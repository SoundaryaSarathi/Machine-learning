1
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:05,164
Finally, I've become super famous, too!
Just kidding!

2
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:06,999
Actually, a fake Sailor Moon
suddenly appeared

3
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:08,167
and started being a great hero!

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,203
But I had no idea this was
our enemy's trap!

5
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:12,501
Tuxedo Mask, watch out!

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:16,843
Okay, then! This is when
the real Sailor Moon

7
00:00:16,843 --> 00:00:19,812
has to do something in the
name of the moon!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

9
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

10
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

11
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

12
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Guided by the light of the moon

13
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

14
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,808
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

15
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

16
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,865
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

18
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:01,866
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of
love and justice, Sailor Moon.

19
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,944
But it's not easy, you know.

20
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:07,613
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

21
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:09,581
before the bad guys get it,

22
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,821
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

23
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,125
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

24
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,252
so it'll work out somehow.

25
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:31,963
The Last Sailor Warrior,
Sailor Venus Appears

26
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:38,573
Prepare yourself, Sailor Moon!

27
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,510
I am your opponent, Nephrite!

28
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,344
Tuxedo Mask!

29
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,267
Stop this!

30
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:13,278
Zoisite, what is the meaning of this?

31
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:16,943
I do not wish to see such
scenes again!

32
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:24,524
Queen Beryl, these are actually all
scenes showing Sailor Moon

33
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:27,687
when she was rescued
at the last minute.

34
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:34,563
Are you talking about Tuxedo Mask?
Just who is he?

35
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,303
Unfortunately, we do not know.

36
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,238
However Queen Beryl,

37
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:44,198
he has appeared virtually every time
Sailor Moon has been in danger.

38
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:46,579
If we make use of this,

39
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,639
we should be able to lure Tuxedo
Mask out into the open.

40
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,486
So, you are saying that
you will take back

41
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,545
the two rainbow crystals he stole?

42
00:03:56,255 --> 00:04:01,060
Zoisite, I hope you know this
is your final chance.

43
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,096
Yes, my lady. I am very aware of it.

44
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,825
Wait, Zoisite!

45
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,268
Oh, Master Kunzite!

46
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,667
If you want to lure Tuxedo Mask out,

47
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,744
you will first need a plan to draw

48
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,269
the sailor warriors away
from Tuxedo Mask.

49
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,979
Queen Beryl, I would like to have the
honor of accomplishing that.

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,788
Very well.

51
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:32,986
Bring all seven rainbow
crystals before me.

52
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,688
Yes, my lady.

53
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:41,030
Master Kunzite, I will do this for you
and not for anyone else.

54
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:44,027
I will even die for you.

55
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,468
Touzai Bank

56
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,607
Touzai Bank Juban Branch

57
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,438
Hands in the air! And hand
over the money!

58
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,948
Hurry up!

59
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,084
Ouch!

60
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,852
Who the hell are you?!

61
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,732
News
Kume Newscaster

62
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:13,499
News
Kume Newscaster
And now for some news.

63
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:13,900
And now for some news.

64
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,435
The sailor warrior, Sailor Moon,

65
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,204
whose actions have been the
talk of the town lately,

66
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:19,831
arrested a bank robber.

67
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,541
Today, around 2 o'clock
in the afternoon,

68
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,542
the robber forced his way into
Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,

69
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:23,976
Touzai Bank
Automatic
the robber forced his way into
Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,

70
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,278
the robber forced his way into
Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,

71
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:28,577
and demanded money from the female
tellers while firing his rifle.

72
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:31,876
Usagi?! No way!

73
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,308
This is it! This is it!

74
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,691
I'm so happy!

75
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:43,195
This is the right way for a middle
school girl to spend her holiday!

76
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:45,965
Usagi, if you eat too much,
you'll gain weight!

77
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,830
But I just can't stop!

78
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,436
Oh, no!

79
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,529
Help!

80
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:51,897
It's Sailor Moon!

81
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,066
So, she's the Sailor Moon
everyone's talking about!

82
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,125
Wow! She's so cool!

83
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,438
Good job!

84
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,507
Thanks!

85
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:11,350
She didn't cut the rope
on purpose, did she?

86
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,840
Sailor Moon...

87
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:19,158
Why?! Why was Sailor Moon there?!

88
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:22,094
What about me?!

89
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,959
Calm down, Usagi.

90
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:29,064
Anyway, let's contact Luna and
everyone else and follow her.

91
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,869
Okay.

92
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:56,118
Only the sailor warriors and Tuxedo
Mask will be able to follow her.

93
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:01,232
Hurry up and come. I am waiting
for you, Tuxedo Mask!

94
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:05,065
Refrigerated Warehouse

95
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:20,118
She should be somewhere in this
direction. I've lost sight of her.

96
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,089
Who would have expected that a fake
Sailor Moon would show up?

97
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,256
I know.

98
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:27,493
I saw the news on that
bank robbery, too.

99
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,428
Of course, I didn't think
that was Usagi.

100
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,832
We would have nothing
to complain about

101
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:36,131
if the real Sailor Moon was as
hard working as her.

102
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:38,262
You're so mean!

103
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,974
The question is, what is the fake
Sailor Moon's goal?

104
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:44,204
Is she our enemy or our ally?

105
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,273
An ally...

106
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:49,915
Luna, could she possibly be
the fifth sailor warrior?

107
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,407
What? No, uh...

108
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,521
There's just something
fishy about this!

109
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,523
Besides, how dare she use
the name of Sailor Moon

110
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:59,325
without my permission?!

111
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,294
I gotta catch her, and make
her pay license fees!

112
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,829
Oh, no!

113
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,491
That is not the problem here!

114
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,635
Let's go, everyone!

115
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,102
Okay!

116
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,891
That guy is one of the
Dark Kingdom's...

117
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,695
Oh, no! We need to rescue her!

118
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,931
Wait!

119
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,434
It's dangerous. This could be a trap!

120
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:43,936
Even if it is a trap,

121
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:47,439
I just can't watch Sailor Moon
being treated like that!

122
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:48,929
I agree.

123
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,169
Everyone, transform!

124
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:57,748
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

125
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:02,253
Mercury Power Makeup!

126
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:07,423
Mars Power Makeup!

127
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:11,988
Jupiter Power Makeup!

128
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,227
What annoying and wasteful lights.

129
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,332
The only true beauty is the
radiant darkness.

130
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:33,013
The darkness of the Dark Kingdom
will shade the entire world.

131
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,106
I cannot wait to see it.

132
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:39,048
Not so fast!

133
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:46,423
You have terrible taste, tying
up a girl and hanging her!

134
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,158
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

135
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,330
Sailor Moon!

136
00:11:57,604 --> 00:12:00,368
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!

137
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,072
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

138
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,679
And I'm Sailor Jupiter!

139
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:15,147
In the name of the moon, I will
severely punish you!

140
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:16,990
So, you are here.

141
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,790
I am Kunzite, one of the Great
Four of the Dark Kingdom!

142
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:25,922
Sailor Moon and sailor warriors,
prepare yourselves!

143
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,664
What?!

144
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:48,511
How do you like this beautiful
darkness?!

145
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,391
It's quite impressive.

146
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,791
Fire

147
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:59,022
Soul!

148
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,899
Sailor Mars, you good-for-nothing!

149
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,372
He's tough!

150
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,619
What's wrong?

151
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,220
Supreme

152
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,162
Thunder!

153
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,397
The power is being sucked
into the darkness!

154
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:44,907
Is that the extent of the sailor
warriors' powers?

155
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,552
Sailor Moon!

156
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:31,747
Is this a trap?

157
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,333
Shoot!

158
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,472
What are you doing, Sailor Moon?!

159
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,080
Zoisite!

160
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,809
You poor thing.

161
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:34,516
I will soon put you out of your
misery, Tuxedo Mask.

162
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,521
Zoi!

163
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,262
Running will do you no good.

164
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:45,798
I will take the rainbow crystals
this time for certain.

165
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,265
Zoi!

166
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:04,350
Oh, no! We're trapped!

167
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,817
Let me try something!

168
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,555
Supreme

169
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,260
Thunder!

170
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,626
It's no use! The power is being
sucked away by the barrier!

171
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:38,483
Give it up! You will never
break this barrier!

172
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:45,886
Here, here, here, here!

173
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,896
I've found you.

174
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,736
Die!

175
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:02,040
Zoi!

176
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,380
Oh, this man is...

177
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,521
My, you look handsome unmasked.

178
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,256
But I won't let you get away.

179
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,814
Prepare to die!

180
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,932
Crescent Beam!

181
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:32,468
It hurts! Ouch!

182
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:39,178
Who are you?!

183
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,645
Shoot!

184
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,285
How dare you make a fool of me?!

185
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:49,618
I don't care who you are! I'll tear
you to shreds! This isn't fair!

186
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:03,536
I can't breathe.

187
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,003
The air...

188
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:08,141
How do you like the taste
of my darkness?

189
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:10,302
Master Kunzite, please be careful.

190
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,871
In addition to Tuxedo Mask, there
is another enemy nearby.

191
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:19,379
Zoisite, did you fail to capture
Tuxedo Mask?

192
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:22,587
Such cold words! I was just
about to take care of that.

193
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:25,158
Tuxedo Mask! Look!

194
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:27,319
This is the end of Sailor Moon
and her friends!

195
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,128
What? Tuxedo Mask?

196
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:41,736
If you want to save them, come out
with the rainbow crystals!

197
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:44,735
Surrender yourself, Tuxedo Mask!

198
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,514
Tuxedo Mask, don't come out!

199
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,675
I can't hold on anymore...

200
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,185
Sailor Moon!

201
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,652
Wait!

202
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,828
We did it, Master Kunzite!

203
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:05,059
That's right! In the end, there is
no way for you to win!

204
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,201
Struggling will only bring
you more suffering!

205
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:10,803
It's important to know
when to give up.

206
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:12,271
No! You're wrong!

207
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,535
No matter how hard it is, you
must never give up!

208
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,503
It's the same voice again!

209
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,110
Oh, that voice is...

210
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,616
Who are you?!

211
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:43,191
Sailor warrior, Sailor Venus!

212
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,535
If you will pardon me,
I have arrived!

213
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:53,438
Crescent Beam!

214
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,050
Master Kunzite!

215
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:02,984
The barrier is gone!

216
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:10,797
Sailor V! You're Sailor V, aren't you?!

217
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:11,864
What?

218
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:12,698
Sailor...

219
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,063
V?!

220
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,870
She is the warrior of justice,
Sailor V!

221
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,895
And her true identity is...

222
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Sailor warrior,

223
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:26,808
Sailor Venus!!

224
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,185
Luna, long time no see.

225
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,709
Artemis!

226
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,122
Damn it!

227
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,886
Master Kunzite, please run!
I will take care of them!

228
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,696
Wait, Zoisite, Kunzite!

229
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,898
Queen Beryl!

230
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:52,500
That is enough! The situation has
changed! Come back now!

231
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,741
Why?

232
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:58,266
Quiet! I am telling you to pull out!

233
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,313
We have no choice.

234
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,372
But Master Kunzite...

235
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,781
Sailor warriors, we shall finish
this battle another time!

236
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:14,588
Tuxedo Mask!

237
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,063
He's gone!

238
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:19,395
Anyway, looks like we're safe now.

239
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,812
Now, we have five warriors
and two cats.

240
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:35,042
Everyone is together now.

241
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:38,675
Sailor V, no, Sailor Venus...

242
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:54,522
Oh, by any chance, are you the
princess from the moon?

243
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,476
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

244
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:18,091
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

245
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:25,827
It's a world no one knows about

246
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,730
With white shoes clicking

247
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,540
Cross the white moon bridge

248
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:41,606
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

249
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:48,250
Offer a prayer to the moon

250
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:57,024
It will surely bring you happiness

251
00:22:57,497 --> 00:23:04,198
Go round and round, the
moon's merry-go-round

252
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:12,508
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

253
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:20,053
She's always watching over us

254
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:26,549
Moon, moon princess
