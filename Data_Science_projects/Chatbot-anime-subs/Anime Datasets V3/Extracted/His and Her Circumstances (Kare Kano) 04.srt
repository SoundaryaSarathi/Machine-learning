1379
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,435
What's happened so far!

1380
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:14,750
Our sister, Miyazawa Yukino...

1381
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,661
...had a confession of love
from her classmate, Arima Souichirou.

1382
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,111
But Miyazawa flatly 
turned him down.

1383
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,565
Right afterwards, her true nature,

1384
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,100
that she had been desperately hiding,

1385
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,635
was discovered,

1386
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:26,885
and she became Arima's lackey.

1387
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,938
Meanwhile, feelings of love towards him

1388
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,339
had awakened in her for the first time.

1389
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,750
After much fuss, they made up.

1392
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,080
They were joined by
friendship for the time being...

1393
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,380
...but at the very end Arima said...

1394
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:43,584
My feelings for you never changed.

1395
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,586
I've liked you the whole time.

1396
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,722
So what'll happen

1397
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,222
to them after that?!

1398
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:04,038
Oh, look! It's Miyazawa!

1399
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:07,509
She's so cute.

1400
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:09,679
I wonder what she's reading.

1401
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:10,629
Salinger!

1402
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,830
That cover is Salinger.

1403
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:14,833
How romantic.

1404
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,502
That fits her to a T.

1405
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:20,203
Yeah, that's the way a beauty's gotta be.

1406
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,692
Oh, it's Arima!

1407
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,193
He's as wonderful as always.

1408
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:27,043
I wonder if he's really
going out with Miyazawa.

1409
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,131
Oh, Arima.

1410
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,146
Why do you show off like this?!

1412
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,765
You said you were going
to be honest with yourself!

1415
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,319
It's just a little!

1416
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,469
Quit nagging.

1417
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:55,173
People can't change that easily.

1419
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,500
Ow ow owwww...

1420
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:04,033
Until last week, I, Miyazawa Yukino,
and Arima Souichiro...

1421
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,468
...had been model students.

1422
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:09,705
Known all over school for
being graced with wit and beauty...
...excelling at all kinds of sports,

1425
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,874
and for our pleasant personalities.

1426
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:14,024
But that's not how we really are.

1427
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,212
We've been "playing" model students.

1428
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:17,213
Arima, to rebel against

1429
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,981
his unfortunate beginnings...

1430
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:24,301
And me, out of a swollen appetite for
praise, attention, and getting buttered up.

1433
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:29,091
But we happened to find out
the truth about each other...

1434
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,141
...and decided to stop the act.

1435
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:34,228
To become more like ourselves...

1436
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,698
But...

1437
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:40,236
It takes considerable time and effort to
put into practice what you're not used to.

1438
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,000
Geez, you're so pushy.

1439
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Well, that's fine...

1440
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:57,416
...compared to the huge
problem in front of me right now.

1441
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:58,753
Here you go.

1442
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,157
Oh, the Athletics Festival.

1443
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:03,557
Looks like it's gonna be a pain again.

1444
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,761
- Oh, a typo.
- Let's see.

1445
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
- Where?
- H...h...h...here!

1446
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,092
Oh, you're right.

1447
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,677
I was confronted with a serious,

1448
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,330
urgent problem.

1449
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:27,465
We aren't

1450
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,000
officially going out yet.

1451
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,855
More than friends...Less than lovers...

1452
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:35,905
We stopped just short of
being an official couple...

1453
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,028
It was like going out on the
highway with a learner's permit.

1454
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:39,728
Why?

1455
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It all started when he said...

1456
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,468
I've liked you the whole time.

1457
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,014
Shall we head home? That's right.

1458
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,152
What? I failed to say it.

1459
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,941
I never get embarrassed like this!

1460
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,041
Idiot, idiot! I'm such an idiot!

1461
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:29,644
This is bad!

1462
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,415
This isn't the time to just
Let's things take their course.

1463
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,065
I have to do something.

1464
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:39,837
"Destiny" has meaning precisely
because you shape it with your own hands.

1466
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:43,592
Who cares about
"being myself" right now?!

1467
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,961
My absolute top priority is

1469
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,000
Telling Arima that I like him!

1470
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,404
However...

1471
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,239
...although I've practiced turning people down

1472
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,676
and have successfully gone through with it...

1473
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,612
...this is the first time I've
been the one doing the approach.

1474
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:06,562
I've got absolutely no
examples and no experience.

1475
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:10,252
But, nothing's going to
happen if I just sit here afraid.

1476
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,052
All I have to do is do it.

1477
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,371
Arima, Arima.

1478
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:15,757
I'm sorry...

1479
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,694
I was told to pick up a report
from Chemistry Room #1...

1480
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,162
...but something came up.

1481
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,162
Can you get it for me instead?

1482
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:23,415
Sure.

1483
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,786
This is the plan.

1484
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,523
Lure Arima into the deserted science room,
and tell him.

1486
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:46,854
Oh, Miyazawa, what's up?

1487
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,593
Apparently a fluorescent light
broke in the 11th graders' class.

1489
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,193
The place is a real mess with

1490
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,811
broken glass all over.
What's wrong?

1491
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:07,537
He's alone...I have a second chance already!

1492
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,227
Oh, Miyazawa.

1493
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,682
What was that noise?

1494
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,118
Oh, just look at that.

1495
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,518
Clean it up, okay?

1496
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,236
Sorry about that.

1497
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,750
Looks like no one's around!
Lucky! Third chance!

1498
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- Arima!
- Y...yeah?

1499
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:45,080
Would First Year Class A
Officers Arima and Miyazawa...

1500
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
...please report immediately
to the staff room.

1503
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,741
Gotta tell him. Gotta tell him.

1504
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,000
Gottatellhim gottatellhim
gottatellhim gottatellhim...


1506
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,967
This is today's last chance!

1507
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,037
A...Arima...

1508
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,463
Today's lesson:

1509
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,265
To get back a chance once

1510
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,984
Lost requires considerable effort.

1511
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:26,471
Soon...

1512
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,423
Gotta tell him... soon...Soon...

1513
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,045
Sis, what're you moaning about?

1514
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,381
I swear, she's such a pain.

1515
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,650
Although I keep doing such stupid things...

1516
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,920
...I really like Arima.

1517
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:45,122
What about him?

1518
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,908
Let's's see...

1519
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,311
He's smart and nice, of course...

1520
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,561
...and he seems so gentle and neat.

1521
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:54,147
And his soft, warm voice is so dreamy...

1522
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,750
His traditional narrow eyes,

1523
00:07:57,086 --> 00:08:00,454
his fine hair, and his slim body...

1525
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,000
And he says he likes me...

1526
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:09,781
Whatcha' doin, Miyazawa?

1527
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,149
We're off to the student council meeting.

1528
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,336
Geez, Arima.

1529
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:20,224
I'm blushing and stammering so much...

1531
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:24,000
Why can't you figure it out?
Get a clue.

1533
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:30,419
Arima hasn't tried to show
any hint of love at all since then.

1534
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,670
I bet he's thinking that he
would annoy me if he's too persistent.

1536
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,226
He's such a damn gentleman.

1537
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,262
He has an excellent
poker face to begin with.

1538
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:42,598
I couldn't tell what he was
thinking the first time either.

1539
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:45,500
If he'd just show a little more on his
face I'd have an easier time saying it.

1540
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,137
Show it on his face?!

1541
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:48,672
That's it!

1542
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,022
The timing's so hard because
I try to say it out of the blue.

1543
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:54,041
I have to arrange
for him to be receptive.

1544
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,611
The more Arima's flustered,

1545
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,846
the easier it'll be for me to tell him!

1546
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,696
I'll break that poker face!

1547
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:04,836
He's alone.

1548
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,221
This is the return match sent from heaven!

1549
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,774
New chance!

1550
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Arima.

1551
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,171
What're you doing?

1552
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,500
Nothing!

1553
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:50,915
I'm home...

1554
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,970
Oh, Sis, welcome back.

1555
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,470
Sis, listen to this!

1556
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,842
I can't believe what Tsukino did!

1557
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,000
Who cares?
It's over and done with.

1559
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,500
Today, at school, right
when I was in class...

1560
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:10,000
As an example, this goes like this,
and after this, goes like this...

1562
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,915
I really got yelled at!

1563
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,202
Quit doing weird stuff like that to me!

1564
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,137
Well, when I saw you,

1565
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,806
I felt like I just had to make you laugh.

1566
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,341
It must be sisterly love.

1567
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,241
How so?!

1568
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,925
Sis, say something to her, would you?

1569
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,563
You're lucky...

1570
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,865
Jr. High is so fun...

1571
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:43,768
S...Sis?!

1572
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,124
Sis?

1573
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:52,276
What's wrong?

1574
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,929
Lots of stuff happens to high schoolers...

1576
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,033
...stuff middle schoolers wouldn't understand.

1578
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,868
Oh, but you wouldn't get it.

1579
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,940
Middle schoolers are so carefree...

1581
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,876
What's up with that holier-than-thou attitude?

1582
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,076
Oh, the usual.

1583
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:11,044
It has to do with Arima.

1584
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,780
This is our sister

1585
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,965
we're talking about here.

1586
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:17,185
She probably dug her own grave,...

1587
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,788
...fell into it, and ended up writhing in it.

1588
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:20,888
So hopeless.

1589
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:24,342
Kano, quit seeing through me!

1591
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:28,595
It's times like these that

1592
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,033
I realize how alone I am...

1593
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,302
...that I don't have any friends
who I can share my problems with,

1594
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:34,702
besides my family.

1595
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:38,372
No one, besides Arima...

1596
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:45,227
But nothing's going to get
done if I just mope around!

1597
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,547
Let's's do this!

1598
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,986
I shouldn't be blindly overconfident

1599
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:52,536
about what I'm doing.

1600
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,488
I have to think about this rationally.

1601
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,227
Looking at my past failures...

1602
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,530
...it looks like I should start
by radically changing my methodology.

1603
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,769
It's possible that the cause
of the failures until now...

1605
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,206
...is relying too much on
communication of intention...

1607
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:13,976
...through first-degree encounters,
or through direct conversation.

1608
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,544
If a direct attack doesn't work...

1609
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,679
...then I have to try communicating

1610
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,479
through indirect means.

1611
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,752
...I wanted to tell you...

1612
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:29,091
This isn't going to work!
This is way too embarrassing!

1614
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,500
I don't have the talent for this kind of thing!

1615
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,830
This is pointless.

1616
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:40,132
I don't have any friends to tell him for me.

1617
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:47,592
Gulp.

1618
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:58,378
Sis...
...G...good luck.

1619
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:38,207
I used to do everything so efficiently.

1621
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,343
Why the sudden cowardice?

1622
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:44,848
This has never happened before...

1623
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:48,901
We both like each other.
And I want to tell him that.

1624
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,654
Why isn't it working out?

1625
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,823
Miyazawa, can we leave the rest to you?

1626
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:56,292
We have to go to prep school.

1627
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:57,094
Sure.

1628
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,700
What the heck am I doing?

1629
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Darn! I'm just a breath away from enjoying a
rose-colored love-love high school life!

1631
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,665
Where's everyone else?

1632
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:18,765
They're all gone already.
All that's left is clean up.

1633
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,835
And I hurried over too,
since practice ended early.

1634
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,272
I'll help you.

1635
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,957
Oh, thanks.

1636
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,526
Hey, we're all alone...

1637
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,395
Oh, unexpectedly lucky!

1638
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,247
A surprise chance!

1639
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,748
Oh, sorry. I'll pick it up.

1640
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,867
That's okay.

1641
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,026
What do I do?

1642
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,560
He noticed. He saw me staring at him.

1643
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:07,696
But I have to say it. I have to say it now.

1644
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,518
Just like how I always do, and spit it out...

1645
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,618
B...but how?

1646
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,708
Won't he think,

1647
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,460
Why now all of a sudden?

1648
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:23,296
But you didn't answer me then...

1649
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,267
It's been several days already...

1650
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:26,267
Besides...

1651
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,102
I don't know if he still likes me now.

1652
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,806
Th...that's right.

1653
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,542
He might have liked me then,

1654
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,413
but that doesn't mean he
still likes me now, does it?

1655
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,663
He might have gotten disillusioned.

1656
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,800
I mean, just look at me.

1657
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,789
I might have gotten carried
away and done something weird.

1658
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,789
I mean, I AM weird!

1659
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,059
I'm a showoff and a liar...

1660
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,909
I've got personality flaws!

1661
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not perfect like Arima...

1663
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,282
He may have said he liked me,

1664
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,367
but I don't know how he could!

1665
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,537
I don't know a single

1666
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:05,000
good thing about myself!

1667
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,000
Miyazawa...? What's wrong?

1668
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,465
Nothing...This is fine!

1669
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:18,985
Just being friends is good enough!
Being a girlfriend isn't everything!

1670
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm okay with just being friends!

1671
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:26,292
Because...I may lose my only friend...

1673
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,277
Say, Miyazawa.

1674
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,945
You haven't told me your feelings yet.

1675
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,331
When could you give me an answer?

1676
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:08,452
What?

1677
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:10,171
I'm okay with just being friends!

1678
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,940
He might have liked me then...

1679
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,440
That doesn't mean he

1680
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,192
still likes me now!

1681
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,460
I'm fine with just being friends!

1682
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,295
I don't want to lose him!

1683
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,000
I must look really ugly right now.

1685
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:36,713
I finally figured out

1686
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,332
what's been motivating me.

1687
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,119
I was running away.

1688
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:47,708
I'm so unfair...

1689
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,579
I ran away to keep myself from getting hurt.

1690
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,529
I didn't have faith in Arima.

1691
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:57,249
Now that I think about it,
I might not have even...

1692
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:59,185
...been serious when l

1693
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,089
tried to tell him I liked him.

1694
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,409
Why am I like this?
I'm so ashamed...What should I do?

1695
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,996
Now now now...don't cry like that.

1696
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,634
Besides, it's impressive that
you at least figured it out!

1698
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,352
By this point you've discovered the truth and

1699
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,405
taken a hard look at reality..

1701
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:20,856
The problem might as well be half solved!

1702
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:24,243
Huh? I didn't get that at all.

1703
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,329
Well, um...

1704
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:30,083
Sis, you've never been hurt until now.

1706
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,886
You've always been praised...

1707
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,655
...and you were so good at

1708
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,956
hiding your real feelings...

1709
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:38,006
...that you became afraid
of showing your true self.

1710
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:41,463
You might not feel any pain
if your fake self gets hurt.

1711
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,363
But your real heart can feel the pain.

1712
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:48,568
The person whom you're most afraid
of getting hurt by right now, is Arima.

1714
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,472
I...I see.

1715
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:53,173
But, I think you realize somewhere in your heart.

1717
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,628
Being afraid of getting hurt
is because you care more about
yourself than about someone else.

1719
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,500
I think being in love
might be the opposite.

1722
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,572
Kano, you're amazing!

1723
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,590
How do you know so much?

1724
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,945
I get it all from manga and novels.

1726
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:18,181
I've got to have courage.

1727
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,169
If I don't overcome this hurdle,

1728
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,419
I'm never going to make it to love.

1729
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:30,794
Good morning.

1730
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,364
Good morning.

1731
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,351
...and so management should

1732
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,786
communicate any schedule changes...

1733
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,788
...on the day of the Athletics Festival directly

1734
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,856
to the person in charge of each post.

1735
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,024
If I try to say it with words,

1736
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:44,674
I might screw up again.

1737
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:56,653
If I'm going to get hurt...

1738
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,841
...I want Arima to be the first one.

1739
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,539
What'll happen next!

1740
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,457
Sis finally became an
official couple with him!

1741
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:19,180
But harsh reality brings
new trials and enemies!

1743
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,648
When will happiness

1744
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:21,983
finally come her way?!

1745
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,218
Next time on KareKano:

1746
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,368
His Ambition.
