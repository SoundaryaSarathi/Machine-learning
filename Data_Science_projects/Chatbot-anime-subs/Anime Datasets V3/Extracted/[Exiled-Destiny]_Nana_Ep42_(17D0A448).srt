1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,860
If I were to die now, I doubt Ren
would die with me anymore.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,170
But that's fine.
That's how it should be.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,610
I must be crazy for thinking
that's sad.

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,510
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,380
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,230
Baby I'm standing alone

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,030
An unforgettable rainy day

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,040
Chasing after your shadow

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,900
And it's over, it's like sand now

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,210
I sigh every night

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,240
I scream like a child and cried

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,980
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,040
Please, please God, forgive my sins

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,780
I don't need to hide no more

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,720
Flowing toward the turquoise light

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,760
Just keep going on

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,360
You've got the chance now

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,560
You've got the power

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,070
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,700
I show you my life now

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,130
I show you my love now

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,370
I show you my everything yeah yeah

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,610
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,410
Don't ever change so be yourself

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,840
I'll show you my strength now

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,210
I'll show you my love now

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,480
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,510
Baby don't be afraid

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,160
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,850
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,630
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,530
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,830
Excuse me,
I'm from next door, and...

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,260
I think she's hyperventilating.

35
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,470
D-Do you have a plastic
or paper bag?

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,030
You don't have one?

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,740
A paper bag would be better.

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,830
If you don't use it right,
plastic could make it worse.

39
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,950
Really?

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,470
Or rather, how should she use it?

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,440
Well... um... I've never been
in this situation before...

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,110
You seem like you know a lot.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,250
Is it safe for someone not in
the medical profession to do it?

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,820
Sure. I always do it by myself.

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,260
Lay her on her back,

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,470
then cover her nose and mouth
with the paper bag,

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,960
but make a little opening.

48
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,070
Like this...

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,270
Have her take deep breaths,
and it'll stop before long.

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,880
It's a living hell.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,480
Th-Thank you. I'll give it a shot.

52
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,860
You don't have to freak out.

53
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,720
She's got that guy,
who is like a tranquilizer.

54
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,320
Tranquilizer?

55
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,990
I was jealous
so I said something mean.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,130
Sorry.

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,440
As if being pulled up from
the depths of the ocean,

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,000
I was finally able to breathe.

59
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,910
Yasu's chest had
the sweet scent of Black Stone.

60
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,810
I'm not going anywhere.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,000
- Ah, Ginpei. Keep up the good work.
- Where's Nana?!

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,200
602.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,970
How is she?!
Did you notify Dr. Azuma?!

64
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,000
Calm down. She was probably
just hyperventilating.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,030
The same symptoms as Myu's.

66
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,770
That's a problem.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,130
The security guard apparently
phoned the agency

68
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,720
instead of getting an ambulance.

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,960
Ginpei rushed over

70
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,990
and he drove me to see a doctor
he said he knew well.

71
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,540
By the time we arrived
at the hospital,

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,910
which was past its hours
of operation,

73
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,240
I was feeling completely back
to normal.

74
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,110
AZUMA CLINIC
I was feeling completely back
to normal.

75
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,610
AZUMA CLINIC

76
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,340
AZUMA CLINIC
But they insisted that I get
checked just to be sure,

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,480
AZUMA CLINIC
and I got a thorough physical checkup.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,910
AZUMA CLINIC

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,710
Hyperventilation syndrome.

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,540
Also known simply as
hyperventilation.

81
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,950
What's that?

82
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,290
It's just as the words suggest.

83
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,690
It's caused by excessive breathing.

84
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,090
The carbon dioxide levels
in your blood decrease,

85
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,220
causing the attack.

86
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,920
Carbon dioxide levels in my blood?

87
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,620
Be quiet and listen.

88
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,170
Your attack subsided

89
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,430
when you placed a paper bag
over your mouth

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,460
and breathed into it.

91
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,700
This is called
"the paper bag technique," and...

92
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,000
Doctor, I don't need you to share
your knowledge with me.

93
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,970
What the hell's wrong with me?
Is it my lungs?

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,840
No.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,810
Then is it my blood?

96
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,600
No.

97
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,020
Then it must be 'cause I smoke
even though I'm on the pill.

98
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,950
But I heard that when you're young,
a little is all right.

99
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,920
"A little"?

100
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,320
That's not good.

101
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,460
You risk getting thrombosis, you know.

102
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,150
I know that,
but I can't quit either.

103
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,360
What am I gonna do?

104
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,700
If you'd use protection instead,
then the problem's solved.

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,920
Huh? Me?

106
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,600
Come on, Doctor!
You're misunderstanding!

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,300
Yasu belongs to me!

108
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,640
My apologies.
But in any case,

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,410
the examination shows
there is nothing wrong with you,

110
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,380
so you can relax.

111
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,140
Huh?!

112
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,240
I was in so much pain
I thought I'd die!

113
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,350
Did you examine me properly?!
You rogue doctor!

114
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,970
Nana...

115
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,970
Miss Osaki, calm down.

116
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,660
Hyperventilation can occur
after strenuous exercise,

117
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,720
but it can also easily happen
if you're overly nervous or excited.

118
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,090
But she's always like this, Doctor.

119
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,360
How can it be cured?

120
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,760
Well, there's no guarantee
it'll even happen again.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
The best thing to do is
not worry about it.

122
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,170
Of course I'll be worried!
I'm a singer, Doctor!

123
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,740
Performing live is
a tough workout,

124
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,230
and I do get really excited
when performing.

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,310
I can't risk having another
attack onstage!

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Please do something!

127
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,190
Hmm... But this is stress-related,
which isn't my area of expertise.

128
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,920
If you're worried,
I suggest you see a psychiatrist.

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,820
If you'd like,
I'll write you a referral.

130
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,950
- A psychiatrist?
- Thank you very much, Doctor!

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,850
I always appreciate your help greatly!

132
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,170
Nana!

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,450
Oh, you were here?

134
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,780
Oh, you look perfectly fine.

135
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,140
Nana!

136
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,210
Are you feeling all right?
What did the doctor say?

137
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,280
He says I'm nuts, like I thought.

138
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,450
BAM

139
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,060
That hurt!

140
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,260
Wow, that stone head full
of prejudices won't even crack!

141
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,030
THAT REALLY HURT...
Wow, that stone head full
of prejudices won't even crack!

142
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,160
Wow, that stone head full
of prejudices won't even crack!

143
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,130
Don't crack it!

144
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,930
In this modern age,

145
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,030
everyone has to deal with
varying degrees of stress.

146
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,970
It's truly a difficult world to live in.

147
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,700
You just happen to be a little
more sensitive than others.

148
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,610
There's nothing wrong with that.

149
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,650
But I hate myself for
being so weak.

150
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,580
I can't stand being
who I am anymore...

151
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,220
So why do these guys
continue being with me?

152
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,760
They have guts.

153
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,630
NOBU
MESSAGE FROM NANA

154
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,730
I'M REALLY BUSY
SO I CAN'T CALL YOU,
BUT I'M DOING
REALLY WELL, DARLING!
LET'S BOTH DO OUR BEST.

155
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,560
Why is there so much work to do
immediately after returning?!

156
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,970
It can't be helped.

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
Going to England wasn't part
of the original schedule.

158
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,110
So stop whining!

159
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,080
Sorry about that.

160
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,300
It's not your fault, Ren.

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I don't think it was necessary

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,480
to go all the way to England
in the first place.

163
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,990
What are you doing?!

164
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,720
Don't touch it with
your filthy hands!

165
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,660
Filthy? I'm outta lighter fluid.
That's a lighter, right?

166
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,770
Huh? So that's a lighter?
Wow, it's huge!

167
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,570
You know, you said the same thing

168
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,730
when you saw the one Shin
was using at the after-party.

169
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,100
Have you forgotten already?

170
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,270
Huh? You mean Shin from BLAST?

171
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,640
He said it was a limited edition.
It's a rare item.

172
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Is that right?

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,410
That one you have isn't Shin's, is it?

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,650
It isn't!

175
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,750
Why are you carrying a lighter
in the first place

176
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,290
when you don't even smoke?

177
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,150
It's a present from a fan,
and I like it!

178
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,090
Must be nice to get
cool stuff like that.

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,660
All I get are stuffed animals.

180
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,820
My room's full of stuffed animals.

181
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,330
You're actually displaying them?

182
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,760
Ren, hand me your lighter.

183
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,330
SHIN
WELCOME BACK

184
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:06,800
I'VE BEEN THROWN INTO
THIS JAIL THEY CALL A DORM.
I'M THINKING OF A WAY
THAT I CAN MEET YOU
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING,
BUT HAVEN'T COME UP
WITH ANY IDEAS.
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU SOON.

185
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,610
Saying I was busy was
just an excuse.

186
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm sure Ren realized that.

187
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,590
But if I heard Ren's voice,

188
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,820
I thought I'd have trouble
breathing again. I was scared.

189
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,220
So now, I'm announcing
today's schedule!

190
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,530
There's a photo shoot for promo material
at the Harajuku studio.

191
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:30,670
Detergent?

192
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,530
DETERGENT?
Detergent?

193
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,630
DETERGENT?
Promo material.

194
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,070
DETERGENT?

195
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,670
In the afternoon,

196
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,190
there will be three interviews
for music magazines.

197
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,660
We're introducing ourselves
so we'll be visiting them.

198
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,310
Please make sure
you're very polite to the people

199
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,480
during these work-related visits.

200
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,030
We want to leave
a good impression.

201
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,610
Remember, your rebellious image
is only an act.

202
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,450
Also, if they ask you any questions
about your private life,

203
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,440
do not answer.

204
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,420
Then, at seven, we will meet
with event organizers

205
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,910
to discuss the guerrilla live performance.
That will be at the Gaia main office.

206
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,160
A rehearsal at the Kagurazaka
studios at nine.

207
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,220
Finishing time depends
on Matsuo's mood.

208
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,260
Well, there you have it.
It's not as packed as I thought.

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,560
THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE.
Well, there you have it.
It's not as packed as I thought.

210
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,100
Well, there you have it.
It's not as packed as I thought.

211
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,970
That's plenty packed! Nana's still
recovering, you know!

212
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,230
Not a problem at all.

213
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Well then, we're leaving now!

214
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,230
We'll have breakfast in the car.

215
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,980
All right! I'm starving!

216
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,840
The busier I was, the better I felt.

217
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,510
This is Masaru, the stylist.

218
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,440
Nice to meet you.

219
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,220
- Nice to meet you, too.
- If the work was fulfilling,

220
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,590
I felt refreshed, so I didn't think
I had to go to the hospital.

221
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,850
I don't intend to change much.

222
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,460
Your styles are already
pretty well established.

223
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,860
I agree! Let's bring bondage
back into style!

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,430
SIGH

225
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,570
SIGH
There were so many people involved
with BLAST's debut project

226
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,900
There were so many people involved
with BLAST's debut project

227
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,340
that I couldn't remember
everyone's name.

228
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,830
I can't ask about your private life?

229
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,200
At least tell me what your hobbies are.

230
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,870
- Mahjongg.
- That was fast!

231
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,680
Interacting with people
was never my forte,

232
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,310
but I had no problem with it.

233
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,150
Teacher, I'm so hungry
I can't reach the high notes!

234
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,240
Don't blame it on your stomach.
One more time!

235
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,180
Yo, Old Fox!
How are ya doing?

236
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,940
What dirty tricks do you have
up your sleeve this time?

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
Nana!

238
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,320
Looking good. Okay, don't move.

239
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,660
Think we should tell Misato
about the live performance?

240
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
But it's on a weekday.

241
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,000
Midterms are coming up, right?

242
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,940
If we tell her, it could be
a disaster for her.

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,000
I wonder if she'll be able to graduate.

244
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,300
Hey guys!
You can't tell anyone about it!

245
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,570
I felt that if I saw Hachi now,
I could laugh and talk with her.

246
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,980
I felt I could even listen to her
talk about Takumi and the baby.

247
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,750
But, there just wasn't any time.

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,130
I'm sleepy.

249
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,830
But if I don't do the laundry today,

250
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,130
I'll run outta clothes to wear.

251
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,270
I've gotta hurry and move my stuff
from the old apartment

252
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,330
and cancel the lease.

253
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,240
It's a waste of money.

254
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,970
Won't anyone do it for me?
The laundry too?

255
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,680
But everything won't fit here.

256
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,150
Should I just send it to
my parents' place for now?

257
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,970
But I'll bet my Dad's
still angry with me.

258
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,120
But when BLAST's debut
is officially confirmed,

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,590
I'll bet they'll be so thrilled.

260
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,910
G-Good evening.

261
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,850
LAUNDRY

262
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,580
Um... Can I ask you something?

263
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,550
Huh?

264
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,620
Ah, well, about hyperventilation.

265
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,720
You probably wouldn't wanna talk
about it, huh? I'm sorry.

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,390
It's all right. What is it?

267
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,440
One of our staff members told me,

268
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,010
that if Nana has another attack,

269
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,810
we should stay calm and act
as if it's no big deal.

270
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
That if the people around her
start to panic,

271
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,770
it would only make her more anxious.

272
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,890
I do think he has a point and
I hear that's what the doctor's said,

273
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,820
so that may be the right thing to do.

274
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,530
But wouldn't you feel lonely
if you were in great pain

275
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,890
and those around you acted
like it's no big deal?

276
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,900
Like, I wonder if
I could remain calm.

277
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,560
I doubt if I could.

278
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,800
LAUGH

279
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,030
Huh?

280
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,710
Whether you're surrounded
by people who are calm or upset,

281
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,610
you wouldn't be lonely if
you could feel their compassion.

282
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,810
I don't know about other people,
but that's how I'd feel.

283
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,710
I feel like I just asked something
really obvious as a person.

284
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,360
Hey, is that a script for a movie?

285
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,260
Yeah.

286
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,760
You're an actress?!

287
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,300
More or less.

288
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

289
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,810
It's okay. I'm not at all well-known.

290
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,140
This is a small part for
a straight-to-video.

291
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,480
What's the title?!

292
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,940
I'll be sure to watch it
when it goes on sale!

293
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,780
TANKI NA ONNA

294
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,650
TANKI NA ONNA
"Tanki na Onna."

295
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:12,810
"Tanki na Onna."

296
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,780
A mahjongg movie?!

297
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,180
I love mahjongg!
Though I'm really bad!

298
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,860
Um, can I ask you one more thing?

299
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,590
What?

300
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,020
What's your name?

301
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,360
I wonder how many people in
this city know my name right now.

302
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,340
Hey, what's that? Is someone coming?

303
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,770
Who knows?
It's probably some unknown singer.

304
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,770
It would be nice if they could
get Trapnest to perform.

305
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,480
I can never get a ticket.

306
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,740
That'll never happen.

307
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,650
Anyway, Yuji and the guys are
at the karaoke and told us to join.

308
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,520
Wanna go?

309
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,180
- Sure. Will they be paying?
- Mr. Kawano? We're all set here.

310
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,890
Okay, go! Play as hard as you want!

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,020
Hi, Yuji? Yeah.
We're on our way now.

312
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,960
- Nana!
- Huh?!

313
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,680
Hey, that's BLAST! BLAST!

314
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,390
No way.

315
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,450
- No way! Nana?!
- What? Who?

316
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,890
- She's the worst! Get lost!
- Don't you know them?

317
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,650
I can't tell which ones are
the hired applauders.

318
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,930
Looks like we're more famous
than I thought.

319
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,890
I guess Ren's pretty popular
with the peop--.

320
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,760
That means we don't hafta
spend time on introductions.

321
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,300
I appreciate it, paparazzi.

322
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,310
October 10, 2001.
Seven p.m. in Shinjuku.

323
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,850
You guys all better be thankful

324
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,650
for the fate of just happening to be
here right now by coincidence.

325
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,570
YASU
MESSAGE FROM NANA
I'LL BE WAITING AT 7:00
IN FRONT OF ALTA IN SHINJUKU.
NANA

326
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:45,690
Hey, Hachi. It's a little far,
but that's the safest VIP seat.

327
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,830
I wonder if the baby in your belly
can hear me singing, too.

328
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,090
Good morning, everyone!
It's Friday, October 26th.

329
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,560
Time for Music J.

330
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,430
The first video clip today is
of the new Trapnest single,

331
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,690
"Shadow of Love."

332
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,300
I wanna wear the same dress
as Reira's!

333
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,200
Huh?

334
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,370
You know, the wedding dress
she wears in the promo video!

335
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,430
It's so beautiful!
I totally wanna wear it!

336
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,170
Can they make another of the same?

337
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,110
We already ordered a dress.
You can't change it now.

338
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,620
You'll make the dressmaker cry.

339
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,580
But I wanna wear it.

340
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,170
Then I'll change twice
during the reception.

341
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,410
That's too many times.

342
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,690
Besides, it's not the dress
that's pretty.

343
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,990
It's Reira.

344
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,050
It wouldn't look good on you.
Give it up.

345
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,900
I knew it!
You're involved with Reira!

346
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,890
No I'm not!
And what do you mean "I knew it"?

347
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,890
Oh, Myu! Good morning!

348
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,860
Calcium? Can I have some?

349
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,370
Hey, Nobu.
Will you stop calling me Myu?

350
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,080
The name's not Myu.
It's Miu.

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,070
But it's too hard to pronounce.

352
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,970
Why not? It's a cute nickname.

353
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,340
Everyone says so, and
no one pronounces my name properly.

354
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,820
Though I really like my name.

355
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,690
No one does? Then I will be
the only one to call you Miu.

356
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,860
Are you off today?

357
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,330
Nope, we'll be on
a music show tonight,

358
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,330
so we've got a rehearsal
in the afternoon.

359
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,330
You're really busy, huh?

360
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,570
It's already been one month since
we moved into the dorm

361
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,370
and Nobu is getting cozy
with the girl next door.

362
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
There was no point in us
changing rooms!

363
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,240
I would've preferred to have
him fool around with Yuri.

364
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,170
Why do people easily drift
from one relationship to the next?

365
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,450
Until recently all he'd say was,

366
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,220
"Hachi, Hachi, Hachi, Hachi."

367
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,820
They're all such fools.
Hachi included.

368
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,960
But it would be too cruel to
force Nobu into a relationship

369
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,260
that has no future.
I have no right to do that.

370
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,260
Hey, this isn't good.

371
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,570
I'm having... trouble breathing...

372
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,610
Good morning.
You going somewhere?

373
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,850
Like, to have your hair cut?

374
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,250
THERE'S NOTHING TO CUT

375
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,320
THERE'S NOTHING TO CUT
No, I have a meeting with Mr. Kawano,

376
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,220
No, I have a meeting with Mr. Kawano,

377
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,190
so I'll be leaving ahead of you.

378
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,030
You're looking pale.
Are you feeling okay?

379
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm perfectly fine.

380
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,260
I can't keep Yasu
in unrequited love limbo.

381
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
On top of that,

382
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,510
why did I unwittingly move
in next door to him?

383
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,230
That's pretty cruel.

384
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,620
One reason I didn't wanna get back
with Ren is because

385
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,380
I was feeling Yasu's
extraordinary love for me.

386
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,260
But in the end, I got swept away.

387
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,550
I'm just one of the fools.

388
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,860
I'll breathe into this just to be safe.

389
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,790
After all, I've got important work
to do today.

390
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,840
I've managed to keep on living even
when Ren wasn't around,

391
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,210
but without Yasu,
I'd probably fall apart.

392
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,140
I've gotta end it.

393
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,340
The next time I see Ren,
I won't get swept away.

394
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,750
It's been a while

395
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,310
since we performed live for
a music show on TV!

396
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,390
I'm sure the fans are
looking forward to it.

397
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,910
I bet the ratings are gonna be great!

398
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm sure of it.

399
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,790
They're throwing us in the pit together.

400
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,930
But even if they pick a fight,
I'm not gonna fight back.

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,400
- What are you talking about?
- Here, say "Aaah..."

402
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,270
HERE, SAY "AAAH"
- What are you talking about?
- Here, say "Aaah..."

403
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,870
HERE, SAY "AAAH"
- Do not resort to violence, Takumi.
- Aaah...

404
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,240
- Do not resort to violence, Takumi.
- Aaah...

405
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,040
AAAH
- Do not resort to violence, Takumi.
- Aaah...

406
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,660
BLAST will be performing, too!

407
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,660
Hey, Hachi.

408
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,310
I always thought life was
about standing your ground,

409
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,180
no matter how strong the current is.

410
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,580
But going with the flow isn't such
a foolish thing after all.

411
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,120
As long as you're moving forward.

412
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,400
Will you hold me now?

413
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Hold me now?

414
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,570
My frozen heart

415
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,880
Kiss my lips and maybe you can

416
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,780
take me to your world for now

417
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,720
I can't be alone right now

418
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,360
Will you hold me now?

419
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,300
Hold me now?

420
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,600
My frozen heart

421
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm lost in a deep winter sleep

422
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,510
I can't seem to
find my way out alone

423
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,710
Can you wake me
