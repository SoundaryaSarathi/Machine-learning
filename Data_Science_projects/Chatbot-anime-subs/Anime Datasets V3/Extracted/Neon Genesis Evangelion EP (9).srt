<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

Standing there smiling serenely.

<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300

...of the path your destiny will follow.

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18

<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>

So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,250
Hey, have you seen her yet?

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,350
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,420
Seen who?

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,550
You dork, you haven't seen
the foreign girl yet?

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,690
Foreign girl?

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,820
Yeah, she's in 8th grade, Class A.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,850
She just transferred
here last week.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,420
She's hot!

30
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,900
Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu,
did you know that?

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, she's so cute.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,240
Since she was raised over
there but born here,

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,140
do you think she already
has a boyfriend?

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Don't be stupid!

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,010
I bet she broke up in Germany,
and she's here in a foreign land

36
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,800
with a heart that can't be mended.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,090
<i>To Asuka Soryu</i>

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh my gosh...

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,650
Did you hear all the cat talk?

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,560
Asuka! Asuka!

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,120
They're just ignorant.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,610
Thank you, come again.

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,090
At least the pictures don't
reveal her personality.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,430
Hello!

45
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,830
Shinji!

46
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,500
Guten Morgen!

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,440
Guten Morgen.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,410
Hey, why so gloomy? This is the
gorgeous Asuka greeting you!

49
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,710
You should appreciate your
good fortune!

50
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm the most popular
girl in school!

51
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,220
Hey, the other one's
here too, isn't she?

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,220
Other one?

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,050
What are you, stupid? I'm talking
about the First Child, of course!

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,920
Oh, Ayanami...

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,770
Hello!

56
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,100
You must be Rei Ayanami,
the pilot of the prototype.

57
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,540
I'm Asuka! Asuka Langley Sohryu.

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm the designated pilot of Eva
Unit 02. Let's be good friends!

59
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,250
Why?

60
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,950
Because it'd be convenient.
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,320
If I'm ordered to, I will.

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,790
Talk about odd.

63
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,880
I'll say. Are only weirdos
chosen to be pilots?

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,240
You've lost some weight.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,340
Is that so?

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,270
You must be enduring an
unrequited love.

67
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,440
How did you know?

68
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,610
Because...

69
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,150
"A woman with a mole in the
pathway of her tears

70
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,690
is destined to a life full of them."

71
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,690
If you're trying to put a move on
me, I'm afraid you can't.

72
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,950
There's a very ugly face
observing us.

73
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,930
Long time no see, Kaji.

74
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,560
It's been a while.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,630
You're a little less discreet
than I expected.

76
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,040
He hasn't ever been
discreet in his life!

77
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,870
You've handed over Unit 02,
right? You should be leaving now!

78
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,740
I just received orders this morning
that I'll be staying here on loan.

79
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,750
So we can hang around again,

80
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,080
just like we used to.

81
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,950
You've got to be kidding!

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,820
Enemy attack?!

83
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,490
We just got this report from
the battle cruiser Haruna.

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,360
"Huge submerged object detected
off Kii peninsula. Sending data."

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,930
The data has been collated
and examined.

86
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,230
Wavelength pattern Blue.
Confirmed to be an Angel.

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,200
All personnel, go to
first stage alert.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
Episode 9:
Momentarily Unite the Minds.

89
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,240
The recent battle severely
damaged the intercept system.

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,350
Only twenty-six percent of our
defense capability is available.

91
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,320
And our operational capability for
actual combat is virtually nil.

92
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,120
Therefore, we're going to have
to intercept the target

93
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,220
at the water's edge, right
before it makes landfall!

94
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,260
Units 01 and 02 will mount an
attack in a series of waves.

95
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,660
In other words, close in
and take turns.

96
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,800
Roger.

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,070
This sucks. My Japanese debut,
and she won't let me solo.

98
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,660
Why do I have to bring you?!

99
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,270
It can't be helped.
Procedures, you know?

100
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,540
Well, let me tell you something,
just don't get in my way!

101
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,280
His selection as a pilot must
have been a joke, right?

102
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,530
Two against one is not what I call
a fair fight. It's not fair.

103
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,930
<i>We don't get a choice.</i>

104
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,330
<i>Survival takes priority.</i>

105
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,430
There!

106
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,680
Commence attack!

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,220
I'll handle this Angel!
You cover me!

108
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,520
Cover you?

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,050
Ladies first!

110
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,780
Damn it, don't give me orders,
you dumb rookie!

111
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,720
Charge!

112
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,370
That wasn't bad.

113
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,920
What did you think of
that, Third Child?!

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,650
A fight should be clean, elegant
and without waste.

115
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,590
What's this crap?

116
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,170
<i>Today, at 10:58:15 AM,</i>

117
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,710
<i>Unit 01 was attacked</i>
<i>by Target Alpha,</i>

118
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,880
<i>which separated from the target</i>
<i>submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.</i>

119
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,250
<i>At the same time, plus 20 seconds,</i>
<i>Unit 02 was halted by Target Beta.</i>

120
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,420
<i>We have a comment from</i>
<i>E-Project chairperson.</i>

121
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,620
<i>This is pathetic.</i>

122
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,860
This is all your fault! You totally
screwed up my debut battle!

123
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,100
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,870
You're the one who charged in
there acting like an idiot!

125
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,270
Idiot?! How dare you call me that?
Pathetic excuse for a combat pilot!

126
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,740
You're just a jerk!

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,540
Look in the mirror!

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,170
In your rush to show off, you
completely ignored procedures!

129
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,270
In your rush to show off, you
completely ignored procedures!

130
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,840
What was that? You look like a drowned rat!

131
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,740
<i>At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation</i>
What was that? You look like a drowned rat!

132
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,710
<i>At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation</i>
You can't say that kind of thing to me!

133
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,780
You can't say that kind of thing to me!

134
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,920
<i>And yielded command to the UN Secondary Force.</i>
<i> </i>

135
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,490
We've been humiliated.

136
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>At 11:05 AM, UN forces attacked with an N2 mine.</i>

137
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,730
We'll have to re-draw
the map again.

138
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,530
<i>They succeeded in burning off 28%</i>
<i>of the target's structural substance.</i>

139
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,160
Did they kill it?
<i>They succeeded in burning off 28%</i>
<i>of the target's structural substance.</i>

140
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,500
Did they kill it?
This is merely temporary relief. A
second attack is a matter of time.

141
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,670
This is merely temporary relief. A
second attack is a matter of time.

142
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,640
At least we have time to regroup.
You can't ask for more than that.

143
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,670
Listen up, you two.

144
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,240
Do you know what your job is?

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,380
Piloting Eva.

146
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,680
No! Your job is to defeat
the Angels.

147
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,750
NERV does not exist to make
grotesque displays like this.

148
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,020
Therefore, you two
must cooperate.

149
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,890
Why should we?!

150
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,380
Enough already.

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,990
Why does everyone get
so angry here?

152
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,600
It's because adults are much too
aware of their credibility.

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,160
Where's Misato?

154
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,190
Clearing things up. The person in
charge must take responsibility.

155
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,870
Here are the internal protests
and damage reports.

156
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,640
This is a bill from the UN,

157
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,840
and here you have complaints
from the PR department as well.

158
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,310
Read them all.

159
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,750
I can tell what they say
without looking.

160
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,390
"If you're going to fight,
don't do it here," right?

161
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,720
Good guess.

162
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll do it as soon as we take
care of this Angel.

163
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,360
I swear I will destroy that Angel.

164
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,500
The Vice Commander
is pretty angry.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,370
You'll almost certainly be demoted
if you embarrass him again.

166
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,970
It was good luck within bad luck
that Commander Ikari wasn't here.

167
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,510
If he'd been here, you'd have been
fired before he ever saw these.

168
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,240
So, have you brought me an
idea to help save my job?

169
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,410
Just one.

170
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,480
I thank you, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,320
It's good to have a friend
one can count on.

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,460
However, I'm not the one who'll
be saving my old friend.

173
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,660
This is Kaji's idea.

174
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,150
Kaji?

175
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm home! Not that anyone's
here, of course, but...

176
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,610
What is this?!

177
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,180
Don't be so rude!

178
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,150
Those are my personal
belongings!

179
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,480
You! What in the blazes are
you doing in my house?

180
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,320
Why are you still here?

181
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,810
Still here?

182
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,950
You've been dumped for
the new model!

183
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Misato will be living with me.

184
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,770
That's a more logical choice when
you consider my superior abilities.

185
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,240
Although honestly, I'd
rather live with Kaji.

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,830
Say, just why are Japanese
houses so small anyway?

187
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,610
Not even half of my stuff fits!

188
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,050
<i>Shinji's Room</i>

189
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,050
And the Japanese sure don't
have any sense of privacy.

190
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,790
How can they live in a room
without locks? Unbelievable!

191
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,290
It's because the Japanese way

192
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,660
is to consider the priorities and
needs of others before one's own.

193
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,730
Misato!

194
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,100
How are you? You two are going
to get along real well, right?

195
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,370
What do you mean?

196
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,270
This is all preparation for
the next operation.

197
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,760
Say what?

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,710
There is only one way to destroy
the seventh Angel!

199
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,410
A simultaneous two-point attack
on each target's core

200
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,600
while its components
are separated.

201
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,850
In other words, an attack by two
Evas with synchronized timing.

202
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,280
Cooperation and coordination
between you will be paramount.

203
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,050
Therefore, I want the two
of you to live together.

204
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,860
No way!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

205
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,730
No way!
A boy and girl should never sleep
together after the age of seven!

206
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,030
A boy and girl should never sleep
together after the age of seven!

207
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,330
The Angel is currently
restoring itself.

208
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,630
It will begin its second assault
in six days, so there's no time.

209
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,900
But it's impossible.

210
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,740
Now, we have a way to
make it possible!

211
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,970
The master attack pattern will be
choreographed using this music.

212
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,110
In six days, as soon as possible.

213
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

214
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm worried about Shinji.

215
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,310
He's been gone three days, right?

216
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,490
Hey, there's the class rep.

217
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,090
Two of the three stooges.

218
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,420
Why are you here?

219
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,730
To offer condolences to Miss
Sohryu. What about you two?

220
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,060
To offer condolences to Ikari.

221
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,760
Why did you stop here?

222
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,320
Yes?

223
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,480
You've betrayed us!

224
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,980
You look like two peas in a pod.

225
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,180
I can't believe this!

226
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,920
Neither can we. It's all
Misato's fault!

227
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,610
We have to eat, breathe
and sleep together!

228
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,060
You're living in sin! How awful!

229
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,820
No, it's not like that!

230
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,360
Then, just what is it like?

231
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,850
Hi, welcome everybody!

232
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,630
Why don't you explain
all this to us?

233
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,840
You should have told us that first.

234
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,510
How is the coordination coming?

235
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,670
Well, as you can see.

236
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,650
Well, so much for synchronization!

237
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,450
I could never sink to the pathetic
level this animated turnip lives at!

238
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,850
If you ask me, this whole
idea is impossible!

239
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,290
Then you give up?

240
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,350
But you don't have anyone
else, do you?

241
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,390
Rei?

242
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:10,930
Yes, Ma'am.
Rei?

243
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,890
Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?

244
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,190
Why don'tyou try?

245
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,430
Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?

246
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,690
Yes, Ma'am.
<i> </i>

247
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,840
It looks like I should alter the
operation to pair Shinji and Rei.

248
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,880
No! I can't stand this!
I can't take it anymore!

249
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,090
Asuka!

250
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,220
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Asuka!

251
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,260
Even the Devil cries sometimes.

252
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,320
Ikari!

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,250
You've got to follow her!

254
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,090
You made her cry! It's your fault!

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,350
Well...

256
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,380
Don't say anything.
Well...

257
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,850
Don't say anything.
<i> </i>

258
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,920
I know.

259
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,940
I have to pilot the Eva.
I've got no choice.

260
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,580
I'll do it.

261
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,960
No matter what, I'll put Rei
and Misato to shame!

262
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,200
You don't have to squash them.

263
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,430
You're being too simplistic,
even if you are a man!

264
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,970
I must avenge myself.

265
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,440
My pride...

266
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,140
It's a matter of honor
now, you see?

267
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,900
<i>2 days left</i>

268
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,370
<i>Tomorrow: Attack</i>

269
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,750
Where's Misato?

270
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,120
At work. She called earlier.
She'll be there all night.

271
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,650
So that means we're
all alone tonight.

272
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,340
This is the impenetrable "Wall
of Jericho", Third Child.

273
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,910
Take one step over this wall
and you'll be a dead man.

274
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,350
And now, it's time for children
to go to bed!

275
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,090
Why do the Japanese sleep on
the floor? This is so stupid.

276
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,350
Mama...

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,210
Mama...

278
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,560
You're just a child yourself.

279
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,540
No, somebody will see us.

280
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,140
Who's watching?

281
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140

Someb...

283
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,200
No! There's nothing
between us anymore.

284
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't do that again.

285
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,830
But your lips didn't say no.

286
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,240
Which one should I trust?

287
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,210
Your lips or your words?

288
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,400
There you go.

289
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,900
Thanks.

290
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,740
You're unusually sober today.

291
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,070
Yeah, a little.

292
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,770
Work? Or a man?

293
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,770
A lot of things.

294
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,880
Still in love?

295
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,920
Don't be ridiculous!

296
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,080
Who'd want that idiot?!

297
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,550
I was young, and it's still the
biggest blemish on my whole life.

298
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,930
I meant that he may still like you.
Did I scare you?

299
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,300
Why you lousy...

300
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
You're only proving
my hypothesis.

301
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,770
Why don't you go with
your feelings?

302
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,040
It's not like it's still
eight years ago.

303
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,670
It hasn't changed. Not a bit.
He's still immature.

304
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,940
Well, I've got to get to work.
Tomorrow is D-day.

305
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,970
Target has broken through the
final defense line at Gora.

306
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,630
Here it comes!

307
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,640
We won't fail this time!

308
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,710
Spread your AT fields as soon
as the music starts.

309
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,310
Then follow the operation
choreography.

310
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,110

311
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,640
Roger!

312
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
The target has entered
the mountains.

313
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,620
Just remember Shinji, full power,
maximum performance.

314
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,790
I know that. We'll finish in
sixty-two seconds.

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,420
Target entering Ground Zero.

316
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,910
Detach external power cables.

317
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,550
Launch.

318
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,360
Confirmation. Both Evas
are operational.

319
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,010
Geez...

320
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,500
This is pathetic.

on my Unit 02?!

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,980
What are you talking about?
You're the one who fell on me!

323
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,790
You're the one who lost
his timing first!

324
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,020
You're always so slow!

325
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,530
What were you doing, staying
up so late last night?!

326
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,000

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,700
Liar! I know you tried to kiss
me while I was sleeping!

328
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,230
You cheat! You were awake?

329
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,740
Oh, my gosh! I was just kidding!
Did you really kiss me?!

330
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,380
No, I didn't! I stopped!

331
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,880
Pervert! Fiend! Idiot!
I can't believe this!

332
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,510
You caused it by calling for your
mother and sleepwalking!
