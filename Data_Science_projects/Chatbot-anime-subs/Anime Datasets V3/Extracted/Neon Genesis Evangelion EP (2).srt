<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,556
Are you ready, Shinji?

23
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,996
Yes.

24
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:37,463
Release the final safety lock!

25
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,431
Release the final safety lock!

26
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,896
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!

27
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,399
Shinji, just concentrate on
walking right now.

28
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,476
Walk...

29
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,953
It walked!

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,857
Walk...

31
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,594
Shinji, are you okay?

32
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,230
Hurry! Get up!

33
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,151
Shinji, calm down! That's not your arm!

34
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,691
What's going on with the
Eva's defense system?

35
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,326
The signal's not working!

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,793
The field's not unfolding!

37
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:43,661
Have we failed?

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,268
Left arm damaged!

39
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:49,802
The circuits have snapped!

40
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,734
The circuits have snapped!

41
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,672
Shinji, dodge!

42
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,281
There's a crack on the front
of the brain case!

43
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,340
The armor won't last much longer!

44
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,127
The head's been damaged!
Extent of damage, unknown!

45
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,596
The control nerves are breaking off!

46
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:19,723
We're not getting any readings
on the pilot!

47
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,900
Shinji!

48
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,699
This ceiling is unfamiliar.

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,000
EPISODE 2:
UNKNOWN CEILINGS

50
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,051
So, the Angels have returned?

51
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,786
It's so sudden.

52
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,855
It's the same as it was
fifteen years ago.

53
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,655
A disaster comes as it will,
without warning.

54
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:25,998
On the positive side, our previous
investments will not go to waste.

55
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,667
You can't be sure about that yet.

56
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,137
If it doesn't pay off, it's a
waste all the same.

57
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,106
Correct. Now that the Angels have
become common knowledge,

58
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,701
we have to manipulate the
information to avoid trouble.

59
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,106
NERV must take care of
these matters quickly.

60
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:48,687
It's already been taken care of.
You may rest assure of that.

61
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,825
<i>In regards to the declaration</i>
<i>of the state of emergency,</i>

62
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,226
<i>government officials</i>
<i>have announced...</i>

63
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,561
<i> </i>
<i>This incident was...</i>

64
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,796
<i> </i>
<i>UN forces in Japan...</i>

65
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,000
Public scenario B-22, as we thought.
<i>UN forces in Japan...</i>

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,535
So, we're hushing up the truth again?
<i>No, there's no threat of contamination</i>
<i>from the center of the explosion.</i>

67
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,369
But at least our Public Relation people are thrilled.
<i>No, there's no threat of contamination</i>
<i>from the center of the explosion.</i>

68
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,503
But at least our Public Relation people are thrilled.
<i>The only Angel samples collected</i>
<i>were adhered to the Eva.</i>

69
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,500
Now that they've finally got something to do.
</i>The only Angel samples collected</i>
</i>were adhered to the Eva.</i>

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,000
We're being pretty casual about it.
</i>The only Angel samples collected</i>
</i>were adhered to the Eva.</i>

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,908
We're being pretty casual about it.
<i>Correct, as in the model simulation,</i>
<i>approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.</i>

72
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,077
I don't think so. I think we're all scared to death.
<i>Correct, as in the model simulation,</i>
<i>approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.</i>

73
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,145
<i>Correct, as in the model simulation,</i>
<i>approximately 99.9% of it evaporated.</i>

74
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,544
Of course we are.

75
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,516
Well, we must acknowledge that.

76
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,552
Speaking of which, Mr. Ikari,

77
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,122
isn't there a better way to
utilize NERV and Eva?

78
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,924
We're referring to the repair
costs for Unit 01,

79
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,494
which when added to the
costs for Unit 00,

80
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,529
are enough to bankrupt
an entire country.

81
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:35,100
We also understand that you gave that
particular toy to your son, didn't you?

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,263
Manpower, time and money.

83
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,774
How much more will be wasted
by you and your family?

84
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,044
And that is not your only
responsibility.

85
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,645
The Human Enhancement Project,

86
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:49,114
that should be your top priority.

87
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:55,821
Yes, in these desperate circumstances
that project is our only hope.

88
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,389
Do you understand?

89
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,725
In any case, the Angel is no excuse
for delaying that project's schedule.

90
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,198
However, we will consider
adjusting the budget.

91
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:09,068
Now, the rest of this meeting
concerns only us.

92
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,434
Your presence here was
appreciated, Mr. Ikari.

93
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,366
Ikari, you do understand there can
be no turning back, don't you?

94
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,539
I know.

95
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,440
Mankind has no time left.

96
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,346
Air conditioning has just got to be
mankind's greatest treasure.

97
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,849
It's the triumph of science over nature.

98
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,184
Shinji's woken up.

99
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,220
How is he?

100
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,712
No external injuries. His memory
is a bit muddled, however.

101
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,593
You don't think it could
be brain damage?

102
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,862
The doctor said that there was
nothing to worry about.

103
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,329
Really?

104
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,567
I suppose he did have a
pretty hectic day.

105
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,298
His cranial nerves must have
taken a lot of strain.

106
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,401
Don't you mean his heart?

107
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,097
Okay, go on.

108
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,724
Yeah, that way. Stop.

109
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,938
If Eva and this city both operate
at their full potential,

110
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,506
maybe we can make it through this.

111
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:58,143
Are you going to defeat the Angels?
You're always such an optimist.

112
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,375
Sometimes you need a little wishful
thinking just to keep on living.

113
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,580
I see your point. Your attitude makes
me feel a little more at ease.

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,488
See ya!

115
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,155
<i>Dr. Ugai of Internal Department</i>
<i>One, Dr. Ugai,</i>

116
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:13,025
<i>Dr. Ugai of Internal Department</i>
<i>One, Dr. Ugai,</i>

117
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,825
<i>please call Dr. Azuma of the First</i>
<i>Surgical Department immediately.</i>

118
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,559
<i>The medical conference on the B</i>
<i>Experiment will be held as scheduled.</i>

119
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,131
<i>All supervisors please proceed</i>
<i>to conference room two.</i>

120
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,062
Are you sure?

121
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,764
They don't want to live together?

122
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:56,633
I think that living apart is natural
for Ikari and his son.

123
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,594
And being together is unnatural?

124
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,641
Alone?

125
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,512
Right. His room will be in the Sixth
Block, just beyond this one.

126
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,913
Is that satisfactory?

127
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,013
Is that satisfactory?

128
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,378
Yes.

129
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,818
Are you sure? Shinji...

130
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,945
It's fine. Being alone is okay with me.

131
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,583
I'm alone anyway.

132
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,358
What?!

133
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:19,691
So, I said, I'll take care of Shinji.

134
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,718
So, I said, I'll take care of Shinji.

135
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,856
I've already got permission
from the brass.

136
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,301
Hey, it's not like I'm going to
"put the moves" on him.

137
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:32,738
<i>Of course you're not! How could you</i>
<i>even think of such a thing?</i>

138
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,405
<i> </i>
<i>You're always like that. Shame on you!</i>

139
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,737
She just can't take a joke.
<i>You're always like that. Shame on you!</i>

140
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,813
Well, we'll have to have a
party tonight, right?

141
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,084
What for?

142
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,451
What for? A welcoming party for my
new roommate, of course!

143
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,545
What for? A welcoming party for my
new roommate, of course!

144
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,316
So, you're going to move after all?

145
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:01,300
Yes. I'd never have dreamt that this
city would become a battlefield.

146
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,968
Yeah.

147
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:06,972
My husband's saying that our kid and
I should move, at the very least.

148
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,740
Don't I know it.

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,711
This city may be a fortress, but that's
no guarantee of safety.

150
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:16,112
Just remembering it gives
me the chills.

151
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,749
Really.

152
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,457
I hope you don't mind if we make
a little stop on the way.

153
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:26,924
Where?

154
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,759
Someplace really cool.

155
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,428
So desolate. This city seems so lonely.

156
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,106
It's time.

157
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,258
Amazing! The buildings are growing!

158
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,042
This city is a fortress, designed to
protect against the Angels.

159
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,419
This is Tokyo 3.

160
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,618
This is our city.

161
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,493
And it's the city that you saved.

162
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,300
NEON GENESIS
EVANGELION

163
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,739
Your things should have already
been delivered, Shinji.

164
00:11:56,448 --> 00:12:00,578
I just moved into this apartment too.

165
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:02,921
Come on in.

166
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:06,516
Pardon the intrusion.

167
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,684
Shinji, this is your home now.

168
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,527
I'm home.

169
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,629
Welcome home.

170
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,611
As you can see, the place
is a little bit messy.

171
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,078
Make yourself comfortable.

172
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,482
You call this

173
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,118
a "little bit" messy?

174
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:37,789
Oh! Sorry! Could you put
the food in the fridge?

175
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,256
Sure.

176
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,960
Ice,

177
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,427
snacks

178
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,420
and tons of beer.

179
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,190
What kind of a life does she lead?

180
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,410
Excuse me. What's in the other fridge?

181
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,073
Oh, don't mind that. He's
probably still sleeping!

182
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,014
Sleeping?

183
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,886
Let's eat!

184
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,353
Let's eat.

185
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:21,523
Life just doesn't get any
better than this!

186
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:27,032
Don't you want to eat? It's good,
even if it is all instant.

187
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:31,543
I'm sorry, I'm just not used to it.

188
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,307
That's no excuse! You
can't be so finicky.

189
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:38,780
No, that's not what I... well...

190
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,075
Isn't this nice?

191
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,289
Having two for dinner instead
of eating alone!

192
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,655
Yeah...

193
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,863
Here we go for the next one.

194
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,366
Paper, stone and scissors...

195
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,063
Pon! Pon! Pon! Pon!

196
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,501
Sorry, Shinji.

197
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,410
Okay! That was a pretty fair way of
splitting our daily chores, right?

198
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,079
Yeah.

199
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,580
This is your home now, so make
yourself comfortable,

200
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,242
This is your home now, so make
yourself comfortable,

201
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,943
and take advantage of everything
here, except me.

202
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,754
Yes.

203
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:15,921
Man, yes, yes, yes. Is that all you
say? It's getting on my nerves.

204
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,691
Man, yes, yes, yes. Is that all you
say? It's getting on my nerves.

205
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:23,218
You're a boy, aren't you?
Act like a man! Okay?

206
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,397
Yes.

207
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,525
Okay, that's just the way you are.

208
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,937
Well, why don't you go take a bath
and scrub away those bad memories.

209
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,064
Bathing cleanses both
the mind and soul.

210
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,417
Miss Misato!

211
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,051
What?

212
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,918
What?

213
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,715
A p... p... p...

214
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,022
What?

215
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,514
Oh, him? He's one of those new
warm water penguins.

216
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,970
What was that?

217
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,036
His name is Pen-pen.
He's your other roommate.

218
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:08,472
His name is Pen-pen.
He's your other roommate.

219
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,573
Why don't you cover that up?

220
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,779
I guess I'm not being as
nice as I ought to.

221
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,751
Of course, he's probably already
made up his mind about me.

222
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,753
Misato Katsuragi.

223
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,654
She's not a bad person.

224
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:33,398
Bathing cleanses both
the mind and soul.

225
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:37,357
But bad memories always seem to
find me when I'm in the bath.

226
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,170
Like my father

227
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,967
and Rei Ayanami.

228
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,236
So, how was Rei today?

229
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,279
You did see her at the hospital
this afternoon, didn't you?

230
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,454
She'll be ready to work
again in twenty days.

231
00:15:56,454 --> 00:16:00,356
By then, we'll be ready to re-activate
Unit 00 from cryo-stasis.

232
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,924
It's so hard on these poor children.

233
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:07,298
There is no one else who
can pilot the Evas.

234
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,868
As long as they survive, that
is what I'll have them do.

235
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,531
With no regard to what
they may want?

236
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,626
Yeah, after all the horrible
stuff he went through,

237
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,685
I doubt that he'll pilot it again.

238
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:40,397
<i>Maintaining him is part</i>
<i>of your job, Misato.</i>

239
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:44,402
I'm just scared. I don't know
how to deal with him.

240
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:48,106
Grumbling already? It was your idea
to take him in, you know.

241
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,573
<i>Shut up!</i>

242
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:54,907
I was just thinking of Shinji as a tool.

243
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,274
I'm as shameless as Ritsuko.

244
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,246
We destroyed the Angel.

245
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,580
So, why can't I be happy about it?

246
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,582
Another unfamiliar ceiling.

247
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:15,258
Of course. In this whole city, there's
no place that's familiar.

248
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,561
This is your home.

249
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,835
Why am I here?

250
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,031
The brain case has been damaged!
Extent of damage unknown!

251
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,767
We're having problems
maintaining activation!

252
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,734
Status report!

253
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:50,268
The synchrograph is reversing!
The pulses are flowing backward!

254
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,604
The synchrograph is reversing!
The pulses are flowing backward!

255
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,339
Break the circuit! Block it!

256
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,242
We can't! It's not accepting the
signal! It won't take it!

257
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,676
What about Shinji?

258
00:17:58,676 --> 00:17:58,743
His monitors aren't responding.
His condition's unknown!

259
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,879
His monitors aren't responding.
His condition's unknown!

260
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,447
Unit 01's gone completely silent!

261
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,182
Misato!

262
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,416
We've got to stop this.

263
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,086
Abort the operation! Rescuing the
pilot is our first priority!

264
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,788
Eject the entry plug!

265
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,190
We can't! It's completely
out of control!

266
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,657
No way!

267
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,034
The Eva's re-activating!

268
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:23,334
Impossible! How could this happen?!

269
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,325
Impossible! How could this happen?!

270
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,472
Impossible!

271
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:27,739
A berserker?!

272
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,933
A berserker?!

273
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,694
It looks like we've won.

274
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,801
An AT field!

275
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,471
No! As long as the Angel
has that AT field up...

276
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,336
He can't get near the Angel!

277
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:06,744
The left arm has been regenerated!

278
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:06,945
The left arm has been regenerated!

279
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,207
Incredible!

280
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,152
Unit 01's expanding an
AT field of its own!

281
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,588
It's neutralizing the phase space!

282
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,852
No, not neutralizing, it's eroding it!

283
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,385
Unbelievable! It went through
that AT field so easily.

284
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,167
No! It's going to self-destruct!

285
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,921
Is the Eva...

286
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,134
That must be the Eva's

287
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,658
true form.

288
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,044
<i>Circuits reconnected.</i>

289
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,479
<i>Systems restored. Graphs</i>
<i>back to normal.</i>

290
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,348
<i>Pilot life signs, confirmed.</i>

291
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:52,183
<i>Send out the recovery team. Hurry!<i>

292
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,980
<i>Preserving the pilot's life<i>
<i>is our first priority.<i>

293
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,763
Shinji, can I come in?

294
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,198
I forgot to tell you something.

295
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,872
You did a very good thing today.

296
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,907
You should be proud of yourself.

297
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,774
Good night, Shinji.

298
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,100
Hang in there.

299
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,300
TO BE CONTINUED

300
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Preview

301
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,500
Shinji starts a new life with the training
of Eva, school, and a roommate.

302
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,900
...but once he's known as the pilot of
Eva, he becomes popular in his class.

303
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Next time: "A Phone That Never Rings."
And of course, I'll give you good service!
