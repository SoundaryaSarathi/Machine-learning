1
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,321
But then, you're gonna pay!

2
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,451
<i>I can use these guys.</i>

3
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:15,785
That's all that people
like you are good for, at best.

4
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>They're gone</i>! <i>They've both disappeared</i>!

5
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:22,751
T-The woman wearing
fatigues who was sitting there!

6
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,755
It's already overtaken us!

7
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,173
The Rail Tracer!

8
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,826
I see. So she arrived without incident?

9
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:00,318
Well, apparently,
it wasn't exactly without incident.

10
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:01,818
What do you mean?

11
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:04,908
Word is that the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>
switched out not only its engine,

12
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,170
but its passenger cars, as well.

13
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,658
Do we have a read on the circumstances?

14
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:12,107
Only fragments.

15
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:15,122
Nebula is moving
to suppress information about it,

16
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:18,128
so we can't really
get a grasp of the whole picture,

17
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,850
but there's no question
that there was quite an incident.

18
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:24,537
It appears that
a good deal of the passengers are dead.

19
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:28,468
<i>She</i> was aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot,</i>
as I recall, wasn't she?

20
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:29,428
Yes.

21
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,308
Why don't we wait until
we've gotten her report.

22
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,938
What did she see,
what did she hear, what does she know?

23
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,118
It looks like she's already here.

24
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,045
Rachel-<i>kun</i>, I'm glad that you are back.

25
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:53,702
We've had nothing but
unpleasant information coming in

26
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:56,553
regarding the <i>Flying Pussyfoot,</i>
so I've been most worried.

27
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:02,168
As president of the <i>Daily Days,</i>
I am proud to have employees like you.

28
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,962
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:05,937
Did you hitch another free ride?

30
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,024
Yes, that's right. Is that a problem?

31
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,848
Nicholas-<i>kun,</i>
looking at Rachel-<i>kun</i>'s injured leg,

32
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:17,365
it's evident that
the situation must have been serious.

33
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,534
Please refrain from such levity.

34
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,398
Please excuse my impropriety.

35
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:24,122
Now then, Rachel-<i>kun,</i>

36
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:29,044
ordinarily, I would have you
take plenty of time off to recuperate,

37
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:33,742
but we are information brokers.
I will ask you for your report right away.

38
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,968
What happened aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>?

39
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:41,598
All I know is what happened
within the scope of what I saw.

40
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,752
That is fine.

41
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:48,258
Please tell me,
who were the people in the black suits?

42
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:50,968
Who were the people in the white suits?

43
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,638
President, you appear to know more than I do.

44
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:58,073
Also, what was this "Rail Tracer"?

45
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,773
Rail Tracer?

46
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,732
W-What's the Rail Tracer?

47
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:07,533
Oh, Jacuzzi, you don't know?

48
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,528
The Rail Tracer is...

49
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:10,862
Now that you mention it,

50
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,089
some of the passengers
in the dining car were talking about it.

51
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:19,010
A legendary monster,
that traces the shadows of the railways.

52
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,622
Monster?

53
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,806
Yes, monster.

54
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,851
I don't know if that much is actually true...

55
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:33,302
but there was indeed a monster
aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

56
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,277
A crimson, brutal monster.

57
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:45,188
Call it strange, or really,
call it unbelievable...

58
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:49,068
No, really, why is there a sea of blood in here?

59
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:52,210
Isn't it strange? Or rather, isn't it amazing?

60
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:56,135
What is it that can kill a man
in such a messy manner?

61
00:04:56,135 --> 00:05:00,578
Hey, come on, now.
Is this man without a face that one guy?

62
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:01,970
Could this be Dune?

63
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:07,392
Man, that's amazing.
The hunter has become the hunted.

64
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,928
So then, who was it that killed Dune?!

65
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:16,067
If I'm to avenge him,
I can't do anything if I don't know who did it.

66
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,682
Oh, Dune, you poor man!

67
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,908
You can't even have your friends avenge you.

68
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:28,557
Now then,
as for the all-important way to be spared...

69
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:33,168
Everyone who heard this story died right away.

70
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,922
They say there wasn't a single way
for any of them to be saved!

71
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,708
There <i>is</i> one way to be saved.

72
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,712
Kill before you are killed.

73
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,768
W-Wait! Wait a minute!

74
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,187
I don't think so.

75
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:58,512
Oh, yeah. To continue my story,
the way to keep the Rail Tracer

76
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:02,768
from coming for you is to believe this story,

77
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:07,728
and if it is already here,
to keep running until the sun rises.

78
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,038
Although, it's too late for that.

79
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:14,112
The Rail Tracer is certain
to show up for you people.

80
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:18,463
This gunshot will wake it up.
It will be awakened with your death.

81
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,591
Now sacrifice, die.

82
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,108
What's going on here?

83
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,058
Who are you?

84
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:45,978
Just a minute, please!
I'm not doing anything wrong!

85
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,938
The two of us are the only conductors
that are supposed to be on this train.

86
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,272
Who are you?

87
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,755
Hey, please put
that dangerous thing away, will you?

88
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:58,158
How can you be so composed,
given your situation?

89
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:01,095
Who are you? What are you after?

90
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:04,092
Uh oh, is the secret out already?

91
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,775
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,712
You seem to be the type that doesn't crack,

93
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:17,218
even with a gun pointed at you.

94
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:20,149
So I'm going to have to
torture you for a little bit.

95
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,222
What do you mean by that? Torture?

96
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,948
What year did you come from?

97
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:33,818
Hey, now, I'm glad you
got rid of your gun, and all,

98
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:36,374
but I've got this fine little piece here...

99
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,293
Huh?

100
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,899
I'll ask you again!

101
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:04,986
Who are you?!

102
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,657
That's too bad.

103
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,215
I'll ask you once again. Who are you?

104
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:26,174
D-Dune...

105
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,176
Where are you from, Dune?

106
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,553
Oh, man!

107
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:42,388
Just what kind of person
would do something like this?

108
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,638
I'll just bet it's someone incredible!
Someone so incredible,

109
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:49,518
they've never thought that
they themselves might get killed!

110
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:53,368
But then, there's me.
I won't be outdone by them!

111
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,959
Dune-<i>kun</i>, friend of the Russo Family,
I know what your plan is.

112
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,881
Can I ask you one more thing?
Why are you dressed like a conductor?

113
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:17,100
I like... I like how it feels!
Ladd says... killing... is fun!

114
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,311
I see. For the fun of it, huh?

115
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,342
Well then, where did you get that uniform?

116
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:28,820
This morning, at the station!
From that old geezer conductor!

117
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,155
What did you do to him?

118
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,493
I killed him! It felt good! Fun! Fun!

119
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,588
That conductor's name was Tony!

120
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:52,301
He's the man who taught me
what I know about conducting.

121
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,712
Watch yourselves.

122
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:05,314
I don't know what, exactly,
but there's something dangerous on this train.

123
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,098
I'm going to go kill
whoever it is and those black suits,

124
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,446
so you stay hidden. Okay?

125
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:29,964
Don't forget, I'm going to
be the one who kills you. Okay?

126
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:40,183
Lemures? The Russo Family?
Don't make me laugh.

127
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:46,439
I am a monster to you.

128
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:50,193
A monster who is going to devour you all.

129
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,432
As of now, I am going to be this train's...

130
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,991
I am going to be <i>your</i> Rail Tracer!

131
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:03,915
Conductor?

132
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,917
Yes, conductor.

133
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,920
It was wearing a conductor's uniform.

134
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,344
So, what did this monster say to you?

135
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,391
Ticket, please.

136
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,012
Excuse me.

137
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:34,946
I think that it knew
I had boarded the train without paying.

138
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,282
Indeed. There doesn't
seem to be any question, then.

139
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,745
That conductor is Vino.

140
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,958
How do you know the red monster was Vino?

141
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,506
Vino is feared as an elusive monster,
appearing in every city in America.

142
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:59,804
In fact, he suddenly appears in
unpredictable locations, then leaves,

143
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,224
then appears in yet
another unpredictable location.

144
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,811
How is it possible for him to do this?

145
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:11,607
What if Vino was a conductor
on a transcontinental express?

146
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,777
It would explain why he's so elusive.

147
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,782
If that's the case, it's only natural
that he'd be seen often in those cities.

148
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:23,483
Vino... I've heard of him.

149
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:26,283
Vino, also known as Claire Stanfield,

150
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,458
was raised by the Gandor brothers' father.

151
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:34,922
The Gandors lived next door to him
when he was orphaned.

152
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,868
Thus, the brothers considered him
part of the family,

153
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:43,097
and you could safely say that
he was essentially the fourth brother.

154
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,168
Later, it's said that
he ran away with the circus.

155
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,561
That is correct.

156
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,092
In the circus,
with superhuman abilities and effort,

157
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,598
Claire gained physical strength and skill

158
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:58,112
that literally surpassed human levels.

159
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:03,200
Those must be of use to him,
now that he is an assassin.

160
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,337
Hey, would you pipe down!

161
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:23,168
You and Master Ladd might be
content with just the killing,

162
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,640
but there's something
more important that I'm...

163
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,398
Vino's methods of killing
are famous for being messy.

164
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:48,318
The bodies of those that
fall under his hand are utterly destroyed.

165
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,498
Almost as if someone
had dumped wine over them.

166
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,992
He seems to have to go that far,
or he cannot rest assured

167
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,175
that he has done
a complete job as an assassin.

168
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,764
Were you able to confirm whether or not
Vino made contact with the three Gandor brothers?

169
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,099
Yes.

170
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,077
What happened? You look like hell.

171
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:16,107
Live long enough, and I'll tell you someday!

172
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:19,598
Excuse me, might you be Gandor-<i>sama</i>?

173
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:20,722
Yes, I am.

174
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,446
I have this to give to you.

175
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,031
Thanks.

176
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,204
Keith...

177
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:43,801
Claire, you're a conductor.
What are you doing out here?

178
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,431
I'm no longer Claire, nor am I a conductor.

179
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,268
Then, what should we call you?

180
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,945
Well, you can call me Vino, or the Rail Tracer.

181
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,803
How lame.

182
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:02,785
Now, let's get going.
First of all, who should I kill?

183
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:07,398
I only got a little light exercise last night,
so I'm getting flabby.

184
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:10,119
I want to do a job that
I can go all-out on for a change.

185
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:15,238
Let's finish this up quick.
There's someone I have to track down later.

186
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:18,627
Someone to whom there's
a chance I might get married to.

187
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,630
But why would that be?

188
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,170
Why would Vino have committed
such indiscriminate killing?

189
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,372
It may appear to be indiscriminate,

190
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:31,932
but his actions are based on
some ethic of his own making.

191
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:35,922
It has been reported before
this that Vino seems to possess

192
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:38,183
a somewhat warped sense of justice.

193
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:41,525
But, to kill a child as young as that...

194
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,195
Which child is that?

195
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,989
It was a young boy, about ten years old.

196
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:52,705
I see. Perhaps you can ask
the boy himself why he did that someday.

197
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,830
Himself? What do you mean, himself?

198
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,057
Now then, Rachel-<i>kun,</i>

199
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,377
there are still a great deal of things
I must ask of you.

200
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,465
You still haven't even told me
about how you got hurt.

201
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,675
Right.

202
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,978
What is this?

203
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,189
What the hell?

204
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,191
Dallas,

205
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,638
that girl injected us with something.

206
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,823
It looks like you're awake.

207
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:35,022
Who are you?!
What are you going to do with us?!

208
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:37,608
I am Szilard Quates.

209
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:41,908
After I have asked you something
I need to ask you, I'm going to have you killed.

210
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:43,198
Does that answer your question?

211
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,216
You're going to have us killed?
You just take your best shot!

212
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,719
H-Hey, hey!

213
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:09,432
Hmph, he didn't live a respectable life, huh?

214
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:12,950
I can't tell whether or not the medicine is safe.

215
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,452
Dallas Genoard...

216
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,956
How would you like to make a deal?

217
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,743
Looks like the shock is too great.
We'll continue this later.

218
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:29,425
Ennis, what happened to
the other two who were there?

219
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:35,248
They left the area right away.
There's no sign that I was followed.

220
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:38,311
I see. Then there shouldn't be any problem.

221
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:39,101
Right.

222
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:43,298
The finished product appears to be
in the den of a mafia family named Gandor.

223
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:47,138
We can't afford to botch negotiating with them
and revealing any information about us.

224
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:50,035
Have those three steal it back.

225
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,728
This bunch appears to have
a grievance with the Gandors.

226
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:56,978
Once they find out they have
been given immortal bodies,

227
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:59,022
they will gladly obey.

228
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,122
Right.

229
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,417
Szilard-<i>sama</i>!

230
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,328
Even if it was the unfinished product
that you injected them with earlier...

231
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,317
Why would you give it to those hoodlums?

232
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,425
Be quiet!

233
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,628
This could turn into a quarrel with the mafia.

234
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,300
That bunch are tools to that end.

235
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,853
Once I am done with them,
I'll devour them. Any problem with that?

236
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,802
If any of you have the strength
to tussle with gangsters and win,

237
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:30,444
that's another story.

238
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,037
Mary!

239
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,807
I trust you are relieved?

240
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:52,174
We have rescued your daughter
from those despicable white suits.

241
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,208
Now then, if a signal flare
goes up tomorrow morning

242
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,878
on a bridge that this train will pass over,

243
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,798
then provisionally, you will be spared.

244
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:04,144
Provisionally, you understand.

245
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,132
This is a negotiation.

246
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:09,888
Since we cannot negotiate from inside the train,

247
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:13,877
I'm having my men conduct
the negotiations with your husband.

248
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,058
You mean...

249
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:19,062
In the event that we do not reach
an understanding with your husband,

250
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:22,898
to assure him that our actions are not a bluff,

251
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:26,988
I regret to inform you that
your daughter's body will end up being left

252
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:29,533
along the side of the tracks.

253
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:34,147
I do hope that
you will not ask us to kill you, instead.

254
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:36,078
There is no particular reason why,

255
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,958
but for the trouble it would cause,
I must refuse.

256
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:43,462
Further, please be aware that
if there is any police obstruction

257
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,354
on the tracks along the way,
it will mean the loss of your daughter.

258
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,802
I should tell you, for your information,

259
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:54,111
that it will be death by shooting,
so please prepare yourself.

260
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,192
I'll raise.

261
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,488
Whoa, aren't you the bold one?

262
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:10,885
I'm out.

263
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:13,422
Well then, I guess I'll call.

264
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,498
Who are you guys?

265
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,332
Oh, as it happens, we were here
this afternoon, and forgot something.

266
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,878
You forgot something?

267
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:23,891
Yes. Ah, that box.

268
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:31,592
I hate to say it, but I've got
no way of knowing if that's really yours.

269
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:34,151
You'll have to wait until
Luck-<i>san</i> comes back tomorr--

270
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,948
Is that all you've got?!

271
00:20:55,948 --> 00:21:00,078
You go calling <i>us</i> nothing but scum,
and <i>this</i> is all you've got?!

272
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:03,222
This is so gratifying, it's laughable!

273
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:18,362
The phone... Have to... contact... Luck-<i>san...</i>

274
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,648
I'm pretty sure... Luck-<i>san</i> is...

275
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,285
That hurt.

276
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,045
We really are immortal!

277
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,467
I'm overcome. I am absolutely overcome!

278
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,850
What did you want from me, kid?

279
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:54,231
Mister, you're really powerful, huh?
You really surprised me!

280
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,262
Oh, really? You think so?

281
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,972
Mm-hmm. Mister, if you stepped into the ring,

282
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:02,728
I'm sure you'd be wearing the belt by now.

283
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:05,062
I don't dislike kids who are good at flattery.

284
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,335
So, what do you want?

285
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,664
The thing is, I need a favor from you, mister.

286
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,488
A favor?

287
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:16,044
Don't look at me so scary, mister.

288
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,448
Shut up. Don't you forget that
the only reason you're still alive

289
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:25,095
is because you didn't call me, Ladd-<i>sama,</i>
who turns 25 this year, "Uncle."

290
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,958
Whether this favor you're
going to ask of me makes me angry

291
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:32,436
or makes me laugh will determine
how long you live, boy.

292
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,468
Okay, listen.

293
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:40,444
Would you kill all of the people
in the dining car for me?

294
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,362
What?

295
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,785
Do you realize what you're saying?

296
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:49,995
Mm-hmm.

297
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:07,460
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

298
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:21,641
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

299
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:33,232
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

300
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:40,238
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

301
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:47,288
<i>I believe so</i>

302
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:54,378
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

303
00:23:54,378 --> 00:24:01,888
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

304
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:08,558
<i>We can go on spinning our Io ve</i>

305
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:18,614
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

306
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,721
<i>Hey, Miria, what exactly</i>
<i>is Czes-kun so scared of?</i>

307
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:31,134
<i>That "sha" in "fushisha"</i>
<i>refers to people, right?</i>

308
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:32,804
<i>Then what does the "fushi" part mean?</i>

309
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,431
<i>I bet it's the fushi from "fushidara."</i>

310
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,894
<i>Which means it's a person who 's slutty?</i>
<i>Can't say I blame him.</i>

311
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,896
<i>Besides, it's their specter, and all.</i>
