00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:37,462
Gohan! Don't take your
eyes off of theirs!

2
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,797
R- right!

3
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,131
There's nothing to be afraid of.

4
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,257
Right!

5
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,109
Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

6
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,599
R- right!

7
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,125
This time, shall we
take the fight to them?

8
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,592
Kuririn!

9
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,467
Tenshinhan!

10
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,803
Chaozu, you're here, too?

11
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:53,134
Mm-hmm!

12
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:58,170
Weren't there only
supposed to be two Saiyans?

13
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:02,480
Well, a lot has happened.
It looks like there are more of them.

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,971
However many there are,
it's all the same.

15
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,087
Is that him? Goku's son?

16
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,488
Yeah. He appears to have been
trained quite a bit by Piccolo.

17
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,895
He's got a fine look to him.

18
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,765
What shrimps...

19
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,394
Saibaimen, make them all suffer!

20
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,074
Just a minute!

21
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,791
Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

22
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,622
Yamucha-<i>san</i>!

23
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,132
I guess we're all here, except for Goku.

24
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah!

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,739
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6, huh?

26
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,411
Interesting. The exact number
of Saibaimen that we have here.

27
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,413
Yes, it is.

28
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:13,817
How about you all take turns
fighting each one of our soldiers?

29
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:16,311
It will be a game.

30
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,758
A game!? Ridiculous!

31
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,762
Stop beating around the bush
and let's settle this right here and now!

32
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:28,433
Now, now, where's the harm? It works out
better for our side to do it this way.

33
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,770
Goku hasn't arrived yet, after all.

34
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,605
Very well.

35
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:37,564
I'll lead off.
Now, come and get it!

36
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:46,111
He's going to be bowled over once he
realizes how strong the Saibaimen are!

37
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:55,460
So, which one of you is going to face me?

38
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,988
You go first. Hammer him with
all you've got. Understood?

39
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:08,501
T- Ten-<i>san</i>, good luck!

40
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:23,247
We're going to start reporting
from above the scene now...

41
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,097
Whoa! Those are the Saiyans!

42
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,122
The Saiyans!

43
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,066
Noisy mosquitoes!

44
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,121
Okay, Saibaiman!
Don't hold back! Crush him!

45
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:13,496
These Saiyans appear to possess
tremendous power. Is everything all right?

46
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:18,565
You idiot! 'course
everything ain't all right!

47
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:26,877
L- like I said, my boys're fightin'
with 'em for your sakes right now!

48
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:31,422
--Who do you mean when you say " my boys" ?
--Won't you be surprised when I tell ya!

49
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:34,759
The winner of the Tenkaichi
Tournament, Son Goku.

50
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,428
With him're Tenshinhan,
and Piccolo, as well.

51
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:38,763
That is amazing!

52
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,425
So, everything'll be okay.

53
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,935
Prob'ly...

54
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:48,439
<i>There's a good chance</i>
<i>that this'll be my last meal...</i>

55
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,634
<i>But I can't tell 'em that!</i>

56
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:57,609
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, are you sure
that Goku has been returned to life?

57
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:01,052
Gyumao!

58
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:04,055
He should be heading to where
Piccolo and the others are, right now.

59
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,058
W- well then...

60
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,618
W- where is my Gohan?

61
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:15,924
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, where is my Gohan?

62
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:20,094
He's still with Piccolo and the others.

63
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,041
Chichi!

64
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,818
I- incredible!

65
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,527
W- what!?

66
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,737
You did it!

67
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,001
That's Tenshinhan for you!

68
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,700
Incredible!

69
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,143
I- impossible!

70
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,489
Saibaimen have a battle power of 1200.

71
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,759
They're on par with Raditz,
as far as power goes!

72
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,763
His battle power
must be higher than that.

73
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,458
B- but...

74
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,434
It's simple arithmetic.

75
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,901
That wasn't in our data...

76
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:03,736
Nappa, it looks like these guys
are going to be somewhat entertaining.

77
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:11,614
Ten-<i>san</i>! He's getting up!

78
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:34,136
V- Vegeta! How could you do that?

79
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>W</i>- <i>what is this strange</i>
<i>uneasiness l'm feeling?</i>

80
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,083
<i>l've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

81
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:49,417
<i>Piccolo, hang in there somehow</i>
<i>until I get back! l'm counting on you!</i>

82
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,115
W- why?

83
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:21,786
Anything more would be a
waste of time. He couldn't win.

84
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:26,457
That Saibaiman took him
too lightly when he attacked.

85
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:30,461
I told him to go at it
with everything he's got.

86
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,131
H- how could he do that!?

87
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,801
<i>T</i>- <i>that Saiyan blew that monster</i>
<i>to bits in the blink of an eye!</i>

88
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,291
<i>What destructive force!</i>

89
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,677
We'll be okay from here.
This special lens is working out great!

90
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:55,279
There's so much energy colliding
in the area, we can't get very close.

91
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:01,884
This is almost as if the end of the world
were approaching, it's such a spectacle.

92
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,211
Now, who's going to be next?

93
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:32,222
You guys, go all-out
from the start this time!

94
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,795
A- all right... I'll face them.

95
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:39,130
Wait, Kuiririn.

96
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,131
Yamucha-<i>san</i>...

97
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:46,470
Let me do this. I want to show them
that we've had enough of their games.

98
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,806
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, <i>l</i> can do that-

99
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:52,310
You've already been brought back
to life once by the Dragon Balls.

100
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,314
Supposing that the unthinkable happens,
you couldn't come back to life again.

101
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:01,485
Let me handle this. I'm going to take care
of the other five all at the same time.

102
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,817
Y- Yamucha-<i>san</i>...

103
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:09,616
What a beautiful friendship you must have.
All right, you take him on.

104
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:14,765
All right, come on!
Don't you take us so lightly!

105
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,767
He's getting cocky.

106
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,603
Give us a look...

107
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:21,504
...at how truly terrifying
you Saibaimen are!

108
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,778
T- these are the Saiyans!

109
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,680
These are the Saiyans that have
plunged us into depths of terror!

110
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,623
Oh, that face!

111
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,292
It's one of the regulars
from the Tenkaichi Tournament!

112
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,793
Yamucha!

113
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:46,130
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>'s face is looking
even tougher now, isn't it?

114
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,930
It's not just his face. His abilities
are a lot greater now, too.

115
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,472
Bulma, you're taken
with him again, aren't you?

116
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,307
D- don't be silly!

117
00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:01,078
Once they defeat the Saiyans, you could
get married, couldn't you, Bulma-<i>san</i>?

118
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,138
Y- you don't mean-
I mean, marriage!

119
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,617
Oh, that's the face of Piccolo Daimao!

120
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,429
It's Gohan!

121
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,226
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

122
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:29,774
He's lookin' a lot tougher, huh?

123
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:34,973
Gohan-<i>chan</i>...
Look at how you've become...

124
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,286
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i> is in the same place
as those revoltin' monsters?

125
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,349
C- Chichi!

126
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,320
W- why isn't Goku there?

127
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,748
T- they vanished!

128
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,920
You fool! They're moving at high speed!
Try feeling out the movement of their <i>Ki</i>.

129
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,755
T- the movement of their <i>Ki</i>?

130
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,189
Everyone except for you can see them.

131
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,097
You all can see them?
All right, then!

132
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,565
Use your whole body as your eyes.

133
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,826
My whole body as my eyes?

134
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:18,078
Do you see them?

135
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:26,481
I see them!

136
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:46,440
You're not getting away!

137
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,726
You did it!

138
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,728
I- incredible!

139
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:07,398
He did it!

140
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:09,066
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

141
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,330
Yamucha did it!

142
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,372
Not again!

143
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:37,428
Looks like these monsters
aren't as strong as you think they are.

144
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:39,096
W- what did you say?

145
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,927
Keep your head, Nappa.

146
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:45,701
I'll take care of the
other four by myself, too.

147
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,775
It appears that this time, <i>you're</i> the ones
who took the <i>Saibaimen</i> too lightly.

148
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:52,867
What?

149
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,883
Oh, crap!

150
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:22,069
N- no!

151
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,480
Yamucha!

152
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:41,592
Yes. That will do.

153
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:45,187
W- what a fiend!
He blew himself up!

154
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,226
H- how awful!

155
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,349
H- he's dead...

156
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:21,065
W- what's wrong with Yamucha?
What happened, Oolong?

157
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:24,967
I- I'm not sure. I couldn't
hear what he said.

158
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:37,147
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>! Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

159
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,115
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

160
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:44,482
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

161
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:56,589
Bulma...

162
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,636
No!!

163
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,728
Y- Yamucha-<i>san</i> must have had
a bad feeling about this.

164
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:29,631
T- that's why he went
in my place. Damn it all!

165
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:38,409
Damn it all! What do I tell
Pu-erh and Bulma-<i>san</i>!?

166
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,479
What a pathetic Saibaiman-
ending in a draw!

167
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:45,749
What did he think he was doing,
against scum like that!?

168
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,846
Hey, clean that filth up.
He's polluting up the place.

169
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,226
You dirty bastard!

170
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,854
