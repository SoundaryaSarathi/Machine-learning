1
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:21,421
Here.

2
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:23,729
Thank you.

3
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,491
You should have put
your bag in the trunk.

4
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:29,926
It’s pretty small…

5
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:31,964
Is this the place?

6
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,372
Yeah, about nine kilometers further.

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,008
This is my first time
going to a summer house.

8
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:38,473
Me too.

9
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:49,722
[Sakura and the rainbow of memories]

10
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,919
Sorry to intrude on your family trip.

11
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:56,589
Not at all.

12
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,564
Sorry to make you come along
on your summer vacation.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,132
Not at all.

14
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:00,991
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,529
We don’t have any homework
over the summer holidays..

16
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,265
How nice. I am jealous.

17
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,867
I have this much.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,240
You are probably going to run
around doing it all at the end.

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,908
We have to stop by and visit
Tsukishiro-kun’s place sometime.

20
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,418
You help around the house a lot,

21
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,514
and help out Touya a lot too.

22
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:26,860
I’ve never met your family.

23
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,461
I only have my grandparents,

24
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,357
so they get up early in the morning
and go to bed early.

25
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:34,532
Turn left here.

26
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:52,086
We’re really borrowing this place?

27
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,818
It seems they usually
spend summers here,

28
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,417
but this year they are going overseas.

29
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:00,920
Yay!

30
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,694
Sorry our summer trip isn’t overseas.

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,399
This place is wonderful too.

32
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,476
Dad,

33
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,844
thanks for bringing me along.

34
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,423
For the next two days,
I’ll be staying here.

35
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,761
I’m looking forward to it, Mom.

36
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:57,549
Hey! Did you forget I was in there?

37
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,020
Sorry, the room was just so nice

38
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,047
that I…

39
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,785
Oh, it’s pretty good isn’t it?

40
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,793
Right? So I was just so happy…

41
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:09,686
You were about to make me
into a sandwich.

42
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:11,124
That’s why I said I was sorry.

43
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,859
I will forgive you.

44
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,527
In return take care of my share
of the after dinner desert.

45
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,105
You don’t have to eat do you?

46
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,202
Well, yeah.

47
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,804
But, you like sweets.

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,901
I like a bit of luxury.

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,345
Doesn’t that just mean you like snacks?

50
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,875
All right.
The stove and faucets work.

51
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:33,950
OK, shall we go shopping?

52
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:35,751
Are you going somewhere?

53
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,451
To go buy groceries.
Do you want to come along?

54
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,262
Or, do you want to take
a walk until dinner?

55
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:43,862
I’ll go take a walk.

56
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:48,196
Now that you mention it, there was
a huge summer cottage near here.

57
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:49,597
Where?

58
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,933
Just a bit down the road.

59
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:53,531
Were you asleep?

60
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:54,273
No I wasn’t!

61
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,404
See you later!

62
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,210
Kero-chan, let’s go outside.

63
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,689
OK.

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,291
I was in the bag for so long,

65
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,761
the fresh air is nice.

66
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:24,864
Really.

67
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,691
It’s huge.

68
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,159
It is like Alice’s garden.

69
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,091
Alice?

70
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,594
Alice in Wonderland.

71
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:57,903
I saw it in a book.

72
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,601
Ah, that English story.

73
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,332
You sure know your stuff.

74
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,105
I am well educated.

75
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,445
Young lady.

76
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,681
Up here.

77
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,822
What a cute girl. Are you lost?

78
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,829
No, I am just taking a walk.

79
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,125
Where from?

80
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:25,588
From the summer home over there.

81
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,530
Did they have a girl your age?

82
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,437
We are borrowing it,
just for summer vacation.

83
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,906
I see. Are you in a hurry?

84
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,870
Would you like a cup of tea?

85
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,276
Here you go.

86
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:26,058
This is well done? Is that
because of your part time work?

87
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,792
From the steakhouse.

88
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,290
My brother really has worked everywhere.

89
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:31,826
It’s done.

90
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,263
So, shall we eat?

91
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,192
Thanks for the food.

92
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,308
Oh yeah, how was your walk?

93
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,842
It was fun.

94
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,976
I met an old man

95
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:47,246
at that big house.

96
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,607
He said he was out here
on vacation from work.

97
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,153
He treated me to some tea.

98
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:56,016
Didn’t you just gulp down
his tea without hesitation?

99
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,186
I didn’t.

100
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,051
Was the tea good?

101
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:00,755
The cookies were good too.

102
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,630
So you didn’t hesitate after all.

103
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,267
That old man invited me

104
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,796
to come over again tomorrow.

105
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:12,973
Go ahead.

106
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,132
It is good to make friends
at a travel destination.

107
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,169
Yeah.

108
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:24,681
Hello, this is Daidouji.

109
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,416
Ah, Tomoyo-chan. This is Sakura.

110
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:27,754
Sakura-chan?

111
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:28,918
I’m here too.

112
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,185
Kero-chan went with you right?

113
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:34,157
Yeah, it’s a really nice place.

114
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,059
I would have been nice
if you could come too.

115
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:39,600
The chorus club has
a national tournament.

116
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,363
It really was too bad.

117
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,063
Don’t worry about it. Good luck.

118
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,803
I’m cheering for you too.

119
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,834
Thank you very much.

120
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,138
There is a really big summer
house nearby.

121
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,444
There is a nice old man there,

122
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,406
he treated me to tea today.

123
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:58,279
Tomoyo-chan?

124
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,476
Nothing. Was it enjoyable?

125
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,416
Yeah, it was like
the tea party I saw in a book.

126
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,158
He told me to come over
again tomorrow.

127
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,857
That is wonderful.

128
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,120
Let me know about it

129
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:12,329
afterwards.

130
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,462
Yeah, my dad told me

131
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:17,869
I could too

132
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:19,962
Yeah, well then good night.

133
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:21,632
Good night.

134
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,246
Are you going to that old man’s
place again tomorrow?

135
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:30,647
Yeah, I’m going to go visit.

136
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,916
Don’t forget some snacks for me.

137
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:35,388
You are too glutonous.

138
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,416
I’m turning off the lights.

139
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:38,716
OK.

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,091
Good night. Pleasant dreams.

141
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:42,726
Good night.

142
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,373
I’m going out.

143
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:58,945
Ah. Sakura. I baked cookies.

144
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,475
Give them to the old man.

145
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:02,677
Thank you.

146
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,281
Say hello for me.

147
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:05,546
OK!

148
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,246
Are you going out already?

149
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,346
Yeah.

150
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,313
See you later.

151
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,554
I’m off!

152
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,226
Young lady.

153
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:25,035
Come on up.

154
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,837
Eh…

155
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:50,391
Over here.

156
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,434
Ah, over here.

157
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,335
Eh!

158
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:11,276
How cute.

159
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,759
Good afternoon.
Thank you for inviting me.

160
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,622
Thank you for coming over.

161
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,197
Is this a child’s room?

162
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,566
Yes it is.

163
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,097
A girl?

164
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:33,334
You can tell.

165
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,302
It’s such a cute room.

166
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,939
Is she here too?

167
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:39,440
Then can’t she join us?

168
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:40,542
She isn’t with us anymore.

169
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,650
She went to heaven some time ago.

170
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,455
I’m sorry. I…

171
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,962
You need not apologize
for anything.

172
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,263
So, smile.

173
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:10,673
A smile suits a girl best.

174
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:11,468
What is your name?

175
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:14,608
Sakura. Sakura Kinomoto.

176
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:18,142
Kinomoto?
May I call you Sakura-chan?

177
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:19,077
Yes.

178
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,483
Well then Sakura-chan,

179
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,217
would you like
to play here today?

180
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,285
Yes.

181
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,523
Let’s have some tea.

182
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,822
I wonder who is preparing the tea.

183
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,158
Is there somebody else here?

184
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,761
When you are like that

185
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,766
it is almost as if
my granddaughter has come back.

186
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,902
Was that child’s room
your granddaughter’s?

187
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,335
But she wasn’t good at tennis

188
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,246
like you.

189
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,677
Oh, shall I go get some cookies?

190
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,345
Ah, I forgot.

191
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,357
Here.

192
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:37,254
These are?

193
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,463
From my father.

194
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:46,296
Thank you.

195
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,281
My dad is a good cook,
so they are good.

196
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,550
You are here with your father?

197
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:04,549
Yes.

198
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,190
What sort of person is your father?

199
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,160
He is kind, a good cook,

200
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:14,196
a college professor,
he is also good at sewing.

201
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,465
Ah, he can knit too.

202
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,201
And then… and then…

203
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:21,166
You really love your father don’t you?

204
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:22,799
Yes.

205
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:31,310
Delicious.

206
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:45,891
Are you worried?

207
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:46,664
Huh?

208
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:47,692
About Sakura.

209
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:00,705
Was this your granddaughter’s too?

210
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,012
It was her favorite dress.

211
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,047
It really does look good on you.

212
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,158
You resemble her a lot.

213
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:20,056
Eh?

214
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,561
You closely resemble my granddaughter.

215
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,237
Will you accept this dress?

216
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:27,399
I can’t.

217
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:29,536
Please accept it.

218
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,509
I am sure my granddaughter
would be happy.

219
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,212
Would she really be happy?

220
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:37,242
Of course.

221
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:51,793
This is?

222
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,656
A picture my grandaughter drew.

223
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:54,793
A rainbow?

224
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,328
Because I liked to watch rainbows.

225
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,566
She drew it for me.

226
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:01,898
We could see a beautiful rainbow

227
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,139
from the veranda of this room.

228
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,074
It is a very kind picture.

229
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:10,810
She was a very kind girl.

230
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:23,695
What a nice old man.

231
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,289
But he seemed so sad.

232
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,302
Did you think of something
to return the favor?

233
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,439
I thought of a few things.

234
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:35,332
With such a big house

235
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,168
there is no point
to giving some present.

236
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:40,240
I wonder if
there isn’t something I can do for him.

237
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:44,346
Do you know something he would enjoy?

238
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,548
Ah, a rainbow.
There was a picture of a rainbow.

239
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:52,048
Rainbow? That’s it!

240
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:03,735
You stopped by?

241
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,933
Umm, I’m going home today.

242
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,200
That is too bad.

243
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,871
That’s why I have a small request.

244
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:15,806
Eh?

245
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,414
After I leave,

246
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:20,853
would you please go out to the veranda
from your grandaughter’s room?

247
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,449
I don’t mind.

248
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,415
Please do.

249
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,549
I understand.
I’ll make sure to do so.

250
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,658
Umm, I had a lot of fun.

251
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,119
So did I.

252
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,124
It was very fun.

253
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:37,203
Good bye.

254
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,835
Umm. Your grandaughter.

255
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,881
I am sure she went to a
beautiful place in the sky,

256
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,777
the same as my mother.

257
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,220
My brother told me that.

258
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:59,618
My mother was very happy
having married my father.

259
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,687
She must be in a
very beautiful place.

260
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,691
So, I’m sure your grandaughter

261
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,532
is also in a very beautiful place.

262
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,734
I am sure she is.

263
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,396
Well then, go out on the veranda.

264
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,651
All right, you can do it from here.

265
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:36,761
Rain,

266
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,326
cast a seven colored
bridge through the sky.

267
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,465
Rain!

268
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,224
Rain?

269
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,754
Grandfather! Grandfather!

270
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,725
Grandfather look, a rainbow.

271
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,876
Grandfather.

272
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:05,381
Sorry to make you stay with me,
Sonomi.

273
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,623
It was fun,
like playing hide and seek.

274
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,152
Putting out tea
and preparing cookies

275
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:18,961
without Sakura seeing me.

276
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,692
My great-granddaughter

277
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:23,159
seemed very happy.

278
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:26,167
I am glad I got to meet her.

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,634
Fujitaka Kinomoto
seems to be a good man.

280
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:32,302
He is the man Nadeshiko chose.

281
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,655
I wonder if Sakura
wanted to show me this rainbow.

282
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:51,328
But I wonder
how she knew there would be a rainbow.

283
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:57,899
I wonder if he saw the rainbow.

284
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,000
Ah, there is somebody there.

285
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,545
Where did you go off to?
It’s time to leave.

286
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:13,943
To the old man’s place.

287
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,482
Welcome back.

288
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,553
Ah, I’m sorry.
I’ll clean up right away.

289
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:20,857
Did you finish your business?

290
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,590
Yeah, I said goodbye to the old man.

291
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,563
Old man, she says.

292
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,063
But who’s summer house is that?

293
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,828
Long ago,

294
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,704
a young girl and her grandfather

295
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:39,944
would go together to that house.
