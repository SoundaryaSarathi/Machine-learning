<i>[Episode 47]</i>

3
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,335
By the decree of the Heavenly Lord

4
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:23,388
I've come to invite High God Zhe Yan
to the Nine Heavens to save a person.

5
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:26,400
The Medicine King has always been
in charge of healing in the Nine Heavens.

6
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,367
Why would the Heavenly Lord send
such a formal decree to invite you over?

7
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,908
It sounds serious.

8
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,848
It must be that no medicine is effective

9
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,787
and the Medicine King
is at his wits' end.

10
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,931
Could it be Prince Ye Hua again?

11
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:54,269
Who knew that you'd use up all your
cultivation just to make the elixir?

12
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,306
It's no wonder that
the Heavenly Lord would sent for me.

13
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,306
You were lucky.

14
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:06,395
If even a couple more hours had passed,
even I wouldn't be able to save you.

15
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,260
Have you given the elixir to Qian Qian?

16
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,540
I have.

17
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,224
That's good then.

18
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:21,151
What's good about that?

19
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:23,282
Look at you!

20
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,699
As the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe

21
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,966
not only have you lost an arm, but
you also used up all your cultivation.

22
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:33,644
If you still wish to inherit
the position of Heavenly Lord

23
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,289
who knows when you'll be fit enough

24
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,790
to withstand all the
sacred blazes and thunderbolts?

25
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,558
None of that matters.

26
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:43,733
Yes, nothing matters anymore.

27
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,347
What matters is that
little fox on your mind.

28
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,042
She'll be able to revive her mentor

29
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,866
without knowing anything, right?

30
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,986
Why don't I see that son of yours around?

31
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:02,419
His father nearly died but
he isn't even crying by your bedside?

32
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,483
I raised A-Li all on my own.

33
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,290
However, I'm terribly
scared to see him cry.

34
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,562
Right after I returned to the palace

35
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:14,623
I had someone take him to the assembly
at Sacred Mountain to avoid seeing me.

36
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:19,687
Indeed, you're both
a father and a mother.

37
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,084
That's not an easy task.

38
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,189
Not easy at all!

39
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,156
Emissary.

40
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:53,817
You're awake?

41
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,548
You're now almost cured.

42
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:06,062
You've been by my side
all these days while I was in coma?

43
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,958
Do you still feel unwell?

44
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:15,505
I wonder if you still remember
the announcement that my father posted?

45
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:16,689
I do.

46
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,596
It says that whoever cures Your Highness
can marry into the West Sea as a consort.

47
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:24,346
I didn't consent to that announcement
when my father posted it.

48
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,535
Although you are very beautiful...

49
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,889
You are not my type.

50
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:36,762
Are you really feeling well now?

51
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,658
You've been looking after me
without getting any rest.

52
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,115
I'm very grateful to you.

53
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:44,589
If the maids hadn't informed me

54
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,062
I wouldn't have noticed
your feelings for me.

55
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,882
I've only read about such scenarios
in plays that Die Feng brought me.

56
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:55,509
Who would have known a story that
only exists in plays would happen to us?

57
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,033
I heard from the maids that the
Crown Prince was here to visit you.

58
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,088
Apparently, he's interested in you.

59
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:06,197
Why would you still devote
yourself to me?

60
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,341
You're right.

61
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:12,632
Why should I devote myself to you?

62
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,375
How... How dare you!

63
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,137
What made you so happy?

64
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,312
Senior, don't tease me.

65
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:54,298
Do you know what your brother
just said to me

66
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,581
for looking after him around the clock?

67
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:57,906
What did he say?

68
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:04,677
He's very grateful to me but
he also turned down my affection.

69
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,836
My older brother has never
been in love before.

70
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,007
You look at him is
as if you're looking at Master.

71
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,733
It's no wonder that
he misunderstood you.

72
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:14,057
If you find it uncomfortable,
just leave him to me.

73
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:16,737
He's awake now,
so he's already all right.

74
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,392
That's good.

75
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:20,103
I'll leave him to you then.

76
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,295
I just took his pulse.

77
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:23,512
It's very stable.

78
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:26,017
Use soul-tracking magic
on him later to check

79
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:30,533
if Zhe Yan's celestial power is really
steady and how Master is doing.

80
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,651
Sure.

81
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,555
I'll leave now.

82
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:44,857
What's wrong?

83
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,500
Is there a problem with Master's spirit?

84
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,779
Come with me.

85
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,083
- Second Prince.
- Keep watch out here.

86
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,867
- Let no one in to disturb us.
- Yes.

87
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,045
Go on.

88
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,954
I've already cast a spell
on my brother.

89
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,620
He's fast asleep.

90
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,899
You can use soul-tracking magic
on him lightly and you'll see.

91
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,807
<i>When I last came in here</i>

92
00:08:57,807 --> 00:09:01,049
<i>there was only Die Yong's frail
celestial aura guarding Master.</i>

93
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:05,725
<i>Yet now, this aura nursing
Master is so powerful</i>

94
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,537
<i>that I can't even get near him.</i>

95
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,825
<i>Such a strong celestial aura
must have come from</i>

96
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:12,032
<i>tens of thousands of years
of cultivation.</i>

97
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:15,298
<i>It seems that Master will soon wake up.</i>

98
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:20,557
<i>However, this celestial aura nursing
Master is not that of Zhe Yan's.</i>

99
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:25,419
<i>This power is fierce but steady,
calm and yet majestic...</i>

100
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,883
<i>This is...</i>

101
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,477
<i>Ye Hua?</i>

102
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,057
I've known the Crown Prince for years.

103
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:58,096
That's surely his celestial aura.

104
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,707
It's no wonder that Zhe Yan seemed
so hesitant when he came over.

105
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:11,529
He wasn't injured at all because
he never went to Yingzhou.

106
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,333
Why would he keep this from me?

107
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:18,469
Seventeenth, don't panic.

108
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,346
The Crown Prince is very powerful.

109
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,818
He must be worried that
you might not accept his elixir

110
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,657
so he had Zhe Yan bring it to you.

111
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,609
What happened?

112
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:50,168
Your Highness is fine now.

113
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:53,288
You won't need me around anymore.

114
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:57,812
Please inform the Water King
that I have urgent matters to handle.

115
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,774
I'll return to the Peach Tree Woods.

116
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,563
Emissary.

117
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:23,783
High God, what brings you to the
Celestial Palace in such a hurry?

118
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,201
I'm here to visit Crown Prince Ye Hua.

119
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,583
Please wait here, High God.

120
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,229
Allow me to inform Xiwu Palace.

121
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,869
When you see High God Bai Qian,
you're not to say a word.

122
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,735
Even if she keeps asking questions

123
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:02,811
you're only allowed to tell her that
I've been busy with official matters.

124
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,004
Yes.

125
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,278
I remember this celestial maid.

126
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,753
Do you serve in the Crown Prince's study?

127
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,595
How has your master been?

128
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:37,875
What is he doing now?

129
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,653
His Highness has been doing well.

130
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:40,899
He was discussing matters

131
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,423
with the Star Lords
of Calamity, Conflict, and Relationship.

132
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:46,104
Now, he's awaiting your arrival
in his study.

133
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,398
<i>He just lost tens of
thousands of years of cultivation</i>

134
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,392
<i>but he's already sitting in
his study discussing official issues?</i>

135
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,091
<i>That's too fast a recovery.</i>

136
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,780
<i>However, it means that
he's now feeling well.</i>

137
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,673
You're here?

138
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:13,542
Have a seat.

139
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:36,357
What is this?

140
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:43,812
A couple of hours ago
I used soul-tracking magic

141
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,874
on the eldest prince
of the West Sea's spirit

142
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:51,222
but I was distracted and
threw up some blood.

143
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,706
I know that you're focused on
looking after Mo Yuan

144
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,904
but you should also
take care of yourself.

145
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:01,654
If Mo Yuan wakes up and you're passed out
won't that be wrong?

146
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:09,256
What do you think I saw
in the prince's spirit?

147
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,327
Mo Yuan?

148
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:27,408
Can you tell me what
those four mythical beasts

149
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,441
guarding the divine fungal grass
look like?

150
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,591
You created that elixir
that Zhe Yan gave me, didn't you?

151
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:43,889
How much cultivation have you got left?

152
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,153
All right, I did make it.

153
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,818
Some time ago, the Heavenly Lord sent me
to the Eastern Sea.

154
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,519
When I went past Yingzhou

155
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,254
I remembered that
you needed the divine fungal grass

156
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:06,914
so I got you a few blades.

157
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:14,339
As for those four beasts,
they don't look pretty.

158
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,452
If they had looked prettier

159
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,658
I'd have captured one for you

160
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:24,072
so that you could tame it
and keep it for entertainment.

161
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:26,889
You happen to have
quite a lot of time on your hands.

162
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,126
You make it sound as if it was nothing.

163
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,418
I still remember that when
my father returned from Yingzhou

164
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,524
he was severely wounded.

165
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,922
How much cultivation did you
use up for that elixir?

166
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:56,096
Why did you make Zhe Yan keep this
from me when he brought me the elixir?

167
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:00,500
Is that so?

168
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,429
Zhe Yan didn't tell you
that I created that elixir?

169
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,625
I shouldn't have entrusted
this matter to him.

170
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,129
He took all the credit.

171
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,341
Don't worry.

172
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:26,004
I was born with more
cultivation than most deities.

173
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:29,148
The Heavenly Lord also transferred
quite a lot of his to me once.

174
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,072
It was a breeze for me
to make the elixir.

175
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,025
It's nothing serious.

176
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,254
I saw that you've been
using your left hand

177
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,025
to pour tea and hold your tea cup today.

178
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,836
Shouldn't you move your right hand?

179
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,548
I was too careless.

180
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,556
When I was retrieving the
divine fungal grass

181
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:03,058
I was bitten by the beast, Taowu.

182
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,117
It's not serious at all.

183
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,915
The Medicine King took a look at it.

184
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,676
I will recover in a few months.

185
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,073
<i>Ye Hua, I've been around
for so many years.</i>

186
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,163
<i>I know that you're making things up.</i>

187
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,782
<i>But I also know that you lying
so that I won't feel bad...</i>

188
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,449
Since that's the case, I'm relieved now.

189
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:41,863
Qian Qian, what is there to worry about?

190
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:44,678
However, the eldest prince
of the West Sea

191
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:47,491
took that elixir some time ago.

192
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:50,015
His condition might be unstable.

193
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,917
Yet you choose to come to the
Nine Heavens at such a time.

194
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,126
Things could go wrong.

195
00:17:56,448 --> 00:18:00,480
<i>He might not be able to
put on this strong front for too long...</i>

196
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,278
You're right.

197
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:13,528
I'd better get going.

198
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,607
Recuperate well.

199
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,654
Zhen! Have you seen Zhe Yan?

200
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,544
Zhe Yan is working in
the Peach Tree Woods.

201
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,204
I heard that he's overwhelmed by
a guilty conscience these days.

202
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:12,336
He hasn't done anything
like that for years

203
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:15,403
so now that he did
he feels particularly guilty.

204
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,961
He has to keep himself busy
in the woods to feel better.

205
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,243
What exactly happened?

206
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:30,800
Can you explain it to me clearly?

207
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,651
I'm really anxious right now.

208
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:38,862
Can you not even tell me a bit about it?

209
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,834
Just a bit would do.

210
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,599
If you won't tell me,
I'm really going to leave.

211
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,977
I'm really leaving.

212
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,536
I'm going now!

213
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,178
Your Highness!

214
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,202
Why have you left your bed?

215
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:20,811
High God Zhe Yan said that
you still need to rest.

216
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:23,375
It's best that you don't leave the bed
or move around.

217
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:37,326
Although your husband is young,
he's a very prudent planner.

218
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:41,311
He had you keep a close eye on the
Soul-gathering Lamp for three nights

219
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:45,010
while he reported to the Heavenly Lord
how it is against the celestial law

220
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,036
for divine fungal grass
to exist in Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

221
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,843
He listed a great many reasons.

222
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:53,496
He asked the Heavenly Lord
to send him to Yingzhou

223
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,776
to destroy all the divine fungal grass.

224
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:59,130
The Heavenly Lord read his report
and believed his reasoning.

225
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,278
He agreed to his request.

226
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:03,837
But when Ye Hua returned severely wounded

227
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:07,943
he thought that his grandson ended up
in such a bad shape

228
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:11,411
because of those four mythical beasts
guarding the divine fungal grass.

229
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,667
He regretted having overestimated
his grandson's ability

230
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:17,240
and not sending more men to assist him.

231
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,242
It's because of the report that the
Heavenly Lord would never have thought

232
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:26,026
that Ye Hua ended up
in this predicament for your sake.

233
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,630
Tell me.

234
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,838
Did he not plan this all out
very meticulously?

235
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,356
No wonder before he left for the West Sea

236
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,804
he kept reminding me
to watch over the prince

237
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:37,771
for three nights
without leaving his side.

238
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:42,603
I wondered why such a quiet man
had suddenly become such a nag.

239
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:47,771
He was actually trying to make me
stay in the West Sea

240
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,838
while he went to Yingzhou alone.

241
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:53,286
Don't worry, I've applied medication
on his wounds.

242
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,713
He only needs to recuperate well.

243
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,452
It's just that his arm is gone.

244
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,099
It's not exactly gone.

245
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,634
Look at that fake arm I've made him.

246
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,838
It might not be working now but
after tens of thousands of years

247
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,798
it might be cultivated enough
to become functional.

248
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:12,540
Why is he so silly?

249
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:15,404
He regards himself as
your future husband.

250
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:16,967
Whatever kindness you owe Mo Yuan

251
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,500
he's willing to repay him for you
as much as he can.

252
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,170
He even told me to keep it from you
because he knows you too well.

253
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,723
He's afraid once you know that the elixir
used up most of his cultivation

254
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,105
you surely won't use it.

255
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:36,553
Although he hasn't been with me for
a long time, he does know me very well.

256
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,811
He does know you very well.

257
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:42,723
Some matters can only be resolved
if you understand.

258
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,866
What is it that I don't understand?

259
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,442
He kept it from me.

260
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,686
Exactly.

261
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:50,019
You're never that attentive.

262
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,604
Who knew that you'd find out?

263
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:57,259
But I'm very impressed by
Ye Hua's responsible attitude.

264
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,036
He has a very tough personality.

265
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:04,911
At 70,000 years old
he slayed the four beasts all together.

266
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,935
He has very promising future.

267
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:12,799
It's just that his elite
cultivation is all gone.

268
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,153
What a pity.

269
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,018
I knew it.

270
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,922
Taowu is a very persistent
and ferocious beast.

271
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:22,772
Once it sinks its teeth into something

272
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:26,127
it won't let go until it swallows
all the flesh and bones.

273
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:28,851
He claimed that
it was just a small injury.

274
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:33,449
It has already come to that.
Just let him recuperate.

275
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,711
There's nothing you can do
even if you're worried.

276
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:37,832
Why don't you get some rest here?

277
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,301
I should stay by his side.

278
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,808
What can you do for him
even if you go there now?

279
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:50,175
You can only stay by his side.

280
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,917
Even if it means nothing

281
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:57,337
I still want go to him right away
and stay by his side.

282
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,578
He was afraid that
you would react like this.

283
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:02,635
Won't that mean it was a waste of effort
to keep this matter from you?

284
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,336
Don't worry.

285
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:12,157
If he means to keep me
in the dark, I'll just act ignorant.

286
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,355
If so, go ahead and keep him company.

287
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,952
I still have some elixirs for enhancing
the spirit and essence.

288
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:20,490
Take them with you.

289
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,477
Why are you staring at me like that?

290
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:00,205
I... I think that
you look nice like this.

291
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:07,221
Aren't you taking care of the
eldest prince of the West Sea?

292
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:10,268
Why have you slipped out to come
to see me in the middle of the night?

293
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,819
Has something bad happened
to that prince?

294
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:17,951
Die Yong is fine.

295
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:22,118
I've already wrapped up that matter.

296
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:26,323
I just thought of your injured arm.

297
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,419
It might not be easy for you
to pour tea or hold a cup.

298
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,105
So I came to look after you.

299
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,299
Qian Qian.

300
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,921
Come here.

301
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:51,701
That's not a good idea.

302
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:56,554
I'd better squeeze in with Riceball.

303
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:01,949
You should get some rest tonight
and I'll visit you tomorrow.

304
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,243
Now that I have only one arm

305
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:13,231
you can push me away
if you aren't willing.

306
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,561
Can I take up half of your bed tonight?

307
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:33,605
This body of yours won't
take up half of my bed.

308
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:03,459
Would you like to sleep on the edge
without a blanket tonight?

309
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:07,021
Or would you prefer to lie in
my arms under the blanket?

310
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:23,734
We can both sleep on the edge
under the blanket.

311
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,755
That is a good idea.

312
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,329
You already know about it all?

313
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,951
You are as you have always been.

314
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,792
You don't like to owe any favors.

315
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:00,147
I don't like to owe anyone favors.

316
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,999
Are you asleep?

317
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:16,017
I'm asleep.

318
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:07,869
Grand Ziming Palace is really
an inauspicious place.

319
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:13,771
Someone noble died a few days ago
and now even the Ghost Queen is dead...

320
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,798
Why has the water turned red?

321
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:31,683
Old Ghost Lord!

322
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,067
This is old Ghost Lord's crimson cloud!

323
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,743
Crimson hellfire!

324
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:00,506
Yan Zhi!

325
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:05,660
What happened to you?

326
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,916
Why doesn't it work even after
I've poured in my cultivation?

327
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:12,201
Don't be silly.

328
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:15,156
It's against celestial law
to create an elixir in the Ghost Realm.

329
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:17,288
Fortunately, your cultivation is
still quite low

330
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,055
so the impact isn't as severe.

331
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,608
This elixir is half finished.

332
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,951
Brother Li Jing...

333
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:33,608
Do we have to go to the Celestial Realm
to create the elixir?

334
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:43,740
In all realms, only Mo Yuan's elixir
cauldron could absorb the evil aura.

335
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,758
Do you think his disciples in Kunlun
Mountain would allow you to use it?

336
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,415
Even if we have reconciled
with the Celestial Realm

337
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:52,551
the past grudges between
Father and Mo Yuan still exist.

338
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:54,362
Don't get your hopes up.

339
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:58,775
No, since it's possible to do it
in Kunlun Mountain, I'll go there.

340
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:00,920
Quit fooling around!

341
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,445
No! Brother Li Jing!

342
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,388
I have to go to Kunlun Mountain!

343
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:06,853
Guards!

344
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:10,090
My Lord.

345
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,295
The princess needs to get some rest.

346
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:14,165
Without my permission

347
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:18,280
no one is allowed to enter, nor is
the princess allowed to leave freely.

348
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
- Yes!
- Yes!

349
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,078
My Lord!

350
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:31,828
Ruoshui River suddenly turned red
and crimson clouds filled the sky.

351
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:33,628
Crimson hellfire is visible
in the distance.

352
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,832
It's a sign that the old
Ghost Lord is coming back!

353
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:56,838
Have you heard?

354
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,383
The old Ghost Lord is coming back.

355
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:00,086
The Ghost Realm is going to change soon.

356
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:01,585
I've already heard that.

357
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:04,127
I wonder if it's true this time?

358
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,576
If it is, is the Ghost Realm going
to make a come back?

359
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:09,855
Keep it down.You might get killed.

360
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:11,565
Let's go.

361
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:23,242
High God Bai Qian snuck into
Zichen Hall?

362
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:25,583
Your Highness, it's true.

363
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:29,114
When the Crown Prince went to bed,
she wasn't in the hall yet.

364
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,512
But when the maids went
to light up the lamps

365
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:36,094
we heard that high god
whispering to His Highness.

366
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:38,869
I didn't dare to linger,
so I left the room.

367
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:43,431
You must watch her
very closely day and night.

368
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,967
Report back to me often.

369
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,465
Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,155
Xin Nu, don't you think

371
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,998
that this high god has little regard
for the Celestial Tribe's rules?

372
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:05,315
The last time she was here
she only stayed in Xiwu Palace.

373
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:09,949
Not once did she visit the Heavenly Lord,
Eldest Prince, and Consort Le Xu.

374
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,085
Then she just left.

375
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:16,159
This time, she just showed up.

376
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:26,293
Your Highness, I think that
she looks down on you.

377
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:30,385
Yes, she does belittle me.

378
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:33,617
When she preached to me the other day

379
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:36,704
didn't she say that as
High God Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

380
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:41,820
even the Crown Prince should
greet her as a superior in seniority?

381
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,251
How could she say that?

382
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:51,692
If the Crown Prince is beneath her,
why would a side consort like me matter?

383
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,835
What should we do?

384
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:58,284
She hasn't even married His Highness yet
and she already belittles you so.

385
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:05,990
Won't Your Highness have a hard time
after she marries into the palace?

386
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:13,766
Ever since she came here
I've tackled her openly and underhandedly

387
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:16,226
but she's had me at a disadvantage.

388
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,927
Be it sending you to Qing Qiu
to question her decency

389
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,512
or getting Yuan Zhen drunk, or
sending Miao Qing to seduce His Highness

390
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:25,224
none of that put her at a disadvantage.

391
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:30,027
I didn't even succeed in driving
a wedge between her and the Crown Prince.

392
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:33,811
She's really hard to tackle.

393
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:46,235
However, I've discovered
her ultimate weakness.

394
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,362
What has Your Highness discovered?

395
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:53,387
She and I share the same weakness.

396
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:56,632
We're both truly in love
with the Crown Prince.

397
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,543
My weakness will be her weakness.

398
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,019
When I get the chance
I'll talk to her about Su Su.

399
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,001
You're awake?

400
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,996
Did you sleep well?

401
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:31,666
I definitely slept well with you
by my side.

402
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,094
What about you?

403
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:38,784
I miss Riceball.

404
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,630
There's an assembly at Sacred Mountain.

405
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,175
The Lord of Numinous Treasures is at
the assembly as a speaker.

406
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:47,539
Cheng Yu has taken A-Li there
for some fun.

407
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,688
I've sent Jia Yun to fetch him.

408
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:52,121
He should be back tomorrow.

409
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:55,835
Riceball is still so young.

410
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,818
Aren't you afraid that he'll be bored?

411
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,753
A-Li only went there for the sugar cane.

412
00:38:01,753 --> 00:38:03,807
Besides, Cheng Yu is there with him.

413
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:05,893
Do you think that he'll be bored?

414
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,306
As A-Li's father,
you've really impressed me.

415
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,340
Why would you say that?

416
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:20,740
You sent him to Sacred Mountain so that
he wouldn't see you so badly injured.

417
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:09,342
These sugar canes should be
enough to feed Mother.

418
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:11,985
Exactly...

419
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,545
This is wearing me out...

420
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,851
Is that Lord Dong Hua and
the Lord of Numinous Treasures?

421
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,289
Quickly... Hurry up, A-Li.

422
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,623
Quickly. Come here.

423
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,971
Quickly.

424
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:35,409
The ancient gods have all
met various heavenly calamities

425
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,923
and fallen into the realm of nothingness.

426
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:41,070
Not many are left now.

427
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:47,297
Lord Dong Hua, have you experienced
such a calamity already?

428
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,153
I should say so.

429
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,552
The punishment of one's heart.

430
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,601
Cheng Yu, what's wrong?

431
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:22,021
Why aren't you happy after
eavesdropping on Lord Dong Hua?

432
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,032
Do you know what it means
to experience a destined calamity?

433
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:28,527
It means to overcome a calamity.

434
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,657
Don't all deities have to
overcome heavenly trials?

435
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:35,525
Father said that none of the born deities
made any effort to gain their statuses.

436
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:38,155
Hence, they should overcome trials
and get struck by lightning

437
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:39,213
so as to be fair.

438
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,884
If they overcome them well,
they can be promoted.

439
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,579
If they don't, they will be vanquished.

440
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:46,661
No...

441
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,429
Experiencing a destined calamity
is much scarier than overcoming one.

442
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,967
Judging by the
Lord of Numinous Treasures' tone

443
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:57,353
Lord Dong Hua might be
in danger this time.

444
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:58,724
He's in danger?

445
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:02,400
Not many of the ancient gods
who experience

446
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,692
their destined heavenly calamity
are able to overcome it.

447
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:07,594
Or should I say that to experience
the destined heavenly calamity

448
00:41:07,594 --> 00:41:09,742
is to be thrown into
the realm of nothingness?

449
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:11,391
The realm of nothingness?

450
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:14,023
Death? Will Lord Dong Hua die?

451
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:18,568
Didn't Lord Dong Hua say that he is
to experience such a destined calamity?

452
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:23,777
I thought that a god like Lord Dong Hua
would surely live forever.

453
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:28,103
Even the Heavenly Father has to
experience his calamity.

454
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:32,148
<i>I must inform Princess Feng Jiu quickly.</i>

455
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:34,492
Mother is a high god as well.

456
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,384
She will have to experience her destined
calamity some day. What then?

457
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,757
As days go by, time goes by.

458
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:47,003
It's the same for everyone.

459
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:50,981
Little Prince, you should treat your
mother well while there's still time.

460
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:53,302
Yes, quickly. Let's head back to
the Celestial Palace now.

461
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,077
I have to ask Father
to take me to Mother.

462
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:56,280
Yes, let's go.

463
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:09,762
