174
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,985

-[Brock] Huh?

177
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,284

178
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,578
[Brock]
What are you doing here?

179
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,580
Aren't you happy to see us?

180
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,914
[Mankey chattering]

181
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,166
[all] Hmm? Huh?

182
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,126
[James] Hmm? Huh.

183
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,045
Buzz off! [grunts]

184
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,505
I wish he hadn't done that.

185
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,507
Still trying to capture Pikachu?

186
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,302
[Jessie]
We just want to borrow it. Permanently.

187
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,095
Your situation is hopeless.

188
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,931
-Hand Pikachu over or else...
-Or else what?

189
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,893
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation...

190
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,854
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation...

191
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,315
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

192
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,567
To extend our reach to the stars above...

193
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,319
Jessie.

194
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,279
James.

195
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,199
Team Rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

196
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,285
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

197
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,746
Meowth! That's right.

198
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm having a major hat crisis.

199
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,709
Could you try to steal Pikachu
some other time?

200
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,169
Now's the perfect time.

201
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,838
You're obviously too pooped
to protect your Pikachu.

202
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,467
If you guys don't get out of here fast,
you're going to get as whipped as Ash did.

203
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,178
-By who?
-By Mankey.

204
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,721
What's a Mankey?

205
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,681
I guess that thing
I kicked out of the way.

206
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,141

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,762
Ha. This fur ball? That's ridiculous.

216
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,097
Now, let's capture Pikachu.

217
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,434
-Go, Ekans.
-And go, Koffing.

Ekans. Koffing. Never mind Pikachu.

230
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,220
Get that Primeape!

231
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,972
But we came for Pikachu.

232
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,725
Team Rocket always puts beauty
before duty.

Pikachu.

[growling and grunting]

Don't look at it in the eye, Pikachu!

247
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,565
-It's got my hat!
-And it never sent in one postcard.

Now what'll we do?

255
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,710
That attack made it even madder.

256
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,505
Wait a minute. I have a theory.

257
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,715
Primeape's not trying to steal your hat.

258
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,842
-[both] Huh?
-It's scared of us.

259
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,970
When it was a Mankey,
you tried to capture it.

260
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,388
Then James kicked it.

261
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,932
I think it took your hat
so it could get a little attention.

262
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,685
-Because it's lonely all by itself.
-Be careful.

Just forget the hat.

It's not that. It's because
I want to be a Pokémon master.

<i>until its opponent falls.</i>

352
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,474
All right!
I didn't know it had that kind of power.

353
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,226
Charmander, go!

354
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,227
Mander!

355
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,482
[both growl and grunt]

356
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,610
Char!

357
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,572
Char!

358
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,825
Pika? Pikachu!

359
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,954
Burn now, Charmander.
Flamethrower attack!

360
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,373
Char!

361
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,333
Pika.

362
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,506
Hey, Pikachu!

363
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,220
Char!

364
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:40,101
[grunting]

365
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,106
Good work, Charmander.
I'll take over now.

366
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,024
Poké Ball, go.

367
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,415
Yes.

368
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,500
Huh?

369
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:17,888
[laughs] All right!
Primeape is mine.

370
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,641
-You did it!
-Congratulations!

371
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,227
-Chu.
-Thanks a lot, Pikachu.

372
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,396
-[Jessie] Don't forget us.
-[all] Huh?

373
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,149
[all groaning] 

374
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,651
So it's the whole gang.

375
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,363
It's your fault we ended up in here.
Where's Primeape?

376
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,700
Well, why don't you just see for yourself?
[chuckles]

377
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,410
[all] Huh?

378
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,247
[Mankey growls]
[all scream]

379
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:47,627
[grunting]

380
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,717
[all] Looks Like Team Rocket's
blasting off again!

381
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,511
[grunting]

382
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,014
Primeape sure gave them a thrashing.

383
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,309
Well, at least now Primeape's
doing the thrashing on our side.

384
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,019
Welcome to the team, Primeape.

385
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,772
[groans]
Primeape's good at thrashing,

386
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,982
but it's got a lot to learn
about team spirit.

387
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,819
-A hat might help.
-Better start sending in postcards.

388
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,114
I'll do whatever it takes
to become a Pokémon master.

389
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,951
Charmander, Primeape, return.

390
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,331
-Pikachu! Pika!
-What is it?

391
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,999
[all gasp] 

392
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,043
[Brock] There's Celadon City.

393
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,256
You know,
if Primeape hadn't chased us,

394
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,592
we wouldn't have gotten here
as fast as we did.

395
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,845
-Right, Brock?
-Yeah, I guess it was lucky after all.

396
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,305
Pika, pika.

397
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,099
Way to go, Primeape.

398
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,268
Now that I caught a new Pokémon,
it's time to earn a badge.
