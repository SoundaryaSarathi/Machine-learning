1
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,629
What?! Really?!

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,199
We have just received information

3
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:08,968
that Rei's Grandpa has turned
into a monster.

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,705
No way! Then will Rei also
become a monster?!

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:16,300
Anyone who turns my favorite Grandpa
and Rei into monsters...

6
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:19,468
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,873
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

8
00:00:54,873 --> 00:01:01,335
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

10
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

11
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:22,291
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

12
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

13
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,773
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

14
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:42,713
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,665
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

17
00:01:56,036 --> 00:02:01,668
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of
love and justice, Sailor Moon.

18
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:04,444
But it's not easy, you know.

19
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:07,414
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

20
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:09,382
before the bad guys get it,

21
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:14,046
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

22
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:18,725
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

23
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,522
so it'll work out somehow.

24
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:31,669
Grandpa Goes Crazy, Rei's in Jeopardy

25
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,952
Oh, what a beautiful moon!

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,189
On a night like this,

27
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,454
some moon-gazing dumplings and
a cup of sake would be great.

28
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:58,098
Who are you?!

29
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:59,565
Zoi!

30
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,168
An evil aura...

31
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,701
So, this old man is one of the Seven
Monsters, just as I thought.

32
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:26,622
Be patient, I will take the rainbow
crystal out of your body soon.

33
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,025
Damn evil spirit!

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,198
Now, it is time to come back
to life, monster Jijii!

35
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,110
You!

36
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,481
I thought you were just
a decrepit old man,

37
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,616
but that wasn't bad!

38
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,083
Zoi!

39
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:59,990
What?! Hey, stop it!
I'm not raw garbage!

40
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:02,694
Grandpa!

41
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,298
Phobos?! Deimos?!

42
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,195
Are you okay? What in
the world happened?

43
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,241
What the heck? Talk about noisy.

44
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,708
Who are you?!

45
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,559
My... My name is Yuichiro Kumada!

46
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,187
Please, make me your apprentice!

47
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:37,763
What?

48
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,503
Inside this old man's body,

49
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:45,801
the rainbow crystal has
begun to awaken.

50
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:47,540
Just you wait,

51
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,974
I will make sure to take the
rainbow crystal soon.

52
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:55,982
Hikawa Shrine

53
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:59,719
Hikawa Shrine
What? Your Grandpa's acting weird?

54
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,453
Hikawa Shrine
Yeah.

55
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:01,181
Yeah.

56
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,236
Yuichiro, follow me!

57
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:21,841
What?! Do I have to do
something like this?!

58
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,410
Yes, Sir!

59
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,503
Okay, then!

60
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,026
Is this how I should be
spending my youth?

61
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:43,162
I'm out.

62
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:44,831
Oh!

63
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,500
Come on, wake up!

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,967
Grandpa, what's going on?!

65
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,871
Grandpa, you look cute in that!

66
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,361
Stop it!

67
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:59,979
You stupid, clumsy slowpoke!
You're a disgrace to this shrine!

68
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,081
Who is he?

69
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:04,684
He is Yuichiro Kumada. He became
an apprentice to Grandpa.

70
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:06,151
Oh, wow.

71
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,423
Yuichiro, are you okay?

72
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:11,890
Oh...

73
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,495
Miss Rei, you look wonderful
in a uniform, too.

74
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:19,199
Did you hit your head or something?
How could you, Grandpa?!

75
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,069
Shut up! Training to become
a Shinto priest is tough!

76
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,338
You can't do it with a soft attitude!

77
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:28,205
Training is all about mental strength!

78
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,347
What am I to do?!

79
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:35,715
The only person who'll take
over the shrine is you,

80
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:38,946
my granddaughter! I am so alone!

81
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,389
See? He's become emotionally
unstable these days.

82
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,380
It's weird!

83
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,094
No, it is not weird!

84
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:50,654
It is only natural that the
training is tough!

85
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:55,031
I will do it! I will endure
any kind of training!

86
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:03,643
All right! You totally fell for it!

87
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,110
Grandpa!

88
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,411
Usagi!

89
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:08,948
Wasn't that fun?!

90
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,117
Yeah, I love this kind of stuff!

91
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:14,484
You're the only one who
understands my jokes!

92
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,085
Grandpa! Enough is enough!

93
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,128
Excuse me, but if you're
concerned about me...

94
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:23,686
You be quiet!

95
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,597
But...

96
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:25,398
Shut up!
But...

97
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:26,266
Shut up!
Yes, Ma'am!

98
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:26,499
Yes, Ma'am!

99
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,201
If you keep doing these stupid things,

100
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,805
everyone's trust in our miracle-working
shrine will be destroyed!

101
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:34,574
Now, now, you shouldn't be
so uptight all the time.

102
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,943
You have to have a little
sense of fun!

103
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:38,511
That's right!

104
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,648
Usagi, this is our shrine's problem.

105
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,843
So, keep your nose out of it.

106
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,622
Rei's being mean to me!

107
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,659
Usagi, don't cry over
such a little thing.

108
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,360
But... But...

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,431
And you, too, Rei. You didn't have
to shove Usagi like that.

110
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,166
Rei, you meanie!

111
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,770
Rei! Honestly! If this is how
everyone's going to be,

112
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,573
I'll be better off studying
at cram school! Bye!

113
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,409
I think I'll going to kung-fu training.

114
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,276
What?

115
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:10,577
What's with them?! They won't even
seriously discuss the problem!
What?

116
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:13,913
What's with them?! They won't even
seriously discuss the problem!

117
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:15,114
Do whatever you want!

118
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:16,216
Excuse me, Miss Rei...

119
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:16,883
Shut up!

120
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:17,717
Yes, Ma'am!
Shut up!

121
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:18,342
Yes, Ma'am!

122
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,212
So, what did you want to talk about?

123
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:25,692
About my Master...

124
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,855
Oh, please! Grandpa is no master!

125
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,629
The weather changes easily
in the autumn.

126
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,567
What?

127
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,103
The biorhythm of the mind and
body tend to become

128
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:39,138
disturbed more easily...

129
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:41,040
What are you trying to say?

130
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,743
I'm saying that once the weather
returns to normal,

131
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,439
Master's emotions may
also settle down.

132
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,782
Perhaps it would be better
to give him some time

133
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:51,113
and watch how things go.

134
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:54,954
Was it something I said?

135
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:55,555
Thanks!
Was it something I said?

136
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:56,122
Thanks!

137
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:59,058
You seem like you'll be more
dependable than you look.

138
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,593
What?!

139
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:04,597
Girl friends are no good. They say,
they're your friends,

140
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:07,725
but when you really need them,
they're so uncaring.

141
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,839
Rei looks like she's doing
pretty good over there.

142
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,210
Okay! Usagi's going
to be their cupid!

143
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,112
Usagi, stick your nose in where
it doesn't belong,

144
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:21,014
and she'll hate you even more.

145
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:24,973
Are you kidding?! This is my chance
to patch things up with Rei.

146
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,044
As usual, she gets hung up on
her own ideas so easily.

147
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,922
Ta-da!

148
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,859
Oh, Usagi!

149
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,851
You shouldn't use the transforming
pen for something like this!

150
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:42,257
Moon Power! Turn me into
a fortune-teller of love!

151
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,944
It's perfect!

152
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,750
Oh, she's just hopeless!

153
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,308
Ahem!

154
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,222
Just sit there and let me do my job,
for an accurate fortune.

155
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:08,524
I'm a wandering fortune-teller of love!

156
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:12,065
I shall now tell your fortune.

157
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:13,532
What?!

158
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,441
Oh, boy!

159
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:33,953
If the two of you kiss right now,
your love will come true!

160
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,555
Oh, no...

161
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,989
Kiss?!

162
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,693
This is ridiculous! Let's go!

163
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,461
Yes, Ma'am!

164
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,195
Oh, no, it didn't work.
Yes, Ma'am!

165
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,856
Oh, no, it didn't work.

166
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:50,336
Just what are you trying
to do, Usagi?!

167
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,138
Oops! You knew?

168
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:56,342
If you recall, I have Mamoru!
Don't do anything funny!

169
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,970
I am really never talking
to you again!

170
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,405
Never talk...

171
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:05,014
See? I told you so.

172
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,591
I made Rei mad again.

173
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,168
Cheer up.

174
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:25,271
Rei gets mad easily, but she
also forgets easily.

175
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:28,074
By tomorrow she'll be friends
with you again.

176
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:30,977
But she said she'd never
talk to me again!

177
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:32,912
She just said that in anger

178
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,745
because you pulled that weird stunt!

179
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,919
Oh, this rice cake filled with sweet
bean jam filling is delicious!

180
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,789
I can't think about rice cakes
at a time like this.

181
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,257
It's really delicious!

182
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:53,800
This really is yummy!

183
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,267
Right?

184
00:11:57,603 --> 00:12:00,470
Oh, I know! I'll take
some to Rei, too!

185
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,201
I'll make it up to Rei with
these tasty rice cakes!

186
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:08,281
It's a good idea!

187
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:11,944
Are you sure? I think you'll just end
up making her mad again.

188
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,221
Don't worry, everything
will be okey-dokey!

189
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,815
You know, you really shouldn't!

190
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:21,920
Usagi is just so thick headed.

191
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:49,256
Training! Training! Training!

192
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,816
Miss Rei, I'll do my best!

193
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,327
Thanks.

194
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,698
Training!

195
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:11,678
Say, Phobos, Deimos, what
do you guys think?

196
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,247
Training! Training!
Say, Phobos, Deimos, what
do you guys think?

197
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:15,482
Say, Phobos, Deimos, what
do you guys think?

198
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:15,782
I won't give up!

199
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:16,984
I won't give up!
Is Grandpa really acting weird
because of the weather?

200
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:17,484
Is Grandpa really acting weird
because of the weather?

201
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:18,986
Training! Training!
Is Grandpa really acting weird
because of the weather?

202
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,681
Is Grandpa really acting weird
because of the weather?

203
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,688
Training... Ouch!

204
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,593
So, you have appeared
again, evil spirit!

205
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,802
Tonight, I will be taking
that rainbow crystal.

206
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:40,439
Zoi!

207
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,071
What is this?! The aura
of an evil spirit!

208
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:55,721
Zoi!

209
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:00,653
It's time for you to give up.

210
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,336
The rainbow crystal is mine.

211
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:20,980
You're...

212
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:22,815
Tuxedo Mask!

213
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,879
I will be taking that!

214
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:28,516
Monster Jijii! Do away
with Tuxedo Mask!

215
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,131
This is...

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,467
Jijii!

217
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:44,670
Jijii!

218
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,514
Tuxedo Mask, you shall fall
prey to the monster Jijii!

219
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:55,015
Stop!

220
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:55,949
Jijii!
Stop!

221
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:56,415
Jijii!

222
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,218
Zoisite! You coward! Fight me!

223
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,357
Jijii!

224
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,530
A monster!

225
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,997
Jijii!

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,867
Jijii!

227
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,537
Shoot! I've lost sight of him!

228
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:25,608
Tuxedo Mask. It's too bad, but
this rainbow crystal is mine.

229
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,783
Miss Rei, there's a monster
in the shrine!

230
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:31,018
Oh! Don't look!

231
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,485
I saw her!

232
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,921
This is no time to be worrying
about that!

233
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:36,356
I do worry, okay?!

234
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:38,085
We have to hurry and run!

235
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,163
Jijii!

236
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,332
What's wrong? Oh! A monster!

237
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,466
Jijii!

238
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:48,802
What's a monster doing here?!

239
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,269
Jijii!

240
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,072
Jijii!

241
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:58,744
Yuichiro!

242
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:00,813
Jijii!

243
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,617
Please run, quickly!

244
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:04,785
Yuichiro!

245
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:07,583
If it's for you, Miss Rei,
I won't mind dying!

246
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,157
Jijii!

247
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:10,691
Why you!
Jijii!

248
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:12,056
Why you!

249
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,560
Miss Rei, please run!

250
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,232
Yuichiro!

251
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:28,201
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai,
Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!

252
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,309
Jijii!

253
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,679
Rei!

254
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:37,139
Grandpa?! That monster is Grandpa?

255
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:39,152
Jijii!

256
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,822
What in the world happened
to you, Grandpa?!

257
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:42,889
Jijii!

258
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,224
Grandpa...

259
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,691
Jijii!

260
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,530
Jijii!

261
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,225
Wait!

262
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,071
Jijii!

263
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,576
Grandpa, please wake up!

264
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:06,113
I'm your beloved granddaughter, Rei!

265
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:07,381
Jijii!

266
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,082
Usually, in situations like this,

267
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:12,386
he'll awaken to the little bit of
human heart left in him,

268
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,855
and he should hesitate to attack.

269
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,322
Jijii!

270
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,858
Grandpa!

271
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:22,963
Jijii!

272
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:23,797
This isn't a usual situation!
Jijii!

273
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,098
This isn't a usual situation!

274
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,565
Jijii!

275
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:31,704
Stop right there!

276
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:36,836
I won't forgive you for being mean
to my dear friend, Rei!

277
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:40,569
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

278
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:16,346
I'm a sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

279
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:21,586
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

280
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,589
Jijii!

281
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:25,586
Thanks, you saved me!

282
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,227
It's okay, you don't need
to thank me.

283
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:30,397
By the way, these rice cakes
are yummy! Try one!

284
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:34,968
You're such a dummy! This is no
time to be eating rice cakes!

285
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:37,801
Oh, right. Okay!

286
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:42,242
Wait! That monster is my grandpa!

287
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:46,406
What?! No way! That's Grandpa?!

288
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:50,817
I get it! His sudden personality change

289
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,686
was a symptom of this!

290
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,153
Jijii!

291
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,586
What do we do now?!

292
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,291
Jijii!

293
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:00,994
Jijii!

294
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:03,656
Rei, do something!

295
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:08,134
The monster's my favorite Grandpa!
I don't know what to do!

296
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:12,105
Rei, use the talisman! Immobilize
the monster with the talisman!

297
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:13,440
Jijii!

298
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,907
Okay!

299
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,245
Wake up already, Grandpa!

300
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,408
Be gone, evil spirit!

301
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,252
Sailor Moon, now! Hurry!

302
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:27,652
Jijii!

303
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,519
Grandpa! Please go back
to being a good boy!

304
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:36,753
Moon Healing Escalation!

305
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,699
Refresh!

306
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,509
Grandpa!

307
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,081
I'm glad.

308
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:57,950
Yeah.

309
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:00,954
Oh, Mako.

310
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:01,922
Hikawa Shrine
Oh, Mako.

311
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:04,424
Hikawa Shrine
Hey, what are you doing here so late?

312
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:08,528
Well, Rei and Usagi split up
after fighting, right?

313
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,861
So, I thought I'd talk to Rei about
patching things up with her.

314
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,097
Oh, you, too?

315
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,603
What?! Then, you, too?

316
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:20,562
Female friendships tend to break
easily once cracked,

317
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:24,077
so I thought they should repair
things while it's still early.

318
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,544
Yes!

319
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:30,817
You're right!

320
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,519
These rice cakes with sweet bean
jam filling are delicious!

321
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,653
Aren't they, though?!

322
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:37,257
But where did that weird monster go?

323
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,692
Weird monster?

324
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:41,684
I can't believe you, Grandpa!
Don't you remember anything?

325
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,392
There's no such things as
monsters! Right, Usagi?

326
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:50,036
Yuichiro, are you sure you weren't
half-asleep and dreaming?

327
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:51,104
I bet you were!

328
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:54,307
I don't know. It didn't
seem like a dream.

329
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:54,874
Uh-oh!
I don't know. It didn't
seem like a dream.

330
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:55,342
Uh-oh!

331
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,333
Well, it doesn't matter.

332
00:20:58,678 --> 00:21:00,145
Yuichiro...

333
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,314
What?

334
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:01,982
You seem like a stupid slowpoke,
What?

335
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:04,384
You seem like a stupid slowpoke,

336
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,614
but you're actually brave
and kind, aren't you?

337
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,359
This is youth! I'm living my youth
to the maximum right now!

338
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:18,832
Rei, have you fallen in
love with Yuichiro?

339
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:20,800
Don't be ridiculous! That's not it!

340
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,902
Grandpa's always yelling at him,

341
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:25,472
so I just felt sorry for him and
kissed him as consolation!

342
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:26,806
How sweet!

343
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:28,408
You've got the wrong idea!

344
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:31,969
Rei! I won't let you marry
the likes of Yuichiro!

345
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,414
Marriage! Marriage!

346
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:35,949
Don't say such weird things!

347
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:37,317
Marriage?!

348
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,148
Don't even think about it!

349
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,720
Stop right there!

350
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,755
What?

351
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:42,847
What's going on?

352
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:46,192
It's sure nice. Rei's getting married!

353
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,659
I am not!

354
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:56,870
Rei and Usagi are back to
being friends again.

355
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,134
It looks like there was nothing
to worry about.

356
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,473
You can't get married!

357
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,509
Hiru ni wa hana no kaori
