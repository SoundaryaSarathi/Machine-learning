00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:19,010
A <i>Ki</i>! There's another unknown <i>Ki</i>
coming this way from over there!

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,672
Hide! Gohan! Bulma-<i>san</i>!

3
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,082
W- what, now?

4
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,750
Come on, hurry!

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,684
What in the world is it?

6
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:33,091
I'm always impressed by how
you guys know these things.

7
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:36,761
Shh! Keep quiet.
It's coming this way.

8
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,098
Could we have been discovered?

9
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,360
I don't know.

10
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:55,374
They're here!

11
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,520
T- they're gone.

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,091
Thank goodness. It looks like those
people weren't coming after us, huh?

13
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,686
B- but, what exactly
was that about just now?

14
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,532
What's the matter with you guys?

15
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:00,378
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, could you check
something with the Dragon Radar?

16
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,047
W- what?

17
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:07,719
W- when you examined it before,
there were four Dragon Balls together, right?

18
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,055
What are they doing now?

19
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,489
All right, I'll check.

20
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:18,063
All four of them are moving.
Which means...

21
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:23,735
R- right, no doubt about it. Those guys
just now had the four Dragon Balls with them.

22
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,071
I- I knew it.

23
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,405
You don't say.

24
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:28,497
Gohan!

25
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:30,833
Gohan!

26
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,078
Yes?

27
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:37,415
Gohan, did you see him? The weird one,
flying second from the front?

28
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:41,753
Yes. I sensed an incredible
power from him.

29
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:46,424
The moment I saw him, I froze.

30
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:51,763
That guy might be even more
ridiculously powerful than Vegeta.

31
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:54,699
I- it looked like there were
some other amazing guys in there,

32
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,435
but that guy was in
a whole different league.

33
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:00,705
Stronger than Vegeta?
It couldn't be! Just who is he?

34
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:04,709
I- I don't know, but I think
he's one of Vegeta's pals.

35
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,046
They were all wearing
the same kind of outfits.

36
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:13,651
Dammit! How are we supposed to get
the Dragon Balls away from those guys!?

37
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,320
H- hey, look at this.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,391
That group just now is heading
toward another Dragon Ball.

39
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,394
What's going on?
Do they have radar, too?

40
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,729
What's the location?

41
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,832
About 14 kilometers
in that direction.

42
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:32,737
That's where we sensed that <i>Ki</i>
Kuririn-<i>san</i> said could be Namekians!

43
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:37,409
I'm going to go over there
and see what's going on.

44
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,743
I'm going with you!

45
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,836
J- just a minute, now!

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,083
Are you planning on
leaving me here all by myself!?

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,753
It's a lot safer staying here
than moving around carelessly.

48
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,423
W- when you put it
that way, you're right.

49
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:56,428
Okay then, I'll put up a house with my
Capsules inside this cave and wait for you.

50
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,363
Okay, please do.

51
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,698
Come back soon, okay?

52
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,536
Remember, Gohan, keep your <i>Ki</i>
as suppressed as you can, but hurry.

53
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,703
You can do that, right?

54
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,704
Yes.

55
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,693
All right!

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,381
They're gone. I wonder
if they'll really be okay.

57
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,316
Oh, that's right!
I need to contact Earth!

58
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,659
Oh, okay, okay, okay...

59
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:49,180
Hello? Oh, Bulma... Yeah,
I was just heading to the hospital...

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,841
What?

61
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,793
Doctor, can't I have
your permission to train yet?

62
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:03,795
Are you still goin' on about that!?

63
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:07,465
I told you, bed rest is the best
thing for you right now.

64
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:12,470
If I don't start training soon,
my body is going to go soft.

65
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,472
How are you doing, Goku?

66
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,473
Old Timer!

67
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:21,145
Oh, Doctor, hello there.
Uh, is Chichi around, too?

68
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,815
Does me bein' here make
things inconvenient for you?

69
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,477
Oh, no, no, no,
I wouldn't say that...

70
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,157
I'm goin' to go do some laundry.

71
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:35,660
Ah, thank goodness.

72
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,824
As it happens, I just received
a message from Bulma and the others.

73
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,834
Not again!

74
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:47,839
Oh, my, no, what a naughty hand!
Sorry 'bout that.

75
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,841
So, are Gohan and them okay?

76
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:55,179
Ah, they did indeed arrive
on Planet Namek safely. However,

77
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:59,117
Gohan and the others weren't the only
ones who went to Planet Namek.

78
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:02,787
That Saiyan, Vegeta,
has gone there, too.

79
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,123
Vegeta!? He's there!?

80
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:08,626
That's not all.
In addition to Vegeta,

81
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,130
there are dozens of his buddies
there on Planet Namek.

82
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,632
Those guys wrecked the
spaceship they went there in,

83
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:17,468
so they can't get back to Earth.

84
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:18,970
W- what!?

85
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,809
What's more, at least one of them has a <i>Ki</i>
that's even greater than Vegeta's.

86
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:29,303
That can't be... Someone with a <i>Ki</i>
even greater than Vegeta?

87
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,823
Hey, you still alive?

88
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,159
What's this? After I went to all
the trouble of comin' here,

89
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,827
ya don't look to happy to see me.

90
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:46,831
The senzu beans're finally ready.
There's just a few of 'em, though.

91
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,501
But Karin-<i>sama</i> said
to take all seven of 'em.

92
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:55,173
Wow, all right! That's what you call
good timing! Hurry and let me have one!

93
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,109
N- now look, you, you can't go
giving strange foods to patients!

94
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:59,838
Here ya go.

95
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,531
I've been waiting for this moment!

96
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,533
Here it is, here it is. Kaio-<i>sama</i>
sent this new gi to me for just this day.

97
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,814
All right! I'm off to Planet Namek!

98
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:40,151
Oh, thanks. I'm taking
the rest of the senzu with me.

99
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:44,489
H- how are you planning
to get to Planet Namek?

100
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,558
When Bulma's daddy came
to visit me here earlier,

101
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:52,163
I asked him to make me
a spaceship, just in case.

102
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:55,500
A spaceship? You mean
like Kami-<i>sama</i>'s?

103
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,403
That one was made from stuff
that ain't found on Earth,

104
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:01,105
so even Bulma's daddy
said he couldn't do that.

105
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,441
Well, then-?

106
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,910
When I thought hard about it,

107
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,782
I realized there were still two
Saiyan spaceships here on Earth.

108
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,184
The spaceship that my
brother came here in,

109
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:17,121
and the spaceship that I myself
came to Earth in as a kid.

110
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,457
T- that's right!

111
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:25,129
I had Bulma's daddy go looking for them,
and while my brother's was blown up,

112
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,766
mine was from long ago,
so it was still all right.

113
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,803
I'm having him repair and rebuild it.

114
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,138
Kinto Un!!

115
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,368
Okay, I'll be back later.

116
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,709
Um...

117
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,707
I'm off to Bulma's house!

118
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,821
Ah! Goku-<i>sa</i>!

119
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,881
Hey! Where are you goin'!?

120
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,891
Goku-<i>sa</i>!!

121
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,838
So, where's he going?

122
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,329
Hmm, well, as it turns out...

123
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:15,513
With things's bad as you're saying
they are, what's that guy so happy for?

124
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:21,519
I guess it has to be his Saiyan blood.
Of course, he wants to save everyone,

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,858
but more than anything, he seems thrilled
to be able to fight someone so strong.

126
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:32,196
That guy sure ain't normal, all right.
I can't take being around him.

127
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,867
Idiot. It's obvious he's got
zero chance of winning.

128
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:42,033
<i>l can't believe it. How could there be</i>
<i>anyone even more incredible than Vegeta?</i>

129
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:10,168
Gohan, your <i>Ki</i> is a little too strong.
Suppress it a little more.

130
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,157
Right.

131
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,022
Huh?

132
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:41,199
Goku-<i>chan</i>!

133
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,201
Ah, Bulma's mommy.

134
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,871
Oh, my, are you all better now?

135
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:49,540
As fit as you see me.

136
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,877
By the way, is the reconstruction
on the spaceship that I asked for finished?

137
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:58,149
Well, I'm not sure. It looked like
he was still working on something.

138
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,820
He ain't done yet?
That's a problem...

139
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,051
It's in the inner yard.
Let's go there.

140
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:12,830
You know, I never thought that little
Goku-<i>chan</i> would grow up to be so handsome.

141
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,499
Say, let's date sometime, okay, okay?

142
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:20,504
I- I have to beat that Saiyan
before I can do that...

143
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,506
You're so busy, aren't you?

144
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:26,510
Oh, right, I discovered this terribly
delicious cake shop not long ago,

145
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,180
and it's all thanks to you, Goku-<i>chan</i>.
If the earth had been lost,

146
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,183
I wouldn't have been able to eat
any of it. Thank goodness for that.

147
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:34,518
I guess so.

148
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:39,857
Dear, Goku-<i>chan</i> is here!

149
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:42,526
I- is this...

150
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:45,029
...my spaceship?

151
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,691
It's huge!

152
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,873
Oh, Goku, you're better already?

153
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:59,210
Yeah, thanks to a senzu.
This is mine, right?

154
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,145
Is it true it ain't finished yet?

155
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:05,483
Yeah, there's still a little bit
left on it. Well, come on in and see.

156
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:08,486
Okay, I'll go get us
something to drink.

157
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:09,817
Thanks.

158
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:18,496
This is incredible! I'm surprised
that teeny spaceship has become this.

159
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:22,166
Nothing to it.
Everything is as you ordered.

160
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,170
I can train just fine like this.

161
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,508
I took great pains. It was
hard to find your spaceship.

162
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,177
It was broken into
little pieces, you know.

163
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,846
Still, lucky for us,

164
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:39,183
the important parts were left intact,
but I had to rebuild most of it.

165
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,186
My spaceship was in pieces!?

166
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:45,856
That's strange. I wonder if
I busted it when I was a kid.

167
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:51,195
You know, this Saiyan science
is absolutely amazing.

168
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:56,200
Huh? Um, where is the artificial
gravity device thing?

169
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,803
Oh, this is it over here.

170
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,806
Wow, this thing, huh?

171
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,474
Let's see, this is the switch.

172
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,376
This is the controller.

173
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:10,481
As you ordered, it can generate
at most 100 Gs worth of gravity,

174
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:13,150
but even for you,
isn't that a bit reckless?

175
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,823
At 100 Gs, after all, if you weigh
60 kilos, that will become 6000 kilos.

176
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:21,826
That's six tons. Ordinarily,
that would kill you.

177
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,996
That's okay. If I don't train
someplace like that,

178
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:27,498
I won't be able to beat that Saiyan.

179
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:30,167
So, can't this thing fly yet?

180
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,504
It can fly anywhere you want to.
Even to the ends of the universe.

181
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,506
Huh? Then...

182
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:40,177
Uh, the bathroom, kitchen
and bedroom are down that ladder...

183
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,847
Say, then what still ain't done yet?

184
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:47,184
I can't quite settle on the placement
for the stereo speakers.

185
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:49,854
As long as you're listening to it,
you want it to sound good, don't you?

186
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:54,191
T- that's all!? When you say it ain't
finished, is that all you mean!?

187
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,861
" Is that all?"

188
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:00,695
When you consider reverberations
and everything, it's quite difficult.

189
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:07,471
I- I don't care where the stereo is placed!
I'm in a hurry here! I'll leave right now!

190
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,473
What are you in such a rush for?

191
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,967
We got a message from Bulma,
and anyhow, I just have to hurry!

192
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,816
Tell me how to make
this thing fly, quickly!

193
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,153
All right. Now, you're sure about
the placement of the stereo?

194
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,154
Uh-huh!

195
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:28,826
The data has all been input. All you have
to do is give the switch a little boi-oing,

196
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,829
and six days later, you will
arrive on Planet Namek.

197
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,994
Six days? I can get there
in just six days? That's awesome!

198
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,172
Is it true that Goku is here!?

199
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,843
Yes. He's looking at the spaceship
in the inner yard right now.

200
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,674
Huh?

201
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:07,526
Let's see... after that
comes this button, right?

202
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:29,650
Ho, for as hurriedly
as I put that together...

203
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:34,492
...it actually flew.

204
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:37,325
Huh? Where's Goku?

205
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:41,161
He left in a hurry.

206
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,326
I wonder if he's really
okay with the stereo...

207
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:55,179
Close... we're close. Cut your <i>Ki</i>
completely. Let's walk our way in.

208
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,510
Right.

209
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,122
They're on the other
side of that bluff.

210
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,621
What an incredible <i>Ki</i>!

211
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,809
This is bad! We've come up
right in front of them!

212
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,144
Let's move around
to the other side.

213
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:28,475
Right.

214
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:47,498
Those houses are just like
the spaceship that we came here in.

215
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:51,835
What are they doing?
Those other guys aside,

216
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:56,840
those three- especially the one in
the middle, riding in that round vehicle-

217
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,443
each have a terrifyingly strong <i>Ki</i>.

218
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:01,172
I can tell.

219
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:07,851
Look at what the two guys on
either side have in their hands!

220
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:09,453
They're Dragon Balls!

221
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,013
H- huge Dragon Balls...

222
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:21,131
Is something the matter, Dodoria-<i>san</i>?

223
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:25,803
No, there was just a slight power
reading coming from that cliff.

224
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:30,866
It is gone now, though. It must
have been a small animal or insect.

225
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:42,214
Y- yikes, yikes!
They very nearly spotted us!

226
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:49,159
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, we have
only found five of them.

227
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:52,830
The remaining others appear
to be out at the moment.

228
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,062
Get out here, now,
unless you want to die!

229
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:10,114
He looks just like Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

230
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,674
T- they're Namekians!

231
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,701
Wow, this certainly is fast.

232
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:42,146
Outer space sure is dark, huh? Or maybe
it's just nighttime out here right now.

233
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:45,816
Well, never mind. I've got
to start training right away.

234
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:48,152
I'm glad it's only going to
take six days to get there,

235
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:52,489
but I've got to surpass
that Vegeta guy before then, too.

236
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:53,891
Let's see, as I remember,

237
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:57,494
Kaio-<i>sama</i> said that his world
had 10-times gravity, didn't he?

238
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:01,396
For the time being, I guess I should
get used to around 20 times.

239
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,683
It's working, all right!

240
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:28,192
<i>At last, Goku had</i>
<i>blasted off into space.</i>

241
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:32,863
<i>However, the Dragon Balls were falling</i>
<i>into Freeza's hands, one after the next.</i>

242
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:37,698
<i>ls Goku's power</i>
<i>about to be unleashed?</i>

243
