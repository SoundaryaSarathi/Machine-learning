<i>[Episode 46]</i>

4
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,566
I have to get some proper rest.

5
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,043
Don't disturb me again.

6
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,913
<i>Master's soul is gathered.</i>

<i>I just need to get myself ready

<i>I just have to keep this
from Senior or else</i>

10
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:37,965
<i>the other disciples will fight
to retrieve the grass.</i>

11
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,887
<i>Who could it be?</i>

12
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,210
<i>It's Senior.</i>

13
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,931
I'm exhausted. Could you not
let me sleep for two days?

14
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,762
Someone is here to see you.

15
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,800
Who is it?

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,296
Tell him that I can't
leave the room. He can come in.

17
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,558
Are you sure?

18
00:02:58,558 --> 00:02:59,724
Yes.

19
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,084
Please come in!

20
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:07,270
Fifth Sister.

21
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,731
Greetings to Second Brother.

22
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,027
You've been safeguarding
High God Mo Yuan's spirit.

23
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,186
Don't stand on such ceremony.

24
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,752
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

25
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,281
I'll make the long story short.

26
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:30,764
I've heard from Water King of West Sea
that whoever cures the eldest prince

27
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,645
his or her daughter could marry
into the Crystal Palace.

28
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,682
That is true.

29
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,772
High God Bai Yi, you mean to...

30
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,903
What do you think of my daughter?

31
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,556
That little girl?

32
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:52,270
She might be a bit young but
her mother also married young.

33
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:59,038
Even if I'm willing
Bai Qian wouldn't consent to it?

34
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:05,461
I just think that the age difference
between them is a bit too much.

35
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,412
Moreover, I'm not a unromantic man.

36
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,639
How about this?

37
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,765
High God, why don't I take you
to my older brother?

38
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:13,927
How about that?

39
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:18,199
What's that? Did you just
refuse to marry my daughter?

40
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,747
I wouldn't dare. Die Feng wouldn't dare.

41
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,036
Brother Bai Yi...

42
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:27,052
I understand that you'd like
Xiao Jiu to forget about...

43
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,196
That romance.

44
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:34,185
But it isn't such a good idea
to force a marriage upon her either.

45
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:37,432
As Feng Jiu's aunt, do you have
a better method to make her

46
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,879
forget about that Lord Dong Hua
in the Nine Heavens?

47
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,990
I...

48
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,353
Do you or do you not have a plan?

49
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,233
Yes! I do have one.

50
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,310
Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu is of
such a prestigious status.

51
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,786
Once she gets to the right age
and announces to the public

52
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,432
there will be matchmakers coming
from all of the realms.

53
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:04,860
Between me and my brother, one isn't
romantic and the other is still ill.

54
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,338
Neither of us is the best choice.

55
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:10,081
Instead, why don't we let young men
that are her age propose to her?

56
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:12,386
Am I right, High God Bai Yi?

57
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,480
That does make sense.

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,892
Without further ado,
let's start from the West Sea.

59
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,449
What are we starting with?

60
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,290
Start collecting visiting cards.

61
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,399
I don't believe that

62
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,937
there isn't any outstanding young men
of her age in all the realms?

63
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,211
Yes, indeed.

64
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,016
Have a good chat, gentlemen.

65
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,550
I'm really sleepy.

66
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,247
I have to sleep now.

67
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:42,435
I won't be able to keep you company.

68
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,521
High God, let's discuss this outside.

69
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:48,206
- This way, please.
- Sure.

70
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,185
<i>Xiao Jiu, no one in Qing Qiu's Bai Family
would dare offend your father.</i>

71
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,937
<i>You just have to make do with
whichever young man</i>

72
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:03,415
<i>that might be to your liking...</i>

73
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:06,285
Your Majesty, the weather is
so nice today.

74
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,053
Why don't I take you to
the Imperial Garden for a stroll?

75
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:47,754
Has Your Lordship heard about the news?

76
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,228
Qing Qiu has announced that

77
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:53,072
Little Princess Bai Feng Jiu
has come of age

78
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,860
and they are now seeking
marriage proposals from all realms.

79
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,538
High God Bai Yi is in such a rush to
marry Little Princess off.

80
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:02,735
He is already accepting
visiting cards from West Sea

81
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,281
before she makes it back to Qing Qiu.

82
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,254
What are you trying to say?

83
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,971
It's just a casual chat.

84
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:16,809
After all, Little Princess was
once a friend to Your Lordship.

85
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,474
Send this to the West Sea.

86
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:42,465
The West Sea?

87
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:45,172
When did Your Lordship become
friends with Water King of West Sea?

88
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:48,451
Didn't you say that
Bai Feng Jiu is in West Sea?

89
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,614
Your Lordship means
to hand this to Little Princess?

90
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:55,426
Exactly.

91
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:59,298
May I ask what is in here?

92
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:03,676
Then I'd know what to say
when I hand it to her.

93
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,741
You can take a look.

94
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:13,360
- Just these?
- Just those.

95
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:17,857
Is there any message you would
like me to pass on to Little Princess?

96
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,544
Just tell her that...

97
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,692
She saved me once in the Mortal Realm.

98
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,774
Our debts are now cleared.

99
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,494
I have no use of those things anymore.

100
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:33,312
Give them back to her as
a keepsake of our encounter.

101
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,542
That's all?

102
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,538
What else do you think there is to it?

103
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:42,741
I wouldn't dare speculate
what you have on your mind.

104
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:44,869
I'll get it done now.

105
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,677
Auntie, why would my father
still come after me

106
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,105
after I hid out here in West Sea?

107
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,677
You'd better succumb to fate.

108
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,407
It's better to accept proposal gifts
from talented young men

109
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:19,135
of all realms here
in this beautiful garden

110
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,325
than to marry my senior?

111
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,066
That's true.

112
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,691
Auntie. Little Princess...

113
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,241
This is made from the scales of

114
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,654
Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea's
mythical beast, Qiong Qi.

115
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,094
It's just a small gift.

116
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:42,322
Please don't mind it, Little Princess.

117
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,302
What's special about Yingzhou
of the Eastern Sea?

118
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,178
My grandfather has been to
the Eastern Sea as well

119
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:51,793
and he even brought back
the divine fungal grass.

120
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:52,883
Indeed.

121
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:55,152
Fox King Bai Zhi is truly
the emperor of Five Far Lands.

122
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:57,100
He fought against
the four mythical beasts alone

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,696
and took the divine fungal grass.
He's an inspiration to us all.

124
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,263
None is a match for him.

125
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,859
What about Lord Dong Hua?

126
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:03,924
His Lordship?

127
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,163
Old Lord Dong Hua is...

128
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,520
Is he old?

129
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,626
Not at all!

130
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,821
Although Lord Dong Hua was already around
during the old Heavenly Lord's reign

131
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,134
he still looks so young!

132
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,465
He's not old at all! Not at all!

133
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:18,010
This is made from Buddha's
mythical bird, the Roc Bird's feathers.

134
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,482
This is the Luminous Pearl of Chang Sea.

135
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:29,106
Leave your names behind in the front hall
so I know who sent these gifts.

136
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,721
Then I can have them returned.

137
00:11:40,403 --> 00:11:43,225
Little Princess has accepted
so many gifts. Could you return them all?

138
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,225
Star Lord.

139
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,649
Star Lord, you came at the right time.

140
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:47,767
Keep her company.

141
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:48,903
I'm going back to bed.

142
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:56,975
Star Lord, after seeing so many people
today, seeing your face just made my day.

143
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,091
Really?

144
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,447
Is my face that useful?

145
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,972
Tell me. Why have you
come to see me today?

146
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,229
Congratulations, Little Princess.

147
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:10,724
Although it took you 300 years
you finally repaid the kindness you owed.

148
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:14,538
Yes.

149
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,758
After I've repaid this kindness

150
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,335
I no longer have anything
to do with the Nine Heavens.

151
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:25,227
Star Lord, don't you usually watch
over the events of the Mortal Realm?

152
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,818
Why would you have the time
to visit me today?

153
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:34,745
Lord Dong Hua has ordered me
to bring these two items to you.

154
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:40,208
His Lordship said that you saved him
in the Mortal Realm, so you're now even.

155
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,625
He doesn't need these two items with him.

156
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:47,474
Therefore, he returns them to you
as a keepsake of your encounter.

157
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,225
Your Majesty needs only to remember
that I took this shot willingly for you.

158
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:19,248
I don't seek any reward in return

159
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:23,159
but to have Your Majesty
remember me always.

160
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,775
Forever. For all eternity.

161
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:31,982
For all eternity,
I'll never let you down.

162
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,619
I understand.

163
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:56,014
Star Lord had to deliver
worthless things as well.

164
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:02,840
His Lordship really is... insensitive.

165
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,179
<i>That day when we were on the run
there was a thunderstorm...</i>

166
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,128
<i>Was it Star Lord who made it
difficult for us?</i>

167
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,811
You're the princess of Qing Qiu,
not some common woman.

168
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:07,994
You should understand even if
I leave some words unsaid.

169
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,727
I understand.

170
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,557
The romance started in
the Mortal Realm and it ends there.

171
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:24,863
The romance started in
the Mortal Realm and it ends there.

172
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,571
That does sound good.

173
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,592
Your Lordship!

174
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,043
If the romance started in the
Mortal Realm and really ended there

175
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:47,056
what is Your Lordship
doing in this shabby hut?

176
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:50,386
What is it that you can't forget?

177
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,320
Do you still remember that
I took that shot for you?

178
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
What did I say then?

179
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:14,581
<i>Your Majesty needs only to remember
that I took this shot willingly for you.</i>

180
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:17,206
<i>I don't seek any reward in return</i>

181
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:20,250
<i>but to have Your Majesty
remember me always.</i>

182
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,980
<i>Forever. For all eternity.</i>

183
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,260
I do.

184
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,462
Your Lordship...

185
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,885
I came to the Mortal Realm
to take the heavenly trial.

186
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:37,591
And experience the sufferings
of the mortals.

187
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:43,272
Even if this is your trial of romance
it also counts as my heavenly trial.

188
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:48,870
Feng Jiu, you have to understand
that we aren't common mortals.

189
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,466
Flowers bloom and then wither.

190
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,278
All things come to an end.

191
00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:01,917
Holding on to it would only
bring you and the others pain.

192
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,965
Father.

193
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,905
I've come home.

194
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:41,204
I'll get ready to make you dinner.

195
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:42,659
Go ahead.

196
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,661
I'll take my leave.

197
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:14,518
You woke up at the right time.

198
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,375
I made you an arm.

199
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,846
Try and see if it fits?

200
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,676
I can't feel it.

201
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,977
It was very difficult to
make it look real.

202
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:53,957
Just keep it on for now.

203
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:58,520
Perhaps in a couple thousand years
it might be able to move.

204
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,214
Thank you, High God.

205
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:14,000
You really should thank me.

206
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,373
It took me great efforts to
treat your injuries.

207
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:17,663
I was terrified that

208
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,210
the Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe's
soul would vanish and die

209
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,390
here in Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

210
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,064
I would feel wronged.

211
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:30,115
You just woke up and you're already
pushing yourself so hard?

212
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,680
What day is it?

213
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,106
Is Qian Qian still in West Sea?

214
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,301
That's hard to say.

215
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:45,487
Die Feng told me
that you've instructed Qian Qian

216
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:48,901
to stay by the eldest prince of West Sea
for three full nights.

217
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,319
Not an hour is to be missed.

218
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,126
It's three full nights till this morning.

219
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,575
High God, have you seen my elixir?

220
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,236
It's right here.

221
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,092
That's good.

222
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:17,298
Please hand this elixir
over to Qian Qian for me.

223
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,817
However, please don't tell her
that it's from me.

224
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,721
I can give it to her.

225
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:32,509
But you have to tell me
where you get it.

226
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,132
My senior gave me an elixir
for mastering my training.

227
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:42,538
A few days ago, Heavenly Lord sent me to
Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea

228
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,230
to eliminate all divine fungal grass.

229
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,137
I kept a few blades to make an elixir
combined with the elixir from my senior.

230
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:50,213
High God Mo Yuan can have it.

231
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,339
You went to Yingzhou
for the divine fungal grass?

232
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:01,188
Fox King came back
with injuries all over him.

233
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:04,490
It's no wonder that you lost an arm.

234
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:08,244
I wouldn't have lost my arm

235
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:12,278
but the Ghost Lord Li Jing and his wife
were also in the cave.

236
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:15,780
The beast bit my arm off
when I was trying to save them.

237
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:19,057
Ghost Lord is after that grass as well?

238
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,761
You saved him in the cave?

239
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,693
That was quite unexpected.

240
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:31,974
That aside, you just told me
not to tell Qian Qian.

241
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,811
Since this elixir was given
by Lord of Numinous Treasures

242
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,770
why can't you tell Qian Qian?

243
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,284
She should thank you.

244
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:44,928
You should know that Qian Qian
doesn't like to owe any favors.

245
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,661
If she knows that the elixir is from me

246
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:52,144
she wouldn't be able to accept it happily
and focus on the treatment.

247
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:56,314
High God, you just have to say that
you attained the divine fungal grass

248
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,440
and used your cultivation to
create the elixir.

249
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,796
Qian Qian is keen on saving Mo Yuan
so she won't question it.

250
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,867
All right, I'll agree to it.

251
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,318
I won't be staying.

252
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:15,520
I still have to report back
to the Celestial Palace.

253
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,376
Crown Prince.

254
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:26,489
Have you ever thought that once
Mo Yuan's spirit returns to his body

255
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:31,518
the seal of the Bell of East Emperor
will break once he wakes up?

256
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,526
What will happen to
all lives in the realms?

257
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,705
If Qing Cang is to kill
all lives in the realms

258
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:45,212
someone who can subdue him
will surely appear.

259
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:49,699
70,000 years ago Mo Yuan sealed
him up with his spirit.

260
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,259
300 years ago Qian Qian
risked her life to do it again.

261
00:22:56,821 --> 00:23:02,036
Someone will also do it in the future.

262
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:15,692
Your Highness.

263
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,570
Let's go.

264
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,346
Why are you pulling me away?

266
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:29,971
I just want to tell him that
Qian Qian's feelings for him are real

267
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:32,332
so that they could bare their heart
to each other soon.

268
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:35,637
Flowers bloom and wither.

269
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:37,228
Everyone answers to their own actions.

270
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,313
This isn't something we can manipulate.

271
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,040
Crown Prince.

272
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,201
Jia Yun.

273
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,537
Present.

274
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,326
Go to Cheng Yu.

275
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,299
Tell her to take A-Li with her

276
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,759
to the assembly at Sacred Mountain
for a few days.

277
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,494
Just say that the sugar cane
in Sacred Mountain is delicious.

278
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,568
Take A-Li there to have some fun.

279
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:17,948
Sugar cane?

280
00:24:17,948 --> 00:24:19,597
Do it now.

281
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,582
Yes.

282
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:24,664
Tian Shu.

283
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:26,825
Present.

284
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,775
Report back to the Grand Hall for me.

285
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:31,680
Just say that I've destroyed all
the divine fungal grass

286
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,317
killed the four mythical beasts,
and sunk Yingzhou Island.

287
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:40,638
However, I've also used up
all of my cultivation doing so.

288
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:41,738
What?

289
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:43,278
Your energy...

290
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:46,788
Bear this in mind.

291
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:49,309
Do not mention that
I've been to Ten-mile...

292
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,397
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods...

293
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,580
Your Highness...

294
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,172
Father really agreed to this?

295
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,054
Yes, Little Prince.

296
00:25:11,054 --> 00:25:14,236
His Highness said that the sugar cane
on Sacred Mountain is the most delicious.

297
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:16,953
Little Prince can enjoy sugar cane
and have fun for a few days.

298
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:19,064
Is Father celebrating some occasion?

299
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:22,440
Why would he suddenly be so lenient
and allow me to go out to play alone?

300
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,000
What other happy occasion could it be?

301
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,844
It must be that your mother
is finally going to marry your father.

302
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:27,844
You're right!

303
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,865
The other day Third Great-uncle said that
my mother will soon marry my father.

304
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,068
Are you happy for me?

305
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:35,450
Definitely! I'm happy for you.

306
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,403
Little Prince, should we get going?

307
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,565
Speak up!

308
00:25:46,565 --> 00:25:48,126
What went wrong?

309
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,961
Crown Prince went to Yingzhou
of the Eastern Sea alone.

310
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,811
Not only did he kill
the four mythical beasts

311
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:55,084
but he sank Yingzhou and
destroyed the divine fungal grass.

312
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:57,983
It's also because of that
he has now used up all of his energy.

313
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:59,021
What?

314
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,496
Silly child.

315
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:30,642
Why would you go and destroy some
divine fungal grass for nothing?

316
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,421
You've now brought such
calamity upon yourself.

317
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,887
Where is Xiao Jiu?

318
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,922
Emissary.

319
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:09,261
You're finally awake.

320
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,193
What happened?

321
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:14,259
You've been asleep for so long.

322
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,525
High God Zhe Yan has been waiting
for you in the main hall for two days.

323
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:20,115
I've been asleep that long?

324
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,057
Zhe Yan!

325
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:39,201
Seeing how you are now
I suppose Mo Yuan's soul is repaired.

326
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,058
A few days ago, I had this elixir created

327
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,875
so I've brought it here for you
since you might be in need for it.

328
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:53,365
This is...

329
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,773
You used your powers to
create this elixir?

330
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,018
You actually knew that I planned to
transfer my power to my mentor?

331
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:09,797
Are you all right?

332
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,012
Are you hurt by the four mystical beasts

333
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:16,605
when you retrieved
the divine fungal grass?

334
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:21,855
When my father went to retrieve it,
he was injured.

335
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:29,825
You're actually going to transfer
power to Mo Yuan?

336
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,586
I hadn't thought of that.

337
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,363
I only had the elixir created
and brought it here to you.

338
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:41,780
You had singlehandedly sealed Qing Cang
up and used up most of your powers.

339
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,308
If you transfer your energy to
Mo Yuan and leave but a bit for yourself

340
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,170
it might be hard to call
yourself a High God.

341
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:59,931
Heavenly Father raised me and
I never had the chance to repay him.

342
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,678
I should at least offer some help.

343
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:07,327
However your friendship might be
with my mentor

344
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:11,326
I should still bow
to you for this elixir.

345
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:15,901
That's not necessary.

346
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,394
I have to go now.

347
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:21,183
When Die Yong feels better
get him to take this elixir.

348
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,733
However, he's too frail.

349
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:25,203
I wonder if he can withstand
the effect of this elixir.

350
00:29:25,203 --> 00:29:27,190
You'd better stay by his side
to look after him.

351
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,468
I understand.

352
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:42,223
What brought High God here?

353
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:43,958
Auntie hasn't returned yet.

354
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:47,023
No, I've just visited her in West Sea.

355
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:49,931
Are you here to see Fourth Uncle then?

356
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,973
Isn't he in the Peach Tree Woods?

357
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm here to see you.

358
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,492
You're here to see me?

359
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,316
I need you to take a trip
to the Ghost Realm.

360
00:29:58,316 --> 00:29:59,353
The Ghost Realm?

361
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:03,829
High God, you're not joking with me?

362
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,282
Do I look that bored to you?

363
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:19,056
Die Yong, this elixir is created with
thousands of years of cultivation.

364
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:20,556
There's the divine fungal grass in it.

365
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,502
But we're worried that
it could be too strong.

366
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,973
You should gather your power
around your heart to protect it.

367
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:28,505
I've been ill for 600 years.

368
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:29,976
What medicine haven't I taken?

369
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:31,314
Don't worry.

370
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:33,440
I'm not that fragile.

371
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:38,391
Mother, don't be so nervous.

372
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:42,251
I already feel much better these days.

373
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:45,953
After I overcome this last obstacle
I might be totally cured.

374
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,412
Die Yong...

375
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,269
Die Yong!

376
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,144
Yong'er...

377
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,296
This is...

378
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,648
Emissary, didn't you say that the final
treatment is the most crucial one?

379
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,220
Look at this. What are we to do now?

380
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,496
Don't worry.

381
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:24,952
High God Zhe Yan already
reminded me of this possible reaction.

382
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:28,428
This is because the prince has been ill
for hundreds of years

383
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,348
so his body became very frail.

384
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,538
He can't withstand such a strong elixir.

385
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:34,847
It's normal that he passed out.

386
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:39,397
Mother, don't worry.

387
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,223
High God Zhe Yan is renown
in the four seas for his medical skills.

388
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:45,968
Die Yong will wake up in no time.

389
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:08,124
Why are you out here alone
staring like that?

390
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:09,432
I'm scared.

391
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:10,478
You're scared?

392
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:11,518
Of what?

393
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,559
I'm scared that it might
all be for nothing.

394
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,944
I'm scared that Master won't return.

395
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,785
Ever since you disappeared with Master

396
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:30,209
I've been searching for you.
For 70,000 years.

397
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,875
Not once have I stopped
searching for you.

398
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,430
Seventeenth, listen.

399
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:41,451
It's already my biggest blessing to
have met you in West Sea.

400
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:48,497
As for Master, he's finally going to
take over Kunlun Mountain again

401
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:50,737
to be worshiped by all the deities.

402
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,525
Zi Lan, you already followed her
all the way here.

403
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:20,739
Now that she's safe and sound
you should stop following her.

404
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,588
I'm one step away from the Ghost Realm.

405
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,625
We're still on the celestial grounds.

406
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,668
Don't take another step forward.

407
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,253
Don't...

408
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,259
Don't go any further.

409
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:29,277
Second Senior.

410
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,255
Zi Lan?

411
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,507
Brat! You finally returned.

412
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:40,003
I'm a few days late.

413
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,804
By the way, you tricked me into
feeding your red-crowned crane

414
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:46,940
while you went searching for Seventeenth
in the Mortal Realm alone.

415
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:49,434
Where's Seventeenth?

416
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,351
I didn't find him.

417
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,262
If I had, would I return like this?

418
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:59,889
I'd surely make a fuss about it
and inform all realms.

419
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:07,588
Second Senior, on the way back here
I heard that Qing Qiu has announced

420
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,579
the coming of age of Bai Feng Jiu.

421
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:13,148
They are seeking marriage proposals.

422
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:15,063
Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu?

423
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,416
Her aunt is the future Heavenly Empress.

424
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,836
Who would dare marry her?

425
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:23,887
Even if you dare
she might not want to marry you.

426
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,472
Why don't you marry her then?

427
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:27,987
I wouldn't dare...

428
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:30,172
Second Senior, sweep the floor quickly.

429
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:32,360
I'll go tidy things up.

430
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:28,492
Brother Li Jing.

431
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,726
As a princess
I don't need my lifetime's cultivation.

432
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:37,762
However, you're the Ghost Lord.

433
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:40,054
You need to protect your people.

434
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:45,173
This child is after all
your flesh and blood.

435
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:49,737
Since the Crown Prince gave us
the divine fungal grass

436
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:54,811
I'll try to use my life's energy
to see if I can revive him.

437
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,161
Yan Zhi.

438
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:08,221
Transferring energy
can only be done by the Celestial Tribe.

439
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:14,221
If you go against the divine rules
do you know what the consequences are?

440
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:16,016
This is your only child.

441
00:38:16,016 --> 00:38:18,112
He's also my nephew.

442
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,248
How could I not even give it a try?

443
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,083
Brother Li Jing, trust me.

444
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,960
I will revive him.

445
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:50,389
My Lord, someone from Qing Qiu
is here to see you.

446
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:54,012
Qing Qiu?

447
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:57,614
Is it a woman?

448
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,527
My Lord, it's a man.

449
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,293
A man?

450
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:06,898
- Let him in.
- Yes.

451
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:18,987
Queen Bai Qian of Qing Qiu's minor deity
Mi Gu greets the Ghost Lord.

452
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,090
I wonder why your auntie sent you here?

453
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,400
My auntie didn't send me.

454
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,978
It's High God Zhe Yan.

455
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:27,347
High God Zhe Yan?

456
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:33,291
I've long heard of his name,
but not yet the honor of meeting him.

457
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:38,014
I wonder what message he has for me?

458
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:42,922
High God said that since Lord Ye Hua
saved you in Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea

459
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,570
you should repay his kindness.

460
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,432
Repay him?

461
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:50,920
Exactly. Repay his favor.

462
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,530
<i>Zhe Yan was right.</i>

463
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,072
<i>This eldest prince couldn't withstand
the power of the elixir.</i>

464
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,385
<i>This won't do.</i>

465
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:09,313
<i>I have to head back
to the woods to ask that old phoenix</i>

466
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:11,840
<i>how to bring that Die Yong
out of coma again.</i>

467
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:19,500
Emissary, someone who claims to
be from Qing Qiu asked to see you.

468
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,686
Qing Qiu?

469
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:30,527
Auntie!

470
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,083
Mi Gu?

471
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,159
What are you doing here?

472
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,989
I'm here to deliver this to you.

473
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,248
Soul jade?

474
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:42,699
Why would you have it?

475
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,813
A few days ago
High God Zhe Yan came to see me.

476
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:47,994
He sent me to the Ghost Realm's
Grand Ziming Palace

477
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:50,103
to ask the Ghost Lord for this soul jade.

478
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,242
Zhe Yan?

479
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:56,838
Why would Zhe Yan send you to
the Ghost Realm to retrieve this for me?

480
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,047
How did he know that Li Jing would
hand it over to you to bring to West Sea?

481
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:05,231
High God only said that
you have nothing to worry about.

482
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:08,385
He knows that you dislike owing favors

483
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,521
so this soul jade isn't given to you
as a favor.

484
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:15,603
A few days ago, the Ghost Lord was
rescued by the Crown Prince.

485
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:18,505
Auntie is the Crown Prince's future wife

486
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:21,840
so it's only right that he repays
the favor to Qing Qiu.

487
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:25,025
When did Ye Hua rescue Li Jing?

488
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,684
I don't know about that.

489
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:32,036
I'm just following High God's orders
to pass this message on to you.

490
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,251
Forget it. I won't get an answer
out of you anyway.

491
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:39,052
Once this prince wakes up
I'll go and ask Zhe Yan about it.

492
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:41,614
By the way, Auntie!

493
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:43,744
There's one more message!

494
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:47,760
High God Zhe Yan said that
the powers on elixir are too strong

495
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,965
so the prince might not withstand it.

496
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,744
If the prince is not to be
engulfed by the celestial aura

497
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,324
you must place this soul jade on him.

498
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:58,016
In three days, he will wake up.

499
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:05,378
You didn't tell me the most important
part until last!

500
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:08,280
It took you so long to
blabber that much nonsense.

501
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,338
You almost cost me a great deal.

502
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:14,224
Forget it. I'd better ask Zhe Yan
about Ye Hua myself.

503
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:15,664
Leave now.

504
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:45,186
Judging by what Zhe Yan said
you could really make it back.

505
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:51,822
<i>When did Ye Hua rescue Li Jing?</i>

506
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:05,393
