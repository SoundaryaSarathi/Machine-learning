1
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,537
It’s no good, I can’t get close.

2
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,131
Show it your perseverance.

3
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:16,409
Yes…

4
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:23,276
Eh!

5
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:31,088
Li-kun.

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,720
That’s dangerous, stop it.

7
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,201
Eh!

8
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:42,969
Li-kun!

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,066
Didn’t I tell him?

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,438
Come forth lightning, obey the command!

11
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,923
Now, Sakura!

12
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:06,288
Yeah.

13
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:12,762
Return to your rightful form,

14
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:15,294
Clow Card.

15
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:22,733
Oh!

16
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,177
The card chooses the one

17
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,947
who sealed it’s power as its owner.

18
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:30,615
It’s hard to take,

19
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,816
but he did more this time.

20
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,244
It is impossible after all.

21
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,451
Eh?

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,348
It is impossible for you
to gather cards.

23
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:39,590
You have too little power.

24
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:41,221
What was that brat?

25
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,286
That was too bad, Sakura-chan.

26
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,393
Yeah, there is no helping it.

27
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,233
She is hiding her distress inside.

28
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,602
Umm…

29
00:01:55,876 --> 00:02:01,610
[Sakura and Kero’s big fight]

30
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,681
Nothing good at all happened today.

31
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:11,558
Kero-chan, I wonder if it really
is impossible for me.

32
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:18,494
Kero-chan,

33
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,225
are you listening?

34
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:24,627
Hey, Kero-chan.

35
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:27,133
Kero-chan!

36
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,546
Why are you screaming,

37
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,853
after I was thinking of
a way to win against that brat.

38
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,485
Eh? That is what you were doing?

39
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:44,652
Sorry.

40
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,125
So, that way is?

41
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:49,225
Way?

42
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:52,959
I forgot it.

43
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,525
Geeze, and I was expecting something.

44
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:56,892
I really had thought of something,

45
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,204
but your idiotic voice
made me forget it.

46
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,465
I didn’t have any idiotic voice.

47
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,532
No, you did.

48
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:04,703
You’re wrong.

49
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,070
You did!

50
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:08,776
Huh!

51
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:10,580
I need a place

52
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,518
where I can relax and think

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,648
without being interrupted by Sakura.

54
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,217
I didn’t interrupt.

55
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,383
You did!

56
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:19,954
I didn’t.

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,055
If I said you did, you did.

58
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:23,288
I didn’t.

59
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:25,665
I don’t care any more.

60
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:30,394
Good night.

61
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,304
Huh!

62
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,734
Just when I was about
to have a good idea.

63
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,237
Sakura, you moron.

64
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,818
I feel better after sleeping.

65
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,220
I’m not angry anymore,
come out Kero-chan.

66
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:55,721
Eh!

67
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:57,925
Kero-chan?

68
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,328
Where are you?

69
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:05,231
I’m in here.

70
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,198
Are you OK?

71
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,306
What are you doing in there?

72
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,879
How do you like it? I made it
last night after thinking it up.

73
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:17,042
Pretty good for being made in one night?

74
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:20,050
Now if I only had something for a sofa

75
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,351
or a nice table.

76
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,480
This is…
This is…

77
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,057
Where are the contents of the drawer?

78
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,018
Ah that stuff?

79
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:29,852
Over there.

80
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,436
Eh!

81
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:38,463
What are you doing?

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,402
Geeze,

83
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,868
you messed up the drawer.

84
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,904
My room that I went through
all that trouble to make!

85
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,402
It’s too cruel!

86
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,803
You are the one who was cruel.

87
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,545
Beast!

88
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:50,045
What was that?

89
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,485
If you aren’t a beast,
you are a monster!

90
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:53,843
What did you say?

91
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:57,052
I called you a monster
because you destroyed my room.

92
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,755
Monster Sakura!

93
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,559
Monster!

94
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,393
Geeze.

95
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,066
You seem one level
more the monster today.

96
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,347
Monster.

97
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:30,213
So that is why you have been

98
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:32,421
in a cross mood all morning.

99
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,287
I had to clean up after it all.

100
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:37,562
There were important things
in there too.

101
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:41,762
There was a letter
I got from you in there too.

102
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:52,436
Oh?

103
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:54,543
Damn it,

104
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:55,880
I can’t calm down.

105
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:57,882
Geeze.

106
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,076
Eh!

107
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,917
A gift from somebody?

108
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:02,149
I wonder if it is something to eat.

109
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,520
No.

110
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:05,722
Sakura will get mad at me.

111
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,995
No, I am angry too!

112
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:15,130
What is this?

113
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,974
It’s chocolate!

114
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,108
This is good!

115
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:32,017
I understand Kero-chan wanting
some privacy, but…

116
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,616
I am sure he didn’t intend anything bad.

117
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:36,955
But

118
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,656
then Kero-chan called me a monster.

119
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:41,727
Monster Sakura.

120
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:45,563
My, I would love a monster

121
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,432
that was cute like Sakura-chan.

122
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:48,857
Eh!

123
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,298
This chocolate really is good.

124
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,309
Great!

125
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,520
Kero-chan must have done this,

126
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,550
to make such a mess eating.

127
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,852
Isn’t this chocolate
with alcohol in it?

128
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:20,122
Geeze, he ate them all.

129
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,262
Eh!

130
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,641
Thanks for dinner.

131
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,271
Ah, Sakura,

132
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,339
have you seen a package

133
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:35,613
I left out?

134
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,109
It had chocolate in it.

135
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:39,282
Chocolate?

136
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,881
Yes, chocolate.

137
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,318
Well I am going to sleep,

138
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,620
good night.

139
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,825
Geeze, Kero-chan…

140
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,329
Where did he go?

141
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,832
You see?

142
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:00,729
I am really Cerberus,

143
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,666
I was protecting
that book the whole time.

144
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,310
In rain or wind.

145
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:10,539
Lots of terrible things happened.

146
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,978
You’re the only one
to listen to my story.

147
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:18,953
I feel kinda sleepy.

148
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:20,784
Do you know someplace

149
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,752
I could sleep?

150
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:27,163
Over there?

151
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,929
Oh, it’s a bed.

152
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:30,326
This is good.

153
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,937
Thank you.

154
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,870
Eh!

155
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,106
Sakura, you moron.

156
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,114
Where is this?

157
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,554
Are you awake?

158
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:23,815
Who is that?

159
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:25,820
I brought breakfast.

160
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,652
What is your name?

161
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,288
What?

162
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:31,628
Here.

163
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,294
Do you not like milk?

164
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:35,692
You’re a cat aren’t you?

165
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:37,961
No I’m not.

166
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,969
Oh, it’s over.

167
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,137
Oh no, I spoke.

168
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,235
You have an interesting meow.

169
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:47,709
Your name is Chau-chan right?

170
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,510
No.

171
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,442
It is Chau-chan!

172
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,182
Can you help me a bit?

173
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,682
OK, Mama!

174
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,852
Wait a bit, OK Chau-chan?

175
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,087
Chau? It’s not Chau.

176
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:05,726
No, no.

177
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,131
I left the window open all night

178
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,074
so he could come home any time.

179
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,501
Kero-chan is so obstinate.

180
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,349
Where did he go?

181
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:26,782
Hmm?

182
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,682
No, it’s nothing.

183
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,554
Huh?

184
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,690
I said it’s nothing.

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,824
I see.

186
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:40,156
I’m leaving.

187
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,371
I was thirsty

188
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,042
so this milk tastes good.

189
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,612
Well then, I am heading out.

190
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,845
See you later!

191
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:00,149
Chau-chan, did you eat it up?

192
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:02,684
That’s good.

193
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:03,851
Good boy.

194
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,482
Mama went out to work,

195
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,758
so it is up to Akane and
Chau-chan to look after things.

196
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,128
So this kid’s name is Akane?

197
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:14,528
Such a small kid

198
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,960
has to stay home alone?

199
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:17,398
Chau-chan,

200
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,838
your face looks a little dirty.

201
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:24,075
Stay still,

202
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,503
I’ll make you clean.

203
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:28,713
Isn’t this cold water?

204
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:30,139
Wash me with warm water.

205
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:35,714
There, all done.

206
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,191
Oh yeah! I’ll put on a ribbon too.

207
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,352
Where is this?

208
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,959
If I don’t do something in a hurry…

209
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,431
That is my Papa who is in heaven.

210
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,305
My dad went to a place
called heaven they say.

211
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:56,604
That is why

212
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:58,508
I have to watch over the house.

213
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:01,244
You’ll help me look over
the house too, right?

214
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,008
I got it!

215
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:06,281
Ah, Mama?

216
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:07,981
Yeah this is Akane.

217
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,353
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

218
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,289
Good luck at work.

219
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,888
Yeah. Bye, bye.

220
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:18,926
Kumiko!

221
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,293
Papa?

222
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:22,360
You were alive?

223
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,368
Kumiko!

224
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,601
Papa!

225
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,104
Huh? Chau-chan?

226
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:43,687
Chau-chan?

227
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,820
Chau-chan?

228
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:49,093
Chau-chan?

229
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,353
Ha…

230
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:53,096
Chau-chan?

231
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,058
Chau-chan?

232
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:58,404
Ha…

233
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,337
Kero-chan left home?

234
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,533
I don’t know,

235
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,775
but he hasn’t come back home.

236
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,003
Perhaps he got angry

237
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:09,473
because of how I reacted.

238
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,483
I am sure that Kero-chan
also regrets fighting.

239
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:16,113
The same as you are now.

240
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:17,955
I wonder.

241
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,757
Let’s go look for him, OK?

242
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:21,755
Yeah.

243
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,120
Even if we say that…

244
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,063
It’s too long.

245
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,594
Really.

246
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:29,732
Where should we search?

247
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,036
Sakura-chan. What are you doing?

248
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:34,930
Yukito-san!

249
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,639
Nothing at all.

250
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,981
He saw me at the worst
possible time.

251
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,977
I suppose this method
is impossible too.

252
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:52,684
I’m home.

253
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:57,763
I forgot,

254
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:00,399
I was supposed to make dinner today.

255
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,061
You do it on Sunday.

256
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,803
Why did you switch with me?

257
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:06,933
No reason.

258
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:08,873
There was just something I wanted to eat.

259
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,471
If you walk around with that spaced out
expression, you’ll fall over.

260
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:13,936
Eh!

261
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,508
Yuki was worried and called.

262
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,710
Yukito-san did?

263
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:21,846
Thanks, big brother.

264
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,018
I’ll answer that.

265
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:28,350
Hurry and go. Hurry and go.

266
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:31,892
Hurry. Hurry.

267
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:41,201
Where is it from?

268
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:43,741
A friend.

269
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,369
A very important friend.

270
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:46,575
Eh!

271
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,744
To Sakura, I am fine.
I’ll contact you again.

272
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:53,509
Kero-chan contacted you?

273
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,716
It was a fax,

274
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:56,749
but it had Kero-chan’s writing.

275
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,954
Do you know the phone number
it was sent from?

276
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:00,988
Let’s see…

277
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,487
The transfer data should be

278
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,693
On the top of the fax sheet.

279
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,833
Let’s see, 5,2,2…

280
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:21,611
I think I know the general area now.

281
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:25,111
As you can see a large
low pressure zone

282
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:26,215
is moving into the area.

283
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,912
Strong winds are expected,

284
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,118
so please be careful.

285
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,246
Next is the report for
the surrounding area…

286
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:32,955
What should I do?

287
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,490
I can’t leave her alone.

288
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,397
I have to get back to
Sakura’s place tho…

289
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:42,757
Eh!

290
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,363
Chau-chan, you can fly!

291
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:45,964
Eh?

292
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh!

293
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,601
Chau-chau…

294
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,603
That’s amazing, Chau-chan!

295
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:52,772
I wish I could fly too,

296
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,008
Then I could

297
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,879
Meet my father in heaven.

298
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,010
Even if you can fly you won’t
meet people who are dead.

299
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:01,176
I understand wanting to
meet him though.

300
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,314
Eh?

301
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,665
Ha…

302
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,472
What is this?

303
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,868
I flew! I flew!

304
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:24,265
Look!

305
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:25,905
I can fly too.

306
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,544
That’s not it, she’s not flying.

307
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,273
This is…

308
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,178
A Clow Card!

309
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,448
Chau-chan!

310
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:35,220
Eh!

311
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,647
Join me over here.

312
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:38,255
Oh no!

313
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,153
Oh!

314
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:43,957
Akane!

315
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,124
Chau-chan, I can’t stop!

316
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:49,594
That is the Float card.

317
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,297
Give back Akane!

318
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,537
Chau-chan!

319
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:56,807
Stop!

320
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,108
If this goes on

321
00:16:58,478 --> 00:16:59,672
you really will go
to where your papa is.

322
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:03,344
Damn.

323
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,513
Akane, wait for me!

324
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,121
I’ll show you my perseverance!

325
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,322
Oh, no. I’m falling.

326
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:26,900
Kero-chan.

327
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:27,830
Sakura,

328
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,401
you saved me.

329
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:30,403
But why are you here?

330
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,334
Tomoyo-chan searched for it.

331
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,338
Is that because of a card?

332
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:35,970
It is the Float card.

333
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,178
It is a prankster that likes
to make things float around.

334
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,379
If we don’t hurry and seal it,

335
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,380
Akane will be hurt.

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,345
I understand.

337
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:47,091
Return to your rightful form,

338
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,719
Clow Card!

339
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,406
All right!

340
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,878
Akane!

341
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,629
Oh, no! I can’t stop!

342
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,060
Wood!

343
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:45,043
Mama…

344
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,620
Huh? Chau-chan.

345
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:50,186
Are you OK?

346
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:52,821
Oh! Chau-chau.

347
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,159
Well then, Akane-chan.

348
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,328
Yeah. Wait just a bit, Mama.

349
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:03,667
Chau-chau.

350
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,403
Miss.

351
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,941
You really will take Chau-chan?

352
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:11,068
Yeah.

353
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:13,706
Take good care of him.

354
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:14,445
Yeah.

355
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,649
Our new house won’t
let us keep Chau-chan.

356
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,049
If you get lonely

357
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,909
you can always visit Kero…

358
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:23,350
I mean Chau-chan.

359
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:24,245
Yeah!

360
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:25,582
But now

361
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,017
I can always be together with Mom.

362
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,624
I won’t be lonely anymore.

363
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:31,663
That’s good.

364
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:32,396
Yup.

365
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,796
Akane-chan.

366
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:35,659
Coming!

367
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:36,763
Bye, bye.

368
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:41,699
Akane’s mom

369
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,906
is changing jobs

370
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:45,540
so she can always be with her.

371
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,545
Yeah.

372
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:49,374
Chau-chan!

373
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,114
Bye, bye Chau-chan.

374
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,580
Bye, bye!

375
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,256
So, shall we go home, Kero-chan?

376
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,989
I haven’t decided to go
back to your place yet.

377
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,656
Are you still in a sour mood?

378
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,493
Look.

379
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:11,397
Ah, this is…

380
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:13,500
You made this?

381
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:14,372
Well?

382
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,331
Is is it a little too girlish?

383
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:18,436
No not at all…

384
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:21,144
I think.

385
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,741
This bed especially is pretty good.

386
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,118
You broke it!

387
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:30,613
After I went through all
the trouble to make it.

388
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:32,881
It wasn’t on purpose.

389
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,055
Wasn’t it just poorly made?

390
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:36,456
You’re horrible,

391
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:37,761
I think you are just too fat.

392
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:38,926
What’s that?

393
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:39,959
I’m not fat.

394
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,128
You are just clumsy.

395
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:43,928
Now you said it.

396
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:44,635
You monster.

397
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,401
Ah, you called me a monster again.

398
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,306
When all you have is dots for eyes.

399
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,403
What was that?

400
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,436
Giant monster Sakura!
