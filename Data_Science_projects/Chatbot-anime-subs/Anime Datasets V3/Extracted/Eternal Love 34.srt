<i>[Episode 34]</i>

3
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,199
I got it.

4
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
Have you been possessed?

5
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,919
I am going to go to choose
someone from Qing Qiu

6
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,520
to be Ye Hua's disciple in the kitchen.

7
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,960
This way, even if Ye Hua leaves Qing Qiu,
we'll still have food to eat.

8
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,080
All right, I'll go post up notices.

9
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I've already arranged for a servant girl
to transform into a Taoist nun

10
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,840
to look after Yuan Zhen
in the Mortal Realm.

11
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
Why must you still insist on
going to Qing Qiu to see Bai Qian?

12
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,680
You don't understand, My Lord.

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,000
A mother absolutely will not
allow her child

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,503
to be subjected to
any suffering or grievances.

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,199
I must see Aunt

16
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,360
and ask her to face the trial
in place of Yuan Zhen.

17
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,680
He caused this disaster,
so he needs to go through this trial.

18
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,479
Never mind Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

19
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,680
even if were High God Zhe Yan, I'm afraid
he would not be able to help either.

20
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,039
No.

21
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,000
Aunt can.

22
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,280
You have too much confidence
in this aunt of yours.

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
It is not that I am
overly confident in her

24
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
but because of us

25
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
the Celestial Tribe owes Qing Qiu.

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,680
Other people cannot interfere in this,
but Aunt certainly can.

27
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,159
Even if Aunt changes
Yuan Zhen's fate without permission

28
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,120
the Heavenly Lord will still
turn a blind eye.

29
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,719
That does hold some reason.

30
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,840
However, with Bai Qian's personality...

31
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,560
If she were to make
your life difficult...

32
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,280
Do not worry, My Lord.

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,479
Aunt has returned
the Cloud Clearing Fan to me

34
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,560
and has allowed me one wish.

35
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,439
She is one who keeps to her word.
She definitely will not turn me down.

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
Mushroom Fairy, what is this notice for?

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
Aunt is going to choose someone today

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,959
to become Lord Ye Hua's disciple
in the kitchen.

39
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,319
It is a rare chance.

40
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,519
It would be a great fortune
to be Lord Ye Hua's disciple

41
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,959
even if it is in the kitchen.

42
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,639
There is already a long line
of people in front of the Fox Den.

43
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
I'm afraid it is too late to go now.

44
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
It's not, it's not. It's happening
tonight. There's still time. Let's go.

45
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,879
I heard from Mi Gu that
you are choosing a disciple for me.

46
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,639
Yes.

47
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,639
Have them all leave.

48
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,720
None of them look like
they have the talent.

49
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,759
In my opinion,
you look like you'd do well.

50
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,879
But you truly have
no need to learn from me.

51
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,959
It's enough that one of
the two of us can cook.

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,199
Mi Gu.

53
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,639
Aunt, which one has
the Crown Prince chosen?

54
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,519
He doesn't like any of them.
Tell them to disperse.

55
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,959
J... Just like that?

56
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,920
Leave, leave.

57
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,620
All right. Let's go.

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,439
I'll take the young prince
on a boat ride then.

59
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,879
Let's go.

60
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,160
Come on.

61
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,040
Qian Qian.

62
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,959
Come take a walk with me.

63
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,319
With your level of laziness

64
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,680
even this pond's flowers were
left to survive on their own.

65
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,139
Yet, they still ended up looking
like natural decorations.

66
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,000
They're not inferior to those
in the Celestial Palace's lotus pond.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,439
How rare.

68
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,600
Not at all.

69
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,680
This is just a natural pond.
How can it compare to your lotus pond?

70
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,439
Your lotus pond has been written about

71
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,800
in countless poems
by immortals and mortals

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,478
and has been praised by countless people.

73
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you want to see it?

74
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,279
See what?

75
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,439
The Nine Heavens. The lotus pond.

76
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,439
There will be time.

77
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,720
According to what you said, you've
never been to the Celestial Palace.

78
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Aren't you curious?

79
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,959
There are many places in the world
that I've never been to.

80
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,874
If I were curious about every place,
wouldn't I be exhausted?

81
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:31,279
Kunlun Mountain is also
renowned throughout the four seas.

82
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,120
I haven't been there either.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,279
Do you really admire Kunlun Mountain?

84
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,000
<i>Oh no. Why did I
bring up Kunlun Mountain?</i>

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
Where's Mi Gu?

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,120
Mi Gu has a barrier set up
at the cave entrance.

87
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,839
It seems someone has stumbled in.

88
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,439
Aunt.

89
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,920
She's here with the fan already.
It seems she has thought it through.

90
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
So you mean...

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Allow her in.

92
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Yes.

93
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,559
What did Aunt say?

94
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,120
Aunt said to let you in.

95
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,320
Shao Xing, if I were you,
I would not have come to see Aunt.

96
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
It's the last time.

97
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,399
After this, I will never step foot
in Qing Qiu again.

98
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,039
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

99
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,559
Take A-Li to play.

100
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,759
Your Highness, come.

101
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,519
Since you have come to see me, you must
have decided what to ask of me.

102
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,799
Lord Ye Hua is not a stranger.
Go ahead and speak.

103
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,840
Aunt.

104
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,519
Can you save my child, Yuan Zhen?

105
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,720
Save your child?

106
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,080
It was the Heavenly Lord's
birthday banquet a few days ago.

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,360
My Lord had brought Yuan Zhen and a gift

108
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,039
to the Nine Heavens to celebrate
the Heavenly Lord's birthday.

109
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,960
Who could have known

110
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,320
Yuan Zhen would cause trouble
in Xiwu Palace that night and nearly...

111
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,480
he nearly molested
Consort Su Jin of Xiwu Palace.

112
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Molested Su Jin?

113
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,600
<i>A man who can be a crown prince
sure is not an average man.</i>

114
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,200
<i>He seems to be quite cheerful
at having been made a cuckold.</i>

115
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,500
Yuan Zhen stopped at the last moment,
but the Heavenly Lord was alerted.

116
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,279
The Heavenly Lord
was exceptionally furious

117
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,480
and had Yuan Zhen immediately
bound by an Immortal Seal

118
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,559
and then issued a decree

119
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,240
to have Yuan Zhen undergo a trial
in the Mortal Realm for 60 years.

120
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
After 60 years, he can return
to the ranks of the immortals.

121
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,679
This punishment does sound
a bit severe for attempted harassment.

122
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,960
Yuan Zhen is a good
and kindhearted child.

123
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,639
He doesn't even have the heart
to step on an ant in the road.

124
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,080
I earnestly ask that
you save his life, Aunt.

125
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:55,080
But... he has harassed
Lord Ye Hua's side consort.

126
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,720
No need to defer to me.

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,840
I also think Yuan Zhen
was punished too severely.

128
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,399
It was your side consort
whom he harassed.

129
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,559
I do not have a side consort.

130
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,840
Since Your Highness thinks
the punishment is too severe as well

131
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,519
please go to the Mortal Realm
to save him, Aunt!

132
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,879
He is just going to the Mortal Realm
to experience a trial.

133
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,480
He can return to the ranks
of the immortals in 60 years.

134
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Why do I need to save his life?

135
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,000
Because I have made inquiries
and learned that

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,159
Yuan Zhen will encounter a major ordeal
when he is 18 years old.

137
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,720
This ordeal will ruin his life.

138
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,480
I cannot bear to see him
subjected to such torture

139
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
so I ask you to please change
his predestined fate

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,679
so he can make it through
this lifetime safely.

141
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,559
So you came to see me
to help your son pass this trial?

142
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,519
Yes.

143
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519
I do not dare to beg you to ask for
a favor to pardon him from punishment.

144
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,679
I only ask that you secretly help him.

145
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,519
You were quite clever
to ask me to help you with this.

146
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,600
You know that even if I change
Yuan Zhen's fate

147
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,440
the Heavenly Lord won't pursue
this matter with me, right?

148
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,678
I know that in this world

149
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,879
only you are able to do this.

150
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,240
All right, I promise you.
I will do this for you.

151
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,679
But after it is done, our relationship
as mistress and servant will be over.

152
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,240
You will have no more ties to Qing Qiu.

153
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,000
I thank you for granting me this wish.

154
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,960
What's wrong?

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,679
Were you bullied by
those young immortals again?

156
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,080
They all laugh at me for being a snake.

157
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,240
They say I am not worthy of
serving Qing Qiu's queen in the Fox Den.

158
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,679
You are so hopeless.

159
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,759
If anybody dared to bully me
when I was a child

160
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,744
I would beat them up until
they couldn't recognize their way home.

161
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,690
This is called the Cloud Clearing Fan.

162
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,559
It was given to me by
the Lord of Numinous Treasures.

163
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,879
I'm giving it to you.

164
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,799
It is from
the Lord of Numinous Treasures?

165
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,000
It's too valuable. I cannot accept it.

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,919
Just take it.

167
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,320
You've been with me for so long.
I haven't given you any artifacts.

168
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,840
This fan is very powerful.

169
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,120
If anybody bullies you, just use
this fan to blow them out of Qing Qiu.

170
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,600
This fan is that powerful?

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,039
It's yours now.

172
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,039
Thank you, Aunt.

173
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,799
Why did you say Shao Xing was clever
to ask you to do this?

174
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,840
You were eavesdropping?

175
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,200
I wanted to hear how this person who paid
no heed to your position as her mistress

176
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,279
and caused you to be
ridiculed by the four seas

177
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
would come to beg you for a favor.

178
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,399
In the Nine Heavens...

179
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,919
every immortal has the ability
to change the fate of mortals.

180
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,159
However, the Celestial Tribe
has a rule in place.

181
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,320
Even if they have the ability,
they cannot use it.

182
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,399
The Celestial Tribe owes
the Bai family a great many debts.

183
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,480
They haven't repaid any of them.

184
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,759
If I were to meddle a little

185
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,759
the Heavenly Lord would turn
a blind eye and just accept it.

186
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,480
That's why I am the best person to do it.

187
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
This snake sure is crafty.

188
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,519
It is good her to be clever.

189
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,240
Then she won't be taken advantage of
in the North Sea.

190
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,480
This is a simple task.

191
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,624
When done, my ties with her
will be cleanly severed.

192
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,759
It seems I'll have to make a trip to see

193
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,120
Star Lord Si Ming, who follows
Dong Hua Dijun

194
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,200
to see what ordeal Yuan Zhen
goes through when he is 18 years old.

195
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,799
I'll have to find out which hour and day,
and how it happens to him.

196
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,679
Star Lord Si Ming is quite eccentric.

197
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,639
Even the Heavenly Lord cannot
take a look in his Book of Destiny.

198
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,320
It will be quite difficult
for you to find out from him.

199
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,799
What should I do then?

200
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,679
Fortunately, Star Lord Si Ming
owes me a favor.

201
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,759
If I ask him in your place,
it will be easier.

202
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,600
Really? Can you get it for me?

203
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
But you have to promise me one thing.

204
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,559
What is it?

205
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,759
Seal your powers when
you go to the Mortal Realm.

206
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,679
Seal my powers?

207
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,480
Changing fate is an act
that defies nature.

208
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,400
The same amount of magic you use
to change fate

209
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,624
will rebound back at you.

210
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,599
Qian Qian, you may be a high goddess

211
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,920
but being hit a few times
like that can be quite serious.

212
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,000
When we take on the positions of
Heavenly Lord and Heavenly Empress

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,559
what will we do then?

214
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,519
Take on the position of Heavenly Empress?

215
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,000
Have you forgotten?

216
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,920
You will marry into Xiwu Palace one day.

217
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:37,400
When one becomes
Heavenly Lord or Heavenly Empress

218
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,940
one must endure 81 sacred blazes
and 9 holy bolts of lightning.

219
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,720
If you are hit by your own magic,
I'm afraid you won't survive.

220
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,119
All right, I promise.

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,960
But, you and I aren't married yet.

222
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,200
If you have to take on the position
of Heavenly Lord today

223
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,559
I won't be able to marry you in time.

224
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,539
81 sacred blazes
and 9 holy bolts of lightning

225
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,119
will then be out of the question.

226
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:11,839
What is it? Is there something wrong
with what I said?

227
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,519
Qian Qian.

228
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,079
Are you blaming me for
not proposing to you sooner?

229
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,480
If I had married you 300 years ago

230
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,519
then this worry
wouldn't be a concern today.

231
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,119
It was just an offhand comment.

232
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,400
It looks to be getting late.

233
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,599
Lord Ye Hua, why don't you
complete this task for me quickly

234
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,440
so I can start helping Yuan Zhen
through his trial?

235
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,000
Why would Your Highness think
of looking into Yuan Zhen's fate?

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,440
High Goddess Bai Qian
promised Second Uncle's wife

237
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,450
that she would help Yuan Zhen
through his trial.

238
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,559
Aunt sure is kind.

239
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,920
She doesn't mind at all that the snake
stole Second Prince away 300 years ago...

240
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll tell Your Highness about Yuan Zhen's
story in the Mortal Realm then.

241
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,039
Yuan Zhen is reincarnated
into an imperial family.

242
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,519
It is the Song family.
His name is Song Yuan Zhen.

243
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,519
He is named Crown Prince at 12 years old.

244
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:33,359
Now, he is almost 18 years old
and his trial will soon commence.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yuan Zhen's mother in the Mortal Realm
is a Noble Consort.

246
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,839
After she gave birth to Yuan Zhen

247
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,799
she took him with her to
a Taoist temple and became a nun.

248
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,960
When he turned 16

249
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,584
she had Yuan Zhen's master
send him back to the palace.

250
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,299
Yuan Zhen's master

251
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,839
is a servant sent by Sang Ji,
the Water King of the North Sea

252
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,000
to look after Yuan Zhen.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,359
A servant?

254
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,240
So Second Uncle still secretly
sent someone to look after him.

255
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,079
Yes.

256
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,640
In my opinion, if Aunt
does not want to disrupt his fate

257
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,680
then she must replace this master
and remain by Yuan Zhen's side.

258
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,960
That's the only way.

259
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,759
As for how to help him pass the ordeal,
she will have to consider it at length.

260
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,759
Thank you.

261
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,339
You are most welcome.

262
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,079
It was Your Highness
who deferred to Dong Hua Dijun

263
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,920
and pardoned Bai Feng Jiu
for stealing the Soul-gathering Lamp.

264
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,920
You could say I am
returning this favor for Dijun today.

265
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,839
Your Highness must remind Aunt that

266
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,400
she must seal her own powers
when she is in the Mortal Realm.

267
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,480
- Or else...
- I understand.

268
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
You're saying the nine-tailed fox

269
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,359
is going to the Mortal Realm
to help Yuan Zhen?

270
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,640
That is what His Highness
and the Star Lord said.

271
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,200
They also said Bai Qian must seal
her own powers in the Mortal Realm.

272
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,839
Sister Miao Qing, I might have to ask you
to make a trip to the Mortal Realm.

273
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,200
Me?

274
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,799
It is reasonable to say
that I am your older sister.

275
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,039
I should be the one to take such risks.

276
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,359
But as His Highness's side consort

277
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,400
every move I make is
under scrutiny by everyone.

278
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
I truly do not dare
to make any rash moves.

279
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,839
However, you have much more freedom.

280
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,680
What would you like me
to do in the Mortal Realm?

281
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,720
I heard you saying
how precious and cherished this book is.

282
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,839
I thought you would
only be able to get a copy.

283
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,240
I didn't expect you would
come back with the original.

284
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,599
Take a look.

285
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,319
Si Ming wrote a story that
really makes one want to tear up.

286
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,640
It is a waste of talent for
Lord Si Ming not to write a few plays.

287
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,559
<i>On the first fay of the sixth month,
the emperor will visit Shuyu River.</i>

288
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,079
Crown Prince Yuan Zhen will go along.

289
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,799
A roc bird will appear at the river
scaring everyone into a panic.

290
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,599
A beautiful woman on the riverbank
accidentally falls into the water.

291
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,119
Yuan Zhen will jump into
the water to save her.

292
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,799
So this trial is the test of a beauty?

293
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,799
Yuan Zhen and the beauty fall in love
with each other in the water.

294
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,359
Unfortunately, the emperor
also takes a liking to this woman.

295
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,921
He takes her back to the palace
and she becomes his favorite.

296
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,663
This emperor sure is affectionate.

297
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:42,759
Yuan Zhen cannot accept
losing the love of his life

298
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,880
and on a certain drunken night, he and
the beauty meet in a secluded spot.

299
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,519
Not long after, the beauty
gives birth to a prince.

300
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,240
So Yuan Zhen cuckoldes his father
in the Mortal Realm?

301
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
That's correct.

302
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,599
The prince is naturally Yuan Zhen's son,
but Yuan Zhen does not know it.

303
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,279
A dozen years later,
the emperor falls severely ill.

304
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,720
The prince fights Yuan Zhen
for the position of Crown Prince

305
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,200
and ultimately dies by Yuan Zhen's sword.

306
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,240
This grievous news is relayed to
the beauty who then hangs herself.

307
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,880
Before her death, she writes a letter
telling the truth to Yuan Zhen.

308
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,151
After reading it, Yuan Zhen is
inconsolable with grief

309
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:21,559
and wishes to slit his own throat.

310
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,599
However, he is the only remaining
male heir of the imperial family.

311
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,680
He has no choice but to
reluctantly take the throne.

312
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,119
And just like that, he rules until
60 years of age when he dies of old age

313
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,943
having lived a miserable life.

314
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,359
What a tempestuous fate.

315
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,759
Yuan Zhen's life is truly legendary.

316
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,079
So at 18 years old, the moment
he sees the beauty fall into the water

317
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,240
is a crucial turning point in his life.

318
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,480
As long as he doesn't save that beauty,
he can then live a smooth life?

319
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,720
That's correct.

320
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,200
Looks like I'll have to live in
the Mortal Realm for half a year

321
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,160
and wait for
the first day of the sixth month

322
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,119
and prevent him from saving that beauty.

323
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,720
I've already made arrangements for you.

324
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,319
After you arrive in the Mortal Realm

325
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,759
Yuan Zhen's Taoist master
will refer you into the palace

326
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,359
for you to be Yuan Zhen's new master.

327
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,559
I'm going to be a Taoist nun?

328
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,960
Yes.

329
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,559
- Senior.
- Junior.

330
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,039
Crown Prince, my time with you
has run its course.

331
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,759
It is time for us to part.

332
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,160
Master.

333
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,000
It's just that as Your Highness's master

334
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,880
I feel I am letting you down
by leaving so suddenly.

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,359
Fortunately, my senior fellow apprentice
who wanders the world

336
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,119
happens to be here.

337
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,799
I asked her to look after
Your Highness in my stead.

338
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,440
I have not traveled outside
temple grounds in hundreds of years.

339
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,200
To be able to have been
master and disciple with Your Highness

340
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,680
can be considered good fortune.

341
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,240
But... But I can't bear
to leave you, Master.

342
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,880
The fate of meetings and partings
is not up to you or me, Your Highness.

343
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,279
I understand. But...

344
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,480
Master, thank you for watching
over Yuan Zhen all these years.

345
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,960
You are welcome, Noble Consort.

346
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,119
Hurry and greet my senior.

347
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,920
Yuan Zhen, hurry. Give your greetings
to the Taoist priest.

348
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,480
Taoist Priest.

349
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,119
Very good, very good.

350
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,119
You mean to say...

351
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,079
I can tell from a glance

352
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,983
the Crown Prince was one among the ranks
of the immortals of the Nine Heavens.

353
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,573
He descended to the Mortal Realm

354
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,680
to endure a trial because
he had committed a wrong.

355
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,519
Will my son return to ranks of
the immortals after he passes the trial?

356
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,000
If I properly guide and enlighten him

357
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,609
and the Crown Prince is
wholeheartedly devoted to Taoist practice

358
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,809
I believe it won't be difficult for him
to return to the ranks of the immortals.

359
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,839
Quick, salute your master.

360
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,839
Master.

361
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,039
Master, if you do not mind,
you can live here from now on.

362
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
It will do.

363
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,799
You can go for today. Come back tomorrow
to study Taoism from me.

364
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,160
Yes.

365
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
<i>It is only the first day
of the first month.</i>

366
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,839
<i>I really have to live here
for half a year</i>

367
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,920
<i>until the day the beauty
falls into Shuyu River.</i>

368
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,039
<i>But this can be good.</i>

369
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,400
<i>I can observe how the Mortal Realm's
imperial family spends their days.</i>

370
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,000
High Immortal.

371
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,680
Ghost Lord, at the Eastern Sea,
you spoke very rudely.

372
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Now you are bowing your head
to Kunlun Mountain disciples?

373
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,519
I am here to request to see
High Immortal Si Yin.

374
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,079
What did you say?

375
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,519
You want to see Si Yin?

376
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,079
It was because of the war with
your Ghost Tribe 70,000 years ago

377
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:44,519
that my master died in battle
and Si Yin disappeared as well.

378
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,319
How dare you have the nerve to come here
and say you want to see him?

379
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,599
High Immortal, I saw Si Yin
a couple of days ago.

380
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,440
I thought that since Si Yin is
deeply attached to Kunlun Mountain

381
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,759
if he were to return, he would
surely come to Kunlun Mountain.

382
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,480
What? You've seen him? Where?

383
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,880
On the north bank of the Eastern Sea,
within the borders of the Far North.

384
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,279
The Far North?

385
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,039
Please leave, Ghost Lord.

386
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,480
Although Kunlun Mountain
isn't an enemy of the Ghost Realm

387
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,000
for the sake of the Celestial Tribe

388
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,559
we still have no friendship
with the Ghost Realm.

389
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,839
As for Si Yin, my fellow disciples and I
will continue to search for him.

390
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,880
You need not go to the trouble,
Ghost Lord. Farewell.

391
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,759
Wait, High Immortal!

392
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,920
What is the use in asking him?

393
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,240
Since A-Yin purposely hid her identity

394
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,440
why would these
Kunlun Mountain people know?

395
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,160
Fiery Qilin.

396
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,359
My Lord.

397
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,839
- Return to Grand Ziming Palace.
- Yes.

398
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,440
My Lord.

399
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,446
I have been investigating
the Ghost Realm situation recently.

400
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:07,047
I encountered many from the Ghost Realm

401
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:10,160
traveling to various regions in disguise
in search of High Immortal Si Yin.

402
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,720
They all carried this drawing.

403
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,680
I heard this very drawing
was drawn by the Ghost Lord himself.

404
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,519
The rest are all copies.

405
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,319
There was word from
Sixteenth Disciple just now

406
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,480
that Ghost Lord visited
Kunlun Mountain today

407
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,279
and said he had seen Si Yin

408
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,240
so he went to check if
Si Yin had returned to Kunlun Mountain.

409
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,480
I have been searching for Si Yin
for 70,000 years without any clues.

410
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,160
How could he have seen him?
It is clearly another lie!

411
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,240
Die Feng.

412
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,880
Is the one in this drawing
really Si Yin?

413
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,279
Yes, this is Seventeenth Disciple.

414
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,799
You just said Ghost Lord Li Jing
had seen Si Yin?

415
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,839
Yes, that's what Li Jing said
to Sixteenth, Zi Lan.

416
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,279
Did he say where?

417
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,680
On the north bank of the Eastern Sea.

418
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,559
The north bank of the Eastern Sea?

419
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,839
<i>So it is indeed the Eastern Sea.</i>

420
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,220
<i>Kunlun Mountain's
seventeenth disciple, Si Yin</i>

421
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,559
<i>and Mo Yuan's body,
have been missing for 70,000 years.</i>

422
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,839
<i>This is the Celestial Tribe's
biggest unresolved case.</i>

423
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>I never imagined....
Qian Qian, you are Si Yin.</i>

424
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Does Your Highness have a clue?

425
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,720
No.

426
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,200
But I have heard of
the matters regarding Si Yin.

427
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,240
Seeing this drawing has reminded me
of the great war 70,000 years ago.

428
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,839
You may all step out now.

429
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

430
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,279
<i>Why did you take Mo Yuan's body?</i>

431
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,559
<i>Why did you disappear?
You even avoided your fellow disciples.</i>

432
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,599
<i>Qian Qian, if I were to ask you,
would you tell me the truth?</i>

433
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,680
Good boy. Ying'er, you are
such a good boy.

434
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,920
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

435
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,119
- Leave.
- Yes.

436
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,279
My Lord, look. He's very obedient.
He doesn't cry or scream.

437
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,039
Stop this nonsense.

438
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,960
It's been 300 years. How come you
still haven't come to your senses?

439
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,200
It's because you stole
the tactical formations

440
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,039
that we have a sick child.

441
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:03,400
My Lord, I have found a way
to make him wake up.

442
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,880
My Lord.

443
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,519
As long as Ying'er wakes up

444
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,680
that will be proof that I can
give birth to a healthy child.

445
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,160
Then I can bear more princes for you.

446
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,119
And princesses!

447
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,440
Don't you miss Yan Zhi the most?

448
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,440
I will give birth to a few princesses
for you. Won't that be nice?

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,880
Since things have turned out this way,
why don't you just let it go?

450
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,039
Let me ask you.

451
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
Who exactly is Si Yin?

452
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,559
It's been 70,000 years.

453
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,759
Are you still thinking of that man?

454
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
Could it be that you don't know?

455
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,839
She is the same as you,
a woman of the Fox Clan.

456
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,199
A woman of the Fox Clan?

457
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,840
Impossible.

458
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,639
I saw him get dressed with my own eyes
when I was at Kunlun Mountain.

459
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,280
He is a man of the Celestial Tribe!

460
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,760
Your Majesty was once with him.

461
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
How could you not know
he is a man of the Celestial Tribe?

462
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,280
I knew long ago that she is a woman.

463
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,119
But she never told me she was from the
Fox Clan, and not the Celestial Tribe.

464
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,840
The Fox Clan?

465
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
A woman of the Fox Clan?

466
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,559
Did you think of something?

467
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,960
I don't believe Si Yin is
a woman of the Fox Clan.

468
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,320
My Lord, stop lying to yourself.

469
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,079
Do you really not know?

470
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:03,360
Ying'er, you're so good.

471
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,079
As long as you listen to me,
I will definitely wake you up.

472
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,199
Qian Qian.

473
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,760
So it was you.

474
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,559
I can't believe it didn't cross my mind
that Si Yin was actually you.

475
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,400
Why do all the men I love
constantly think of you?

476
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
You already have Mo Yuan.

477
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,280
Why must you still steal Li Jing from me?

478
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,559
Mo Yuan?

479
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,320
Why didn't it occur to me?

480
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,519
Mo Yuan.

481
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,400
Take a look at this.

482
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,840
This is made from fresh morning dew
collected from leaves at daybreak.

483
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,360
- Aunt.
- It smells so fragrant.

484
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,679
Take a look.

485
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
- Aunt is back.
- Aunt, you're back?

486
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,119
- Weren't you going to the Mortal Realm?
- Yes. You're back so soon?

487
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,960
<i>I can't believe Bai Qian
actually isn't here.</i>

488
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,280
<i>Even the Heavens are helping me.</i>

489
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,159
A day in Heaven is
a year in the Mortal Realm.

490
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,159
You might think time passes by quickly

491
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,119
but many months have
actually gone by already.

492
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,257
That is true.
You picked these this morning.

493
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:03,141
You said you'd be in the Mortal Realm
from six months to a whole year.

494
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:06,079
You told me to save these loquats
and you'd pick them up tomorrow.

495
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,280
Should I deliver them
to the Fox Den for you?

496
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,000
No, I'll take them myself.

497
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,480
Thank you.

498
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,079
- Aunt sure is polite today.
- Yes.

499
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,920
- It's so strange.
- Yes.

500
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,360
Mother, you're back!

501
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,920
- Aunt.
- Mother!

502
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,400
What did you call me?

503
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,440
Mother, didn't you tell me you'd be
gone from Qing Qiu for a day?

504
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,800
How come you're back so soon?

505
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,400
Because I really miss you.

506
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:57,320
Aunt, didn't you say you'd be
in the Mortal Realm for at least a day?

507
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,440
The Mortal Realm is too boring,
so I came back.

508
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,119
Boring?

509
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,599
What's the matter?

510
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,159
Weren't you going to help
Shao Xing's son through his trial?

511
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,440
The trial was too easy so I came back.

512
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,239
Why don't you follow me into the Fox Den?

513
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,519
All right.

514
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
Let's go.

515
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,960
My good son.

516
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,490
<i>Aunt might dote on the young prince</i>

517
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,480
<i>but she knows
the Celestial Tribe's etiquette</i>

518
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,199
<i>and never calls him her son.</i>

519
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,280
<i>Aunt is acting a little strange today.</i>

520
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,760
All right, go bring me High God Mo Yuan.

521
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,840
Aunt, have you forgotten?

522
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,079
Forgotten what?

523
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,440
Weren't you afraid the Crown Prince
would discover Mo Yuan

524
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,280
so you personally cast a spell
to hide Yanhua Cave?

525
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
Yes, Yanhua Cave.

526
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,440
Let's go to Yanhua Cave right now.

527
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,719
Son, wait here for me.

528
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>You really are here.</i>

529
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,380
You aren't Aunt!

530
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,440
Mi Gu, don't be silly.

531
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,800
When Aunt sees Mo Yuan, she always
does a salute as his disciple!

532
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,280
You aren't Aunt. You are Xuan Nu!

533
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,760
You traitor! How dare you
come to Qing Qiu?

534
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,920
Aunt!

535
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,239
No...

536
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,199
Aunt, what orders do you have?

537
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,920
Bring me the young prince.

538
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
Yes.

539
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,400
Why don't I save the beauty
when she falls into the water?

540
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:21,079
No, no. What if the beauty falls for me?
Wouldn't that be even more troublesome?

541
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,880
Qian Qian, I haven't seen you in days.
I missed you terribly.

542
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:34,119
Have you missed me?

543
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:42,039
I came to tell you some important news.

544
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,719
Do you know who was reincarnated as
Yuan Zhen's father in this lifetime?

545
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:54,856
