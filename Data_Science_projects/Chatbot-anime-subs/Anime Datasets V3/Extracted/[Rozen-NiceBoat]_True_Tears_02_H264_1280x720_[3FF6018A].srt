1
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:59,280
<i>Shinichirou has a cockroach under his shoe~♪</i>

2
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,650
<i>Shinichirou has a cockroach under his shoe~♪</i>

3
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,190
You're strong.

4
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,940
You really liked it, right?

5
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,020
But even so...

6
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,130
I'm sad.

7
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,220
Really, really sad.

8
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,960
Isurugi Noe...

9
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,770
Because... I lost my tears.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,140
What I'm going to tell you is something I've never told anybody else.

11
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,460
I need you to trust me on this. {"And since I am telling you, I need you to trust me."}

12
00:02:59,450 --> 00:02:59,840
Trust-?

13
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,250
What is... what are tears?

14
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,110
Well, for example when you are sad...

15
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,630
That's not what I meant. What are tears?{Not that kind of tears... now, what are tears?}

16
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,010
Umm... In order to clear the eyes, the tear glands secrete... {was "Well... It's the secretion of the lacrimal gland as a result of the over-reaction of feelings."}

17
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,820
I have high expectations of you. {Could be "I have high expectations of you"}

18
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,890
Eh?

19
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,760
I have a mission. {was "I have a task to retrieve all the tears"}

20
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,180
I have to go and retrieve my tears. {And these tears, are specially selected}

21
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,490
For that reason, I need the tears of someone special.{To do that, I need tears from a few select others.}{This line and the two before were misplaced. Corrected. The TL should be better too.}

22
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,730
Umm, could that be... {"would it be that"}

23
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,750
Although Raigou-maru died an unnatural death,{Raigou-maru wa hi go no shi togeta kedo} {it indeed left me some memories}

24
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,240
I still have a replacement.

25
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,350
This is a secret between the two of us, okay? {Missing Translation Again O_o}

26
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,640
What would you do if I told somebody?

27
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,960
Come on, say something.

28
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,700
I thought that since it was you, you'd believe me. {was "I am sure that you trust me."}

29
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,070
Umm...

30
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
See you tomorrow at school!

31
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,610
Did I really believe that?

32
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,100
Seconds, please.

33
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,850
Okay.

34
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,870
Have some more, Shin-chan. The rice we used today is different from always.

35
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,030
So, have you decided yet?

36
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,460
Not yet...

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,960
When is the due date of your school's application?

38
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,370
I will make sure to do it next time.

39
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,030
I see...

40
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,900
Oh yeah, Shin-chan. You know, about yesterday...

41
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,290
Thank you for the meal.

42
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,540
Tea, please.

43
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,700
Coming.

44
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,170
I'm quite naive... {He seems to talk about not being adult-like, but this should do}

45
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,470
Especially since mom didn't go against that.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,960
On top of that, my work didn't get selected.

47
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,040
So if I give my tears to that girl...

48
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,390
What'll happen to me?

49
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,890
Maybe I'll become incapable of crying?

50
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,930
Well, who cares about that anyway.

51
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,990
Come on, your lunch's old nowadays.

52
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,190
If you want to, I'll switch with you anytime.

53
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,950
You'd give your lunch away despite the fact it has motherly love written all over it? {"...to give away your lunch?"}

54
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,910
But, I will take that banana of yours for dessert.

55
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Just what the hell was my mom thinking when she put a banana in my lunch?

56
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,590
It means that she cares about you, right?

57
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:03,560
You know, that girl's kind of strange even at school... I mean, she asked you out in public.

58
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,390
You are incredible.

59
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,420
Idiots who eat tamago-yaki dropped on the ground are even more incredible.

60
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,100
Living under the same roof as Yuasa Hiromi,

61
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,660
On top of that, falling for Isurugi Noe.

62
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,990
Why are you the only one? {Now, what kind of a guy is that?}

63
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,850
On top of that, someone who eats others' lunch.

64
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,750
What's up, pimp?

65
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,980
What is it?

66
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm giving you these.

67
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,170
Giving it to me?

68
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,240
But... this is bird food.

69
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,800
You don't want them?

70
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,150
I don't want them.

71
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,680
I love looking at Shinichirou!

72
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,400
Since you seem like you're somewhere close to the sky.

73
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,560
So I really am taking Raigou-maru's place?

74
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Oh? {Do a sick effect you lazy Typesetters >_>}

75
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,310
What?

76
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,040
Is it really fine with you if he's taken away?

77
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,350
You thought it was perfectly safe since the two of you live together?

78
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,620
It's not like Shinichirou-kun and I have that kind of a relationship.

79
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,100
Woops, maybe I said too much. {Just what is she thinking?}{Kinsei ni furechatta ka mo na}

80
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,440
I heard a racoon killed a chicken here the other day.

81
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,870
Is this grave the chicken's-

82
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,830
It's Raigou-maru's.

83
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,460
You know, there's still one in there, and yet you are making this a grave...

84
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,650
Bye.

85
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,120
Wow, Hiromi! You've already declared war with her?{Had the two of you declared war already?}

86
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,620
It's not like that.

87
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,590
Rai...

88
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,180
Raigou-maru...

89
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,020
's grave?

90
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,890
Now, isn't this a cage?

91
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,030
On top of that, there's still one inside.

92
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,930
What do you want?

93
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,730
You brought something else for-

94
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,160
Shinichirou-kun, you know Isurugi Noe?

95
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,960
Have you heard of the strange rumors about her?

96
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,760
Yeah, I heard of them from Nobuse.

97
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,760
It's THAT, right?

98
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,780
Exchanging e-mails with someone who lives underground.

99
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,490
Just stupid, isn't it?

100
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,320
On top of that, I heard that she's hitting on a guy passing by while climbing trees?

101
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,630
I held the bottle towards the sun.

102
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,860
Staring at the sparkling liquid inside.

103
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,570
Suddenly, everything else became dark.

104
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,870
And, I opened my eyes.

105
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,520
Maybe I should trust her, since it's just exchanging emails with someone who lives underground.

106
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,560
And just forget about someone ever hitting on me like a chicken.

107
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,050
Good morning.

108
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,810
Good morning.

109
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,170
Good morning, Shin-chan.

110
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,830
Good morning.

111
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,640
Thank you for the meal.

112
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,260
Bye! {"going to school." ???}

113
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,570
Shouldn't you hurry up and go as well?

114
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,020
I have a request.

115
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,840
Oh, we've been waiting! {"That was long" :S}

116
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,380
Wh- What is it?

117
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,460
Suspicious... {"That's strange..."}

118
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
Give me two of the white ones, please!

119
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,720
Right away!

120
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,310
Now, tell me about that request earlier.

121
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,480
Well you see, she wants me to introduce her to Isurugi Noe.

122
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,860
Huh?

123
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,000
How many times must I repeat myself?

124
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,470
Hiromi wants me... to introduce her... to Isurugi Noe.

125
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,090
Hiromi wants me... to introduce her... to Isurugi Noe.

126
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,130
Hiromi wants me... to introduce her... to Isurugi Noe.

127
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,360
Oh...

128
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,180
Why? {?}

129
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,420
Well... maybe she wants to be friends with her? {WTF ......????? Missing lines}

130
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,020
If you don't eat it straight away, our delicious Imagawa-yaki here will become cold.

131
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,850
I think you should learn how to treat your customers.

132
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,660
But, think about it, maybe Yuasa-san has that kind of interest?

133
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,190
Interest? What do you mean by that?

134
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,260
Well... How do you put it...

135
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,150
Traditional, is it?

136
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,260
Well, seems like it's fun to stand by and watch this sort of erotic things happen...

137
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,230
Come on, tell me what do you mean by interest.

138
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,970
But well, it's great that my girlfriend has a keen eye.

139
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,450
Right, Ai-chan?

140
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,390
You fool.

141
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,510
You seem happy.

142
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,850
Well, I'm not really happy.

143
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,460
Especially since something sad happened.

144
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,610
But...

145
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,100
I saw a sparkling light, in front of the darkness of despair.

146
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,530
First I saw Isurugi Noe on the tree.

147
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,580
After that, the chickens were assulted by a racoon.

148
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,460
And then, I got these seeds.

149
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,020
What follows is Hiromi talking to me.

150
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,920
When I saw her this morning...

151
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,650
Cockroach...

152
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,650
Cockroach...

153
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,680
<i>"Shinichirou has a cockroach under his shoe~♪"</i>

154
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,040
In the bottle exists a monster, disguised as an angel.

155
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,590
I am trapped.

156
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,880
As I see the other bottle nearby,

157
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,360
I see someone who is locked up, like me.

158
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,070
A girl that's crying.

159
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,080
That's right...

160
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,500
If she's going to take someone's tears,

161
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,000
It shouldn't be mine, but Hiromi's.

162
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,540
You seem to be pretty popular...

163
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,380
There's a girl that wants to make friends with you.

164
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,050
I'll introduce you. When is it okay? She's quite a nice girl.

165
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,950
I'm sure you'll like her.

166
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,900
Raigou-maru's grave... it's done!

167
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,340
Oh? So you get things done properly, after all.

168
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,700
Tomoyo!

169
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,280
Nice shoot!

170
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,730
I...

171
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,510
I...

172
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,980
Hiromi, what are you doing?

173
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,590
Shinichirou-kun, where are you?

174
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,090
Don't leave me alone!

175
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,850
I... What do I want to do?

176
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,480
Hiromi, are you alright?

177
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,250
Are you alright?

178
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:30,670
Yeah...

179
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,100
Hiromi, are you alright?

180
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,470
You seem to be a little out of it today.

181
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,330
Perhaps you should take some rest.

182
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,740
Yes.

183
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,200
Are you okay, Hiromi?

184
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,370
Yeah... I'm sorry.

185
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,940
Alright then, everyone back into position. It's a 2-on-2.

186
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,040
Umm...

187
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,410
You made the grave, right?

188
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,810
Y- Yeah...

189
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,950
I think a grave should be properly made.

190
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,080
But maybe it was wrong of me to make that decision alone.

191
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,030
That's right, I did it the wrong way.

192
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,580
I- I didn't mean that your way of doing it was wrong...

193
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,270
I heard from Nakagami Shinichirou that you want to be friends with me.

194
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,530
I see... umm...

195
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,440
That's a lie, right?

196
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,930
You lied to Nakagami Shinichirou, right?

197
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,220
A lie? Why would you say that?

198
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,030
That's because you don't like me.

199
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,280
It's alright, I'm not mad.

200
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,450
What's wrong, Hiromi? Are you okay?

201
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,830
Hey you, hold on!

202
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,590
Forget it... it's my fault.

203
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,060
Are you done with your break yet?

204
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,900
That's bad...

205
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,370
Anyways, let's go back in first.

206
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,210
Sorry for the wait, we're coming back now!

207
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,360
I see you talked to Isurugi Noe.

208
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,480
About the details...

209
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,230
It's fine.

210
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,020
What do you mean it's fine?

211
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,080
Isurugi-san declined.

212
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,720
She told me she can't be friends with me.

213
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,970
That girl...

214
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,490
I am sorry.

215
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,720
Well...

216
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,370
I didn't actually want to make friends with her.

217
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,130
Huh?

218
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,730
I am sorry.

219
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,860
But... then why...

220
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,670
But... I think Isurugi-san is amazing.

221
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,950
Since she saw through me.

222
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,280
Huh? Isurugi Noe?

223
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,760
Someone came to pick her up on a bike?

224
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,420
Don't leave me alone...

225
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,050
Don't leave me alone, Shinichirou-kun.

226
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,790
Who?

227
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,600
How did it go? What we talked about the other day.
