1
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,342
I am still sleepy.

2
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:25,718
Ah, I can’t!

3
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:27,915
I have to clean the yard.

4
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,028
Still sleepy after all.

5
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:40,201
Can I help you?

6
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:46,266
– Eriol-kun…
– Good afternoon.

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,174
Hello, are you returning home 
from shopping?

8
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:52,443
Yes, I bought some ingredients
for dinner tonight.

9
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:55,343
Eriol, you cook your own meals?

10
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:56,482
So impressive

11
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:58,847
Sakura-san as well,
I’m impressed to see

12
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:00,887
you taking care of the various
chores around the house.

13
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:06,293
Allow me to assist?

14
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,890
It’s not too good.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,926
There’s no need to reserved.

16
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:13,228
But if you return home late.

17
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,969
Won’t your parents be worried?

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,268
It’s alright.

19
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:20,006
Thanks.

20
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:26,840
[Sakura and the Panic Bicycle]

21
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,032
Allow me. Should I set it over there?

22
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:46,697
Yes. Thanks.

23
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:15,991
Are you all done?

24
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,202
Then let’s go back to the front.

25
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,505
– Thanks.
– Sakura.

26
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,933
Dinner’s ready!

27
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,703
Let me introduce you.
This is my father.

28
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,548
He is a college professor.

29
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:36,145
Hiiragizawa Eriol.

30
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,448
He transferred to
our school this September

31
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,184
and we ended up in the same class.

32
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,815
I’m Hiiragizawa Eriol.

33
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,284
I’m Kinomoto Fujitaka.

34
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,359
He lives nearby too.

35
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,831
He stopped by on his way home

36
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:49,790
to help me clean

37
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,258
Is that so.

38
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,198
Thank you.

39
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,303
Not at all.
That’s right!

40
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:58,566
Eriol, do you want to eat dinner with us

41
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:01,233
You helped me out
with the cleaning after all.

42
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:02,541
Yes please.

43
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,071
We have snacks inside as well.

44
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:06,406
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:08,583
I would very much like to
eat dinner with you as well,

46
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:12,314
but I have to return home and
prepare dinner tonight…

47
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:13,684
I see…

48
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,823
– Please invite me again.
– Sure, you bet.

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,892
Then, I’ll see you tomorrow in school…

50
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,030
Ok, see you tomorrow.

51
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,131
You have your work cut out for you…

52
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,583
Let’s eat!

53
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:44,250
Help yourself.

54
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:50,518
So good.

55
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:52,393
It would’ve been nice

56
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,730
if Eriol were eating with us

57
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:57,223
If he’s in the same class as you

58
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,593
that means he’s in the 5th Grade, right

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,770
He doesn’t look like it.
He’s very composed.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,998
It’s because he’s nice and very mature…

61
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,410
He also does well in his studies,
and he’s a…

62
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:12,347
Good cook.

63
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,451
You seem to be sleepy a lot recently.

64
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,681
Are you OK?

65
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,152
Y… Yes!!

66
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,252
I woke up because the food is so good.

67
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:23,481
Can you sleep at night?

68
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,827
I’m getting my rest.

69
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,827
Really, there’s nothing wrong
so you don’t worried.

70
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,498
This one’s so delicious!

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,531
So delicious! This one too!

72
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:42,740
Who could it be?

73
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:46,606
I’m home.

74
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,318
Weren’t you supposed to be late
because of work tonight?

75
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:51,251
I just came to get something I forgot.

76
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:52,812
Have you eaten dinner yet?

77
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,280
I’ll be returning soon so.

78
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:11,673
– Sakura.
– What?!

79
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,471
Did you touch my bicycle?

80
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,514
Huh? Umm…

81
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,144
Oh, I moved it a little when
I was cleaning the yard.

82
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,425
Don’t ride my bicycle.

83
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,358
I won’t.

84
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,095
My feet can’t even reach the pedals.

85
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,062
Ah! The last piece of fried shrimp!!
Brother!!!

86
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,371
I’m leaving.
Good-bye.

87
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,635
Big brother, that’s so mean!!

88
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,542
You know fried shrimp is my favourite!!

89
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:59,885
Is Sakura’s father working this late?

90
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,583
He sure is a hard worker.

91
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,991
Your father made dinner tonight,
didn’t he?

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,733
What about dessert?

93
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:14,993
Yup…

94
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:17,067
You brought back
some dessert for me, right?

95
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,708
Wow, pudding!
It is pudding!

96
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,443
It is my beloved pudding!

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,643
That’s my Sakura-sama.

98
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,042
Pudding, Pudding, Pudding,
Pudding, Pudding, Pudding…

99
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,884
Sleepy.

100
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:35,688
It is probably because
you’re transforming

101
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,126
the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards.

102
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,563
It’s OK because today is Sunday,

103
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,362
but I’ll be in trouble
during the school week.

104
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:48,470
But with the magic power
you have right now…

105
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:53,433
Until all the cards
are transformed,

106
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:55,540
your magic and mental powers
will be drained.

107
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,608
– Hey Kero-chan.
– What’s it?

108
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,376
I’m getting a weird feeling
from the Clow Cards.

109
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,251
Weird?

110
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:42,021
Before, I would get a sense of warmth

111
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,984
and energy

112
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,851
from the Clow Cards

113
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,534
But now it’s cold.

114
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,607
It’s true!

115
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,672
The remaining Clow Cards are so cold!

116
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,844
Why?

117
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:07,807
Hmm, how can I explain
it so it’s easy to understand?

118
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:10,007
These cards, you see,

119
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,748
they move by the power
of the keeper’s magic.

120
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,086
Before you sealed the cards,

121
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,790
they were moving under

122
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:18,857
the supervision of the magic
left over by Clow Reed.

123
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,690
Magic is food for the cards.

124
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:23,824
Food?

125
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,269
So, after you become the new master

126
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,765
by collecting all the cards
after they were spread out…

127
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,733
My magic

128
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,632
was being cosumed?

129
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:34,500
That’s right!

130
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,239
But right now,

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,704
the Clow cards can’t be used
coz there’s an interference…

132
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:39,807
In other words,

133
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,616
the cards are still asleep

134
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:44,578
If it is in a sleeping state…

135
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,182
The food can’t be eaten…

136
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,021
If the food can’t be eaten?

137
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,191
What happens?

138
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,056
They become ordinary cards.

139
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:01,734
I won’t be able to meet
with the Cards anymore?

140
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:03,602
Umm… yeah.

141
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:04,837
I can’t let that happen.

142
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,232
I was finally able to become
good friends with them!

143
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:08,768
Therefore,

144
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,238
the ones that are transformed
to Sakura Cards are fine.

145
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,081
Since we just said that

146
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,848
the source of the Sakura Card
is your magic…

147
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,388
O Key which hides the power of the stars,

148
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,723
reveal thy true form before me.

149
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:29,663
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

150
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,795
Release!

151
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,240
Wh What are you planning to do?

152
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,372
I’m going to turn them
all into Sakura Cards.

153
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:47,578
Say what?

154
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,685
O Card that Clow has made,

155
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,645
I command you to lose your
old form and be reborn.

156
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:57,118
Under the new master, Sakura!

157
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:07,235
Sweet!

158
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,498
Lock!

159
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,973
Libra!

160
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,002
Song!

161
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:18,742
Voice!

162
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,575
Change!

163
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:22,373
Loop!

164
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,617
Dash!

165
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:36,229
Sakura!

166
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,632
Why are you being so reckless?

167
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,470
Your magic power is drained right now

168
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,241
so if you try to change them all at once,
of course you’re going to collapse.

169
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,621
I’m so glad, you’re all
still full of energy!

170
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:06,891
Sakura!!

171
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,161
That one, Dash.

172
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:24,406
What’s going on?
The magic has run away relentlessly.

173
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,113
I didn’t even use Dash, so why?

174
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,816
It’s because it’s impossible

175
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,352
to transform those cards all at once

176
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:11,121
That, and the fact that
the card was initated

177
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,759
without any reason

178
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,857
and Dash didn’t know

179
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,229
what to do so it went
into a panic state.

180
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,330
Considering your magic power
and precision at the moment,

181
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,773
you can’t use magic when
there’s no need for it.

182
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:25,732
On top of that,

183
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,305
transforming that many cards
into Sakura cards,

184
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,042
You idiot!

185
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:36,041
Of course,
I’m worried about the Clow Cards,

186
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:37,942
but if something happens to you

187
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,184
then the Sakura Cards
lose their magic as well.

188
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,760
In any case, we must stop Dash
and calm it down.

189
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,704
O Card created by Clow,

190
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,705
discard thine old form and be reborn.

191
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,376
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

192
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,277
Windy!

193
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,986
It looks like Windy can’t catch up to it.

194
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,025
Oh! That’s right.

195
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:37,440
Hey!! What’re you doing
making a phone call now?!

196
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,039
But, I promised

197
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,977
Li-kun and Tomoyo
that I’d contact them.

198
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,849
Think about the time
and the place!!

199
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,553
[You have reached the
Daidouji Residence.]

200
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,747
[I am unable to pick up
the phone right now.]

201
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,787
[Please leave your message
after the beep.]

202
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:54,561
I guess Tomoyo’s not there.
I’ll leave her a message.

203
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,624
Listen when someone is talking to you!!!

204
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:01,865
Next is Li…

205
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:11,504
Hello.

206
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,779
Li-kun? It’s me Sakura…

207
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:16,210
What’s it?

208
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,443
We’re chasing a bicycle right now.

209
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,115
Without thinking,

210
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:22,821
I tried to change all the cards at once,

211
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:24,887
and Dash ran away… 
And then…

212
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:26,789
I can’t understand
what you’re trying to say!

213
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,322
Anyway we’re in big trouble!

214
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:29,625
Where are you right now?

215
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,660
In the park, heading towards the library.

216
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,595
Alright, I’ll be right there!

217
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,338
Ok!
Look! You lost the card

218
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,708
because you were concentrating
on your phone call!!

219
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:43,943
Jump!

220
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,077
There it is.

221
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,791
No, you can’t do that!

222
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:08,994
Sakura!

223
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,741
God of Wind, obey my order!

224
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,922
Stop being so reckless!

225
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:31,050
Are you ok?

226
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,529
You came here pretty fast, kid.

227
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,723
I didn’t really.

228
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,727
Thanks for coming.

229
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:47,333
Is that it?

230
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:53,215
Thunder, come!

231
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,654
Damn.

232
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,027
One more time!!

233
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:14,366
Don’t! You’ll scare the card!

234
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:15,963
But if you leave it like that…

235
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,867
It’s my fault, if we’re calm,

236
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,200
I am sure Dash will come back
to us peacefully.

237
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:26,915
OK. I understand.

238
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,049
What’re you planning on doing, Sakura?

239
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,622
Using Fly, get in the air… 
No,

240
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,060
following Dash in its panic state

241
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,487
is too much even in my true form.

242
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:43,192
Don’t think Fly would work either.

243
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,659
If we can somehow get ahead

244
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,435
so Dash can’ t go anywhere.

245
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,262
It might work!!

246
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,176
Loop, huh?

247
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:57,273
Yeah, but then you have
to transform another card.

248
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:00,778
This time,
it won’t end with you just fainting.

249
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,510
But it’s my fault

250
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:04,786
that Dash is like this,

251
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,178
I have to try and
turn it back into a card!

252
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,494
All right!
If you faint,

253
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,129
I’ll be sure and catch you!

254
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:19,961
Go for it Sakura!

255
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,515
O Card that Clow has made,

256
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,145
I command you to lose
your old form and be reborn.

257
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,055
Under the new master, Sakura!

258
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,623
Loop!

259
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,832
I see. Loop, is it?

260
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,467
But what’ll you
do about the frightened Dash?

261
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:34,736
WINDY

262
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,680
Don’t hurt it.

263
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:56,328
It’s alright.
You don’t have to be scared.

264
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:00,699
I’m sorry I fightened you.

265
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:04,899
It’s alright now.

266
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,337
You’re a good kid,
so stay still. Ok?

267
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:15,276
That tickles.
I’m sorry.

268
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:17,613
I won’t frighten you anymore so please,

269
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,418
turn back into a card.

270
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,370
Thank goodness…

271
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:42,711
You did it, Sakura!

272
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:46,244
Kero,

273
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,975
if there’s a reason to use magic
and if it’s little by little,

274
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,285
Then it’s OK to change

275
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,020
the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, right?
That’s right.

276
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,423
I don’t know why strange events

277
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,024
keep turning up in Tomoeda

278
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,591
or why I can’t use the magic power

279
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:06,797
from the Clow Cards

280
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:09,328
But I’ll do my best

281
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,062
to change all the cards

282
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,566
And then,
when I’ve changed all the cards

283
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:16,175
and when my magic
becomes stronger,

284
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:17,436
I might find out

285
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,676
why all these strange
events keep happening.

286
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:21,379
Exactly!!

287
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:25,276
Allright! I’ll do my best.

288
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:28,015
Sakura!
What’s wrong?

289
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,887
Sleepy…

290
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,125
It’s because you overdid it!

291
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,632
Hey! Wake up!!!

292
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,031
I can’t go on without you…

293
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:42,802
Get a hold of yourself…!

294
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:49,744
I didn’t make it on time!

295
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,613
It just ended right now!

296
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,709
Who would’ve thought that

297
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,610
I would get a phone call from
Sakura while I was taking short bath?

298
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,214
I even brought the costume…

299
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:06,923
Well there’s no need to worry
because I was by her side.

300
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,258
At least… At least…

301
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:13,792
Let me get Sakura-chan’s

302
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,668
cute sleeping face on video!!

303
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:21,866
The batteries are running out!!

304
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,011
Really, I’m so careless today!

305
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:28,540
Get my cool pose as well!!

306
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,382
Sakura’s smiling face is so cute!!

307
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,649
Are you listening to me, Tomoyo?!

308
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:35,584
Really Sakura is…

309
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,859
Sakura is so ñute!!

310
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,521
Are you listening to me, Tomoyo?!

311
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,024
Being able to shoot Sakura like this

312
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,831
forever makes me so happy

313
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:49,103
Are you listening to me, Tomoyo?!!!!?
