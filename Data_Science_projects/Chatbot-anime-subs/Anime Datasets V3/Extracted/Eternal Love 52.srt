<i>[Episode 52]</i>

3
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,914
<i>It's a promise then.</i>

4
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,405
<i>You can't marry anyone else.</i>

5
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:23,893
<i>I'll come and visit you
when I have the time.</i>

6
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,748
<i>When you're all grown up, I'll marry you.</i>

7
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,836
<i>Ye Hua, you loved to read
when you were a child.</i>

8
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:58,049
<i>Who would have expected you to be
the same as your mortal self?</i>

9
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,895
Little man.

10
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,223
You're talking to me?

11
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,557
Little man.

12
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:22,454
Who are you?

13
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,258
Do you not know me?

14
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:42,555
Your Highness, the Crown Prince
took the amnesia potion.

15
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,361
It's normal that he doesn't know you.

16
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,079
Don't be upset.

17
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,491
It isn't that.

18
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,014
I know that he doesn't remember me.

19
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:56,377
It's just that seeing him at this age
reminds me of the time

20
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,777
we spent together
in the Celestial Palace.

21
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:03,342
Back then, that mortal,
Su Su, didn't exist.

22
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,770
Nor was there Qing Qiu's Bai Qian.

23
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:11,118
I was the only one in the Nine Heavens
who could keep him company.

24
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,776
Indeed.

25
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:15,608
I've served Your Highness since then.

26
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:21,139
I remember that Prince Yang Cuo
made you the Crown Prince's playmate.

27
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:25,721
Back then, Your Highness was
still very playful.

28
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,922
You often teased the Crown Prince
until he frowned.

29
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,317
It was so cute.

30
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,471
Indeed.

31
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,653
Ye Hua has always been
very pretty since he was a child.

32
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:38,160
He didn't like to talk much,
nor was he lively.

33
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,072
I had to tease him for a long time
to get a reply from him.

34
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,485
I've been by his side since he was born.

35
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:54,185
He's my only kin.

36
00:04:55,538 --> 00:05:00,697
I treat him wholeheartedly and
valued him more than my own life.

37
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,666
What are those other women
compared to me?

38
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:24,245
Young Master, you must be
tired from your studies.

39
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,622
Why don't you continue tomorrow?

40
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,521
Master.

41
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,778
Father.

42
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,872
You're studying hard again?

43
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:39,778
What good deeds have I done to get
such a self-motivated child?

44
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:43,396
Our Liu Family relies on you
to make our family proud.

45
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,762
Come here.

46
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,103
This is your older cousin, Su Jin.

47
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,237
She will be staying
in our manor for a few days.

48
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,124
Take her as your playmate.

49
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,543
Hey! Aren't you going to greet me?

50
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,105
Are you a mute?

51
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,264
There are books in the back.

52
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,752
You can go and read them.

53
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:12,156
Don't disturb me.

54
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:40,572
Why have you come home so late today?

55
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:43,531
You just started in the Imperial College
and there's so much homework?

56
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,988
Look at you. You're drenched.

57
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,341
What will you do if you get sick?

58
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,206
Seriously, Sixteenth.

59
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:17,509
He said that
he's been guarding Kunlun Mountain

60
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,524
but he didn't even
clean the wine cellar....

61
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:27,100
These men are all so lazy.

62
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:35,764
Who knew that the lazy Seventeenth
had changed after 70,000 years?

63
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,394
Master, you're here?

64
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:41,052
Look! Is this place tidied up well?

65
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,418
It's very clean.

66
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:52,968
Master, do you remember?

67
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,303
Back then, I made such a big fuss
over the break up with Li Jing.

68
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,495
Master was forced to leave
your meditation early.

69
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:05,077
It was right here that you drank with me.

70
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:09,742
Did you already know that
I was a girl then?

71
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:12,690
Since the moment you stepped
into the Grand Hall of Kunlun Mountain

72
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,399
I knew that you were Fox King
Bai Zhi's youngest daughter.

73
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,894
Why did you still take me
as your disciple?

74
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:22,677
Isn't it a rule in Kunlun Mountain
not to take female disciples?

75
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,978
Why do you think I took you in?

76
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,119
It was definitely because of
Zhe Yan, right?

77
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,195
Master is such an easygoing person.

78
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,794
You must have been scared of being
pestered by that old phoenix.

79
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:39,159
Master probably didn't know then

80
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,554
that taking me in as your female disciple
would be even more troublesome.

81
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:47,850
You even had to take
my godly ascension trial.

82
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:53,549
Speaking of which,
all I did then was cry.

83
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,785
I haven't even thanked Master properly.

84
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,232
Zhe Yan told me that
you pierced your heart

85
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,523
to feed me your blood
for 70,000 years.

86
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,905
Is that true?

87
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:11,702
Master is my benefactor.

88
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:15,988
If I have to sacrifice
my life for you, I will.

89
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,639
I think that it was totally worthwhile

90
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,798
to offer blood from my heart
to keep Master intact.

91
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:34,884
If I hadn't sacrificed my spirit to
seal the Bell of the East Emperor...

92
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:39,740
would you still be here
in Kunlun Mountain today?

93
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,100
Definitely.

94
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,534
I wanted to stay in
Kunlun Mountain forever.

95
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,654
Stay in Kunlun Mountain forever?

96
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:52,833
I don't mind if Master makes
fun of me about it

97
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,527
but when I broke up with Li Jing

98
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,279
I was too upset and I thought

99
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,568
that I'd just stay
in Kunlun Mountain forever.

100
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,889
I could keep Master company
and stay forever carefree

101
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:05,690
while learning Taoism. How nice.

102
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:11,244
As a woman, you have to
get married sooner or later.

103
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:15,658
Even if you wanted to stay,
your parents wouldn't have agreed.

104
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:21,245
Ye Hua wasn't around then

105
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,602
and I hadn't thought of being
with anyone forever.

106
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:26,604
Indeed...

107
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:29,464
Ye Hua wasn't around then.

108
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,581
Seventeenth.

109
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:44,293
Do you know why I worked unceasingly
for 70,000 years to repair my spirit?

110
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,148
I do.

111
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:52,214
Zhe Yan said that you would never
disappoint those you care about.

112
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,017
Back at Ruoshui Riverbank

113
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:58,368
Master told all the disciples of
Kunlun Mountain that you'd return.

114
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,259
We knew that you would.

115
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,181
You worked so hard for us.

116
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,732
I've never disappointed
those I cared about...

117
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,436
That's true.

118
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,530
I did it for the one I cared about.

119
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:24,658
I know that Master cares about all of us.

120
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,615
I remember when Master rescued me
from Grand Ziming Palace.

121
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:46,831
It was because you cared.

122
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,389
How nice.

123
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,984
Master has finally returned.

124
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:57,495
Yes, I've returned.

125
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,950
Seventeenth.

126
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,404
An honored guest has asked for you.

127
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:09,457
Come quickly!

128
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:10,677
An honored guest?

129
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:12,667
Master, do join us.

130
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,895
Master, come with us.

131
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,758
Look, how cute is he?

132
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:29,719
He does look quite lovely.

133
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,875
Where is the honored guest?

134
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,744
- Master!
- Master!

135
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,568
Mother!

136
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,768
What brings you here?

137
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:44,730
Come here to greet my mentor,
High God Mo Yuan.

138
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,845
A-Li greets High God Mo Yuan.

139
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:03,663
Get up.

140
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,789
Thank you, High God.

141
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:13,998
I'm here on Father's behalf to
greet High God with Lord Dong Hua.

142
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:18,011
It's just that Lord Dong Hua has
lost his powers temporarily

143
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,402
so A-Li had to come here alone.

144
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,318
Your father is...

145
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,668
Crown Prince of the Nine Heavens, Ye Hua.

146
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,677
He's... he's that future husband of mine.

147
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:39,716
A-Li, your father is
my mentor's twin brother.

148
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:41,400
He's the son of the Heavenly Father.

149
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,357
His spirit sunk into a deep sleep
after a huge battle.

150
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,153
He turned into a golden lotus
and rested in this lotus pond.

151
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:51,595
Then due to a series of coincidences
he was born as Crown Prince Ye Hua.

152
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:55,674
Father is the younger brother
of Mother's mentor?

153
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,990
How should I address High God Mo Yuan?

154
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,472
Uncle? Or Grand Master?

155
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:07,023
Mother, this difference in hierarchy
seems to be quite huge.

156
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:11,899
Why don't we wait until
we can ask your father about it?

157
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:18,581
Who would have thought?

158
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,249
You're not married yet
and your child is already so grown up.

159
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,514
Seventeenth, you've really impressed me.

160
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,948
Exactly.

161
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,561
Seventeenth got ahead of us.

162
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:30,900
She's definitely the first
among us to have a child.

163
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,110
- Exactly.
- Yes.

164
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,267
Look at Senior.

165
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,679
He's still all alone by himself.

166
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,860
Don't you feel bad?

167
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,871
Master is also still single, isn't he?

168
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,000
Why would you single me out?

169
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,768
Don't frighten my Riceball.

170
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,167
Go and play now.

171
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,648
How adorable! Come here!

172
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,530
How cute. Look at his tiny face.

173
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,580
It's snowing.

174
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,980
Aren't you going to take a look?

175
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,816
Little nerd, I have a secret to tell you.

176
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,625
My parents told me that your father has
asked to have me marry you.

177
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,177
Ridiculous! I'll go and break
this engagement off right away!

178
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,981
No! I want to marry you!

179
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,995
You've been holding on
to this all the time.

180
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,298
Who gave it to you?

181
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,067
- Give it back to me!
- I won't!

182
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,400
- Give it back!
- I won't!

183
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,070
- Give it back to me!
- No!

184
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:46,706
Give it back to me!

185
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:47,797
I won't!

186
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:49,865
Give it back!

187
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,159
Young Master, what's wrong?

188
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,312
Give it back to me!

189
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,630
Ye Hua, come back here!

190
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,912
Young Mistress Su Jin, are you crazy?

191
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:01,475
Who is Ye Hua?

192
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:03,505
How dare you speak to
Young Master like this?

193
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,488
Even Master and Mistress have
to give in to Young Master's temper.

194
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,070
Why would you dare to touch his beads?

195
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,996
Whatever you do, you can't touch those.

196
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,740
They mean the world to Young Master.

197
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,466
Who gave them to him? Tell me!

198
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,686
I... I don't know.

199
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:19,282
I only know that
they're related to Qing Qiu.

200
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,373
Qing Qiu?

201
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,139
Do you know where it is?

202
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,039
Young Master has been searching
through ancient records for that place

203
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,039
but to no avail.

204
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,940
If you really know about it
tell him quickly.

205
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,082
He will be so happy.

206
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:31,197
I know about it. I definitely do.

207
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,269
Really?

208
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:33,380
Go and tell him now.

209
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,323
Young Master will be
very grateful to you.

210
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,768
No! I won't tell him!

211
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,477
I'll never tell him what Qing Qiu is!

212
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,539
Your Highness, does it hurt?

213
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:44,599
Get some rest, Your Highness.

214
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,211
You've been carving that
for two days now.

215
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:50,990
If you keep using your eyes
you might go blind.

216
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,026
No...

217
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:58,717
If I don't finish it soon,
it might be too late.

218
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,644
Xin Nu, look.

219
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,207
Do you think this wooden
figurine resembles that mortal, Su Su?

220
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,368
Your Highness...

221
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:24,855
I'm asking you.

222
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:28,942
Does it resemble her?

223
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:32,294
It's...

224
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:37,159
It's about two thirds similar now.

225
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,065
It has to be at least three quarters
similar to fool the Crown Prince.

226
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,942
Little Princess, since you returned
to the den

227
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,392
you haven't eaten or slept at all.

228
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:12,397
All you do is cry.

229
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,221
Are you trying to worry me sick?

230
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,699
What are you worried about?

231
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,981
Even my aunt doesn't care
about me anymore.

232
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:23,210
Little Princess,
Mi Gu watched you grow up.

233
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,204
You always have a say in
who you like and who you don't.

234
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,016
So what if you take
the throne as the Queen?

235
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:32,652
What does that have to do
with your affection for Lord Dong Hua?

236
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:36,345
You don't understand!

237
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,251
If I become the Queen,
I have to stay in Qing Qiu.

238
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,659
Who said that?

239
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:41,885
Am I not right?

240
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:44,981
Auntie can't be the Queen once
she marries Crown Prince Ye Hua.

241
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,589
She has to marry into the Nine Heavens.

242
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,560
Of course not.

243
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,355
Are you muddleheaded?

244
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,518
You're the muddleheaded one,
my Little Princess.

245
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,347
Why would Auntie
have to marry into the Nine Heavens?

246
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,788
Because Crown Prince Ye Hua
is the future Heavenly Lord.

247
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,282
He's the master of the world.

248
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:06,243
Hence, Auntie has to leave Qing Qiu to
marry into the Nine Heavens.

249
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:09,096
Because Auntie will be
the Heavenly Empress.

250
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,638
Exactly.

251
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:13,135
But who is Lord Dong Hua?

252
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:15,363
He was once the
God of Heaven and Earth.

253
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,746
But he's retired now.

254
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:20,567
He can go anywhere he wants,
or stay in the Heavens.

255
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,179
Who could hold him back?

256
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,513
Am I right?

257
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,051
That's true.

258
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,577
See?

259
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:30,076
Why would it matter if you become
the Queen of Qing Qiu?

260
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,553
It doesn't change anything.

261
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,720
I'd say that it would be better if
you were the Queen of Qing Qiu.

262
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,449
As the Queen of Qing Qiu

263
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:43,434
you'd have a lot more chances to
discuss matters in the Nine Heavens.

264
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:49,941
You just need to stand on one side
and Lord Dong Hua on the other.

265
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:52,386
You get to look at each other every day.

266
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,991
As time goes by, won't that
kindle some affection?

267
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,272
That's true.

268
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:02,383
In my opinion, you and Lord Dong Hua
just need some more time.

269
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,262
How long have you known him?

270
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:08,412
Didn't Lord Dong Hua fall in love
with you in the Mortal Realm?

271
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:10,989
If you get to spend more time together

272
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,470
how could Lord Ding Hua not fall for you?

273
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:16,770
Exactly!

274
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:19,146
Hurry up, Mi Gu! Waste no time!

275
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,788
Bring me the books of rites
for Qing Qiu's Queen.

276
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,059
I'm going to read them now.

277
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,741
That's my Little Princess.

278
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,730
Wait here. I'll get them from
the cellar for you.

279
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,772
Little Princess, you've been
reading all night.

280
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:44,328
Shouldn't you get some rest?

281
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,991
Auntie will marry the Crown Prince soon.

282
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,020
I can't waste any time.

283
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,009
The sooner I finish reading them,
the sooner I can take the throne.

284
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:55,776
The sooner I can attend
court sessions in the Nine Heavens.

285
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:58,534
This is it?

286
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,940
These are just a portion of the books.

287
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,008
The rest are the ancient teachings
of Qing Qiu.

288
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:05,711
Finish reading these first.

289
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,008
The others were all thrown
into the cellar by Auntie.

290
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,098
They are a bit damp.

291
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:10,298
I'll go and dry them off.

292
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:31,042
Star Lord.

293
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:36,061
I heard that Little Princess is soon
to become the Queen of Qing Qiu

294
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:38,678
so I've come to present
a small gift to you.

295
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:40,316
What gift is it?

296
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,502
I was going through some
ancient records of the Celestial Tribe

297
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,182
and I discovered something interesting

298
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,311
so I hurried over here to
hand it to Little Princess.

299
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:57,702
More ancient records?

300
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:01,792
This ancient record isn't
just any ancient record.

301
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:07,020
It's the record of Lord Dong Hua when
he was still the God of Heaven and Earth.

302
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,567
Some events recorded in here
might be of some help to you.

303
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,680
It's about Dong Hua?

304
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:33,307
<i>[Removed his name from
the Rock of Three Incarnations.]</i>

305
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:41,732
Are the records all true?

306
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:43,567
Definitely.

307
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,215
No wonder...

308
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:49,637
It's no wonder that even my aunt
persuaded me to give him up.

309
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:56,499
Are you using this record
to try to convince me too?

310
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:05,116
I think that Little Princess is entitled
to know the truth.

311
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:10,196
His Lordship isn't really
so cruel to you.

312
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:15,663
It's just that before you were born,
he had already made that decision.

313
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:25,220
It isn't that His Lordship hasn't
taken a liking to you.

314
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,030
His Lordship didn't take that
heavenly trial in the Mortal Realm

315
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,258
to experience the six
sufferings of the mortals

316
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:34,818
but to fulfill your wish
for a romance with him.

317
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:37,778
In the Celestial Palace, Lord Dong Hua is
tied down by his destiny.

318
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:39,603
He can't be with you.

319
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,711
However, in the Mortal Realm
he could defy destiny

320
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,655
in the name of taking on
a heavenly trial.

321
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:52,560
It might have only been a few years,
but His Lordship was true to you.

322
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,555
This is the truth that
I wish for you to know.

323
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,230
Lord Dong Hua...

324
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:01,553
He went to the Mortal Realm for me?

325
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,163
Exactly.

326
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,857
Therefore, before the Crown Prince went

327
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,973
to the Mortal Realm
for his heavenly trial

328
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,987
he'd already sent you to guard
Ruoshui and the Ghost Realm?

329
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,083
Indeed.

330
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:41,266
<i>Mo Yuan has just returned and trouble is
already stirring in the Ghost Realm.</i>

331
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,587
<i>Is something going to happen soon?</i>

332
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,574
Lord Dong Hua...

333
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,367
I don't wish to see you again.

334
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:46,558
Lord Dong Hua!
Lord Dong Hua!

335
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:47,954
What's the matter?

336
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,798
You used a third of
your power on that leap.

337
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,825
It's too much for me.

338
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:57,143
The Star Lord was telling the truth?

339
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,138
You've lost your powers since
you returned from the Mortal Realm?

340
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,575
Exactly.

341
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:06,605
Why didn't you tell me?

342
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,470
What is so shocking about that?

343
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:15,084
How can I not be shocked?

344
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:16,790
You were so powerful.

345
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,455
What will you do if you encounter
danger without your powers?

346
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:24,624
What danger will I encounter
in the Celestial Palace?

347
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:37,838
I've lost my powers temporarily
for returning to the Celestial Realm

348
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:40,224
before the end
of my scheduled 60-year trial.

349
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:43,115
Not even I can defy
the will of Heaven, you see?

350
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:47,013
But I'll be all right in a year or two.

351
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:52,644
I've cleared things up with you
so you can go home now.

352
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,410
Lord Dong Hua...

353
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,498
You purposely avoided me

354
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:04,435
because our names aren't
on the Rock of Three Incarnations?

355
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,605
How do you know about
the Rock of Three Incarnations?

356
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,385
Did Zhe Yan or Mo Yuan tell you about it?

357
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,044
Or was it your father?

358
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:16,829
But he promised me that
he wouldn't breathe a word of it to you.

359
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,613
Neither.

360
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,903
The Star Lord brought me
the Celestial Tribe's ancient records.

361
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:24,901
They said that you gave up
the heavenly throne.

362
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,263
Is that true?

363
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:32,701
You ruined your own destined
marriage recorded on the rock?

364
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:39,999
Is there no way to fix it?

365
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,310
I don't believe that.

366
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:50,085
It doesn't matter if you don't.

367
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:52,593
The Rock of Three Incarnations
records all destined marriages.

368
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,324
My name won't be on it.

369
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,632
It isn't just you, no one
will be in a relationship with me.

370
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:03,530
I don't believe that...

371
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,282
Stop fooling around!

372
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:16,763
I don't believe that your name can't be
on the Rock of Three Incarnations.

373
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:30,935
Every tail of a nine-tailed fox can
turn into a magical artifact by will.

374
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,951
I'm going to carve your name
into the Rock of Three Incarnations.

375
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,126
<i>There were ceaseless battles
in the realms then.</i>

376
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,480
<i>As the God of Heaven and Earth</i>

377
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,673
Lord Dong Hua defined
the law of the immortals

378
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:28,101
as well as life and death
in all six realms.

379
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,837
In order to make himself invulnerable

380
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:35,939
he removed his own name from
the Rock of Three Incarnations.

381
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,166
The Rock of Three Incarnations
determines all marriages.

382
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:46,923
Anyone whose name isn't on it,
won't be in any relationships.

383
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:54,037
No matter how long Lord Dong Hua lives,
he will always be single.

384
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,983
It isn't that he is deprived
of all emotion.

385
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,625
It's just his name isn't on the rock.

386
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,830
Whatever relationships he encountered

387
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,066
he regarded them
as ill-fated romance.

388
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:11,483
Little Princess, do you understand
what an ill-fated romance is?

389
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:16,471
It's just like what you both
went through in the Mortal Realm.

390
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:21,381
The relationship between you
and Lord Dong Hua will never end well.

391
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:40,359
Lord Dong Hua...

392
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,778
Lord Dong Hua...

393
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:54,336
Lord Dong Hua...

394
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,948
Where is your name?

395
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,217
Where is it?

396
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,353
Bai Feng Jiu...

397
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:13,989
That's impossible...

398
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,494
That's impossible…

399
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:22,111
How can that be right?

400
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,221
It can't be!

401
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:28,155
How can it be...

402
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,270
<i>Lord Dong Hua is the one I love!</i>

403
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,903
Little Princess.

404
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,483
Heed my advice.

405
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:49,059
If you remain so stubborn and continue
to defy the will of Heaven...

406
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,301
it won't do you much good.

407
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:55,276
It won't do Lord Dong Hua
any good either.

408
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:58,635
Those years you shared
in the Mortal Realm

409
00:32:58,635 --> 00:33:01,886
were but a few days in Heaven.

410
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,589
Yet that was enough to make
Lord Dong Hua lose his powers.

411
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,790
Although it's only temporary

412
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,201
and His Lordship will recover
in a year or two...

413
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,965
this serves as a warning to him.

414
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:21,942
If you insist on staying by his side

415
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:25,917
who knows how the two
of you will be punished?

416
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:32,161
Little Princess, it's not too late
to set things right.

417
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:37,865
Why?

418
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:48,257
<i>[Bai Qian and Ye Hua]
[Bai Feng Jiu and Lord Wen Chang]</i>

419
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:08,219
<i>Why is it gone?</i>

420
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,278
<i>How did that happen?</i>

421
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:14,081
Why?

422
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:23,983
Why?

423
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:27,333
How could it be? Dong Hua, tell me!

424
00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:35,635
How can it be?

425
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:15,389
It can't be...

426
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,798
What happened to Little Princess?

427
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:22,396
Take her to Qing Qiu right away.

428
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:26,097
The pain of losing a tail
is unbearable for a nine-tailed fox.

429
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:27,637
You violated the regulations.

430
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:30,849
Ancient records of the Celestial Tribe
aren't allowed outside the Nine Heavens.

431
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,347
As the Star Lord,
you violated the regulations knowingly.

432
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:35,661
Go to Lord Pu Hua for
your punishment.

433
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,746
I willingly accept the punishment.

434
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,552
Mi Gu!

435
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:53,485
What is it now?

436
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:55,048
- She cut off her own tail.
- What?

437
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,876
The loss of a nine-tailed fox's tail
is like digging one's heart out!

438
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,001
Is it really that bad?

439
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:00,351
All right now, give her to me.

440
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,902
I'll take her to the Peach Tree Woods.

441
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,641
Don't follow me.

442
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,043
High God! High God Zhe Yan!

443
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:15,623
Fourth Uncle!

444
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:17,481
Fourth Uncle!

445
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,175
I'm so forgetful.

446
00:37:20,175 --> 00:37:21,836
They have all gone to Kunlun Mountain.

447
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:26,514
Auntie!

448
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:28,219
Auntie!

449
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:31,420
Auntie!

450
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,547
You are...

451
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,391
Isn't this Seventeenth's niece?

452
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,186
Yes, this is our Little Princess.

453
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:40,791
I'm the minor deity, Mi Gu, who serves
in Auntie's Fox Den.

454
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:44,085
Our Little Princess... she broke her tail
and her fever won't go down.

455
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:45,159
She's still unconscious.

456
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,579
I couldn't find High God Zhe Yan,
so I came for Auntie in Kunlun Mountain.

457
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,579
Here.

458
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,670
Come with me.

459
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,693
Why aren't they here yet?

460
00:38:08,693 --> 00:38:10,704
Don't worry. I've sent someone
to search for them.

461
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,679
She's awake.

462
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,846
Little Princess, are you awake?

463
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,559
Does it hurt badly?

464
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,737
Seventeenth!

465
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,271
Mu Gu!

466
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:21,721
- High God!
- What happened?

467
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,235
Wasn't she fine when
she returned from Kunlun Mountain?

468
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,001
It's because of Lord Dong Hua.

469
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,592
When is it not because of him
that Little Princess is wounded?

470
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:29,733
What does that mean?

471
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:32,402
When the Star Lord carried her back
to the Fox Den

472
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:36,161
he said that she had cut off her tail.

473
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:39,907
Fourth Brother, look at that child!

474
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:42,701
She really doesn't care about her life.

475
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:45,597
Think of a way to ease the pain quickly!

476
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:49,150
The pain of a broken tail could
easily kill her!

477
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:56,978
I already eased the pain.

478
00:38:56,978 --> 00:38:58,411
Don't say another word.

479
00:38:58,411 --> 00:38:59,862
Leave the room now.

480
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,831
What is Lord Dong Hua doing here?

481
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,246
Fifth Sister, speak politely
to Lord Dong Hua.

482
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:32,007
After all, this isn't his fault.

483
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:35,416
You know about the
Rock of Three Incarnations?

484
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,934
So?

485
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:44,467
Lord Dong Hua, you knew that
you couldn't have any relationships.

486
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,900
You should have rejected Xiao Jiu sooner.

487
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:53,454
The Nine-tailed Fox Clan is
one stubborn clan.

488
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:56,152
Once we decide on someone,
we never change our minds.

489
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,929
You meddled with her and
made her fall in love with you

490
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,864
but then you told her that
you can't be with her.

491
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,826
What play is this you're acting?

492
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:10,295
I'm sorry.

493
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:12,157
What good is an apology now?

494
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,887
Can you bear the pain of
her broken tail for her?

495
00:40:14,887 --> 00:40:16,257
Seventeenth.

496
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,862
Lord Dong Hua has his reasons.

497
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:23,329
All right, I won't say another word.

498
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,489
All right, she's awake now.

499
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,527
She's just still a bit dazed.

500
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,047
You can take a look at her.

501
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:12,016
Auntie...

502
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,012
Who do you think I see?

503
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:23,106
Lord Dong Hua, whom you care for deeply.

504
