1
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:15,722
Yay! Yay!

2
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,069
You seem to be enjoying yourself,
Sakura-chan.

3
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:21,863
Yeah.

4
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:28,103
What is this?

5
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,874
Seijou high

6
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,477
is having its culture fair this Sunday.

7
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,447
Oh yeah,

8
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,945
big brother has been home late
recently because of preparations.

9
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,523
Why don’t you come along with a friend?

10
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,254
Eh!

11
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:44,985
Perhaps you already got one from Touya.

12
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,121
No,

13
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:49,426
last year he gave me one,
but not yet this year.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,730
Perhaps he is worried about the play.

15
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:52,861
Play?

16
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:55,202
Here.

17
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,597
With this you can eat what
ever you want at the stands.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,873
Thank you.

19
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,675
Tomoyo-chan!

20
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,588
Sakura, you were just so cute

21
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:13,751
as you were lost in memory…

22
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:24,291
[Sakura, Touya, and Cinderella]

23
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,330
Hurry,

24
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:27,796
it’s almost show time.

25
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:32,767
Kinomoto,

26
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:33,802
the shoes are broken.

27
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,138
Try and do something about it.

28
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,482
Kinomoto-kun, you’re good.

29
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:42,047
Are you good at things like this?

30
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:42,943
Sorta.

31
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,652
Ha!

32
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,279
You’ll make a good husband.

33
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,723
Really, really.

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,900
Kero-chan would be jealous.

35
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:00,970
Oh yeah.

36
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:01,771
Eh!

37
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:05,269
Kero-chan asked me to get a souvenir.

38
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,207
Oh!

39
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:18,649
Hi.

40
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,546
Yukito-san, good afternoon.

41
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,920
A kimono.

42
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,890
Our class’s shop

43
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,423
is selling sweets,

44
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,527
so we did it Japanese style.

45
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:30,756
So, come in.

46
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,035
Welcome.

47
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:35,970
Eh!

48
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,770
What do you want?

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,698
We have lemonade and hiyashiame.

50
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,610
Then I will have hiyashiame.

51
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,506
Umm, I’ll have lemonade.

52
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,272
OK, wait one moment.

53
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:50,617
Yukito-san.

54
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:52,953
Sorry to keep you waiting.

55
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:58,789
Delicious.

56
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,860
What is it?

57
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,331
I feel like somebody is looking at me.

58
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:10,132
Huh?

59
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:16,942
Would you like another?

60
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,004
Yeah.

61
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,778
It seems like he has been
in here for quite some time.

62
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,318
Eh?

63
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:37,628
Here.

64
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,338
My shift is over.

65
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:44,502
Shall I show you around?

66
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,003
Will you?

67
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:52,040
That’s heavy.

68
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:52,882
Really?

69
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:53,942
Kinomoto,

70
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,012
Are you sure
you aren’t a robot or something?

71
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,585
You’re too strong.

72
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,383
You guys…

73
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,485
Kinomoto-kun really is great.

74
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,457
At first I thought
he seemed a bit scary,

75
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,727
but he is pretty nice.

76
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,028
He has good looks.

77
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,457
He is the ace of the soccer team.

78
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,798
He is also good at cooking and sewing.

79
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,597
Don’t you think so too, Youko?

80
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:15,933
Eh?

81
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,838
Why do you ask me?

82
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:21,310
After all you are cute

83
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,305
and have a nice personality.

84
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:24,675
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:27,140
You are the president of the drama club,
and are good at taking care of people.

86
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,516
Wouldn’t you do well with Kinomoto-kun?

87
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:31,216
Geeze,

88
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:32,815
that has nothing to do with it.

89
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,359
I guess Youko really
does like Kinomoto-kun.

90
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,796
Yeah,

91
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,554
but there is a rumor all the girls
that have approached Kinomoto-kun

92
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,801
were rejected.

93
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,759
That Kinomoto-kun and Tsukishiro-kun

94
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,002
don’t have girlfriends

95
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:49,063
is one of the seven mysteries

96
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:49,998
of our school.

97
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,402
How cute.

98
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,637
You like such childish things?

99
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,675
But it’s cute.

100
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:01,947
You can have it

101
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:02,818
if you pass through five

102
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,914
of our regulars

103
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:04,980
and score.

104
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,716
Eh?

105
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,922
A hundred yen per attempt.

106
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,358
Here.

107
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,932
You are going to do it?

108
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,228
Yeah.

109
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:35,881
Wait just a bit.

110
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,247
Yes.

111
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,469
Go in!

112
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,310
Oh! Huh!

113
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:08,915
Eh?

114
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,980
Hey

115
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,753
There is no way our club members
can win against Tsukishiro-kun.

116
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:15,682
That’s not true.

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,254
Here.

118
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,223
Thank you.

119
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:25,666
You’re going again?

120
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,295
I need two more stuffed animals.

121
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,409
Tsukishiro!

122
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,742
Join our team.

123
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,079
I’ll think about it.

124
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:52,884
It’s just about time.

125
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,295
Time for what?

126
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:55,964
Time for play

127
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:56,890
Our class play.

128
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:57,996
We’re doing it in the gym.

129
00:06:58,735 --> 00:06:59,861
Is my brother in it?

130
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,793
Yeah.

131
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,529
I wonder what role it is.

132
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:03,903
Ha…

133
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:05,538
Look forward to seeing it.

134
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:06,666
Umm…

135
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:14,208
Excuse me!

136
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,414
Eh

137
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,381
Are you in it?

138
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:20,682
Me?

139
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:21,580
Yes.

140
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,125
Woo…

141
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,118
What is your part?

142
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,188
Canned mackerel.

143
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,996
Eh!

144
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,260
Mackerel?

145
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,157
Canned?

146
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,066
Yep.

147
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,597
Seems like a pretty delicious role.

148
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:38,972
You’re right,

149
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,541
canned mackerel is delicious.

150
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,254
Next is the play Cinderella
by 2nd year D class.

151
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,628
Class D

152
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,226
is your brother’s right?

153
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,794
Why would there
be canned mackerel

154
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,330
in Cinderella?

155
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:02,484
Sob. Sob.

156
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:03,588
Long ago,

157
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,551
in a land far away

158
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,088
there was a beautiful
and lovable girl

159
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,929
named Cinderella.

160
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,201
Sob…

161
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,427
This voice.

162
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,105
Cinderella was bullied
by her mother and sisters

163
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,739
every day,

164
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,803
but was still a good girl
who worked very hard.

165
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,744
Bro… Brother

166
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,682
He’s …

167
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,352
Big brother?

168
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,524
Your brother seems very popular.

169
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,232
Are you cleaning well?

170
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,029
It is dirty over here,

171
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:47,935
useless girl.

172
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,037
Useless!

173
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,068
Hey, the miso soup this morning

174
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,001
was terrible.

175
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:54,902
Ah!

176
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,212
Were you trying to kill us?

177
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:58,043
Oh my God!…

178
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:04,712
There is a ball at the castle today.

179
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:06,282
Oh yes.

180
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:07,851
Yes, there is a ball.

181
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,154
The prince is going
to choose his bride.

182
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,529
From the girls that
come to the ball.

183
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,422
I will be joined
with the prince.

184
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:17,390
Me!

185
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,258
No, me.

186
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,102
It will be me.

187
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,340
La…

188
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,566
This seems fun.

189
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,503
Hey, be a little jealous.

190
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,244
Ah, I want to go to.

191
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,378
The three of us are going,

192
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,112
you stay home.

193
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,749
Have dinner ready too.

194
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,889
Ramen, we’ll have ramen.

195
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,220
Shall we go?

196
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,459
Yes, let’s go.

197
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:45,317
Let’s dance.

198
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:53,427
Woo…

199
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:57,671
I want to go to the ball too.

200
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,943
He doesn’t seem to
want to go at all.

201
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,373
Hello.

202
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,011
Wow

203
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:07,646
It’s Yukito-san.

204
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:09,913
Tsukishiro-san is popular too.

205
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,580
Yukito-san is wonderful.

206
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,322
You seem troubled,

207
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:15,584
Cinderella.

208
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,922
This is an invitation to the ball,

209
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,455
but why do you do this?

210
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,458
Because I am a wizard.

211
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,898
What is that on your head?

212
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,768
Canned mackerel.

213
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:29,969
A discarded canned mackerel

214
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,237
that gained magical power

215
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,630
over many years.

216
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,202
Why a canned mackerel?

217
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,010
There is a moral to the story,

218
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,381
treat things with respect.

219
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,067
The prince has arrived.

220
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:07,433
Eh!

221
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,013
I think you all know,

222
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,211
but today is a ball

223
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,280
to determine my bride.

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,145
Eh!

225
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:24,691
Big brother.

226
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,394
Eh!

227
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,094
Youko,

228
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,637
your line.

229
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,731
Oh, what a wonderful young maiden.

230
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,807
Well then, shall we dance?

231
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,175
Weird play.

232
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:53,453
Huh!

233
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,031
Is something wrong?

234
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,441
Perhaps my imagination?

235
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:27,955
Cinderella,

236
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,258
I don’t want to let
you leave like this.

237
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,055
But if I don’t go make the ramen…

238
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,864
Please be my bride.

239
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,636
But the canned mackerel told me

240
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:42,471
to be home by midnight.

241
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:43,701
Something…

242
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,734
Feels strange.

243
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,611
Cinderella, I…

244
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,182
Prince.

245
00:13:58,988 --> 00:13:59,920
Ah!

246
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:05,082
Eh!

247
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:10,760
Big brother!

248
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,093
Touya!

249
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,727
Ummm…

250
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,946
What’s going on!

251
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:34,482
It was a Clow Card after all.

252
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,491
We have to go somewhere
people don’t go.

253
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:44,928
Sakura-chan.

254
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:46,600
Li-kun!

255
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,767
What a great story, it made me cry.

256
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,872
Parent-child relationships
sure are great.

257
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,209
Kero-chan, it’s terrible,

258
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,140
the play my brother is in…

259
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,040
What?

260
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,883
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,349
That is the Mist card,

262
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,082
it corrodes everything

263
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,482
that gets in the fog.

264
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,654
If you don’t hurry

265
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,427
your brother’s footing
will crumble too.

266
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,856
This can’t be.

267
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,294
It would be good

268
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,396
if you could gather Mist
all into one place to take care of it.

269
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:22,033
Gather it?

270
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,535
Ah!

271
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,274
Eh!

272
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:26,967
Youko!

273
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,175
Kinomoto-kun.

274
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:34,779
Touya.

275
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,014
Touya, let go!

276
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,413
You’ll fall too.

277
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:41,189
At this height

278
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,252
I will just be hurt a little,

279
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,149
so…

280
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,621
Touya

281
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,463
Gather? How can I gather it?

282
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:57,773
Oh yeah.

283
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:07,715
Shadows, gather all the fog within you.

284
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,482
Shadow!

285
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:26,833
Return to your rightful form,

286
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:30,770
Clow Card!

287
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:50,283
Woo…

288
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:52,658
Wah…

289
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,233
Wind come forth!

290
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:26,990
Thank you.

291
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,061
Touya!

292
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,798
Youko!

293
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:35,796
Thank god.

294
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,605
Touya, are you OK? Not hurt?

295
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,633
Somehow.

296
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,187
Mic test. Mic test.

297
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,589
Even so it is unfortunate,

298
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,858
even though I brought my video camera

299
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,224
I missed your action.

300
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:04,858
Ha…

301
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:08,365
But it is good
it didn’t become a big accident.

302
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:09,902
Really.

303
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:11,532
Thank you.

304
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,374
For helping me.

305
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,638
I don’t remember helping you.

306
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:20,978
Yukito-san.

307
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,513
That was pretty exciting.

308
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,386
Your canned mackerel was wonderful.

309
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:26,780
Thank you.

310
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:29,116
Where is my brother?

311
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,487
He’s fine.

312
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,718
But he was called out
to talk to somebody.

313
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,029
Umm… I…

314
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:50,110
I love you.

315
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,309
Thank you, but I…

316
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,142
You have somebody you like?

317
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,356
Yes.

318
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,727
I had that feeling.

319
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,054
Sorry for crying.

320
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:13,534
Don’t worry about me.
Ah, they are doing a bonfire.

321
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,937
May I ask one request?

322
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,635
Dance with me.

323
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,595
It’s my brother.

324
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:47,400
Thank you.

325
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,699
Hey, Kinomoto-kun.

326
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,011
I only promised Youko.

327
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,507
A little too cool.

328
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,654
You should have told me

329
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:10,252
you were in the play.

330
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,917
You told her?

331
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:13,851
Yeah.

332
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,126
Shall we dance?

333
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,189
Eh?

334
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,989
Let’s go.

335
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:23,932
This will make a good video.
