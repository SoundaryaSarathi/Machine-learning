1
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:06,719
That night, I became
worried about Nana

2
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:10,419
since she hadn't replied to
the email I sent her.

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,589
That worry soon turned to anxiety.

4
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:18,229
As it passed midnight,
unable to bear it,

5
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,859
I reached for my cell phone.

6
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,559
That's when it rang to indicate

7
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,399
that I had just received an email.

8
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:35,779
I'LL BE STAYING AT
REN'S PLACE TONIGHT.
I'LL LISTEN TO YOUR STORIES
TOMORROW, SO DON'T WORRY
AND GO TO SLEEP, HACHIKO.

9
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,889
Blinking eyes call the wind

10
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:49,529
A smile clears all the noise away

11
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:56,099
The angel in your eyes whispers

12
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:01,279
"Everything begins now"

13
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,509
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

14
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,319
It's like being caught in a wave

15
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,479
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

16
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,949
Breath held, arms reaching out

17
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:20,189
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

18
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,829
You're the only one I can see

19
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,769
Baby my wish on a wing

20
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,739
This sky is torn

21
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,139
By a single overflowing word

22
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,739
You know,
I'm actually only half Japanese.

23
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,199
My dad is American.

24
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,169
He got sick and died
when I was six.

25
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,919
But when Japanese people hear
that I'm half American,

26
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,749
they're quick to conclude
I'm pretty because of that,

27
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,449
and that's why I have
a good voice.

28
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,619
So our talent agency advised us
to keep it a secret,

29
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,319
so people would think
I'm super talented

30
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,519
in spite of me being Japanese
just like everyone else.

31
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,169
I don't care either way,
as long as I can sing.

32
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,199
The people around me can be pests
in other ways, too.

33
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,309
Like, they tell me not to do
or say anything that'll hurt my image.

34
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,439
Hurt my image or not,
this is who I am.

35
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,079
Being human can be so tiring.

36
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:03,019
The next day, it started raining hard
early in the morning.

37
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,499
As a result, people were scarce
at the supermarket where I worked.

38
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,729
The smell of the dumplings
that wouldn't sell,

39
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:14,969
lingered on my hair and clothes,
making work totally unbearable.

40
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,469
So you failed to go through with it.

41
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:21,979
Shut up!

42
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,249
But even Hachi must have figured out
your feelings for her, Nobu.

43
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,719
She could be at a loss right now

44
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,349
since you only partially confessed
your feelings to her.

45
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,159
What am I doing,
causing her problems?

46
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,489
These aren't any good.

47
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,059
Do you have a light?

48
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,499
I don't. Say, where did you forget
that huge lighter you had?

49
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,329
How do you lose something you wear
around your neck?

50
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,839
What am I gonna do?
I really liked it.

51
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,979
It's a rare item, so it's hard
to find another one.

52
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,809
It's divine punishment.
You've upset the Demon Lord.

53
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,209
You think so?

54
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,139
Huh?

55
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,689
Hey, Yasu.

56
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:01,649
Where's Nana?

57
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,349
Not here yet.

58
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,759
So, how did it go with
the record company?

59
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,419
I'll tell you when Nana gets here.

60
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,789
Come on, you can tell us.

61
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,829
What are you talking about?

62
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:09,899
Oh, Shin.

63
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,629
I couldn't reach you on
your cell since last night.

64
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,669
You had me worried.

65
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,399
I'm glad to see you're alive.

66
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,309
Another woman.
Give it a rest, would you?

67
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,399
It's work.

68
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:25,799
Don't call it work!

69
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,639
Yasu!

70
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,779
How was it
with the record company?

71
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,009
Like I said,
what are you talking about?!

72
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,089
You've been scouted?!

73
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,559
Wait... Wait a minute...

74
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,619
Calm... Calm down...
You need to calm down, Nana!

75
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,359
You're the one who needs
to calm down.

76
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,629
Okay, now calm down,

77
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,169
and you shall tell me what happened
in the proper order.

78
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:49,959
"You shall"?

79
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,269
What happened was,

80
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,769
we casually distributed demo tapes
and a video of our live concert

81
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,369
to various record companies.

82
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,409
Then one of them liked
what they saw and contacted us.

83
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,549
Gaia Records.

84
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:07,649
That's a super famous label!
Even I know them!

85
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,849
Yeah, I guess.
Biggest in the music industry.

86
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,889
Will you be able to debut?

87
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,359
No, not yet.
We're not quite there yet.

88
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:16,519
Aww...

89
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,729
You know, Yasu met with
a guy from Gaia today.

90
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,829
He apparently wants to come
to our next concert.

91
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,739
If we do well,
he'll seriously consider signing us.

92
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:30,969
I see. Then I'm sure
things'll go well.

93
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,199
The live performance of BLAST
is outta this world, after all.

94
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,649
Right? We've practically
won this battle.

95
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,939
It'll be a breeze!

96
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,149
A breeze?
You're beaming with confidence.

97
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,789
When's your next live concert?
The end of the month, isn't it?

98
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:45,989
The 28th.

99
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,529
We'd better let Misato know.

100
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,489
We were all pumped up
at our practice today.

101
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,029
Nobu's guitar strings kept snapping.

102
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,569
I promise you, one day,
I'll be better than him.

103
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,029
Takumi.

104
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,679
You should've come after work today.

105
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,009
You know... Nana...

106
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,279
Yesterday... Er...
The day before yesterday? Huh?

107
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,079
Anyway, the day of
Trapnest's final concert.

108
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,459
Takumi came here late that night.

109
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,649
Yeah, I know.
Actually, I saw you all lovey-dovey.

110
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,169
I called out to you,
but you didn't even notice me.

111
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,709
I knew it. I'm sorry.

112
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,269
Wh-What about?

113
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:38,909
That time, I wasn't thinking clearly.
I'll bet you were surprised.

114
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,149
I hadn't told you anything
prior to that.

115
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,049
Yeah, I was surprised,

116
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,419
but there's nothing to
apologize about, is there?

117
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,949
Since the fact that Takumi
came to our place

118
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,009
meant that the party was over,

119
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,489
I figured you had gone out
to see Ren.

120
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
But then I started thinking that
you might've left outta courtesy to us,

121
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,459
and started getting concerned.

122
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,729
No, you're wrong.

123
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,259
I got an email from Ren,
so I went to see him.

124
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,129
I see. Thank goodness.

125
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,909
But Nana, you told me that
you won't have Ren stay over

126
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,969
because I'd feel obligated
to be hospitable.

127
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,209
I'll be more careful from now on, too.

128
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,709
No, never mind.

129
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,079
Actually, I'm thinking of staying
at Ren's place for a while.

130
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:18,909
Huh?

131
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:19,979
Want a drink?

132
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,289
Yes. Or, ah...
You're gonna stay at Ren's place?

133
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,689
Just for the two weeks
that Trapnest has off.

134
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:30,399
He tells me they rarely get
this much time to themselves to relax,

135
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:31,729
so I thought I'd be with him
during that time.

136
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,229
I see. Well, naturally.

137
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,599
Of course she'd wanna be with Ren.

138
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,269
So the same goes for you.

139
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,679
Don't hesitate to have Takumi
come here every day

140
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:46,909
during that period.

141
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,049
He's not likely to
come here every day.

142
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,489
Takumi told me he's busy
even during the days he's off.

143
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,489
But I guess that could be a lie.

144
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,919
No, I don't think that's a lie.

145
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,689
Since he's normally really busy,
it's likely that

146
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,699
he has a ton of non-work related stuff
to catch up on during his time off.

147
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,869
Ren was saying something
similar to that, too.

148
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:08,839
I'm glad.

149
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,599
It's gonna be all right.
He'll be here again soon.

150
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:17,769
I didn't think you'd cheer me on like this.

151
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,479
That's why I couldn't bring myself
to tell you anything.

152
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:23,579
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:24,809
Why?

154
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,519
I thought you'd despise me.

155
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:29,619
Despise you?

156
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:33,489
Sleeping with my favorite musician
and stuff.

157
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,459
That's just plain foolish,
don't you think?

158
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,059
Even I think it's foolish.

159
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,959
What are you saying?

160
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,669
Sure, Takumi may just happen
to be a successful musician,

161
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:47,269
but regardless of that fact,
you've fallen in love with him, right?

162
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,429
Regardless?

163
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:50,869
Yeah.

164
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:52,809
I wonder.

165
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:56,879
To me, Takumi is simply
Takumi from Trapnest.

166
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,639
I've never thought of him
as anything else.

167
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,989
When I think of him
as some random guy,

168
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,789
he does seem to be
a really horrible person.

169
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:07,419
You know...

170
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,859
I can't stand girls who'd casually sleep
with a guy like that

171
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,059
just for the thrill of doing it
with a celebrity.

172
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,969
But how could I despise you

173
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,599
after seeing you shed tears
like that in his arms?

174
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:25,809
Even Takumi must've felt
pure love for you

175
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,139
when he saw you cry like that
straight from your heart.

176
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,449
If he didn't feel love,
he would've been uncomfortable.

177
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,479
Like, "what mess did I get myself into
having a girl cry on me like this?"

178
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:36,519
So it's gonna be all right.

179
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:37,879
Good luck.

180
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:46,589
People close to you may worry
and say things to you regarding Takumi.

181
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,039
Yasu especially
has a tendency to worry.

182
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:50,489
But don't let it bother you.

183
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,699
Which reminds me, Nana.
About that...

184
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:54,509
About what?

185
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,569
About me and Takumi...
you know...

186
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,609
You were saying
that you saw us.

187
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,679
Did you tell everyone about it, Nana?

188
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,879
Sorry. I did tell Yasu.
Is that bad?

189
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:09,659
No, it's not about Yasu,
but rather Nobu.

190
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,659
I wonder if
Yasu told him anything.

191
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:13,759
No, that's not it!

192
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,899
Nobu and Shin heard it
from Takumi at the party.

193
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,729
He said that she was wagging
her tail looking all pleased.

194
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,159
Then Nobu lost it.

195
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,199
What did you just say?!

196
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,859
Well, but he didn't mean
any disrespect.

197
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:30,839
And the fact that he went to see
Hachi after that is so unlike him.

198
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:34,539
He usually hates getting into
such hassle over a woman.

199
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,079
When Shin poured his drink
over Takumi,

200
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,589
I was sure he'd never want anything
to do with her again,

201
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,209
but I guess he does
have feelings for Hachiko.

202
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,349
What did Takumi tell them
at the party?

203
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,589
It seems that he told everyone
that you two started going out.

204
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,499
That we're going out?

205
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,769
I'll bet he casually and
jokingly told everyone

206
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,539
that "I did it with her"
in that way he always acts.

207
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:02,939
You know him well.

208
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,809
But what was that about Nobu

209
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,179
that you brought up
a moment ago?

210
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:07,909
Did something happen with Nobu?

211
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,349
What happened is... last night...

212
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,119
Nobu suddenly showed up and
said he needed to talk to me.

213
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:20,759
He said something about
becoming better than Takumi,

214
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,189
or something like that...

215
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,759
I'm not really sure what
that was all about, but... well...

216
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:28,799
Yeah. In other words,
he came to confess his love.

217
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,199
You think that was what it was, too?

218
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,699
But it's not as if
he actually said that.

219
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,299
He probably couldn't.

220
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,309
You know, everyone's sorta caught on
to the fact that he's in love with you.

221
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,739
I had no idea about that!
What am I gonna do?

222
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,349
Oh. So that's why you didn't drop
by the studio today?

223
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,459
Well...

224
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,319
Don't worry about it.

225
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,449
There's nothing you can really do
about it, is there?

226
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,059
Since you love Takumi.

227
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:57,919
But...

228
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,799
So you're saying Nana's met
her soul mate?

229
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,929
To be honest, I love them, too.
Being a romantic guy and all.

230
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,459
But I'd be satisfied with
a happiness closer to home.

231
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:07,899
There's not a single thing
I'm superior in.

232
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:08,599
It's impossible.

233
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,269
I can't compete against him.

234
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,739
I can't just leave it at that.

235
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,709
I've gotta make things clear.

236
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,239
If you know that,
then don't just sit there grumbling.

237
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,179
Go and follow up on
what you told her.

238
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,559
Should Hachi never set foot
in the studio again,

239
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,059
it'll all be your fault.

240
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:27,789
I'm going in for the attack knowing
I'm gonna get shot down.

241
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:29,989
I feel like I'm
on a suicide mission.

242
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,389
A suicide mission?

243
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:35,269
Shit! If only there was one thing
I could beat him at!

244
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:35,989
Sure there is.

245
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:36,859
What?

246
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:38,859
My phone.

247
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,499
Aren't you gonna answer it?

248
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,079
I'm going out.

249
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,279
Work?

250
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:47,679
Don't get arrested.

251
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,249
You can't go on stealing
other people's clothes!

252
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,379
And that's my best suit!

253
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,959
Wait, Shin.
Answer my question!

254
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,389
What can I beat him at?

255
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,019
Love.

256
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,369
Hello, Shin here.

257
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:17,909
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.
I was being careless.

258
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,669
Then can I go now to pick it up?

259
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,039
You forgot it on purpose, didn't you?

260
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:00,919
Come on in.

261
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:06,989
Reira.

262
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,229
Payment in advance.

263
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,429
The wind carried Nana's song
to my ears.

264
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,189
It's the same song Nobu played
on that cassette player

265
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:49,829
the day he came to Tokyo.

266
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,999
That song's my number one
favorite song in the world.

267
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:01,719
That girl...

268
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,409
Ms. Yamada-whose-age-is-a-mystery
will come yelling again.

269
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,229
I'm sorry about suddenly
coming over last night

270
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,629
and blurting out weird nonsense.

271
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,239
So, now that I've come to see you
like this again,

272
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,769
this time, I'm gonna
be direct with you.

273
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,889
I love you.

274
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,299
That's not what I had in mind
when I asked you to come in.

275
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:59,969
Then I have no reason to be here,
so I'm going home.

276
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,869
Don't you want your lighter?

277
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,469
If you want it, you can have it.

278
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,989
I'm sorry, Shin.

279
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,089
You can have it back,
so don't be mad.

280
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,829
It's a lie that I charge
one hundred thousand a night.

281
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,439
I occasionally receive
expensive gifts,

282
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,969
but I had never had someone hand me
100,000 yen in cash.

283
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,839
It's the first time you ever bought
a man, isn't it, Reira?

284
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:45,209
You fooled me at first
with your act as a naughty girl,

285
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,349
but I can easily tell whether or not

286
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,359
a girl's had a history of fooling around
once we get into bed.

287
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,289
You don't hafta try and be so tough.

288
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,159
I do feel uneasy about accepting
100,000 for that,

289
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:58,529
so if you'd like,
I will spend another night with you.

290
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,089
Call me whenever you feel up to it.

291
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,429
Good night, Reira.
Sweet dreams.

292
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:27,189
My soul is confused.

293
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,289
My heart is shaking.

294
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,999
I feel as if I made a big mistake.

295
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,939
I know that I'm not being fair
by saying this now.

296
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,579
Since I know about you
and Takumi.

297
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,289
I didn't want you to know.

298
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,359
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

299
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,959
I really didn't want anyone to know.

300
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,759
I wonder, do I really love Takumi?

301
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:13,639
Maybe I just wanna convince myself
that it was okay to sleep with him.

302
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,469
I don't know anymore.

303
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,139
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,049
You couldn't come to the studio today
even if you wanted to,

305
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,559
because of what I said, right?

306
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:34,349
I'm sorry, that's not it!
I was working today!

307
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,459
I don't mind,

308
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,429
so please drop by
like you've been doing.

309
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,819
Everyone feels a bit lonely
without your presence, Hachi.

310
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,999
Actually, it's me who gets sad.

311
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,509
Thank you.

312
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,439
Thank goodness.

313
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,919
That's good enough for me.

314
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,559
What should I do?

315
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:13,789
I feel so happy.

316
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,589
Be mine forever.

317
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:25,739
I'm many times happier now than
hearing those words from Takumi

318
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,109
which I can't be sure
are true or not.

319
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,479
What good is it to keep
this empty cigarette pack?

320
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,279
If this hadn't happened
between Takumi and me,

321
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,659
I'm sure I would've
fallen for Nobu.

322
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,199
I would've loved to be
Nobu's girlfriend.

323
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,399
But if Takumi were to come
and see me again,

324
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,699
I'd likely end up sleeping
with him again.

325
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,129
I probably won't resist it.

326
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,139
What in the world do I want?

327
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,379
If I always get carried away like this,
I'll never get my hands on anything.

328
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,929
When I woke up the next morning,
Nana was no longer there.

329
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,229
There was a note on the table.

330
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,869
TO HACHIKO
DON'T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.
LOSE THAT HABIT OF OPENING
THE DOOR TO ANYONE WITHOUT
CONFIRMING WHO IT IS FIRST.
NANA
There was a note on the table.

331
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:23,199
TO HACHIKO
DON'T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.
LOSE THAT HABIT OF OPENING
THE DOOR TO ANYONE WITHOUT
CONFIRMING WHO IT IS FIRST.
NANA

332
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,309
It's not something I should
be feeling lonely about.

333
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,249
I can see her whenever I want
at the studio.

334
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,039
Besides, it's only for two weeks.

335
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:43,149
After those two weeks...
she will return here, won't she?

336
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:53,019
Hey Nana...
Even now, not a day passes

337
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,259
without me wishing to see you
on the other side of that table.

338
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,629
I'd call out your name from my heart.

339
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,499
Many times.

340
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:05,579
As many times as it takes.

341
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:14,709
I reached into the sky

342
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:21,229
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

343
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:26,599
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

344
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,599
Like colorful balloons

345
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,709
I'm alone

346
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:38,439
My hand had no place to go

347
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:45,069
And gently you took it

348
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:46,249
Starless night

349
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:50,449
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

350
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:56,249
I want to feel your warmth

351
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,129
Tears are falling down

352
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:02,229
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

353
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,729
Of your hand holding mine
