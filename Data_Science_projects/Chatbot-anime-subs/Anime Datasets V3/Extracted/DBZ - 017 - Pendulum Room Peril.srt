1
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,419
It's been six months
since we parted company.

2
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:29,819
It looks like you've
gotten a little better.

3
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:35,427
Now then, how about I start
training you properly?

4
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:36,655
Come at me!

5
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:51,568
One more time!

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,372
Over here!

7
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:01,119
Do not lose sight of your opponent!

8
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,455
I can't see anything that fast.

9
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:06,288
You don't see it. You feel it.

10
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,253
That's easy for you to say...

11
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:22,073
If you've got enough time to whine,
think about what you should do instead.

12
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,506
Then move.

13
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,413
We've only got six more months!

14
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,117
When you're not eating or sleeping,
you will fight me!

15
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:34,753
Set your mind straight!

16
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:38,089
You can't mean it. I'll die.

17
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,760
Then get stronger!
Even stronger than me! And...

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,127
...stronger than the Saiyans
who will be coming in six months!

19
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:53,900
Now, come on!

20
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,380
The end still ain't in sight?

21
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,393
Pretty fired up.

22
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,727
Kami-<i>sama</i>,

23
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:26,788
Just how long will it be
until you train us?

24
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:31,736
Yeah...

25
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:35,740
We've already been here for two months,
and yet you haven't taught us anything.

26
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,744
We want to get stronger, like Goku.

27
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,907
Please give us the same
special training that you gave Goku!

28
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,775
Goku's special training, huh?

29
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,425
I...

30
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,760
...taught Goku...

31
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,991
...absolutely nothing!

32
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,438
What does he mean!?

33
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,041
If that's the case, there's no reason
for us to've come all the way here at all.

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,711
It's 'zactly the same as
training down on the surface.

35
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,715
Tell us, just what kind
of training did Goku do here?

36
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,807
Okay?

37
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,849
We just want to get stronger.

38
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,727
Getting stronger... is knowing enemy,
and knowing self.

39
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,857
Do that, and what you
should do come naturally.

40
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,737
Knowing the enemy,
and knowing oneself?

41
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,842
Enough of your smart-aleck talk! I know
better than anyone what my strength is!

42
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,076
I don't need to be told!

43
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:52,417
Sure about that? You not know self.
You not know weaknesses.

44
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,420
What? Are you calling me weak?

45
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,910
You want to try me!?

46
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,622
Everyone, come.

47
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,099
W- what kind of room is this?

48
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,038
Past. Present. Future.
All intersect here.

49
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,711
You go on time journey now.
Goku trained here too.

50
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,542
What? Goku did?

51
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:26,050
Intriguing. Let's go, then.

52
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,052
Let's go!

53
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,388
I ain't going.

54
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:32,754
I'll wait for ya's here.

55
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:41,661
Those want to go, enter circle.

56
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,538
Close eyes slowly.

57
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,186
Where are we?

58
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,730
A tail?

59
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,065
It's a Saiyan.

60
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,362
What?

61
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:10,688
What happened here?

62
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:13,691
These happened during
some kind of battle.

63
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:18,363
The people on this planet appear
to like fighting something fierce.

64
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:20,365
I'm raring to take them on.

65
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:26,037
I'm ready to have a go at them.
I'd like to try out my strength.

66
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:27,334
Come on, let's go.

67
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:35,046
All four of them together
have a battle power of 1507.

68
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,382
None of them appear to be
all that strong, huh?

69
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:40,510
It'll kill some time.
What do you say we rough them up?

70
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:49,883
There's not a single
person around, is there?

71
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:58,069
Maybe they're scared of us.

72
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,739
If this really is the Saiyan's planet,

73
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,536
we definitely should not
take them lightly.

74
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:09,013
Chaozu, let's go.

75
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,275
Right...

76
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,031
Ten-<i>san</i>!

77
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,032
Chaozu!

78
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:30,432
Ten-<i>san</i>, help!

79
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:42,240
Ten-<i>san</i>, help!

80
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,814
Chaozu!

81
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,547
--Chaozu!
--Chaozu!

82
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,088
Why, you-!

83
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:27,091
Okay, who's going to face us next?

84
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,760
I will!

85
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,024
Tenshinhan, be careful!

86
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:52,450
Okay, now it's your turn.

87
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,475
Hold on, Tenshinhan!

88
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,697
<i>Sokidan!!</i>

89
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,164
Get out of there, Tenshinhan!

90
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,778
I got them!

91
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,423
That didn't hurt one bit.

92
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,721
This time, all three of us
will go at them!

93
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,069
It looks like we took care of them.

94
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,333
Those guys were incredible.

95
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:28,143
<i>Chaozu, I have avenged you.</i>

96
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:57,267
He vanished!

97
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:02,905
--Kuririn!
--Kuririn!

98
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,785
These guys are invulnerable!

99
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,811
Where did they disappear to!?

100
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,464
Kuririn!

101
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,801
--Kuririn!
--Kuririn!

102
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,205
Let's go save him!

103
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,518
--Kuririn!
--Kuririn!

104
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,104
Dammit!

105
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:02,440
At this point, I'll let them have it,
even if it costs my own life!

106
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,110
That's it. That's more like it.
Otherwise, it's no fun.

107
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,380
We've laid two of you to rest.
Who's going to be third?

108
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,677
What!?

109
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:17,650
Before you do that,
let me show you to your graves!

110
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,195
This is our last chance!

111
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,647
An extra-large <i>Sokidan</i>!

112
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:55,079
Those guys were awful! It's almost
like they were undying monsters!

113
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,570
We beat them...

114
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,418
I- I'm alive...

115
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,398
Where are we?

116
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:50,424
We're alive! We're saved!

117
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:56,407
'Course ya are! You've just been
standing there the whole while.

118
00:16:56,407 --> 00:17:00,411
Your minds went on journey.

119
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:05,178
Kami-<i>sama</i> let you have
valuable experience in minds.

120
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,716
How'd it go with the Saiyans?

121
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,362
What's wrong?

122
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:21,365
What're ya keeping quiet for?

123
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:26,200
The Saiyans that you saw were still
only half as strong as full-fledged ones.

124
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,908
They don't even compare to the strength

125
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:33,843
that Saiyans who are now
heading for Earth possess.

126
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:41,184
You mean, they're even stronger?

127
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:51,255
How about it? Do you feel
like running away now?

128
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,351
All right!

129
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,353
I'm keeping at it!

130
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,355
Ten-<i>san</i>!

131
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,050
I'm going at it, too!

132
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:30,367
I'm going to train here for the next
six months to defeat the Saiyans!

133
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,595
Me too!

134
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,349
What's that!?
Is that your defense!?

135
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:12,205
Concentrate harder!
I'm just itching to kill you!

136
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,327
<i>The Saiyans' power is terrifying.</i>

137
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:41,131
<i>The fated time is drawing ever nearer.</i>
