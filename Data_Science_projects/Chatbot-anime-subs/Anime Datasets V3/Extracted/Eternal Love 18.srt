<i>[Episode 18]</i>

3
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,039
There are many injured soldiers inside.
It's not correct for a woman to enter.

4
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,039
Wait out here for me.

5
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,759
Second Prince.

6
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,199
Your Highness.

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

8
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,879
These soldiers may belong to Chang Sea,
but they acknowledge you more.

9
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,680
Ever since I returned from
Kunlun Mountain

10
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,599
I've been leading the army
in place of my uncle all these years.

11
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,800
Naturally, they would look to me.

12
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,319
Uncle has no sons.

13
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,159
This is also why he won't break ties
with the Mermaid Clan so easily.

14
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,879
After all, the Celestial Tribe
rules from so far away.

15
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,479
When the Celestial Army leaves,
leaving him with the Mermaid Clan

16
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,520
it will be the Chang Sea Army
who suffers the retaliation.

17
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,780
If there is a war, you must
be ruthless and leave no survivors.

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,199
Save my leg.

19
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you want your leg or your life?

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,360
If someone like me loses my leg,
that is as good as losing my life.

21
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,680
How will I earn a living?

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Listen.

23
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,400
Your leg has been too severely injured.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
Army Physician.

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
Your Highness.

26
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,439
What is the condition of their injuries?

27
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,639
It... It isn't good.

28
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Do you want to return home?

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Even in my dreams.

30
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,161
If I gave you a chance to end
this fighting

31
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,520
that has gone on for dozens of millennia,
would you be willing to take it?

32
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,039
I would! I would!

33
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Everyone, I have a request to make.

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Will you lend me your assistance?

35
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,639
Your Highness, we are just
injured soldiers.

36
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,879
We could risk our lives for you but
how could men like us make a difference?

37
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,160
In this main tent, there are
only about 40 men.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
How can we help you?

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
I know what you are all worried about.

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,920
After all, Chang Sea Army doesn't want
to wage war against the Mermaid Clan.

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,759
You're afraid you'll be
committing a crime.

42
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,360
Your Highness, we are
not afraid of dying.

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,399
We're afraid that a war

44
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,600
will bring disaster
to our parents and wives.

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,519
Yes, the Mermaids are violent.
They take their revenge.

46
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,199
In our endless fight

47
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,920
we are the ones who are injured,
the ones who joined the army.

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,399
Should there be a great war,
winning would be good

49
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,240
but if we lose, the army will just
give a document of surrender

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,401
while us underlings will be
left in misery.

51
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,600
Yes.

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,086
It isn't as if we haven't fought against
the Mermaids before.

53
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,319
We mostly came away with losses.

54
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,040
- Yes, Your Highness.
- We have our difficulties.

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,115
How could I not disregard the lives
of all those in Chang Sea?

56
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,399
This is the Celestial Tribe's
Crown Prince.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
His Highness has come here

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,399
to prove the Celestial Tribe's resolve
to wage war against the Mermaid Clan.

59
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,519
The Celestial Palace has
finally noticed Chang Sea.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,399
Your Highness.

61
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,680
May the Celestial Palace send its army
to drive the Mermaids out of Chang Sea.

62
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
My entire family of 13 died by
the hands of the Mermaid Clan.

63
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,000
They are my sworn enemy!

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
May the Celestial Palace send its army
to drive the Mermaids out of Chang Sea.

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,959
I make an oath here today.

66
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,480
I will drive the Mermaids out
of Chang Sea and return peace to you.

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,839
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
What is wrong?

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,319
I came across an injured soldier
and saw blood.

70
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,343
I suddenly feel a bit unwell.

71
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,000
It might be because I drank yesterday.

72
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,120
This young man looks like
the refined type.

73
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,519
He must not be accustomed to
being in an army camp.

74
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,680
Here, drink some water.

75
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
No need.

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
That is fine.

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,079
The water in this kind of place
may not be clean either.

78
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,800
Why don't you return to rest?

79
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,879
Is there a clean tent
so an army physician can take a look?

80
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,959
I'll go find a clean tent right away.

81
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,759
How is he?

82
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,000
- This...
- Be forthright.

83
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,959
Report, Master.

84
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,360
This young man has the pulse
of one who is pregnant.

85
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,279
What?

86
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,079
I understand.
You two may step outside now.

87
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,639
Do not speak of this.

88
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,319
Please rest assured.

89
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Ye Hua, is what he said true?

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
I...

91
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,480
Su Su.

92
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,319
You cannot stay here now.
I must send you back immediately.

93
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,279
Why must you send me away?

94
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,439
There will soon be
a big war in Chang Sea.

95
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,000
You are with child. I cannot
allow you to stay here.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,680
You are also a mortal.
Why do you have to stay?

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,639
One last time.

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,439
- Really?
- Absolutely.

99
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,519
All right, I'll trust you one last time.

100
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,519
Where are you thinking of going?

101
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,399
We just learned I am with child.
Are you not letting me walk around now?

102
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,679
So I am pregnant now?

103
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,960
How come you don't seem happy?

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,000
Since you heard I am with child,
you have had a serious expression.

105
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,080
Have I?

106
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,960
I haven't seen you smile.

107
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm so happy that
I don't know how to smile.

108
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,000
Congratulations, Master,
you are going to be a father.

109
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,399
Congratulations to you too.
You're going to be a mother.

110
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,600
Is it good?

111
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,440
I made all of these.

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,840
If they are not to your liking,
I'll find other things to cook for you.

113
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,320
When you first began working to be
an immortal, did you cook for others?

114
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,120
But because you knew how to use weapons,
you were sent to subdue monsters?

115
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,840
I have never cooked for another before.

116
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Really?

117
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,559
It tastes so good though.

118
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,399
Ye Hua, what were you like as a child?

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,639
When I was a child?

120
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Did you like to cry or throw tantrums?

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,759
I'm wondering if this baby
will be like you.

122
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,279
Did your mother have a smooth delivery
when she gave birth to you?

123
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,600
My mother had difficulty
giving birth to me.

124
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
She had labor pains for seven days.

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,360
Such torment?

126
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
My father says so as well.

127
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
Then your mother must
dote on you very much.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,480
I can't say I was pampered.

129
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,080
The moment I was born,
I was taken away.

130
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,039
I only saw my mother
when I became a young boy.

131
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,440
My respectable teacher
is very well-known.

132
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Because of this

133
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,799
I studied every day for
14 hours straight starting at dawn

134
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,019
until evening when lights had to be lit.

135
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,159
Because your teacher had some fame

136
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,480
you had to suffer such torment.

137
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,799
Then don't you think
the Crown Prince in heaven

138
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,080
would have to suffer
such torment every day?

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,559
Perhaps.

140
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,879
Why don't we leave?

141
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
Yan Zhi.

142
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,080
Uncle.

143
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,399
If you hadn't come, I'd have
already forgotten about you, my nephew.

144
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,399
Uncle.

145
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,039
I came here because I want
to borrow some troops from you.

146
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,679
Borrow troops?

147
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,279
Keep on dreaming.

148
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,559
In the past, my mother's father
treated you like his own son.

149
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,679
I cannot believe you are now
behaving with such ingratitude!

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
Your mother's father?

151
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,039
Your mother has been dead
for hundreds of millennia.

152
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:47,159
Your father has been sealed in the Bell
of the East Emperor for 70,000 years.

153
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,080
The entire Ghost Tribe

154
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,399
is under the control of your brother,
who used to be irresponsible.

155
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,559
What do you have?
You dare speak so boldly in front of me?

156
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,879
If my grandfather had had sons of his own

157
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,080
instead of having
only my mother and my aunts

158
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,519
you would not be in any position
to be the Mermaid King!

159
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,399
Leave, leave! Don't spoil my good mood.

160
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,919
If you keep gabbing, you'd better
be careful or I'll become hostile.

161
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,399
- You!
- What? Leave!

162
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,559
Didn't you hear him tell you to leave?

163
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,840
Let me tell you. Even the Water King
has to show respect to us.

164
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,200
If the Ghost Lord came, even he
would have to carry our King's shoes.

165
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,840
You have no power or authority.

166
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,600
You only have the meaningless name
of Eldest Prince.

167
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
How dare you spoil our leader's mood?

168
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,519
That's right. Leave!
Our leader has no time to listen to you.

169
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:49,320
- Leave!
- Leave!

170
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,879
If it weren't for your grandfather,
who gave me this position

171
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,360
I'd have cut you up already!

172
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,039
He doesn't know what's good for him!

173
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
King.

174
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,399
You shouldn't drink so much.

175
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,759
You have to attend a banquet later at
the Water King of Chang Sea's Palace.

176
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,960
A banquet?

177
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,840
The Water King wants me to marry
one of his daughters to avoid war.

178
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,759
He had some eldest disciple of Mo Yuan
fight me for dozens of millennia.

179
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,080
Now he's trying to use a woman on me.

180
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,600
Nothing will work!
Chang Sea will be mine sooner or later!

181
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,759
Greetings, Father.

182
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,279
Hong'er, rise.

183
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,919
Hong'er, go in my stead.

184
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:41,559
Bring me back a princess you like.
She will be my wife.

185
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,759
All right.

186
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,039
You will go with the prince.

187
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't treat them too well
or else they'll walk all over us.

188
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,799
Don't let them think giving me
a princess will do any good.

189
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,279
Yes.

190
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,519
How long have I been sleeping?
Sleep has me confused.

191
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,559
There is a banquet tonight.
You are pregnant, so you shouldn't go.

192
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,840
Good. I don't want
to attend to those princesses.

193
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,879
I'm going now.

194
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
Your Highness, there's been a change.

195
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,200
The one who came isn't
the Mermaid King, but his youngest son.

196
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,799
That is even better.

197
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,039
Come, drink.

198
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,960
Young prince, you have such spirit.

199
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,319
You bear a resemblance to
the Mermaid King long ago.

200
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,880
It makes me so envious,
for I have only two daughters.

201
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,960
Water King, you need not be so polite.

202
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Come, let's all raise our cups
in a toast to the young prince.

203
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,839
- To the young prince.
- To the young prince.

204
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,359
Lu Xiu.

205
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,880
Fill the young prince's cup.

206
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,319
Young prince.

207
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,599
This is...

208
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,359
This is my second daughter, Lu Xiu.

209
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,839
So it is Princess Lu Xiu.

210
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,839
Please.

211
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,319
Despicable.

212
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,519
What did you say?

213
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,680
Why did you touch my hand?

214
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,119
It is your good fortune
for me to take a liking to you.

215
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,480
Would you rather marry my father
and be one of his many women

216
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,079
instead of giving yourself to me?

217
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,559
- You!
- Lu Xiu.

218
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,119
Father, their entire clan is
shameless and cruel.

219
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,079
Why must you yield to them?

220
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,400
You should fight them with all you have!

221
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,039
Presumptuous. You had best
shut your mouth quickly.

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,079
Greetings, Water King.

223
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,559
Whatever it is,
wait until after the banquet.

224
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,279
Water King, it is
an urgent military affair.

225
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,160
An urgent military affair?

226
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
What?

227
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,519
Is that true?

228
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,759
Absolutely.

229
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,920
What has happened?

230
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,359
It is nothing. Just a tiny matter.

231
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,160
A tiny matter?

232
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,240
They why did he say it was
a military affair?

233
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,559
This is the Chang Sea,
so if it's not your army

234
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,319
then it is my Mermaid Clan's army.

235
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,960
What military affair could
escape my attention?

236
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,160
It is just an internal military affair.
It does not concern you.

237
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,519
Uncle.

238
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm afraid it it is not
of no concern to the Mermaid Clan.

239
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,119
Die Feng?

240
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,359
Uncle, how can mutiny be a tiny matter?

241
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,759
If you cannot give
an explanation to our soldiers

242
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,000
then before the Mermaid Clan
makes their move

243
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Chang Sea Army will destroy in one day
the foundation that took years to build.

244
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,759
If you still think of me as your uncle,
then you'd better shut your mouth!

245
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,599
What is the matter?
What do you mean there is a mutiny?

246
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,160
Young prince,
please do not misunderstand.

247
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,799
It's said the Water King of Chang Sea
is irresolute and unaccomplished.

248
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,160
Meeting you today,
the rumors are indeed true

249
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,519
and I am extremely disappointed!

250
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,880
How dare a low immortal
act so arrogantly in my presence?

251
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,640
Die Feng, this friend of yours is...

252
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:39,279
This is His Highness, the Crown Prince.

253
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,880
Crown Prince?

254
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,799
Greetings to Crown Prince.

255
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,519
Greetings to Crown Prince.

256
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,319
Please rise.

257
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,720
Yes.

258
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,319
I did not know you were
visiting Chang Sea in disguise.

259
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,200
Please forgive me if
I have been lacking in manners.

260
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,759
Lacking in manners is inconsequential

261
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,064
but lacking propriety for a deity clan
is a serious offense.

262
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,559
Your Highness, please do not listen
to the slander from others.

263
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,920
I have been in Chang Sea
for 170,000 years.

264
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,960
I may not have achieved great merits,
but I have abided by my duties

265
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,119
and dared not fail at
a deity clan's propriety.

266
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,519
Is that so?

267
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,359
The Mermaid Clan has
repeatedly harmed civilians

268
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,400
and terrorized Chang Sea.

269
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Why did you not report it
to the Celestial Palace?

270
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,079
A Water King of Chang Sea

271
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,599
is actually currying favor with
a son of the Mermaid King

272
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,359
and even attempts to cover up mutiny!

273
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,160
What do I need you for?

274
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I... I...

275
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,640
I had no choice.

276
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,200
As Water King of Chang Sea

277
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,519
first, you failed to ensure
peaceful living for your clan

278
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:57,200
second, you failed to make soldiers
acknowledge allegiance to you

279
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,039
and third, you couldn't even
protect your own family.

280
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,519
How am I to trust you again?

281
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,920
Stand up!

282
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,440
Your Highness, please spare my life.
Spare my life!

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,319
Uncle, get up.

284
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,640
The Crown Prince is here in
Chang Sea to eliminate the Mermaid Clan.

285
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,559
If you want to save your life,
shouldn't you be doing something?

286
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,480
A sacrifice.

287
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,971
The Mermaid Clan is bloodthirsty.

288
00:22:41,971 --> 00:22:44,170
The Mermaid King dotes on
his youngest son the most.

289
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,359
If we really do kill him...

290
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,799
If we really do kill him
but don't win this war

291
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,759
I'm afraid the entire Chang Sea
will be destroyed!

292
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,160
If you continue to hesitate,
it will be a death sentence.

293
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
Guards!

294
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,519
Seize these two from the Mermaid Clan!

295
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,440
Behead them as a sacrifice!

296
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,799
- Yes!
- Yes!

297
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,000
Water King of Chang Sea, my father will
massacre your entire Chang Sea Clan!

298
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Go!

299
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,319
My father will definitely massacre
your entire Chang Sea Clan!

300
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,319
Go!

301
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,640
Your Highness, Chang Sea soldiers
number just 10,000

302
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,279
and are no match for
the 70,000 Mermaid Clan warriors.

303
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:51,400
Your Highness,
please provide your assistance.

304
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
Chang Sea may be an annexed territory

305
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
but the Celestial Tribe
gives equal treatment to all.

306
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,680
Since you have firmed your resolve

307
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,119
I will gather soldiers to assist you
and bring peace to Chang Sea.

308
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

309
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,400
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

310
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,720
Ye Hua, I will not stand
under the same sky as you!

311
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,319
- Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill!

312
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,240
This hairstyle fits your valiant
and formidable appearance.

313
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,720
There is nothing more to improve on.

314
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,559
Su Su, close your eyes.

315
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,519
Are we going to
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods again?

316
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,599
Isn't this our Mount Junji?

317
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Come.

318
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,839
We are finally back.

319
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,039
We are back.

320
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,599
Let's not leave again.

321
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,319
I still have to handle an important task.

322
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,440
Will you be back in time
for the birth of our child?

323
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,319
Definitely.

324
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,359
I will finish as soon as possible
and I'll never leave you again.

325
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,480
Do you still remember that copper mirror?

326
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,839
If there is anything important,
call to me with that copper mirror.

327
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,400
I will definitely be back
in half a month.

328
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,880
What if you still haven't returned
after half a month?

329
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
What will you do if I do not return?

330
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,440
If you still aren't back,
I'll give you another half a month.

331
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,799
If you are still late, I definitely
will not let you off lightly.

332
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,119
All right.

333
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,079
But remember this, Su Su.

334
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,079
After I leave, you must not
step foot outside of this forest.

335
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,519
Now that you are carrying my child, you
could be easily be found by my family.

336
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,920
If you are found, it will not be good.

337
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,599
Why would it not be good?

338
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,599
I'll tell you everything when I get back.

339
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,416
I am already carrying your child.

340
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I still can't meet your family?

341
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,359
Wait for me to come back.

342
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,680
We'll find a suitable place

343
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,519
to plant ten miles of peach trees
that belong only to you.

344
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,599
Good.

345
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,440
I permit you to personally gather
and mobilize the soldiers tomorrow.

346
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,160
Force the Mermaid Clan
into submission within a month.

347
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,880
Seven days.

348
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,039
Seven days?

349
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,559
I will have the Mermaid King's head
in seven days.

350
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,307
Use the Mermaid Clan's submission

351
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:42,799
to further establish your prestige
throughout the four seas.

352
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,240
Ye Hua, do not disappoint me.

353
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,559
I will not fail in my mission.

354
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,079
There is one more thing.

355
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,559
Qing Qiu has given a response
on the wedding date.

356
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,359
Bai Qian is currently in seclusion.

357
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,160
The day she comes out will be
the day you will be wed.

358
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes.

359
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,559
Congratulations, Your Highness.

360
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,079
I'll ask you one last time.

361
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,279
For this woman

362
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,200
you are going to give up the throne
that is yours for the taking?

363
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,839
What is this called in the mortal realm?

364
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,599
To love not the country,
but the beauty?

365
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,720
This is not what a good ruler does.

366
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,079
I won't be a good ruler
if I take that seat reluctantly.

367
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,279
Why not give the seat
to someone virtuous instead?

368
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,359
With my death, perhaps Heavenly Lord may
find an even better successor quickly.

369
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,680
This war...

370
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,983
can be repayment to Heavenly Lord
for his many years of nurturing me.

371
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,680
Is Third Uncle willing to
lend me a helping hand?

372
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,160
This is causation.

373
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,400
Binding you to marriage with
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

374
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,839
can be considered a shameful deed.

375
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,599
Now look. I have to pay for it so soon.

376
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,960
But don't worry.
I will definitely help you.

377
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,839
I will stand witness for you
in front of Heavenly Lord

378
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,000
and say that you were annihilated,
and there are no remains.

379
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,480
Thank you, Third Uncle.

380
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,519
However, I must still remind you...

381
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,880
Father has always been
a skeptic at heart.

382
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,799
You must be absolutely prudent.
Do not rush things.

383
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,480
If you arouse Father's suspicion

384
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,519
even if you hide outside
of the three realms

385
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,920
he will personally
bring you back to be punished.

386
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,960
I know Heavenly Lord's temperament
better than you do.

387
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,079
Third Prince.

388
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,079
Crown Prince.

389
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,640
What is Your Highness doing?

390
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,400
Heavenly Lord said the entire Xiwu Palace
must be tidied up and spruced up

391
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,799
in preparation for the upcoming wedding.

392
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,200
I see.

393
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
That is right.

394
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,279
His Highness will be marrying
his Crown Princess Consort.

395
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,039
It must be done with care.

396
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,279
Indeed. Not even the slightest bit
of negligence can be allowed.

397
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,400
That is why I didn't dare delegate
the task to any other

398
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
and I came to take a look myself.

399
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,799
Where are Your Highnesses heading?

400
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,759
Us?

401
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,599
We are going to visit Consort Le Xu.

402
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,484
I was just at Consort Le Xu's.

403
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,359
Her Highness has been thinking
about the Crown Prince for a long time.

404
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,200
She will surely be very happy to see you.

405
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,400
Speaking of which, Consort Su Jin is
indeed the closest with Consort Le Xu.

406
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,519
Her Highness raised me.
I owe her for that.

407
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,279
It is only proper that I visit her often.

408
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

409
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Congratulations, Your Highness.

410
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,680
Congratulations, Your Highness.

411
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,079
It seems this felicitous news has reached
every corner of the Celestial Palace.

412
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,039
Mother.

413
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
Ye Hua.

414
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,799
Come here.

415
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,920
Every time you see me,
you observe such proper etiquette.

416
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,960
A lot of feelings between
mother and son are lost.

417
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,159
Although I am sad, I do not blame you.

418
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,920
From the moment I gave birth to you,
I could not see you.

419
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,280
Whether you were hungry, tired, weary

420
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,960
or suffered a grievance

421
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,559
I could not be by your side
taking care of you.

422
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:33,880
Every time I think of this,
I feel guilty.

423
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,760
Even with your engagement
to Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

424
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,199
I was one of the last ones
in the Celestial Palace to know about it.

425
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,199
Nor do I have the right to ask...

426
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,119
if you are pleased with this engagement.

427
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,599
Mother, you need not blame yourself.

428
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,840
As Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe,
marriage is not my decision to make.

429
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
My satisfaction does not matter to me.

430
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,760
For the title of Crown Prince

431
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,000
you have given up too much
ever since you were a child.

432
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I really wish you had been
just an ordinary child

433
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,800
and did not have to be so shackled.

434
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,400
Sister-in-law, you are particularly
sentimental about the past today.

435
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,079
I don't know why.

436
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:32,440
Ever since I heard Ye Hua will be
leading an army to Chang Sea

437
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,039
I have been anxious.

438
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,079
Crown Prince's powers are
no less than Mo Yuan's in the past.

439
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,960
It is but a mere Mermaid Clan.
Why are you so worried?

440
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,119
Probably in less than three days,
he will send back word of his victory.

441
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,719
Women always like to worry too much.

442
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,119
After I leave

443
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,519
I hope you will take care of yourself.

444
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:08,840
All right. All right.

445
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,000
I am very comfortable
in the Celestial Palace.

446
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,320
You do not need to think about me

447
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,239
I don't want you to be distracted
when you are on the battlefield.

448
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,320
Without your father here,
you'll have to bear with me.

449
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,920
We clearly bowed to heaven and earth
and became husband and wife.

450
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,000
But he still can't bring me home
to see his family.

451
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,280
It makes me seem like a mistress.

452
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,159
I can't even walk around.

453
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,559
It is so hurtful.

454
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,599
Greetings, Your Highness.

455
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,519
I have brought 30,000 soldiers
from the West Sea

456
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,400
ready for your orders at any time.

457
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,260
I may only have 10,000 soldiers
from Chang Sea

458
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,880
but we are willing to risk our lives and
are ready for your orders at any time.

459
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,559
Greetings, Your Highness.

460
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,519
Your Highness.

461
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,039
I am also willing
to listen to your orders.

462
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,360
What are you doing here?

463
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,079
My entire clan laid down their lives for
the Celestial Tribe 70,000 years ago.

464
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,599
Today, all the various
clan leaders are here.

465
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,440
Even if I am alone

466
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,239
I've asked Heavenly Lord for permission
to don armor and go to battle

467
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,440
and fight alongside all the clan leaders.

468
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,599
Consort Su Jin, please follow me.

469
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,920
Although you have become
my father's consort

470
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,800
I should not scold you much.

471
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
However, I must still urge you.

472
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
You can't even lift a sword.

473
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,360
Besides putting on a show

474
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,543
what other use do you have
for coming here dressed like this?

475
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,400
I want to live or die
with the Crown Prince.

476
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,320
Su Jin.

477
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,159
Could it be you still
have feelings for Ye Hua?

478
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,320
Regardless of what you truly think

479
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,000
since you have joined
my father's palace

480
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,280
it is no longer possible
between you and Ye Hua.

481
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,599
That is why I urge you to forget
this notion of yours.

482
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,000
Bai Qian canceled her engagement

483
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,159
with the Water King of the North Sea
to marry Ye Hua.

484
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,039
Who can predict what will happen
in the Celestial Palace?

485
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,639
Preposterous!

486
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,119
The moment of war is near at hand.

487
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,039
I only hope you will not
hold Ye Hua back.

488
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,679
Watch out for yourself, Consort Su Jin.

489
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,519
- We will send our troops out tonight.
- What? Tonight?

490
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,797
Why are you in
such a hurry, Your Highness?

491
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,360
Your Highness, the Celestial Tribe's
soldiers have just arrived

492
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
and are not familiar with
the waters of Chang Sea.

493
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,639
The Mermaid King has been here
for 70,000 years.

494
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,679
- He is--
- What you're thinking...

495
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:10,960
is what the Mermaid Clan is thinking.

496
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,280
You all thought I would rest a few days
before sending out our troops.

497
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,320
The enemy has their guard down
at the moment.

498
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,199
Tonight is the best time to attack.

499
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Go gather all the soldiers quickly.
We head out this evening.

500
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

501
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,719
Ye Hua.

502
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,280
I'm afraid Su Jin's arrival
brings some variables.

503
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,199
Your fake death tonight must be done
absolutely thoroughly.

504
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,519
Don't let her see any mistakes.

505
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,920
There will not be any mistakes.

506
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,760
Being cut by
the Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer

507
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,360
is sure death.

508
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,480
Do you really intend to take a blow?

509
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,800
That is correct.

510
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,679
There is no helping you.

511
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,960
You would risk your life for her?

512
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Don't worry, Third Uncle.

513
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,239
I will gauge how much to let
the blade slash me

514
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,159
so that the condition of my injury
seems severe

515
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:11,280
but I will not really lose my life.

516
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,119
It is unpredictable!
How can it be as easy as you say?

517
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,639
I only ask that you send me to
a hidden location afterward

518
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,880
and report to Heavenly Lord that
I have died and disintegrated like smoke.

519
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I'll ask you one last time.

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,519
After this war, the Celestial Palace
will no longer have Crown Prince Ye Hua.

521
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,519
Are you willing to accept that?

522
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,320
I only wish...

523
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,280
to be free soon,
and never to be tied down again.
