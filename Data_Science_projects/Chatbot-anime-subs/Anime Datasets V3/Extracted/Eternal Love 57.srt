<i>[Episode 57]</i>

3
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,764
High God, please allow us
to take him back

4
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,413
to be buried in the Sea of Innocence
on the 36th day.

5
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,526
High God, please grant us this wish.

6
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:23,317
It isn't as if Auntie is going to do
something to the Crown Prince's body.

7
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,686
Since His Highness was so
devoted to her when he was alive

8
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,778
what is the harm in leaving him here?

9
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:32,992
Just because you're a bigger crowd,
and Lord Dong Hua came with you...

10
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:33,992
Mi Gu.

11
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,419
That's enough.

12
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:42,018
Yes, Auntie.

13
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,722
I've taken in what you just said.

14
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,760
I also understand your reasoning.

15
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,210
It's just that when I was Su Su...

16
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,390
I was Ye Hua's wife.

17
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:08,711
I'm still engaged to Ye Hua now.

18
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:14,776
As his wife, there is one last thing
I'd like to do for him.

19
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,497
Let me dress him well...

20
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,376
wipe his face...

21
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,854
so he can leave Qing Qiu nicely groomed.

22
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:55,645
As for this kowtow, it's what I should do
for the both of you as Ye Hua's wife.

23
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,836
Please get up.

24
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:59,634
We'll give you some time.

25
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,671
Thank you.

26
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,730
Sister-in-law, don't cry.

27
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,524
Ye Hua came to such an end
for doing what he should

28
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:34,502
as the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe

29
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,961
to save all lives, and the world.

30
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,629
You shouldn't hold a grudge
against High God Bai Qian anymore.

31
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:45,341
This will drive a wedge between Qing Qiu
and the Celestial Tribe.

32
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,283
I'm Ye Hua's mother.

33
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:53,918
He died twice for the same woman.

34
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,187
Am I to worry about the friendship
between Qing Qiu and the Celestial Tribe?

35
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,774
Am I not heartbroken?

36
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:05,107
Is Bai Qian the only heartbroken one?

37
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:07,338
Don't get so agitated, Sister-in-law!

38
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,502
That isn't what I meant.

39
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:18,721
Since High God Bai Qian has agreed
to hand over Ye Hua's body

40
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,271
we should be a bit more patient.

41
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,956
Please have some tea.

42
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,105
I heard that Little Princess will take
the throne as the Queen of Qing Qiu.

43
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:45,406
It's quite remarkable of you
to take one of the five thrones

44
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,310
in the Five Far Lands
at such a young age.

45
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,230
That was because my aunt was going
to marry into the Nine Heavens.

46
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,699
But now...

47
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,601
I think I won't have to
take the throne anymore.

48
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,127
Ye Hua, do you still remember?

49
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,367
I told you that I'd lock you
up in Qing Qiu.

50
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,040
You could look only at me every day.

51
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,922
But it now seems that...

52
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,937
I won't be able to do so.

53
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:56,704
It's because you're the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe.

54
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,536
I'm the Queen of Qing Qiu.

55
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,807
If I insist on keeping you

56
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,783
it will put Qing Qiu and
the Celestial Tribe in a bind.

57
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:23,500
I remember you told me then that...

58
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:31,831
You envied your second uncle the most.

59
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,473
At the time, I really didn't understand.

60
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,992
He... He's just the
Water King of the North.

61
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,348
What is there to envy
a Water King of the North?

62
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,939
But now I understand it.

63
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:01,596
If you were not the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe

64
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:07,732
I could keep you here in Qing Qiu.

65
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,882
Then we could be together forever.

66
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:23,418
I do have quite an awkward identity.

67
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,264
When I was a mortal...

68
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,996
I wasn't good enough for you.

69
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,339
Now that I'm a Queen...

70
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,211
I can't keep you.

71
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,965
Am I not actually useless?

72
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,638
But that's all right.

73
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:58,368
I'll always remember those days
we once shared.

74
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,321
I'll lock them away deep in my heart...

75
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:07,481
I'll never forget them.

76
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:15,618
All right, we won't talk about
such matters anymore.

77
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,451
I have a secret to tell you.

78
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,020
Did you know that...

79
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:36,216
when you stood outside my Fox Den
for seven days and nights...

80
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,857
I'd already forgiven you?

81
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:49,567
But you know how I am.

82
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,721
I just... had to act tough.

83
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,000
Ye Hua...

84
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:05,033
I'd forgiven you long ago.

85
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:17,854
It has been so hard on you
for the past few hundred years.

86
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,513
Ye Hua is sleeping very soundly.

87
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,091
Please carry him out very carefully.

88
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,724
Prince Yang Cuo...

89
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:10,239
High God Bai Qian,
what else can I do for you?

90
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,011
Can I come with you to
the Sea of Innocence?

91
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,589
My apologies, High God.

92
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,318
The Sea of Innocence is a sacred place
of the Celestial Tribe.

93
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,447
Only our tribesmen are allowed in.

94
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:28,446
You are, after all,
the Queen of Qing Qiu.

95
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,514
According to the rites,
it's best for you not to be there.

96
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:35,850
You were only engaged to my son,
not married.

97
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:41,350
Although they weren't married,
they were very much in love.

98
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,019
Why can't my aunt be there?

99
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,735
Forget it, Feng Jiu.

100
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,971
That's the rule of the Celestial Tribe.

101
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,092
Auntie!

102
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:16,442
Auntie!

103
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:21,658
Auntie!

104
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,246
Ye Hua!

105
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,399
- Auntie!
- Auntie!

106
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,918
Ye Hua...

107
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,956
Auntie! Here...

108
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,520
Fourth Uncle, take care
of my aunt for me.

109
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,105
Certainly.

110
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:52,278
Qian Qian, don't cry...

111
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:12,220
Crown Prince, welcome back
to the Celestial Palace!

112
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:21,604
The elders were around just now,
so I couldn't ask you.

113
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:26,461
Moreover, you were all there
to pick on my aunt.

114
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,212
What would you like to ask?

115
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,475
Your injuries...

116
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,176
They are almost healed.

117
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,859
That's good...

118
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,246
Then I'll...

119
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,224
I thought you were going to ask me
the question.

120
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,067
What?

121
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:53,153
The question you asked me before
the battle against Qing Cang.

122
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:58,845
<i>If... I said if.</i>

123
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:02,333
<i>If you didn't remove your name
from the Rock of Three Incarnations</i>

124
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,158
<i>would you have fallen for me?</i>

125
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,642
Yes.

126
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,134
Lord Dong Hua, what did you just say?

127
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:16,383
If I hadn't removed my name from
the Rock of Three Incarnations

128
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,821
I would have fallen for you.

129
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:27,639
I only took the heavenly trial
in the Mortal Realm to fulfill your wish.

130
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,201
But all the more to fulfill my wish.

131
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,309
Go.

132
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,805
You're here?

133
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,270
You're here!

134
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,935
I've been thinking for the past few days.

135
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:52,805
If I were vanquished as well,
I would be able to find you.

136
00:19:56,424 --> 00:20:01,788
But I'm also afraid that
if I were also gone

137
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:05,758
would I not remember you?

138
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,176
It's best for me not to
have my spirit vanquished, then.

139
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:25,778
At least, I could still
see you before my eyes.

140
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,657
I can see you smiling at me.

141
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,077
How lovely...

142
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,260
How lovely...

143
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:50,579
Ye Hua?

144
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,148
Ye Hua?

145
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,481
Ye Hua!

146
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,137
Ye Hua...

147
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:05,992
Ye Hua!

148
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,442
Ye Hua, where are you?

149
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:16,266
Ye Hua...

150
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,239
Ye Hua!

151
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,086
- Ye Hua...
- Get up!

152
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:27,542
Now that Ye Hua is dead,
you can't survive?

153
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,557
You're already at a ripe old age!

154
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,825
Can you still not get over
the loss of lives?

155
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,549
It isn't that I can't...

156
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,307
I don't know how...

157
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:52,347
Fourth Brother, did you know?

158
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:58,621
I was drunk that day and
broke the Soul-gathering Lamp.

159
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:06,036
In a blink, I recalled the past
from 300 years ago.

160
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:11,875
All that I remembered was
how mean Ye Hua treated me.

161
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,814
I couldn't recall how
affectionate he was to me.

162
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,573
Now that Ye Hua is gone...

163
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:30,079
All the memories that
flashed past day by day...

164
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,742
They were all about his devotion to me.

165
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:40,710
Quit thinking about him, then.

166
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,999
Fourth Brother, do you know that...

167
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:57,791
Li Jing came to Qing Qiu to see me?

168
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,045
That day, I gave him
such a sound scolding.

169
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:11,979
I told him that he spent his lifetime
seeking what he can't have.

170
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,006
When he did, he didn't cherish it.

171
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,442
How am I any different?

172
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,477
It is only after
Ye Hua is gone that I realize...

173
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,340
I really can't live...

174
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:42,405
without him.

175
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,863
Forget it.

176
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,920
Go and get some rest.

177
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:01,916
Ye Hua...

178
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,240
Ye Hua...

179
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,648
Qian Qian, come here.

180
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:51,784
Tell me about that play you read.

181
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,248
Ye Hua...

182
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,387
What is the matter?

183
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:20,449
This is so lovely... so lovely...

184
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:24,392
Qian Qian, there's really
nothing between me

185
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,932
and that figurine in the Mortal Realm.

186
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,941
I only had her look after
my sick mortal mother.

187
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:35,547
Su Jin made that figurine.

188
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:39,227
I know...

189
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:41,974
I know.

190
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,192
Qian Qian...

191
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:51,565
Although I grew up with Su Jin

192
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:57,596
I only saw her as a stand
for my brushes.

193
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:59,960
I never even noticed
what her brows looked like.

194
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,166
I don't care who she marries.

195
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:08,094
How could I be upset about that
and take you as a rebound?

196
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,114
I know...

197
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,009
I know.

198
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,604
I believe in all that you say.

199
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:27,025
The second of September
was a good date.

200
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,566
Sadly, we've missed it.

201
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,385
It's all right.

202
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:41,163
It's all right...

203
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:46,577
As long as you're here

204
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,044
as long as you're with me

205
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:51,688
any day is a good day.

206
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,556
Are you going to lock me up in Qing Qiu?

207
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,531
Can I?

208
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:16,961
Ye Hua...

209
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,113
Your parents said that
we're not married yet

210
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:29,202
so they can't even leave me your corpse.

211
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,807
I don't know if this cenotaph buried
with just your belongings

212
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,262
is good enough to let you hear me.

213
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,622
I dreamed of you tonight.

214
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,707
It was as if you were alive.

215
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,486
You could still speak to me.

216
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,378
I really think that it's lovely.

217
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:11,632
If you have the time,
come into my dreams more often.

218
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,305
Come and chat with me.

219
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:18,333
Play chess with me...

220
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,640
<i>[Three years later]</i>

221
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:20,054
Little lass.

222
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:24,087
You're the youngest
Queen of Qing Qiu now.

223
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:29,442
Your aunt was still training in
Kunlun Mountain when she was your age.

224
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,237
Grandmother.

225
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:35,960
Auntie isn't getting married anymore.

226
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,893
Why would she still pass on
her throne to me?

227
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,320
Your aunt...

228
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,071
It's fine, Grandmother. I understand.

229
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,420
What do you understand?

230
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,039
You've never been married.

231
00:31:54,653 --> 00:32:00,371
Grandmother, Auntie has gone traveling
with Fourth Uncle.

232
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,183
It's already been three years.

233
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:04,461
Will they return today?

234
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,982
I don't know about that.

235
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:34,284
I'll lead you out to be greeted by
our people of Qing Qiu.

236
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:35,991
Father...

237
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,961
Others would have thought
that you're escorting me to my wedding.

238
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:40,152
Goodness me.

239
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:42,261
You're soon going to become
the Queen of Qing Qiu

240
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,913
and you're still so mischievous.

241
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,480
Look at you.

242
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,170
You seem more like an elder than us.

243
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,463
I got it.

244
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:51,055
Are you trying to imply that

245
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:54,317
Bai Yi is more like how I was
when I was younger?

246
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:55,400
Listen to yourself.

247
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,319
Of all my five children,
only one is so headstrong.

248
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,701
You were just like that
when you were young.

249
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:01,806
What?

250
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,066
Are you headstrong?

251
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,593
I'm not.

252
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:07,634
All right now.

253
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:08,884
Let's get going.

254
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,452
<i>Lord Dong Hua...</i>

255
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:33,376
<i>A few days ago,
Star Lord came to tell me secretly</i>

256
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:35,093
<i>that for the past three years</i>

257
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,574
<i>you've worked so hard on behalf
of the Celestial Tribe</i>

258
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,938
<i>you've had insomnia
for more than half a month...</i>

259
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:42,734
<i>That Heavenly Lord has quite a few sons.</i>

260
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:45,705
<i>Why would you have to be
the exhausted one?</i>

261
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:54,044
<i>Sadly, I can only feel bad for you,
not change anything.</i>

262
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,172
<i>Lord Dong Hua...</i>

263
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,208
<i>From this day forth</i>

264
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,634
<i>Feng Jiu will become
the Queen of Qing Qiu.</i>

265
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:43,201
<i>Both my aunt and father taught me
that as the Queen of Qing Qiu</i>

266
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:45,777
<i>I can no longer act willfully anymore.</i>

267
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:53,690
<i>I can't enter Taichen Palace at will
to make you tea</i>

268
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,822
<i>and stay with you all night without
considering my identity.</i>

269
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:42,429
Congratulations to Your Majesty
for becoming the Queen of Qing Qiu!

270
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:45,253
All realms are in awe, and our people
pledge their loyalty to you!

271
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:07,266
Lord Shaoyang of Dong Hua Zi Manor's
Star Lord of Destiny is here

272
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:12,579
upon the orders of Lord Dong Hua to
congratulate the Queen on her coronation.

273
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,838
This is His Lordship's gift to you.

274
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,621
This is a map of all
Four Seas and Eight Far Lands

275
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:30,014
used by Lord Dong Hua when
he conquered the realms and united them.

276
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:32,748
His Lordship drew this himself.

277
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:43,780
His Lordship is so generous!

278
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:49,262
The conquest map of Lord Shaoyang of
Dong Hua Zi Manor and Heavenly Father.

279
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,186
We've only heard of it.

280
00:36:51,186 --> 00:36:55,128
Even the current Heavenly Lord
didn't get to see it.

281
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,523
I thought that was just a legend.

282
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:03,494
Thank you, Star Lord.

283
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:08,440
His Lordship sent his gift,
but I wonder if he has a message for me?

284
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,893
His Lordship said that you will
understand once you open the map.

285
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:17,213
Hundreds of thousands of years,
so much has changed with time.

286
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:19,893
None of what was drawn on
this map exists anymore.

287
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:24,108
Even the Four Seas and the Eight
Far Lands will change in the future.

288
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,992
Everything in the world
is small and insignificant.

289
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,380
There is nothing to keep on one's mind.

290
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,179
This bow is for Lord Dong Hua.

291
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:48,902
Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu thanks
Lord Dong Hua for his gift.

292
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:51,621
I hope that Qing Qiu shall remain friends

293
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:54,646
<i>with the Celestial Tribe for eternity
to bring blessings to all.</i>

294
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:28,773
- Well done!
- Great play!

295
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,728
- Great!
- Well done!

296
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,380
- Great!
- Well done!

297
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,670
Should we go for a walk?

298
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:54,802
Deity friends, you're also traveling
in the Mortal Realm?

299
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:56,954
How could you tell that we're immortals?

300
00:38:56,954 --> 00:38:59,150
Your celestial aura is very strong.

301
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,914
It's normal that a mortal
can't notice it.

302
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:03,590
But it wouldn't be right if I didn't.

303
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,300
Let's go.

304
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,489
Could you both lend me some money?

305
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:14,469
I saw that the actors did well in the
play, so I feel bad not tipping them.

306
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:16,215
That's not a problem.

307
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:17,697
But even as a minor deity

308
00:39:17,697 --> 00:39:22,090
you should be able to conduct
magic to create a few shillings.

309
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,885
Why would you have to borrow from me?

310
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:26,148
My parents are worried that
I'll get into trouble

311
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:28,184
so they sealed off my powers.

312
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:34,925
- Great!
- Well done!

313
00:39:37,213 --> 00:39:39,271
Who exactly is he?

314
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:44,862
This is the Fox King's son,
the most beautiful person in all realms.

315
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:46,884
How do I pay you back for this pearl?

316
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,081
Don't bother.

317
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:58,103
Look at this waterfall.

318
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:01,920
It goes right into the river
around the clock and never turns back.

319
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,409
I think that one's life should be so.

320
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,916
We shouldn't keep looking back.

321
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,548
We must look forward.

322
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:09,760
You're right, Fourth Brother.

323
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,460
Look at these mortals.

324
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,530
They only get a few decades of life.

325
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,291
Yet, they even have to go through
all sorts of fortune and misfortune

326
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,561
that Star Lord wrote for them.

327
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:24,262
Some might stay poor all their lives

328
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:27,032
while some never realize their ambitions.

329
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:31,355
The good women who are raised well
might encounter very different marriages.

330
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:34,411
But they are still leading
their lives happily.

331
00:40:36,846 --> 00:40:38,467
Looking at those mortals

332
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:41,443
don't you think that
you're a lot luckier than them?

333
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:45,471
You've become so long-winded
in the past three years.

334
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:55,666
Have I not become
so just to enlighten you?

335
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:59,315
Honestly, you look so much
better these days.

336
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:03,376
I've had him in my dreams every day
in the recent months

337
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,342
so I definitely look refreshed and well.

338
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:06,943
Fifth Sister.

339
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:10,882
Can you still differentiate between
reality and your dreams?

340
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:17,130
Fourth Brother, have you heard of
Zhuang Zhou's dream of a butterfly?

341
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,170
A man named Zhuang Zhou
dreamed that he became a butterfly.

342
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,128
He flew everywhere, and was so happy.

343
00:41:25,128 --> 00:41:29,021
However, when he woke up,
he realized that he was still a mortal.

344
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:30,983
In the end, no one knew
if it were Zhuang Zhou

345
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,945
who dreamed of becoming a butterfly

346
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:35,222
or that butterfly dreamed
of becoming Zhuang Zhou.

347
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:41,101
Since the first time I dreamed
of him three years ago

348
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,804
I already figured it out.

349
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:48,586
Whether I live reality as a dream,
or the dream as my reality

350
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:52,034
it's just a different way of life,
but it is still life.

351
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,333
<i>My dear!</i>

352
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,454
<i>My dear!</i>

353
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:57,746
Please don't leave me, my dear!

354
00:41:57,746 --> 00:41:59,275
My dear!

355
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:04,802
I'm so devoted to you and treated
both your sons as if they were my own.

356
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,025
My dear, you can't divorce me!

357
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,387
I'm begging you!

358
00:42:08,387 --> 00:42:09,748
You mustn't...

359
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:11,226
- My dear!
- Some widow you were.

360
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:13,798
You kept pestering me and drove
a wedge between me and my wife.

361
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,291
<i>I thought that I could have
some good days after marrying you</i>

362
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,463
but who knew that you have
such loose morals?

363
00:42:18,463 --> 00:42:20,460
You'd even seduce some thug
on the streets!

364
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,824
I have given you the divorce papers!

365
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:24,322
Stop pestering me!

366
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,313
My dear, don't!

367
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:27,617
My dear!

368
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:29,699
<i>My dear!</i>
