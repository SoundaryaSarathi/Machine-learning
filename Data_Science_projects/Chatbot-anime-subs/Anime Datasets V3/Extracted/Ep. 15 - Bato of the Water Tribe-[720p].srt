1
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,794
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,904
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:09,195
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,394
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:18,474
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:22,786
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,946
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:30,109
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,948
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,154
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,886
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:41,510
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,432
Hey look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.

15
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,898
Lemme see that.

16
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,809
This is a water tribe weapon. See if you can find anything else.

17
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:22,270
Did someone lose something?

18
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,582
No, we found something.

19
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,213
It's burned.

20
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:34,134
There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,441
The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill...

22
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:45,368
So then what happened?

23
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:47,927
I don't know. The trail ends here.

24
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:49,986
Wait! Look!

25
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:52,675
It's one of our boats!

26
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,340
Is this... Dad's boat?

27
00:01:55,419 --> 00:02:00,925
No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here.

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:12,415
See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being.

29
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,764
Get back! We're after a stowaway.

30
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:22,330
There are no stowaways on my ship.

31
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,930
He's paralyzed.

32
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,060
Only temporarily. The toxins'll wear off in about an hour.

33
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,783
But by then he'll be in jail and I'll have my money.

34
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,044
But how did you find him on my ship?

35
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,363
My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away.

36
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:52,753
Well, I'm impressed.

37
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,462
Very impressed.

38
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,090
Sokka...

39
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,255
I'm coming with you.

40
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:22,548
You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.

41
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:27,757
I'm strong! I'm brave! I can fight! Please, Dad!

42
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:30,734
Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most,...

43
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:34,803
...and for you right now that's here protecting your sister.

44
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,397
I don't understand.

45
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:43,298
Someday you will. I'm going to miss you so much.

46
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,001
Who's there?

47
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:50,882
Sokka?

48
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,078
Bato?

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,718
Who the what now?

50
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:54,883
Bato!

51
00:03:54,973 --> 00:04:02,606
Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two! Oh, you've grown so much.

52
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:03,938
Hi, I'm Aang.

53
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,598
Where's Dad?

54
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,479
Is he here?

55
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:11,788
No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern Earth Kingdom by now.

56
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:17,440
This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside.

57
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:26,030
After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey.

58
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:31,442
The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

59
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:34,833
They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.

60
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:41,128
Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey.

61
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:44,591
Thank you! It's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything...

62
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:47,512
What smells so good, Bato?

63
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,448
The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.

64
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,090
Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa?

65
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:58,019
Because he stinks so much! Am I right?

66
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,488
You have your father's wit.

67
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,320
Bato! It looks like home!

68
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:07,055
Everything's here, even the pelts!

69
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:12,041
Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins.

70
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,205
No way! Stewed sea prunes?

71
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,013
Help yourself.

72
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,613
Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.

73
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:30,935
Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

74
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:36,308
It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging.

75
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:40,134
Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel...

76
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:43,157
So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco?

77
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,677
You knew about that?

78
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,088
Everyone does.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,326
What's that story?

80
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:49,359
It's a long one, Aang, some other time.

81
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,493
You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.

82
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:57,955
Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny with hindsight.

83
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:03,484
Aang, put that down, it's ceremonial and very fragile.

84
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,527
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head...

85
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,887
...and convinced Gran Gran you were a water spirit?

86
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:13,773
Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice.

87
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,209
Out of my way! Step aside, filth!

88
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:32,621
He means no offense! I'm sure you bathe regularly.

89
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,188
I need to talk to you.

90
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:40,348
Well, if it isn't my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

91
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:50,491
Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.

92
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:57,850
Aww, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little short on money. Drinks on me!

93
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,595
Money isn't what I had in mind.

94
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:05,777
I need you to find someone.

95
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:08,503
What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?

96
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,374
It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.

97
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,822
Whatever you say.

98
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:19,016
If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.

99
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,117
Forget it.

100
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,688
Plus we'll pay your weight in gold.

101
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:27,451
Make it your weight and we got a deal.

102
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:28,481
You got it!

103
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,172
Get on.

104
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:46,871
There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father.

105
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:47,854
Really?

106
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,766
When?

107
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,520
Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message...

108
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,459
...when they found the rendezvous point.

109
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:56,099
If you wait here until the message arrives...

110
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,818
...you can come with me and see your father again.

111
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:04,117
It's been over two years since we've seen Dad! That would be so incredible. Katara?

112
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:07,937
I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.

113
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:11,353
It's been far too long, hasn't it?

114
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:16,568
I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does...

115
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:22,216
It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.

116
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:26,180
Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.

117
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,240
We don't have time for a long detour.

118
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,688
I'm sure your father would understand and be proud...

119
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:35,640
...that his children are helping the Avatar.

120
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:41,318
I can't believe they would leave me.

121
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,948
I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.

122
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,258
Uh, I know Bato.

123
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,856
Make sure he gets this.

124
00:08:56,867 --> 00:09:01,157
It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad!

125
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:18,854
Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.

126
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,890
Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left.

127
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:29,310
Yup, but now I'm back. Sure... could go for some delicious sea prunes!

128
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,047
Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

129
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,475
We're looking for someone.

130
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:53,954
I hope it's not Miyuki. Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?

131
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:57,724
The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.

132
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:16,662
Aha! I caught you! You should be ashamed of yourself... littering in the courtyard.

133
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:19,628
I'm sorry! I'll take care of this.

134
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:29,801
This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.

135
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,177
Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in?

136
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,669
Yeh, it's got the scar to prove it. Huh. How about you, Sokka?

137
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,976
You must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?

138
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,464
He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.

139
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,932
Oh, I forgot, you were too young.

140
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,360
What's ice-dodging?

141
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,565
It's a rite of passage for young water tribe members.

142
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,572
When you turn fourteen your Dad takes you...

143
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:02,807
...you know what, you're about to find out.

144
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,027
Why are we stopping?

145
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,396
Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.

146
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,918
We have no time for this!

147
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,202
Hey, watch it!

148
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,344
Oh look, he likes you.

149
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,191
Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

150
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:32,036
At my age there is really only one big surprise left,...

151
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:37,004
...and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.

152
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:45,973
Ice-dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery and trust.

153
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:49,917
In our village it was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.

154
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,573
How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice?

155
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,944
You will be dodging... those.

156
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:05,814
Sokka, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure the mainsail.

157
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:10,621
The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib,...

158
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:16,692
...without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about trust.

159
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:22,674
I know that! Why wouldn't I know that? I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

160
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:29,722
For this to be done right I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own.

161
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:38,699
Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady!

162
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:45,468
Aang, less sail! Katara, give him room!

163
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:54,749
Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee!

164
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,821
What does that even mean!?

165
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:08,734
Great job!

166
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,410
There's no way through!

167
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:13,594
We can make it!

168
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:16,249
Sokka, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should...

169
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,574
Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail!

170
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:23,901
Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!

171
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:26,018
Now!

172
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:48,233
The spirits of water bear witness to these marks.

173
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:54,350
For Sokka, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.

174
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:59,471
For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.

175
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:03,226
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

176
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,615
You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.

177
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:07,741
I can't.

178
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,886
Of course you can!

179
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,245
No, you can't trust me.

180
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:15,298
Aang, what are you talking about.

181
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:19,108
A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

182
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,464
You have to understand, I was afraid you'd...

183
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:26,807
This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you?

184
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:30,877
Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I'm going to find Dad.

185
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,263
Now Sokka, I think you should...

186
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:35,606
Katara, are you with me?

187
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:41,552
I'm with you, Sokka.

188
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,820
Good luck.

189
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,133
Okay. You too.

190
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,715
Guess I should be moving on.

191
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,907
That would be best.

192
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:21,806
I'm an idiot, Momo.

193
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,382
We're getting close.

194
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,915
That wolf sounds so sad.

195
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,559
It's probably wounded.

196
00:15:55,623 --> 00:16:00,928
No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain.

197
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:05,247
It's how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind.

198
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:12,009
They were my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.

199
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,105
Sokka?

200
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,422
We need to go back.

201
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,370
I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most.

202
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,649
You're right.

203
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:30,896
Your father will understand. And I know he's proud of you.

204
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,050
Thanks, Bato.

205
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:36,055
I know where to go from here. Take this in case you want to find us.

206
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:40,120
I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.

207
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:42,292
Looks like we're going alone, guys.

208
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,632
Avatar! You must leave!

209
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:47,546
Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.

210
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,162
A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.

211
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:51,018
Who?

212
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:55,207
A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man with a scar.

213
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,200
Zuko!

214
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,105
The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.

215
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,777
A necklace? Huh! Katara!

216
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:20,571
So this is your girlfriend. No wonder she left. She's way too pretty for you.

217
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,057
Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

218
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,083
We split up! He's long gone.

219
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,526
How stupid do you think I am?

220
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,784
Pretty stupid. Run!

221
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:36,560
What are we supposed to do now?

222
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:43,160
It's seeking a different scent... perhaps something that the Avatar held.

223
00:17:55,871 --> 00:18:00,681
What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!

224
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:13,579
Aang!

225
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,508
Up!

226
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:59,042
I'm starting to get some feeling back!

227
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,676
You've got something I want!

228
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:26,607
That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.

229
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,676
The perfume?

230
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:03,502
June! Noooo!

231
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:16,486
Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.

232
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,801
So, where do we go?

233
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,730
We're getting you to the North Pole.

234
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,793
Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is.

235
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:30,316
Don't you want to see your father?

236
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:35,706
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.

237
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,841
And we need you.

238
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:42,171
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you...

239
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:43,248
I'll be okay.

240
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:49,312
Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like... this!

241
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,174
Aang, how did you get that?

242
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:55,487
Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.

243
00:22:55,567 --> 00:23:00,262
Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?

244
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:02,723
Sure!
