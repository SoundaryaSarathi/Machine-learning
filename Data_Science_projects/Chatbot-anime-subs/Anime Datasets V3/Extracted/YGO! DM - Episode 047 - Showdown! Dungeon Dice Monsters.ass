Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.00,0:05:57.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The Summon failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.00,0:06:01.54,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The dice you chose were high level, meaning they're difficult to Summon.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.71,0:06:06.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,As I explained earlier, each die has a variety of crests on them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.17,0:06:07.34,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And the crests are...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.97,0:06:18.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You can see each of them on the dice.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.19,0:06:22.36,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And the Gargoyle I Summoned has three Summon Crests.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.36,0:06:24.53,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And thus, Summoning it is much easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.94,0:06:28.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But how easy a Monster is to Summon depends strictly on its Level.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.11,0:06:32.28,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Speaking of which, why don't you look at the dice you're holding?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.16,0:06:37.25,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,These dice only have one Summon Crest...!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.25,0:06:38.12,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.12,0:06:42.00,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The less Summon Crests there are, the lower your chances of Summoning it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.00,0:06:45.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But in exchange, the Monster's Level is higher.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.55,0:06:47.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The outcome of this game is determined
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.84,0:06:51.55,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,by how many Monsters you're able to Summon to the field.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.55,0:06:55.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If you only choose high Level dice, you stand no chance of winning!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.14,0:06:57.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}Oh no...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.35,0:07:00.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}The Levels of these dice are too high...!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.81,0:07:02.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That's not fair, Otogi!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.56,0:07:05.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You should start the game over now that he knows all that!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.69,0:07:08.94,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's obvious no one can win in this situation!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.94,0:07:10.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Start it over!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.57,0:07:12.99,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The game can't be stopped now.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.99,0:07:14.66,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Got that, Yugi-kun?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.66,0:07:15.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,My turn.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.54,0:07:20.87,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Dice roll!!

Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.92,0:07:32.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Dimension Dice!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.60,0:07:37.10,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I Summon Yaranzo!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.31,0:07:44.02,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}The Dungeons are connected!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.02,0:07:46.36,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,A passage is headed towards my side of the board...!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.36,0:07:50.78,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You must set the dice so your Dungeons link up.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.78,0:07:53.07,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Plus, I got a Movement Crest.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.07,0:07:55.32,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So I'll move my Monster one space.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.78,0:07:59.24,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And in case you don't want to use the abilities of the Crests you Summon,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.24,0:08:01.83,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,you can stock them in your Crest Pool.
