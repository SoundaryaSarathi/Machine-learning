<i>[Episode 20]</i>

3
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,491
Greetings to Consort Le Xu.

4
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:22,491
When I risked my life to beg for leniency
for you that day at the main hall

5
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:27,651
it was not for you,
but for Ye Hua's child in your womb.

6
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,372
Do you understand?

7
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:32,692
I understand.

8
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:38,451
However, I have already made vows
with Ye Hua to the Lakes of the Far East

9
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,132
and bowed to heaven and earth.

10
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:43,731
We are already husband and wife.

11
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,812
He is Crown Prince of
the Celestial Tribe.

12
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,532
He has his own predestined marriage.

13
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:51,931
The things you two did
in the mortal realm do not count.

14
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,211
- But even if it is in the mortal realm--
- Impudence.

15
00:02:56,211 --> 00:03:00,331
When I am speaking, you may only listen.

16
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,771
This is a rule of the Celestial Tribe.

17
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,171
Yes.

18
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,731
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

19
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,252
Su Jin.

20
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,331
Take me to Crown Prince.

21
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,852
Yes.

22
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:51,812
No need to stand on ceremony.

23
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,012
Why were you so careless?

24
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,132
I was too impatient.

25
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:03,211
You started the war the very night that
the Celestial Army arrived at Chang Sea.

26
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,532
That was a dangerous move.

27
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,292
I am willing to accept punishment.

28
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,331
Father.

29
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,572
The soldiers' fighting spirit was aroused
after Ye Hua was critically injured.

30
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:20,451
They only took three days
to attain an overwhelming victory.

31
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:22,451
Ye Hua has achieved great merit.

32
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,132
You may all step out.

33
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,012
- Yes.
- Yes.

34
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,331
A few days ago, I brought back a mortal.

35
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,851
She was carrying your child in her womb.

36
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,851
What is going on?

37
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:56,492
Is Your Majesty speaking of
a woman from Mount Junji?

38
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,531
Yes.

39
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,091
When I was carrying out the order
to subdue the Golden Lion

40
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,091
I suffered a minor injury.

41
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,891
I was rescued by this mortal woman.

42
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,091
The child she is carrying
is my repayment to her.

43
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:14,732
Since it is a repayment,
then it is not a big issue.

44
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,812
You will be succeeding
my position in the future.

45
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:21,331
It is not good to be too sentimental.

46
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:25,172
You just need to remember this and there
will be nothing for me to worry about.

47
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:29,492
However, since she is
carrying your child

48
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,492
she will stay in Heaven.

49
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,531
I think

50
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,372
a mortal staying in Heaven
is not proper Celestial Tribe etiquette.

51
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,132
Why is there a need
to go to such trouble?

52
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,052
A child of the Celestial family
should of course stay in Heaven.

53
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,331
Being left in the wilderness
is even more improper.

54
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:51,891
She is already in the Nine Heavens.

55
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:55,331
When you have recovered
and returned from Chang Sea

56
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,971
we'll make other arrangements.

57
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,771
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:03,891
Your Majesty.

59
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,812
I would like to say something.

60
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,252
What do you want to say?

61
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:10,372
Although that lady is just a mortal

62
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:14,372
she is already carrying
Crown Prince's child.

63
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:18,211
I think since Your Majesty
has issued the decree

64
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,372
to allow the mortal to stay in Heaven

65
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:24,612
then why not issue another decree
to make her a side consort?

66
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,091
Side consort?

67
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:33,612
If the mother of the child has no title

68
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:37,052
after the baby is born,
it will be mocked.

69
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,531
No. She is a mortal woman.

70
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:41,492
She cannot be
the Crown Prince's side consort.

71
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:45,252
Yes, if the woman is
so easily made side consort

72
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,531
it will be a violation of
the Celestial Tribe's decorum.

73
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,451
We will also be unable to
explain to Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

74
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,692
That is why Consort Su Jin's idea
is inappropriate.

75
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,172
Enough.

76
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:04,851
Since Ye Hua is nursing his wounds,
I will not be staying.

77
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,851
Take good care of Ye Hua.

78
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,851
Rest assured, Father.

79
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,732
I have watched Su Jin grow up.

80
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,482
How come it is becoming harder
to understand what she is thinking?

81
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,172
Ye Hua.

82
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,851
You are more important to Father
than anyone else.

83
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:38,572
You might be able to
protect Su Su for now

84
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,567
but if you wish for her to be safe
for a long time in the Celestial Palace

85
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,451
it is absolutely impossible.

86
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:51,692
After she has safely
given birth to the child

87
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:55,211
I will have her drink
the water of the River of Oblivion

88
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:59,492
to completely forget about me,
and this relationship will end.

89
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:22,372
I thought you were most sensible.

90
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:26,252
I never expected you would
say such preposterous things.

91
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,451
Heavenly Lord.

92
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:43,091
This copper mirror is an item
the Crown Prince carries with him.

93
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:46,611
I picked it up on the day he was injured.

94
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:52,692
Can you guess whose voice
I heard from this?

95
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,331
It is that mortal's voice.

96
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:03,692
Are you saying she and Ye Hua
communicate through this mirror?

97
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:09,491
Your Majesty knows best
the Crown Prince's personality.

98
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:13,251
If it is as Crown Prince says,
that he does not value this mortal

99
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,412
then why would he bestow
the copper mirror to her?

100
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:18,292
Your Majesty, haven't you
been worried that

101
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,836
Crown Prince would become
another Second Prince?

102
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:24,731
That is why everything I just did

103
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,611
was in hopes that the mortal
would remain in the Celestial Palace

104
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,932
so she would be easy to deal with
under our control.

105
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,091
All right.

106
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:36,292
Continue to keep an eye on this matter.

107
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,851
Yes.

108
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,572
Greetings, Your Highness.

109
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,412
You are...

110
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,451
I am the Water King of Chang Sea's
second daughter, Lu Xiu.

111
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,772
It is so late at night.

112
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,251
Have you come on some urgent business?

113
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,971
I came to deliver a tonic
to the Crown Prince.

114
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:27,451
This is a specialty of Chang Sea

115
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,331
the aquatic lingzhi mushroom that
grows only once every thousand years.

116
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,172
It will be very beneficial for
the Crown Prince's recovery.

117
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:37,812
I'll bring it in for you.

118
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:48,451
Go back to rest, Princess.

119
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,131
- But--
- What is it?

120
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,292
Is there something more urgent?

121
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,491
I...

122
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,011
I take my leave.

123
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:51,292
Your Highness, you need to
rest in peace for at least 20 days

124
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,211
- for your wounds--
- It is no matter.

125
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,052
- Go now.
- Yes.

126
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,611
- Crown Prince, Third Prince.
- Crown Prince, Third Prince.

127
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,652
Rise.

128
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,011
- Yes.
- Yes.

129
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,371
Is there any activity in the palace?

130
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,491
Report, Third Prince.

131
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:27,412
Just yesterday, a fire suddenly
broke out in Zhaohua Palace

132
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,532
and nearly... and nearly injured
that mortal woman.

133
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,532
Why would there be a fire?

134
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:36,131
I am not certain either.

135
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,652
I heard it was the Ghost Lord's mount
who caused the fire.

136
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,412
It was an accident.

137
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,371
We return immediately
to the Celestial Palace.

138
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:46,812
Yes.

139
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,451
- Greetings, Crown Prince.
- Greetings, Crown Prince.

140
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,052
<i>Crown Prince.</i>

141
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,971
- Ye Hua!
- Presumptuous.

142
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:19,491
With your status, how should you greet
the Crown Prince when you see him?

143
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:38,692
Su Su greets Crown Prince.

144
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,892
Mother.

145
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:53,091
You are with child. You need not
stand on ceremony from now on.

146
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,331
You may go.

147
00:13:58,711 --> 00:13:59,851
Yes.

148
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:26,211
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

149
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:35,091
The Crown Prince returned
to the palace so quickly?

150
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:41,652
Perhaps his injuries are not
as severe as rumored.

151
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:44,412
Heavenly Lord has forbid
Medicine King from speaking.

152
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:48,412
Ye Hua is also one to
keep everything to himself.

153
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:50,971
As for whether his injuries are severe

154
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:55,251
only he himself and
the ones by his side would know best.

155
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,371
Dijun.

156
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,932
Feng Jiu.

157
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,932
I passed by Xiwu Palace the other day

158
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,812
and saw you come out from there.

159
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,652
What was I doing at Xiwu Palace?

160
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:34,251
Other than Xiwu Palace,
only Zhuxian Terrace is in that area.

161
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,491
Could you have been
at Zhuxian Terrace to view the moon?

162
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:42,772
Yes.

163
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:47,971
That night, the moon was very beautiful,
reminding me of Qing Qiu.

164
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,451
Without noticing, I had
wandered towards Zhuxian Terrace.

165
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,052
You went to Zhuxian Terrace
to view the moon?

166
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,892
Yes.

167
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:58,772
The view was very delightful that night
and the moonlight was especially bright.

168
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:02,451
And I thought the Nine Heavens
is such a nice place.

169
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,932
Even the moon can be so clear.

170
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,812
The moon was big...

171
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,412
Really?

172
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:15,211
If you like it, then go often.

173
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,091
Thank you, Dijun.

174
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,611
Si Ming.

175
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,251
Present.

176
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,211
Remember to keep an eye on her.

177
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,011
Xiwu Palace is not a peaceful place.

178
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,892
It is best not to frequent the place.

179
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,892
I understand.

180
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,451
Did I say something wrong?

181
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,011
Si Ming, what kind of place
is Zhuxian Terrace?

182
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:14,372
When I told Dijun I went to
Zhuxian Terrace to view the moon

183
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,051
why did he act so strangely?

184
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,251
Did I say something wrong?

185
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:21,571
Your Highness has been at
the palace for some time now.

186
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,932
Have you not heard anyone speak of it?

187
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,852
I've never heard anyone mention it.

188
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,451
That's true.

189
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:30,291
Your Highness lives in
the palace maid's side chambers.

190
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,491
Those people naturally
would not speak of it.

191
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:37,892
Zhuxian Terrace has always been
an ominous place for immortals.

192
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,571
Ordinary immortals cannot use any of
their magic powers when they are there.

193
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:43,531
It is a place of bad luck.

194
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,372
Really?

195
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,852
You're not lying to me?

196
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,652
Most immortals avoid walking past it.

197
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,011
You went to the Zhuxian Terrace
to view the moon?

198
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,092
Dijun just can't be bothered to respond.

199
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:08,291
This Hall of Beautiful Youth
has been vacant for many millennia.

200
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,652
We've worked half to death and
it's only looking a little bit cleaner.

201
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,852
Yes, what prospects would we have
following this woman?

202
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,051
- Crown Prince.
- Crown Prince.

203
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,412
Who had you all come here?

204
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:34,971
Crown Prince, it was Consort Le Xu
who sent us here to serve.

205
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,731
To serve this new lady.

206
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,852
In the Nine Heavens, only those with rank
can have palace maids serving them.

207
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,132
She has no rank.

208
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,892
This is a violation of Heaven's laws.

209
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,251
Consort Le Xu is worried that

210
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,612
this Hall of Beautiful Youth
has been vacant for many years

211
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:51,291
so the divine energy is scant
and won't be good for the child

212
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,092
- so she had us--
- Leave now!

213
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,811
- Yes.
- Yes.

214
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,652
Ye Hua!

215
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:19,132
Were you severely injured?
How are your wounds?

216
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,251
I'm fine.

217
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,771
But what about you?

218
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:24,132
Where were you hurt? Are you all right?

219
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,571
Do you mean this?

220
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:29,451
It is not an issue anymore.

221
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:34,531
The wounds left by crimson hellfire
do not go away.

222
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,291
I can just cover it with my sleeves.

223
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,251
Su Su.

224
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,892
I am sorry for this.

225
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,612
But now that I have
returned to the palace

226
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,451
you can rest assured.

227
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,892
I won't allow anyone to give you
a difficult time anymore.

228
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,531
No wonder.

229
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:06,451
No wonder you never mentioned
your family to me before.

230
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:11,172
Nor did you take me to see them.

231
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:15,372
Why didn't you ever tell me?

232
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,011
That you are the Crown Prince
of the Nine Heavens?

233
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,612
I'm sorry.

234
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:29,531
But telling you then
would not have done you any good.

235
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:33,531
So... what will we do from now on?

236
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:39,692
From now on, I must be careful
with what I say in the palace.

237
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:44,971
In front of others,
I must be cold to you.

238
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,291
But, you have to trust me.

239
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,412
This is all to protect you.

240
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,092
Su Su.

241
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:03,731
I only hope that you can
rest in Xiwu Palace

242
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:07,971
and safely give birth to the child.

243
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:13,412
Avoid interacting with anyone
by all means.

244
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,892
Nai Nai.

245
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,372
Crown Prince.

246
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,811
This is the palace maid
who will attend to you from now on.

247
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,971
Your Highness, my name is Nai Nai.

248
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:56,132
I am a maid the Crown Prince brought up
from Deity Mountain in the lower realm.

249
00:21:56,132 --> 00:22:00,211
From now on, I will be staying in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth to serve you.

250
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,771
Your Highness, I'll go prepare
your evening meal.

251
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,051
Was it really the Crown Prince
who sent you all back?

252
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:46,652
Your Highness, we really were
sent back by the Crown Prince.

253
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:51,092
She is a woman who
does not have any titles

254
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,932
but she is carrying
the Crown Prince's child.

255
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:57,451
If she has nobody attending to her,
what if something happens?

256
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:00,412
When we were returning here, I heard
people from Crown Prince's palace say

257
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,731
His Highness took a maid just brought up
from Deity Mountain of the lower realm

258
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,932
to attend to this lady.

259
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:10,612
A maid just brought up here
does not know the palace's rules.

260
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:12,332
How can she wait upon her properly?

261
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,571
Your Highness,
people from Xiwu Palace say

262
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:18,652
after His Highness returned
to the palace, he randomly chose a maid.

263
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:20,491
The maid doesn't have
much experience either.

264
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:23,172
I'm afraid she does not know
the palace rules well.

265
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,451
You may all go.

266
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,211
- Yes.
- Yes.

267
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,372
Your Highness, you seem uneasy.

268
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:50,092
Heavenly Lord dislikes the princes
for being too sentimental.

269
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:55,251
Nobody dares to speak of
the second prince's incident.

270
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,811
A Celestial Tribe prince

271
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,531
was demoted to the North Sea
to be a Water King.

272
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:06,531
I am really worried he will follow
in the second prince's footsteps

273
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:12,011
and end up a laughingstock who only
wants the woman and not the world.

274
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:14,932
The Heavenly Lord said

275
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:18,316
His Highness hasn't asked
for permission to marry this mortal.

276
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:23,491
Even if he asks,
Heavenly Lord would not allow it.

277
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:29,531
That Su Su is a mortal.

278
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:33,971
After she gives birth, she will
naturally return to the mortal realm.

279
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:36,932
I am just worried that
if this news spreads

280
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:39,412
it will more or less have
an effect on the Crown Prince

281
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:42,372
and bring discontent from Qing Qiu.

282
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:45,132
Heavenly Lord has considered Qing Qiu

283
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:48,771
and has ordered this matter
to be suppressed.

284
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:51,892
There are over a hundred courtyards
in Xiwu Palace.

285
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,531
There are many maids serving.

286
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,491
As long as our servants don't discuss it,
not many people would know

287
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:01,811
there is a Hall of Beautiful Youth
within Xiwu Palace

288
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:05,251
and that there is a mortal living in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

289
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,652
That would be best.

290
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:13,692
The Crown Prince does not regard
this woman as important

291
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:17,251
but after all, she is
Crown Prince's woman.

292
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:23,491
You grew up by my side.

293
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:27,092
You know best the etiquette
and rules of the Nine Heavens.

294
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:31,092
When you have time,
teach her in my place.

295
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:32,811
I understand.

296
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:41,771
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

297
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:43,652
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

298
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,491
Your Highness.

299
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:51,652
That day, you had suffered a slash
from the Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer

300
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,932
scaring us witless.

301
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:55,412
Yes.

302
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:58,172
Seeing Your Highness
so lively and invigorated now

303
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,612
you do not seem like
you were injured at all.

304
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,971
Could it have been a scheme

305
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:07,211
to stir up our fighting spirit
to annihilate the Mermaid Clan?

306
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:16,412
I heard Ghost Lord Li Jing
submitted a book of accounts

307
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:19,852
saying someone in the north led an army
and wrested control of three cities?

308
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:22,771
Your Highness, that is correct.

309
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:25,652
It seems to be one trouble after another.

310
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,692
Back in the day, Li Jing was
helped into power by Heavenly Lord.

311
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:32,211
His eldest brother, Li Yuan,
was imprisoned in the Arctic Lands.

312
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:36,612
Li Yuan somehow escaped
and is raising arms in rebellion.

313
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:42,051
It is trouble continued from
the great war from 70,000 years ago.

314
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:53,892
All of you have experienced
the great war from 70,000 years ago.

315
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:57,011
Please tell me about it in detail.
Have a seat.

316
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,692
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:10,011
Nai Nai.

318
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,372
Your Highness.

319
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,011
Are there any other ladies
in His Highness's palace?

320
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:17,451
You are the only one in Xiwu Palace.

321
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:23,531
Has he always been so busy?

322
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:28,291
I heard His Highness often attends to
official matters late into the night.

323
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,211
Are you thirsty?
I'll get some tea for you.

324
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:36,291
No, you are with child.
You cannot drink tea.

325
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,451
I'll get water for you.

326
00:28:57,051 --> 00:28:59,172
Your Highness, are you feeling unwell?

327
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,652
Drink some water.

328
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,932
Nai Nai?

329
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:26,251
Your Highness, someone who says
he is your friend wants to see you.

330
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,892
I don't have any friends
in the Celestial Palace.

331
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:32,251
It is a man. He seems to be a noble.

332
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,571
A noble man?

333
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:48,412
After you left yesterday

334
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:52,251
my shaman said you are with child
and it is very unstable

335
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,932
so I came to visit you.

336
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:59,251
How did you know Her Highness
was in the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

337
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,251
Her Highness?

338
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:04,172
Yes, my lady, Su Su,
is the Crown Prince's...

339
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:06,971
She is the only lady in Xiwu Palace.

340
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:11,132
I cannot believe after a day

341
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:13,971
you have already married
into Xiwu Palace.

342
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,652
Why didn't the Crown Prince
send out an invitation?

343
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,092
He...

344
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:23,811
He was severely injured
and had just returned.

345
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:31,771
Allow me to read
Your Highness's pulse again.

346
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:36,332
I don't know if that would
comply with the rules.

347
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:40,291
It is just a pulse reading.
It should not break any rules.

348
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,771
Ghost Lord, you are wrong.

349
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,172
There are many rules in the palace.

350
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:50,731
To have your Ghost Realm's Shaman
read the pulse of a lady in Xiwu Palace

351
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:55,251
it would seem as if Celestial Palace's
Medicine King is useless.

352
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,372
I'll summon Medicine King
to take a look at Su Su.

353
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,132
This is...

354
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:05,051
Ghost Lord, this is the Heavenly Lord's
newly conferred Consort Su Jin.

355
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:09,811
My apologies.

356
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:11,251
It is no matter.

357
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:16,251
I just saw the fiery qilin by the door
and guessed Ghost Lord must be inside.

358
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:22,331
Since Consort Su Jin has made it clear

359
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:24,532
I will not do more than is necessary.

360
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,411
Farewell.

361
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,052
Your Highness.

362
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:42,331
Quickly make your salutations,
Your Highness.

363
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,612
Your Highness.

364
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:50,411
You are one of Crown Prince's women.

365
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:52,731
You only need to salute me
in front of others from now on.

366
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,211
There is no need to
stand on ceremony in private.

367
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,012
Thank you, Your Highness.

368
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:03,811
Since you are with child,
you must be more careful. Sit.

369
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,492
Your Majesty.

370
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:13,652
Where have you been?

371
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,492
I went to Xiwu Palace.

372
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:17,811
You went to see
the Crown Prince to apologize?

373
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,532
The Crown Prince was not in the palace.

374
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:25,452
I took the chance to pay a visit
to the woman from the other day.

375
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,652
The woman from the other day?

376
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,092
You only met her once.

377
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,092
Why did you pay
a special visit to see her?

378
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:38,492
Don't forget, Your Majesty.
She is one of Crown Prince's people.

379
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:39,851
You are thinking too much.

380
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:43,452
I only feel guilty that
my fiery qilin injured her

381
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,012
and brought the shaman to see her.

382
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,532
The Celestial Palace has Medicine King.

383
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:49,452
Why would she need
Grand Ziming Palace's Shaman?

384
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:50,532
Enough.

385
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,771
I have no notions for that woman.
Don't speak of it anymore.

386
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:00,532
Your Majesty.

387
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:03,692
I am just afraid you will
offend the Crown Prince.

388
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,931
That is why I am so concerned.

389
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,851
I know.

390
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,972
Let's not talk about it.

391
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:17,851
The assembly will start soon.
I'll take you around.

392
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:31,532
What are you doing?

393
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,132
Ghost Lord is an honorable guest.

394
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:36,092
However, Her Highness is
a traitor of the Celestial Tribe.

395
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:40,452
Please go back inside to rest
until your return to the Ghost Realm.

396
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:43,731
You cannot confine me in this way.

397
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:45,452
I am the Ghost Queen.

398
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,492
Please return inside, Your Highness.

399
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:49,492
How dare you treat me like this?

400
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,012
Go inside to rest.

401
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:55,891
There is a banquet tonight.
I must attend.

402
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,251
Wait for me in the guest room.

403
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,652
Your Majesty.

404
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,612
I am the queen of the Ghost Realm,
as well as your wife.

405
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:06,731
For them to treat me like this,
isn't it an insult to you?

406
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,692
So what if it is an insult to me?

407
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:11,532
The peace of the Ghost Realm
is most important.

408
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,291
Go back inside.

409
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:27,492
When you were brought up to
the Nine Heavens by the Heavenly Lord

410
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,211
I had wanted to
plea for leniency for you.

411
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:35,851
However, Heaven's rules are strict.
Fortunately, Consort Le Xu protected you.

412
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:42,452
You do not need to be afraid.

413
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:46,251
After you give birth to the child,
everything will get better.

414
00:37:56,371 --> 00:38:00,132
The name of this
Hall of Beautiful Youth sounds nice

415
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:03,851
but why is the interior
so simple and crude?

416
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:11,692
This ink and brush
are not the ones Ye Hua likes.

417
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,012
Did Ye Hua not say to have them changed?

418
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:19,572
These were arranged by Nai Nai.
Ye Hua did not notice.

419
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,251
That's true.

420
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:26,052
He nearly lost his life in the war
against the Mermaid Clan.

421
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:28,891
He just returned and is busy
day and night with official affairs.

422
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,637
Why would he pay attention
to these things?

423
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:33,532
Nearly lost his life?

424
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:35,652
You didn't see his wound?

425
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,851
It is an injury caused by
the Soul Slayer blade.

426
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,132
I was also at Chang Sea at the time.

427
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:46,012
I was afraid he really would die

428
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:48,652
and stayed by his side
for several nights.

429
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:50,891
Yet, I dared not look at his wound.

430
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:57,692
He has always been one to
keep everything to himself.

431
00:38:57,692 --> 00:39:01,132
Of course he wouldn't say
how severe his injuries are.

432
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:05,811
In the past, when we were playing around,
he wouldn't tell even when he got hurt.

433
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,652
Is that so?

434
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:11,411
Yes, he is a taciturn person.

435
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:17,251
Don't worry too much. He has been
like this ever since he was young.

436
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,612
Ever since he was young?

437
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,931
I grew up with Ye Hua.

438
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:27,851
Later on, I married Heavenly Lord.

439
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:30,411
He doesn't speak to me often anymore.

440
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:36,771
Let's not talk about this.

441
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:43,851
Lord of Numinous Treasures
is hosting an assembly.

442
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:46,291
All the deities of the world
will be attending.

443
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,572
He is also a fellow disciple
of the Crown Prince.

444
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:50,972
His Highness will naturally be attending.

445
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:55,612
Also, those who have ranks in the palace
have also received an invitation.

446
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:57,612
Would you like to take a look?

447
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:03,851
Without Ye Hua's permission,
I cannot leave this place.

448
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,612
If you leave with me,
nobody will block your way.

449
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:16,811
It was Consort Le Xu who had me
come here today to take you around.

450
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:20,931
Sister, since you are already
in Crown Prince's palace

451
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,211
you must learn to handle these things.

452
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,291
Consort Le Xu?

453
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,972
Consort Le Xu also knows that
Ye Hua cannot spend much time with you

454
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,172
and was afraid you'd be bored

455
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:34,612
so she told me to
take you to the assembly.

456
00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:44,331
Sister, since you are already living
in the Crown Prince's palace

457
00:40:44,331 --> 00:40:47,972
then you should think of yourself
as one of the Celestial Tribe.

458
00:40:47,972 --> 00:40:52,092
The Celestial Tribe is
the master of the world. The ruler.

459
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:53,972
Everybody else is a subject.

460
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:57,731
If you are even afraid to walk outside

461
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:01,811
then when you go with Ye Hua
to receive bows from the deities

462
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:04,891
wouldn't you be even more flustered?

463
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:10,411
I don't know the Celestial Tribe's rules.

464
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:15,211
If I say something wrong,
please teach me.

465
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,371
All right, don't worry.

466
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:20,371
I will teach you well

467
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:23,012
so that Heavenly Lord
will be satisfied with you.

468
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:24,811
Thank you, Sister.

469
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,572
That is good.

470
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:38,291
This fan seems like
an artifact of Kunlun Mountain.

471
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,492
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

472
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,371
This fan is a fake.

473
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:48,211
In the past, I did have
the real Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

474
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:52,251
In the mortal realm,
someone had tried to steal it from me.

475
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:57,052
But it is a good thing I later gave it
to someone and got this fake.

476
00:41:57,052 --> 00:42:00,452
Since it is a fake,
then do not carry it with you

477
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:02,211
so as to avoid attracting
unwanted trouble.

478
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:06,411
I don't bring it around with me.
I leave it in my chambers.

479
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,572
Nai Nai, put the fan away for me.

480
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:09,771
Yes.

481
00:42:18,851 --> 00:42:20,092
Be careful.

482
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,931
After all, you are with child.

483
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:27,012
You can rest assured and leave her to me.

484
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:29,172
Yes.

485
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:55,092
