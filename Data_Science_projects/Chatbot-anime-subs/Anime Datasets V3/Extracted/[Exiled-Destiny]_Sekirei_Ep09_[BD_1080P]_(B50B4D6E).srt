1
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,520
Now my life is blooming then falling

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,520
I grab destiny tight

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,920
There's no more hesitation anymore

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,530
Tying our bond

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,530
To the sky waiting for the dawn

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,360
Holding you, my love, tightly

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,530
I present an unbreakable prayer

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,740
We all are still in the darkness

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,370
Right now I just

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,380
Want to touch you deep in your heart

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,680
And give you all of my overflowing passion

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,050
I spread out my wings

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,220
Toward the future of our dreams

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,560
On them are engraved

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
The feeling you gave me that day

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,070
The words of our oath

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,240
Will make a miracle happen

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,240
My pounding heart, take off now!

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,270
My wish can fly high, high up

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,680
Feather 9:
"The Veil and the Wind"

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,590
Water Celebration!

22
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,100
Not so bad.

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,170
I'm thrilled!
A strong opponent! A strong opponent!

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,670
But how about this?

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,250
For Sekireis, there were
no wars of righteousness.

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,780
Some were better than
others, but that is all...

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,920
Water Dragon!

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,390
What?!
Water, perish!

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,140
That was dangerous! Who art thou?

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm just a passerby.

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,810
I only didn't like the unfair fight.

32
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,150
Unfair?! The one who
is unfair is that veiled one!

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,310
I gave my name properly, and...

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,480
But there are two of you.

35
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,090
Musubi!

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes! Is it my turn?

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,420
One-on-one battle is the Sekirei way.

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,960
Thou shalt play with that child there.

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,190
Ah, that's true.

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,660
That should resolve the issue.
Let's continue our battle!

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,510
I'm number 88, Musubi.
Pleased to meet you.

42
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,510
Ah, pleased to meet you too.

43
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,000
Um... shall we fight?

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,860
It's impossible!
I've already lost in every aspect!

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,860
You really are incompetent.

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Hey, you.

47
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,060
Yes?

48
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,200
She is number 95, Kuno.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,100
I'm her Ashikabi, Haruka Shigi.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,670
I'm sorry, but we won't fight.

51
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,870
I don't care about the
Sekirei Plan or whatever.

52
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,040
We don't have any intention
of fighting against anybody.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,530
Water Dragon!

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,090
This finishes it!

55
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,220
Ah, it's empty already?

56
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,890
Stay out of this!

57
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,230
You don't know how to speak to others.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,230
What a cheeky girl.

59
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,230
All right! I'll stand by her.

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,560
How dare thee...

61
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,840
Flower Refuge!

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,940
Remember, only number 01 and the
Game Master can talk to me like that.

63
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,250
Thou art... a Sekirei?

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,150
Number 03, Kazehana.

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,620
Bye, Miss Panty-Flasher!

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Bitch! They got away!

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,250
Number 03...

68
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,520
Musubi!

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,030
Musubi?

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,270
Where art thou?
Where hast thou gone?

71
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,100
Musubi!

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Why did you save me?

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,210
I've seen you before. How's Miya?

74
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,820
Rats!
I could trick Musubi-tan and others well.

75
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,080
You're as good as I'd expect from
Number 03. I could never match you.

76
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,330
Number 10, Uzume.
I hereby formally challenge you.

77
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,470
They're very late.
I wonder if those two are okay.

78
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,470
What are you doing, Mina-tan?

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,210
I'm helping with chores. If you have
something to be washed, give it to me.

80
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,280
Helping with chores?

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,650
Since the capital became like this,
my job's been shelved too.

82
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,990
A little thing like this is
the only thing even I can do.

83
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,090
It's not a "little thing." And please
stop putting yourself down that way.

84
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,030
I told you before, you should
be more confident in yourself.

85
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,000
Th-Thank you, Matsu-san...

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,830
What are you doing?!

87
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,000
You said if I have something
that needs to be washed...

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
I didn't mean you should
take off your clothes right here!

89
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,510
Oh, come to think of it, Musubi-tan
and others are all out of the house now.

90
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,610
This is a good
opportunity for the experiment.

91
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,220
Mina-tan, surrender nice and easy...

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,350
Wa-Wait, Matsu-san!

93
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,690
Matsu? Are you here?

94
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,700
No, not at all! I'm in the
middle of chores, so, see ya!

96
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
You coward!

97
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,100
I can't believe you're dressed like that, Matsu.

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,570
I was in the middle of an experiment.
Kagari-tan, would you join me?

99
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,440
I guess you want me to turn
you into ash, you lusty monster.

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,050
I was just kidding...

101
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,720
Anyway, can you give me more medicine?

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,260
You really shouldn't. My medicine
only lessens the pain for a short time.

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm really in pain.

104
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,190
Is your body still unstable?

105
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,060
I'm not recovering.
It's the first time I've been like this.

106
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,400
Does that mean...

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Maybe...

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,130
Never mind. I'll come
to pick the medicine up later.

109
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,080
You should be more confident in yourself.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,480
Confident, huh?

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,420
Minato-san!

112
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,650
Mi-na-to-saaaan!

113
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm sorry. Are you okay, Minato-san?

114
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm alive...

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,440
Come with me right now, please!

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,370
Now, hurry!

117
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,780
Wha-What's going on all of a sudden?

118
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,450
I would like you to meet somebody!

119
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,000
Me?

120
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,450
This is the apartment I used to live in...

121
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,790
Yes.

122
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,150
Isn't there somebody already here?

123
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,380
This is Musubi.

124
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,140
I'm Minato Sahashi...
I'm the one who used to live here.

125
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,840
Eh? So are you the failed college prep
student the landlord talked about

126
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,140
who brought in women
and had good times?

127
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,810
"Had good times"?

128
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,490
Minato-san, this is Shigi-san.
Number 95, Kuno-san's Ashikabi.

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,490
Ashikabi?

130
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,490
Yes. Is this guy your Ashikabi?

131
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,830
Yes. You don't need to worry anymore.
Minato-san can help you somehow.

132
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,160
"Somehow"? Uh... what?

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,840
Minato-san, I want to help them.

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,170
Musubi! Musubi!

135
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,840
Hasn't Musubi returned yet?

136
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,510
She took Mina-tan and went out again.

137
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,180
What?!

138
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,520
Where did they go?

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,970
I have no idea. Did something happen?

140
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,520
The veiled Sekirei?

141
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,860
Yes.

142
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,480
I see...

143
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,860
I have no doubt about it. She is the
perpetrator who has been hunting Sekireis.

144
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,500
Then, you say that number 95
was chased by the Veiled Sekirei

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
and disappeared with Musubi-tan.

146
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,210
Anyway, it's impossible for her to fight.

147
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,540
You mean number 95?

148
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,550
She's as frail as one can be.

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,220
Why did Minaka release
such a girl to the earth?

150
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Even that is one of the
possibilities for the future.

151
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,560
That's what the Sekirei Plan is.

152
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,120
Thou art using sophistry!

153
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,890
What canst thou expect of one
who can't even make a fist to fight?

154
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,230
Physical fights are not the
only way to fight for Sekireis.

155
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,670
Especially in a battle royale,
one must be able to use this too.

156
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,240
I wonder why I feel
abominable when I'm talking with thee.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh, sounds like we feel the same way.

158
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,910
No!

159
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,250
No fighting!

160
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,780
W-We understand,
so stop that, Kusano!

161
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,090
We'll make up and take a bath together.

162
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,590
I've lost...

163
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,590
Nobody can win against crying kids.

164
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,930
That landlord is really annoying!

165
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,040
He casually storms in to
complain about every single detail.

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,970
I know, I know!

167
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,270
He just comes to annoy
tenants for no reason at all.

168
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,280
Yeah, yeah! And when
I'm a delicate exam-taker too!

169
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,950
You're an entrance exam taker?

170
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,920
This is the second year I failed...

171
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,180
though I'm aiming for the
Shintou Teito University.

172
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,350
My comrade!

173
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,630
No way! You also failed twice?
And aiming for Shintou Teito U?

174
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,970
And also, I'm an Ashikabi like you.

175
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,300
They say even a chance
acquaintance is part of one's destiny.

176
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Musubi-chan...

177
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,310
In addition, you are both Ashikabi-sama,
you've lived in the same room,

178
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,640
and you also both failed
the entrance exams twice!

179
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,370
Do you understand
what you're saying?

180
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,990
The only difference is
that my Sekirei is incompetent...

181
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,990
No, I'm "Kuno"...

182
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,520
Um... so what is your problem?

183
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,670
You don't look like a bad guy,
so I will be honest with you, but...

184
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,410
It's dangerous stuff.
Can you keep it a secret?

185
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,670
Yes, a secret.

186
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,340
To tell you the truth,
we don't want to fight.

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,150
No, rather it's impossible to fight.

188
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,550
She's really weak, and her
only weapon is a loud voice.

189
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,020
So that's why we want to drop
out from the Sekirei Plan.

190
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,890
We want to escape from the capital!

191
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,860
Escape from the capital?

192
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,710
Mina-tan and Musubi-tan are late.

193
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,380
That bloody Musubi!
How long will she drag him around?!

194
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,720
Tsukiumi-tan, don't bathe with
other Ashikabis' Sekireis any more.

195
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,050
Why?

196
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,390
Because you'd be defenseless.

197
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,390
Kusano-tan, you too.

198
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,730
No matter where you are,
you must be attentive.

199
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,570
The battle royale has already begun in
this inescapable cage named Shintou Teito.

200
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,070
Escape from the capital?

201
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,070
Yes.

202
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,730
Um... Why don't you leave if you want to?

203
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,900
Don't you know?!

204
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,080
MBI choppers are flying all over day and night.

205
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,420
Tons of soldiers are at the
train stations and airports.

206
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,220
We have actually tried to escape
across the bridge, but there was...

207
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,660
The Discipline Squad?

208
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,770
Yes. According to her, they are dangerously
strong Sekireis following MBI's orders,

209
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,100
and they don't even hesitate to kill
Ashikabis if they decide it's necessary.

210
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,970
Even Ashikabis?!

211
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,110
We are watched by such guys!

212
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,750
MBI is to not going to let
us Sekireis and Ashikabis

213
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,780
get away from the capital no matter what!

214
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,440
The capital will become a battlefield!

215
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,460
So... that's what is going on...

216
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,130
Shit! That must be nice...

217
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,790
Huh?

218
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,230
I'm sure you can be so relaxed
because you have a good Sekirei.

219
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,530
Oh no, that's because
I'm too carefree... I'm sorry.

220
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,810
You kissed me.

221
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,810
You said I was your girl.

222
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,480
Okay, I know. I won't compare anymore.

223
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,050
Dammit, how the hell can
we escape from the capital?

224
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,490
I'm glad I made a
friend in a similar situation.

225
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,760
Yes.

226
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,170
Also, they were tightly bonded.
It was fantastic to see.

227
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah.

228
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,170
But... I wonder if there
really is a way I can be useful?

229
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,140
Minato-san...

230
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,740
"Maison Izumo"

231
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Thou art late, Minato!

232
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,850
We're back!

233
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,520
Hast thou done
anything secret with Musubi?

234
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,860
No, I didn't! I didn't! Right, Musubi-chan?

235
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,290
No, we just had a secret talk.

236
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,200
What was that secret talk?! What?!

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,500
Mu-Musubi-chan!
Please explain properly!

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,470
I can't walk any longer.

239
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,340
Me either!

240
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,140
We're here!

241
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,890
Huh? Did I leave the bed spread out?

242
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,890
I can't stand anymore. I'm going to sleep.

243
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,790
Wow! Your breasts
are huge! I'm down, too...

244
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,910
U-Uzume-san?!

245
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,850
And... who?

246
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
What happened, Minato?!

247
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,250
Minato-san?!

248
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,250
What is it? It's so loud...

249
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,590
Minato! What art thou doing, bastard?!

250
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,930
Oh, no, I don't know
what's going on at all...

251
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,600
I drank too much... Hmm? Where am I?

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,930
Number 03?!

253
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,940
Your voice... Turn it down!

254
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,910
Ah, excuse me, but who are you?

255
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,240
Could you be Minato?

256
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,290
You really... resemble... So you are his...

257
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,290
Stay away from that woman!
She was allied with that Veiled...

258
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,630
Landlady?

259
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,630
I told you I would never
forgive any violence here.

260
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,630
You too.
Do you understand, Kazehana?

261
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,970
It's been a long time, Miya...
so I guess I'm in Maison Izumo?

262
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,640
Landlady.

263
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,310
Do you know her?

264
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,980
She used to live here.

265
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Is it you who brought her, Uzume-san?

266
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,310
Probably.

267
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,320
Anyway, do something about your looks.

268
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,990
Sahashi-san will feel a
needless lustful urge again.

269
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,660
Wait, Landlady! What do you
mean, "lustful urge" and "again"?!

270
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,330
Thou... Art thou acquainted with her?

271
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:46,670
Yeah... we just met
in town by accident. Right?

272
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,670
Yes, right! Completely by accident!

273
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,230
- Right, right!
- Enough, already!

274
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:02,480
Number 10, Uzume.
I hereby formally challenge you.

275
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,020
No, it's too much trouble.

276
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,020
Aw, I'm sobering up.

277
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,850
I won't let you go!

278
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,710
The fight is over. What will you do now?

279
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,050
I can't... I can't lose yet.

280
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,050
Looks like there's a story behind this.

281
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,750
Well then, let's have a trade.

282
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,060
A trade?

283
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,390
I'll overlook you, so...

284
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,400
Treat me to sake. Sake! Sake!

285
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,070
I've started feeling silly,
being serious all by myself...

286
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,800
What do you mean?!

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,080
What?! Those two art attempting
to escape from the capital?

288
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Yes.

289
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Impossible! How can she have
the nerve to escape from the capital

290
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,410
even though she's a Sekirei?

291
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,590
He... Shigi-kun said that his
Sekirei's unbelievably weak,

292
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,420
and that's his only way to protect her.

293
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,790
Is that an elopement?

294
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,430
Lovers hand in hand
on the run! How romantic!

295
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,760
Shut thy mouth!

296
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,100
Number 95 and her Ashikabi
want to escape from the capital?

297
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Yes.

298
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,440
Do you think it's actually possible?

299
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,780
Supposing, just supposing, that all of
your Sekireis join forces at full strength...

300
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,150
Really?

301
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,120
Then, we can help Shigi-kun and...

302
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,420
You don't understand
how formidable MBI is.

303
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,130
An island?

304
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,660
Kamikura Island.

305
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,900
It all began when two students
landed for an investigation

306
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,140
without permission on this island that
suddenly arose out of the ocean near Japan.

307
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,470
They found a ruin on the island.

308
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,810
A ruin?

309
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,780
But "ruin" may be a misnomer...

310
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,150
It was way more advanced
than human civilization.

311
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,820
Life-forms appearing exactly
like humans were sleeping there.

312
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,490
Although their genetic
structures were similar to humans',

313
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,490
their life forces were much stronger,

314
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,830
and not only that, each of
them had a special ability.

315
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,830
Could they be... Sekireis?

316
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,470
Yes. And the student who discovered
them was the future president of MBI,

317
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:44,180
or Mid Bio Informatics, Hiroto Minaka.

318
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,920
Minaka turned MBI into a colossal
enterprise that can even buy out the capital

319
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,050
by providing just a bit of the ruin's
ultra advanced technology to society.

320
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,860
"Ultra Giant Enterprise!?
MBI became the top of the industry!"
By providing just a bit of the ruin's
ultra advanced technology to society.

321
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,120
By providing just a bit of the ruin's
ultra advanced technology to society.

322
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,590
"Teito Sports, MBI Conquers the World.
Rapidly grew to a super-giant conglomerate.
Taking over even Shintou Teito."
By providing just a bit of the ruin's
ultra advanced technology to society.

323
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,190
By providing just a bit of the ruin's
ultra advanced technology to society.

324
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,960
And everything was for this Sekirei Plan.

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,200
For the Sekirei Plan?

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,070
What's important now is
that Minaka chose the capital,

327
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,210
Shintou Teito, as the battleground.

328
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,610
Retiring from the game without permission

329
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,220
or helping someone to do so is serious
treason for both Sekireis and Ashikabis.

330
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,890
That means... we'd make MBI our enemy.

331
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,090
I just want you to know that, Mina-tan.

332
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,570
Minato-san, lunch is ready to be served.

333
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,900
Maybe...

334
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,060
Yes?

335
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,250
Maybe the escape plan
is too reckless after all...

336
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,920
Wishes will be granted, Minato-san.

337
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,990
I think, as long as we care about
each other, and have strong bonds,

338
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,830
there's no such thing as
"impossible" in this world.

339
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,270
Hey, hey, I heard something interesting.

340
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,610
Blue found a Sekirei and Ashikabi
trying to escape from the capital.

341
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,610
Isn't this unusual?

342
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,280
And? Did Blue kill them?

343
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,610
Nope. She said they were
kinda interesting, so she let them go.

344
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,280
That's pretty good judgment for Blue.

345
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,290
Is that so?

346
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,960
It'll get more and
more interesting, I'm sure.

347
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,290
I see. Then I'm looking forward to it.

348
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah. Me too.

349
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

350
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is the textbook of love

351
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, don't get upset so

352
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without false starts, it's show time!

353
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,440
Get the funky beat!

354
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,820
First ones win?

355
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090
No such thing in this case! No, no!

356
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,000
That's perfect for me

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,660
A sudden scramble!

358
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,100
But I'm a woman, I can't lose. No, no!

359
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
My feelings grow

360
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,970
No, and then a big bang!

361
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,610
Don't seduce him

362
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,770
Get away from him

363
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,110
My heart is pounding hard, so hard!

364
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,110
Secret, going off by myself

365
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,680
Big success, just two of us

366
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,520
Sweet and dazzling night

367
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,620
To tell you the truth, I want him to

368
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,990
Hold only me, just me

369
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,130
I want to monopolize him so badly

370
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,130
I wonder if I could stick a flag on him?

371
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,140
I knew it, he's so wimpy, what should I do?

372
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,140
He's just too gentle

373
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,150
I love that about him

374
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,380
So we are devoted to him

375
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,370
Dear Sweet Heart!

376
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,390
I'm Yukari Sahashi.

377
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,730
I came to the capital I'd longed for,
but I met a mysterious pretty boy,

378
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,400
and now we're actually living together!

379
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
"Super-moe almost R-rated
love comedy, Yukari and Shiina!"

380
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,070
That would've made a better program,
don't you think so, Shiina?

381
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,210
In one sense, it's not that wrong, but...

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,410

In one sense, it's not that wrong, but...
