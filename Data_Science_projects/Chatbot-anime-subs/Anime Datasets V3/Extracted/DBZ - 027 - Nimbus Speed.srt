00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,859
Looks like Kakarrot
has decided to lay low.

2
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,032
What a coward.

3
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:44,035
F- Father is not a coward!

4
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:46,972
D- dammit...

5
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,770
What's become of you, Goku!?

6
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:07,655
Hurry, Kinto Un!

7
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:12,160
Go, go, go! Go!!

8
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:19,004
At this point, it looks like we'll have
to fight them with just the three of us.

9
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,339
You know what to do.
Let's go with that plan.

10
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:23,008
Y- yeah.

11
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:27,138
First, I draw his attention
as much as I can.

12
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:32,651
I'll find an opening, and grab his tail,
the Saiyans' weakness.

13
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,353
Once his power fails,
and he can't move...

14
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:38,690
I- I rush him as hard as I can.

15
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,921
That's right.
Watch yourself!

16
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,634
What are you all mumbling about?
It won't do any good.

17
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,637
What can you guys do against me?

18
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:57,131
We'll show you what we can do, right now!

19
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,330
All right!

20
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,991
Here goes!

21
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,131
He's started charging me
all of a sudden!

22
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:34,778
<i>Keep his attention!</i>

23
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,212
<i>Now!</i>

24
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:46,958
Why, you-!

25
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,789
Gohan!

26
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,494
We did it!

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,031
You fools!

28
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,546
I- impossible!

29
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,325
P- Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,694
Whoa, don't you die, now.

31
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,296
We still have to have you
tell us about the Dragon Balls.

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,774
I- it can't be!

33
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,714
Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

34
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:47,208
Did you think we would leave
our weak spot untrained forever?

35
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:53,324
That's too bad. The best
that this planet had to offer,

36
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,588
and this is what happens
to him after one blow.

37
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,630
P- Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

38
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,634
Shake it off! Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

39
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:06,971
Piccolo-<i>san</i>! Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

40
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,496
I- it's hopeless now...

41
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:15,647
Now then, while he has gone beddy-bye,

42
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:18,639
I think I'll toy around
with the little squirts.

43
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,659
I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

44
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:32,664
Hey, you've inherited
the blood of a true Saiyan.

45
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:36,293
You'll be able to amuse me
for a little while, right?

46
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,443
You know, your old man
is pretty cold, huh?

47
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:48,276
Letting his own son die like this...

48
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:06,397
Dammit, what's going on here!?
The TV isn't showing anything!

49
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:07,632
Come on, come on, come on!

50
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,361
It's no use.

51
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,538
I'm sure that things
aren't going so smoothly

52
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,870
that they can provide us
with a TV broadcast.

53
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:20,645
Y- you don't think that everyone
has been killed already, do you?

54
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,876
Don't you say anything
dire like that again!

55
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,330
C- Chichi, what are you doin',
gussied up like that?

56
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,666
T- those are Lunch-<i>san</i>'s...

57
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,337
I can't take it anymore!
I'm goin' to rescue Gohan!

58
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:49,941
D- don't be ridiculous! If you go now,
you're goin' to be killed!

59
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,944
I don't care! I'm goin'
to die together with Gohan!

60
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,946
H- hold on, now!

61
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:58,283
Chichi! Calm down!

62
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:02,954
Let me go, Pa!
Let me go!

63
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,958
Let go of me! I- I'm goin'!

64
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:12,297
Pa! Let go of me! I'm goin'!
I'm goin'! I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

65
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:17,302
Now see here, Chichi!
You're goin' to get killed!

66
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,304
--I'm tellin' you no!
--I'm goin' to go rescue Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

67
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,639
--Come on, re-think this!
--I'm goin' where Gohan is!

68
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,504
Chichi!

69
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,978
<i>Tenshinhan...</i>

70
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:29,344
<i>Yamucha...</i>

71
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:35,653
<i>Son-kun...</i>

72
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,678
<i>l believe in you.</i>

73
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:43,559
<i>l'm sure... l'm sure you're</i>
<i>going to save the earth.</i>

74
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:03,441
Hey now, don't you snuff it just yet!
Amuse me a little longer.

75
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,666
That's more like it!

76
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:35,502
Stop!

77
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,553
Ho, at least his moves are pretty good.

78
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,091
You dirty brat!
Bounce around, will you!?

79
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,035
Let me show you
something I've been saving.

80
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,066
<i>Kienzan!!</i>

81
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,921
What a worthless technique!

82
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,034
Nappa! Get out of the way!

83
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,991
That idiot! Can't he tell
what kind of technique that is!?

84
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,824
D- damn!

85
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,671
W- why, you-!

86
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:18,768
How dare you wound my face!

87
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:29,350
Away with you!

88
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:38,192
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

89
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:47,000
Now to finish you!

90
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,001
Y- you bastard!

91
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:20,630
A- are you awake already!?

92
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:27,345
Looks like you're having
a hard time with them, Nappa!

93
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:33,045
Don't you... don't you
look down on Earth, Saiyan!

94
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:41,125
W- w- why, you! Now I'm mad!
I was holding back against you,

95
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,694
since we can't kill you
because of the Dragon Balls.

96
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,363
But don't get too full of yourself!

97
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,560
You're the one
who's too full of himself!

98
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,637
W- what <i>Ki</i> is this!?

99
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:56,937
T- there's an incredible <i>Ki</i>
coming this way from far off!

100
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:04,946
I- it's true! A- an amazing,
yet familiar <i>Ki</i>!

101
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:10,784
N- no doubt about it.
I can feel it.

102
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:18,996
You guys are all just spouting
nonsense! What is this!?

103
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:24,195
It could only be him.
It's Son Goku!

104
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:33,344
<i>Just a little farther, Goku.</i>
<i>Hurry! Make haste!</i>

105
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:39,583
It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!
I knew he was sure to come!

106
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,687
Damn that bastard,
making us wait for him!

107
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:48,785
F- Father! Father really
is coming! Hurry!

108
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,630
G- Goku...

109
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,299
Kakarrot?

110
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,630
Where is he?

111
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:07,509
These guys have the unusual ability
to sense someone's presence.

112
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:13,682
Is it Kakarrot?
Let's see...

113
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:23,361
I'm close. I can feel them.
There are two enormous <i>Ki</i>,

114
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:26,998
two even more enormous <i>Ki</i>,
and one small <i>Ki</i>...

115
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:32,003
That number ain't right.
Has somebody died?

116
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:35,302
Kinto Un, please hurry faster!

117
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,291
Vegeta-<i>sama</i>!

118
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,260
Is what these guys are saying true?

119
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,633
Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

120
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,103
I don't know whether
it's Kakarrot or not,

121
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:09,698
but someone will be here
in about four minutes.

122
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,133
Someone with a battle power of 5000.

123
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:20,651
Five- five thousand!?
That's impossible!

124
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,887
<i>lt's definitely a reading</i>
<i>that makes it unthinkable</i>

125
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,989
<i>that this is the same</i>
<i>Kakarrot as before.</i>

126
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,060
<i>What's more, these guys</i>
<i>are able to alter their readings.</i>

127
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,995
<i>That means it's at least 5000.</i>

128
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,400
T- that can't be! It must
be some kind of mistake!

129
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,268
It's unusual to see this guy panicked.

130
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:50,281
Nappa! Kill them! If all four of them
team up, it could be a problem for us!

131
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:52,950
It will also serve
as a warning to Kakarrot!

132
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,281
What!?

133
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,290
But what about the Dragon Balls?

134
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,781
I don't care! I have an idea.

135
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:06,363
If we go to Planet Namek,
the home world of that Namekian,

136
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,633
I'm sure that there will be Dragon Balls
that are even more powerful.

137
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,603
I thought they were
just worthless stories,

138
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,639
but if Kakarrot really
has come back to life,

139
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,310
then those legends are true after all.

140
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,983
I get you. But Kakarrot being 5000
has to be a mechanical malfunction.

141
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:31,655
Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change
the fact that I get to kill them all.

142
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,783
I'll start with you!

143
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:40,431
P- Piccolo-<i>san</i>, run!

144
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,001
I'll stop him one way or another
until Father gets here!

145
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,002
What!?

146
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:49,673
After all, if you die, Piccolo-<i>san</i>,
then Kami-<i>sama</i> dies too,

147
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,609
and the Dragon Balls will...

148
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:57,605
You're talking nonsense! There's no way
you can stop him by yourself!

149
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:05,718
Stop me, you say? <i>Me</i>?

150
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:12,054
I- if this keeps up,
there won't be any going back...

151
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:16,228
I- it's no use... I can't move...

152
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:25,234
Don't make me laugh, you brat!

153
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,539
No!

154
00:16:56,273 --> 00:17:00,232
I- incredible!
D- did he get him?

155
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:34,475
Why, you brat!
This is where it ends!

156
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,418
N- no!

157
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,390
Goku...

158
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,070
Die!!

159
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,624
Who- who are you?

160
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:23,092
They're sour!

161
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:07,805
<i>Piccolo leaps in to rescue</i>
<i>Gohan from his pinch.</i>

162
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:11,008
<i>What will be Piccolo's fate?</i>

163
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,602
<i>Hurry, Goku!</i>
