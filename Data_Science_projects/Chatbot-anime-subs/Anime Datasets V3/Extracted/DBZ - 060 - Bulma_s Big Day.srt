1
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,639
Let me go!
Please, let me go!

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,342
I don't even know Vegeta!

3
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:22,575
Even if you take me to Freeza,
there's nothing I can tell him!

4
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,241
Which would mean...

5
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm done for.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,427
Thinking back, my life has
been a series of hardships...

7
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,983
No! No, no, no!

8
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:36,321
I don't want to die here! Let me go!

9
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,084
Hey, calm down!

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,620
For crying out loud,
what a handful she is.

11
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,293
There are still some things we have
to ask you. We can't let you die so easily.

12
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,896
How many times do I have
to tell you before you get it!?

13
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:21,229
I don't have anything
besides that Dragon Ball!

14
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,569
We'll see.

15
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,563
I wonder how well you'll be able to feign
ignorance like this in front of Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

16
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:48,660
So, why is it that Freeza-<i>sama</i> started
collecting these Balls, anyhow?

17
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,427
Beats me. It's probably something lower-rank
soldiers like us don't need to know.

18
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:01,531
Don't you guys have the slightest
idea what the Dragon Balls are?

19
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,277
Let's go.

20
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,380
Y- you dummies.

21
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,283
When you get the Dragon Balls together,
something fantastic happens.

22
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:14,217
You don't say.

23
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,626
It's true! The Dragon Balls are amazing
things that can grant any wish!

24
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:23,355
Stop talking nonsense!

25
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,964
It isn't nonsense!

26
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:30,969
If you bring the seven Dragon Balls together,
you could have power beyond even Freeza's!

27
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,231
What?

28
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:39,310
I- it's true. That's why everyone
is so desperate for them, you know.

29
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,315
Hey, Buleberry, we don't have time
to listen to her hogwash.

30
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,819
So, wouldn't it be better
if you guys left me alone,

31
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,188
and went off to gather
the Dragon Balls?

32
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,756
H- hey!

33
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,305
I- if you make a wish about wanting
to make the universe your own,

34
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,569
it could come true!

35
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,872
Let's go, Buleberry!

36
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,681
Sounds interesting.

37
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:27,959
Hey!

38
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,294
Now, hold on.

39
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:35,633
Freeza-<i>sama</i> would be thrilled if we brought
all seven Dragon Balls to him. Besides,

40
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:40,638
if what she says is true, then we
could become rulers of the universe!

41
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:43,975
T- that's right! That would
be the best thing to do.

42
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:48,646
Come on, let's go where
the other Dragon Balls are.

43
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:53,251
I- I don't know where they are!
Y- you guys go look for them on your own!

44
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,922
I see. You're saying you want
to meet a painful fate here, do you?

45
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,584
No! Help!

46
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,358
Now, where are they?

47
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,991
T- the sea! They're
submerged beneath the sea!

48
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,733
Is that right?
That's where they are, huh?

49
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,366
Let's go, Raasberry.

50
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,003
What choice do I have?

51
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,194
<i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

52
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,720
All right!

53
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,367
Here goes!

54
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:01,913
<i>Ka...</i>

55
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,916
<i>me...</i>

56
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:09,250
<i>...hame-Ha!!</i>

57
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:15,581
Yikes!

58
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:51,562
Whoo, that was close,
that was close!

59
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:55,020
But it looks like my body is
pretty much able to take it now.

60
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:11,408
Yow!

61
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,219
Hey...

62
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:21,786
J- just a minute, here!
Hey, what are you planning to do!?

63
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,598
We're going to have you lead us
to where the Dragon Balls are.

64
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,271
Y- you've got to be kidding me!
I can't accompany you guys into that sea!

65
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,034
Just come along.

66
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:43,945
Listen, I won't run away!
I can't breathe underwater! Honest!

67
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,699
You knew?

68
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,417
Once they realize there aren't
any Dragon Balls anywhere,

69
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,612
they'll kill me for sure.

70
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,322
Get going!

71
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,584
I know-!

72
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:30,055
I'm going! I'm going, okay!?

73
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:54,452
I don't have anything
like a weapon installed.

74
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,319
The most that I have are flares.

75
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,225
Where are the Balls!?

76
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,305
At this point,
it's time to get desperate.

77
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:17,206
I remember! It's a little
bit farther that way.

78
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:36,152
<i>ls this where?</i>

79
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,276
That's it. If I can lure
those guys in there...

80
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,949
In there! In there!

81
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,247
Go on in there!

82
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,686
In there, okay?

83
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,561
J- just a minute!
What are you doing!?

84
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:35,479
This is certain to be
the place where I die.

85
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,998
J- just... just a minute!
See? Over there!

86
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,365
See? They're over there!
Over there!

87
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,210
Are those?

88
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,619
That's them! That's them!

89
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,644
They're over there, aren't they?

90
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,793
You should hurry along, too.

91
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,887
He's going to have them
all to himself. Go on!

92
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,279
The more the better, you know!
Hurry up and take them.

93
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,634
Nice!

94
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,042
I'm blinded!

95
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:09,232
You take it from here,
if you please, Monster-<i>san</i>.

96
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:32,187
What kind of guys are these!?
I'm done for now!

97
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,183
I've had it!

98
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:16,529
Good grief, you've got to be kidding me,
making me work this hard!

99
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,597
No way!

100
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,577
Wah! Kuririn!
Hurry up and come back!

101
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,752
It's been nearly four days.
Is it still far?

102
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,795
Yeah, a little farther. Dammit,
Grand Elder-<i>san</i> is going to be dead.

103
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:56,437
All right...

104
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,578
How about we try
drastically raising our pace?

105
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:04,582
As far away as we've come,
there's no way Vegeta will know.

106
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:09,587
Y- you're right. Besides,
Father will be here really soon.

107
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:12,256
That settles it, that settles it.
Let's fly at full speed!

108
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,018
Right.

109
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:14,246
Go!

110
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:20,598
If we fly at this speed,
we'll arrive in an hour.

111
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,259
Right!

112
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,943
I've found you at last!

113
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:37,948
There are two presences- Kakarrot's son,
and the runt who was with him.

114
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:42,286
Though I thought they would be
coming here, after my Dragon Balls,

115
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,846
but they're somewhere pretty far away.

116
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:48,959
I don't know what they're planning,
but if I let this opportunity pass,

117
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,228
I probably won't have another
chance to force the location...

118
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,788
...of the last remaining Dragon
Ball that they have out of them.

119
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,067
If I take this one with me,

120
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,303
then even if that woman
does seek this place out

121
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:03,574
with her unusual little device,
she won't be able to get all seven.

122
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,242
All right!

123
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:09,235
You're going to pay this time
for sure! Brace yourselves!

124
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:15,745
Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

125
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,924
We just received a message
from the Ginyu Special Corps.

126
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:24,261
They said that they are currently
passing through the area near 9035-XY,

127
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,930
and that they would be arriving shortly.

128
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,261
Very well.

129
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,202
They are finally arriving, are they?

130
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:35,606
Seeing as how, fortunately,
nothing has happened,

131
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:40,944
it would appear that Vegeta has been unable
to get all seven Dragon Balls together.

132
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:46,283
Remember this well: Once I get the Scouters
the Ginyu Special Corps will be bringing,

133
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:49,775
I will be able to find you,
no matter where you are.

134
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:22,653
<i>Exactly what sort of men are in this Ginyu</i>
<i>Special Corps, who would be arriving shortly?</i>

135
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:27,324
<i>And with Vegeta having finally</i>
<i>discovered Kuririn and Gohan,</i>

136
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:31,124
<i>is there any way for them</i>
<i>to get out of this crisis?</i>
