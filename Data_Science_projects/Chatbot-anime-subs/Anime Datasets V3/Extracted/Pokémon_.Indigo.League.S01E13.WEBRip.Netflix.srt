[Brock]
Everything's somewhere.

15
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,236
[Misty]
Ash, have you gotten us lost again?

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,362
[Pikachu whimpers]

17
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,240
[narrator] <i>Well, here's a familiar scene.</i>
<i>Wandering in a forest,</i>

18
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,867
<i>it appears our friends</i>
<i>have once again lost their way.</i>

19

<i>Ash left his home in the town of Pallet,</i>

21

<i>and a lot has happened</i>
<i>since he began his Pokémon journey.</i>

22
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,296
<i>He's already earned two</i>
<i>of the qualifying badges</i>

23
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>for participation in the Pokémon League,</i>

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,758
a<i> boulder badge</i>
<i>and a cascade badge.</i>

25
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,218
Pretty impressive, huh?

26
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,137
You didn't earn those badges.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,432
You got them just because Brock
and my sister felt sorry for you.

28
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,434
-I did too.
-Mm.

29
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,685
Chill out, guys.

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,480
Either way, Ash here has two badges
and six Pokémon.

31
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,650
He needs those six Pokémon
to compete in the Pokémon League.

32
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,444
[narrator] <i>That's right, Brock.</i>

33
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,615
<i>In the league, a trainer is allowed</i>
<i>to carry six Pokémon at a time.</i>

34
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,824
<i>What are their names again, Ash?</i>

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,825
Their names are...

36
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,785
-Pikachu.
-[Ash] Pikachu,

37
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,495
-[Ash] Pidgeotto.
-[squawks]

38
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,373
-[Ash] Butterfree. Bulbasaur.
-Bulbasaur.

39
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,000
-[Ash] Charmander.
-Char.

40
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,543
-[Ash] Squirtle.
-Squirtle. Squirtle.

41
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,421
And I caught them all fair and square.

42
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,050
[Misty] Caught them?
Ash, all your Pokémon followed you.

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,052
Well, heh, they're all mine,

44
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,387
and that's all that really counts
for a Pokémon trainer.

45
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,014
[chuckles]

46
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,932
This may come as a surprise to you,

47
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,436
but real Pokémon trainers
actually catch Pokémon on their own.

48
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,897
[sighs] You never give me a break.

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,775
That's because you keep bragging
about those two badges.

50
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:34,696
It's really not unusual for most trainers
to capture 20 or 30 Pokémon.

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,698
You're lucky
your Pokémon follow you around.

52
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,658
[all chirping]

53
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,369
And don't forget, Ash,
you had our help too.

[all chirping]

55
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,789
Yeah, don't forget about that, Ash.

56
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,749
[all chirping]

57
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,502
You're always putting me down.

58
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,504
But I'll show you.

59
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,381
I'm going to prove to you
that I can do it.

60
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,216
I'm going to be a Pokémon master.

61
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,928
Stand back and watch me work.

63
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,902
Whoa!

64
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,196
[narrator] <i>Ash finds his way</i>
<i>out of the woods,</i>

65
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>and discovers a beautiful beach</i>
<i>and a sparkling blue ocean.</i>

66
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>But he seems disappointed.</i>

67
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:28,792
[sighs] I don't want to watch the sunset.
I want more Pokémon. Huh?

68
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,880
Hey, wait. Stay here.
Don't go. Come back.

69
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,007
It's a Pokémon.

70
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,720
[Pokédex]
<i>Krabby. Lives near the shore.</i>

71
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,723
<i>Its average height is about 16 inches.</i>

72
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,308
A Pokémon's a Pokémon, I guess.

73
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,436
But this Krabby sure is shrimpy.

74
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,063
[hisses]

75
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,733
Uh, I didn't mean to insult you, Krabby.

76
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,151
You're a cute little--

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,318
[Ash shrieks]

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,615
Aah!

79
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,002
Showdown time.

80
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,795
Tiny or not, you are a Pokémon,

81
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,465
and I'll show Misty and Brock
that I can catch you.

82
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,351
Poké Ball, go!

83
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,565

[chuckles]

85
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,996
Now, I really caught one.

86
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,165
Good try, Krabby, but not good enough.

87
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,666
-[whirring]
-Huh?

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,713
[crackling]

89
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,343
What happened?
Where'd my new Krabby go? Aah!

90
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,055
I don't see it anywhere. Where'd it go?

91
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,308
[Misty] Didn't you know that a trainer
can only keep six Pokémon?

92
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,267
Huh?

93
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,312
Trainers can only have six Pokémon,
and the rest are transported.

94
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,689
Yeah, but you can switch one Pokémon
for another

95
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,193
by pressing the white button
inside your Pokédex.

96
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,404
-Uh... you mean this button?
-[Brock] Right.

97
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,783
It sends a signal to activate the system
that makes the exchange.

98
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,244
But I don't want to exchange my Pokémon.

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,663
Then shut your Pokédex and quit whining.

100
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,749
I wasn't whining. I just wanted to know
where my Krabby went.

101
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,085
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

102
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,129
Your Krabby got transported
to a place for safekeeping.

103
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,090
Where does it get transported to?

104
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,052
Your Pokémon gets transported
to wherever you got your Pokédex from.

105
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,304
Then that means Krabby must be with...

106
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,475
Here's your Pikachu!

107
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,102
It's with Professor Oak.

108
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,105
That's right.
Krabby just got transported automatically

109
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,441
to Professor Oak's Pokémon laboratory,
so don't worry about it.

110
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,403
So, Krabby's with Professor Oak, huh?

111
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,074
Oh, now, I'm doubly worried.

112
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,743
Isn't there any way
I can make sure it's okay?

113
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,454
We could call Professor Oak
to check on it.

114
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,456
But we haven't passed a phone all day,

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,667
and this beach
is pretty far out of the way.

116
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,378
There's got to be a phone
around here someplace.

117
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,130
I've got to check on Krabby.

118
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm more worried
about having to camp out again tonight.

119
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,176
I'm sick of sleeping in sleeping bags.

120
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,139
I'm just worried about finding a way
to find out if poor little Krabby's okay.

121
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,182
Pika! Pika!

122
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,809
-Pika?
-Pika?

123
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,020
[Ash] What's that?

124
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,479
[Misty] It's a lighthouse.

125
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,772
[Ash] A lighthouse!

126
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,985
Every lighthouse has to have a keeper,
and he'll have a phone.

127
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,237
And I'm going to use it
to call Professor Oak.

128
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,823
And there'll probably be some extra beds.

129
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,200
A sleeping bag is no way for me
to get my beauty sleep.

130
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,329
Yeah, and there'll be somebody there
to tell us where we are.

131
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,830
Let's go!

132
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,457
-All right.
-Yeah!

133
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,468
[Ash]
Whew. That was farther than it looked.

134
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,927
[Brock]
This lighthouse looks weird.

135
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,354
-Guess we better ring the bell.
-I got it.

136
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
[bell tolling]

137
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,524
[all whimpering]

138
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,324
[man] <i>Who's there?</i>

139
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,453
Uh, excuse us, sir,
but we're travelers, and we're lost.

140
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,205
We've got a small emergency here,

141
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,624
and we need to use your telephone,
please, sir.

142
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:42,921
We've been camping out for quite a while,
and I'd sure appreciate a nice, comfy bed.

143
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,465
And I wonder if I could use your kitchen

144
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,301
to make some bacon double cheeseburgers
for our group.

145
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,887
And I'd be more than happy
to make something for you.

146
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,848
<i>That's great.</i>
<i>Can you cook without using tofu?</i>

147
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,185
Oh, sure, I can cook lots of things
without using any tofu.

148
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,228
<i>That's good.</i>

149
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,523
<i>I've been eating nothing but tofu</i>
<i>since my cook went on vacation.</i>

150
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,983
<i>Come on in.</i>

151
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,791
[Ash] Would you mind
if I borrow your phone?

152
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,751
[man]<i> There's a phone right near you.</i>

153
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,211
-Huh?
-Huh?

154
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,966
Hey, it's a videophone. Oh, that's cool.

155
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,177
I'll call Professor Oak now,
and see if he has my Pokémon.

156
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
I'm sure Krabby's in great shape.

157
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,224
The professor won't mind
if I call him collect.

158
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,394
Uh...

159
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,313
<i>Well, hi, Ash.</i>
<i>You caught me cooking dinner.</i>

160
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,898
<i>My cook is on vacation,</i>

161
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>and I've got to fend for myself</i>
<i>till she returns.</i>

162
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,070
Wait a minute, professor.
You're not eating my Krabby, are you?

163
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,907
<i>Don't worry. I'm taking good care</i>
<i>of your Krabby. It's right here.</i>

164
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>Anyway, that Krabby of yours is too small</i>
<i>to make a very hearty meal.</i>

165
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,709
<i>On the other hand, the Krabby that Gary</i>
<i>caught would make an excellent dinner.</i>

166
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,586
<i>Much better than tofu.</i>

167
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,464
What? You mean Gary caught a Krabby too?

168
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,508
<i>Yes, it's quite a catch.</i>

169
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,427
<i>Take a look for yourself.</i>

170
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,388
[chittering]

171
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,432
-[Ash groans]
-Awesome.

172
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,145
<i>I want you to know that my grandson Gary</i>
<i>has already caught 45 Pokémon.</i>

173
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,440
Forty-five Pokémon? [whimpers]

174
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,108
Pikachu?

175
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,570
<i>By the way, Ash,</i>
<i>just where are you calling me from anyway?</i>

176
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,907
We're at an old lighthouse
way up on top of a cliff.

177
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>Oh, that must be Bill's lighthouse.</i>

178
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>He's a young Pokémon researcher</i>
<i>who knows even more than me.</i>

179
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,955
<i>See what you can learn from him.</i>

180
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,210
<i>He could teach you just about everything</i>
<i>about Pokémon, and then some.</i>

181
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,421
[Bill]<i> This is Bill, Professor Oak.</i>
<i>Good to hear from you.</i>

182
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,634
<i>Hello, Bill. Please give my friends</i>
<i>a crash course in Pokémon.</i>

183
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>Uh-oh. Tofu's done.</i>

184
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>Well, there's no way I can ignore</i>
<i>a request from the great Professor Oak.</i>

185
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,728
[Ash gasps]

186
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,190
<i>I am Bill of the lighthouse.</i>

187
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,402
[pincers clashing]

188
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,571
[all gasping]

189
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,201
According to the phone book,

190
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,955
that lighthouse belongs to Bill,
the famous Pokémon researcher.

191
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,457
Then I guess we've come
to the right place, huh?

192
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,711
There must be zillions of rare Pokémon
stored inside that lighthouse.

193
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,548
Then there's only one thing for us to do.

194
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,135
Right. Sneak in
and take everything we can grab.

195
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,761
How shall we sneak in?

196
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,558
We could take the road, or risk our lives
by climbing up the cliffs.

197
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,770
-Well, we certainly can't take the road.
-We have to climb up those cliffs.

198
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,522
'Cause we're the bad guys

199
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,151
and the bad guys always got to sneak in.
[chuckles]

200
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,904
It's time for us to rain
on someone's parade again. James!

201
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,864
Jessie.

202
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,658
[both] We're back-to-back,
so prepare for trouble.

203
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,451
Watch your step or we'll make it double.

204
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,912
To protect the world from devastation...

205
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,373
To unite all peoples within our nation...

206
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,876
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

207
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,336
To extend our reach to the stars above...

208
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,258
-Jessie! Ha!
-James!

209
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,511
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

210
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,264
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

211
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,724
Meowth! That's right.

212
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,644
To be truly great criminals,
we have to do things the hard way.

213
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,355
And then we'll become hardened criminals.

214
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,191
[Jessie]
But it will be tough to reach the top.

215
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,653
[both]
Because we're afraid of heights!

216
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,704
It can't be.
That's a Kabuto, an extinct Pokémon.

217
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,331
I wonder what it's doing here.

218
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,499
No, I'm not a Kabuto.

219
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,793
I'm Bill, the Pokémon researcher.

220
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,504
Wait, are you a human being or a Pokémon?

221
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,966
[man] This is a costume.
I'm stuck inside it.

222
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,927
Do you need help getting out?

223
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,846
-Yes, step up here.
-Tell me what to do.

224
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,473
Push that button.

225
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,852
-This one here?
-[man] Yes. These arms are too short.

226
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,439
[man] I tried to get out,
but I couldn't reach the button.

227
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,326
Thanks for helping me get out.

228
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,745
I've been stuck in that costume for hours.

229
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,122
Did you come from a costume party?

230
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,832
No, it's not for a party.

231
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,710
This is a special costume
that I use in my research.

232
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:37,048
Getting inside its skin
helps me get inside its head.

233
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,675
What do you mean?

234
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,302
[man] There are many kinds
of extinct Pokémon,

235
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,471
and I want to understand
how they lived.

236
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,517
Putting on a costume is one way of trying
to figure out what they were like.

237
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,479
You can understand what a Pokémon was like
from wearing a costume?

238
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,440
Yes, indeed. Or I'm beginning to.

239
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,444
This planet was created
4.6 billion years ago.

240
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,447
During that time,
all kinds of Pokémon existed.

241
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,533
They had many ways of living.

242
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,496
[Ash]
All kinds of Pokémon? How many?

243
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,750
[man] On this planet, there are more than
150 known species of Pokémon.

244
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,461
[Ash] Over 150?

245
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,548
You're lucky to be Pokémon trainers.

246
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,634
Your goal is to catch
all of these different kinds of Pokémon.

247
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,428
That's a great task.

248
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,889
Yeah, but so far I've only gotten seven.

249
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,188
There sure are a lot of--

250
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,275
Of course, these are just the Pokémon
we know about.

251
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,902
There are still many Pokémon
that have never been discovered,

252
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,030
so we need to keep searching.

253
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,490
How many could there be?

254
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,702
No one knows exactly.
The search goes on.

255
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,457
There's always something new to look for
in our lives and in ourselves.

256
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,417
Something to look for?

257
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,463
Yes, there's a lot for us to look for,
inside and outside ourselves.

258
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,381
There's meaning for every creature,

259
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,343
a meaning for all the Pokémon,
and a meaning for all us humans too.

260
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,804
A meaning for all.

261
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,192
Sometimes, I wonder
what the meaning of it all is.

262
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,694
Why do I go to all this trouble
just to be bad?

263
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,155
It's so we can get other people's Pokémon.

264
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:28,117
I'm all for it, just as long
as there's something in it for Meowth.

265
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,703
Keep looking for new Pokémon to catch.

266
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,706
It's something that's very important
for Pokémon research.

267
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,333
It's as vital to me as it is to you.

268
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:39,796
Right now, though, there's only one
Pokémon I'm searching for.

269
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,923
What kind of Pokémon?

270
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,513
It's probably the biggest Pokémon ever.

271
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,599
Bigger than all of the rest.
And no one has ever seen it.

272
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,646
[man] It's been wandering the world
for years and years,

273
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,564
looking for friends.

274
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,068
But doesn't that Pokémon have any friends
or family?

275
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,279
The Pokémon wanders because it's alone.

276
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,282
It's the only Pokémon of its species,
one of a kind.

277
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:13,204
One night, I heard this very strange sound
coming across the ocean.

278
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,708
[melodic wailing]

279
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:22,630
"I want... I want to meet you."
That's what it said to me.

280
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,673
Pika.

281
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,843
Some time ago, I recorded a similar sound,

282
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,095
and played it from the lighthouse
towards the ocean.

283
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,555
[melodic wailing]

284
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,100
"Let's be friends. I want to meet you."

285
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:42,108
One day, I heard the same voice
calling back to me from over the ocean.

286
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,527
[melodic wailing]

287
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,322
"I want to meet you too.
I want to be friends."

288
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,825
[man] It was answering me back.

289
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,870
Some foggy night,
that Pokémon might come here

290
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,956
to meet a friend it's been seeking
for a very long time.

291
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,792
I would be so happy to meet that Pokémon.

292
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,295
But will you try to capture the Pokémon?

293
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,464
Why do I need to capture it?

294
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,840
Meeting it would be enough for me.

295
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,260
Just a chance to study it
would make my long wait worthwhile.

296
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,387

-Hmm? Huh?

00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,129
It sounds like it's singing.

304
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,591
-Would you care to dance?
-Oh, thank you.

-What beautiful music.
-it's very haunting. Yet so sweet.

-That's a big Pokémon.
-So size does matter.

312
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,122
Something so rare and unusual.

313
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,084
You know what that means.
Let's grab it for ourselves.

314
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,128
Quite right. I'll attack it at once.

315
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,048
But it seems a shame to aim
at such a sweet creature.

316
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,218
Of course it's a shame.
We built our fame on shame.

317
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,804
Go on! Fire! It's all the shame to me.

Please don't go, Pokémon!
Please stay with us!

Do we always have to mess up
everyone's plans?

328
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,298
Even I think this is rotten.

329
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,594
Quit complaining.
We could score big with this Pokémon.

What kind of Pokémon was that anyway?

Who knows?

335
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:50,087
Pokémon live in more ways and places
than humans may ever learn.

What in the world was that?

337
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,012
One of the rarest Pokémon around.

338
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,681
It's exactly the type
we've been trying to capture.

339
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,226
We missed our chance,
but we can keep dreaming.

340
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,439
When our Pokémon dreams come true,
it's going to be somebody's nightmare.

341
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,650
After all, tomorrow is another day.

342
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,487
[Team Rocket laughing]

343
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,576
I think looking for and catching Pokémon
should help bring all of us together.

344
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,789
Learning to raise Pokémon is another way
of understanding how to live with them.

345
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,750
And Pokémon are always lots of fun
to play with.

346
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,170
Meanwhile, I'll stand watch
for the giant Pokémon

347
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,214
to appear at my lighthouse again.

348
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,468
[Ash] Bill, do you think we'll ever find
all the Pokémon there are?

349
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,681
No, Ash, there are probably as many
as we can imagine. Maybe many, many more.

350
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,768
Maybe there's no limit to the Pokémon
we can actually find on this planet.

351
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,896
Ash, you're a Pokémon trainer.

352
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,733
I'm a Pokémon researcher, seeking out
all kinds of life on this planet.

353
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,863
Even if our paths are different,
I think our goals are the same.

354
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,825
Mm-hmm.
