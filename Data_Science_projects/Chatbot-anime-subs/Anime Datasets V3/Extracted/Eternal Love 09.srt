<i>[Episode 9]</i>

3
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,745
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

4
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,567
You may all go.

5
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,086
- Yes.
- Yes.

6
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,447
What do you think of this place?

7
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,947
How does it compare to Qing Qiu?

8
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,567
It's so beautiful.

9
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,366
This is the Celestial Palace's lotus pond

10
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,698
as well as the most beautiful place
in Celestial Palace.

11
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:14,007
Sneaking you into the Celestial Palace
is not what I wished to do.

12
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:17,247
Give me some time.

13
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,326
I'll have you appear before all
in a dignified manner

14
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,344
and receive bows of salutations
from all the immortals.

15
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,247
Your Highness.

16
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,646
Third Brother.

17
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,926
Second Brother.

18
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,967
Is this person from Qing Qiu's Fox Den?

19
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:45,687
This is someone I just selected
to serve as my personal maid.

20
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,046
What is the matter, Third Brother?

21
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:52,007
Have you started to become
interested in my personal maids?

22
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:56,086
I'm asking if she is from
Qing Qiu's Fox Den.

23
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,326
Was it Ye Hua who told you?

24
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,567
It really is Bai Qian's maid?

25
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,606
That is correct.

26
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,287
Second Brother, there is no time to lose.

27
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,846
Quickly send this snake back to Qing Qiu
before Father returns.

28
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,206
No.

29
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,526
You must not go. I'll do it.

30
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:29,166
Since I have brought her here,
I won't be sending her back.

31
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,607
This must be handled with care.

32
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,567
You can like anybody but her.

33
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,487
I am the second son of the Heavenly Lord.

34
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:40,447
Can I not even decide on
my own concubines?

35
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,545
Ever since the war 70,000 years ago
when Mo Yuan's soul was scattered

36
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:47,459
the clan leaders of the Celestial Tribe

37
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,377
have held increasingly
less regard for Father.

38
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:53,206
Father only arranged a marriage alliance
to stabilize his position.

39
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,166
- Second Brother, you must not--
- That's enough.

40
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,406
I understand.

41
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,487
We must not displease Qing Qiu.

42
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,086
It's good you understand.

43
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:05,007
If I am to be forced to marry Bai Qian

44
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:08,646
then this maid of hers that I like
must also be accepted into the palace.

45
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,406
You absolutely must not!

46
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:13,247
You have not married Bai Qian yet

47
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,966
but you take her maid here first

48
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,708
and want to marry both mistress
and maid at the same time?

49
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,286
Aren't you showing the whole world
that Bai Qian is inferior to a snake?

50
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:26,326
Your Highness, you had best send me back.

51
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,326
Shao Xing, don't be afraid.

52
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,966
Third Brother, you are right.

53
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,526
Consider the greater good,
Second Brother.

54
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,047
When Father returns

55
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:47,846
I will make a request to
cancel the marriage

56
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,726
and then rightfully take a consort.

57
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,487
You want to cancel the marriage?

58
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:59,646
What did you say?
You want to cancel the marriage?

59
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:16,766
Father, I had thought that
as a prince of the Celestial Tribe

60
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,314
my marriage would only be
for appearance's sake

61
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,047
and for the Celestial Tribe's
greater good.

62
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,550
Is it not?

63
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:27,206
That is indeed what I thought
before I went to Qing Qiu.

64
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:31,567
However, after I arrived at Qing Qiu,
I did not see my fiancee, Bai Qian.

65
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,487
She only left a message

66
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:36,166
saying she was going into seclusion
for self-cultivation.

67
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,047
She left me at Qing Qiu's Fox Den.

68
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:46,646
Although I was furious,
I carefully complied with your orders.

69
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,326
I continued to stay there
to await her return.

70
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,927
However, the wait stretched out
to a whole month.

71
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:59,007
I believe Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
is proud and arrogant.

72
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,646
She looks down upon the Celestial Tribe.

73
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,447
So what of one month?

74
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:05,807
Even if it is 30,000 years,
you must still wait!

75
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:11,367
Moreover, she has succeeded
the throne as queen of Qing Qiu.

76
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:15,047
A queen marrying a prince!
What more could you be discontent about?

77
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,206
But, Father, I...

78
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,807
Sang Ji.

79
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,807
Do you have something to say?

80
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:25,726
I...

81
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,607
I...

82
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,326
Let me guess what you want to say.

83
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,726
Did you fall in love with
another woman while at Qing Qiu

84
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,466
and allowed your feelings to grow deep?

85
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,687
How would I dare do something
that would defy your orders?

86
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,526
Very well.

87
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,206
Guards.

88
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,726
Bring in the snake that trespassed
into the Celestial Palace.

89
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:08,887
How did you meet him in Qing Qiu?

90
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:13,206
Heavenly Lord, I do not know him.

91
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:15,367
You've forgotten?

92
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,086
You do not need to look at him.

93
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,607
In the Celestial Palace

94
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:25,247
all princes must abstain from
emotions or carnal pleasures.

95
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:29,646
Marriage and procreation is
for the sake of the Celestial Tribe

96
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:31,487
and for the world.

97
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,447
It is not for love.

98
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,927
He cannot save you.

99
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:39,647
Nor would he dare to.

100
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:45,126
Heavenly Lord, I really do not know him.

101
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,366
Take this snake who trespassed
into Celestial Palace

102
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,726
and throw her off Zhuxian Terrace.

103
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:52,726
- Yes.
- Please spare my life, Heavenly Lord!

104
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,807
- Heavenly Lord!
- Stop right there!

105
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,366
I'm the one who wants to
cancel the marriage.

106
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,767
- It has nothing to do with Shao Xing.
- What did you say?

107
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:05,326
Shao Xing may be Bai Qian's maid,
but she is also my beloved.

108
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:09,966
I implore you to allow me to
cancel the marriage with Bai Qian

109
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,326
and marry Shao Xing!

110
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:15,726
As matters stand now,
you still want to marry her?

111
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:18,126
That is correct.

112
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:23,927
I am determined to marry Shao Xing
in this lifetime.

113
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,726
Absolutely disgraceful.

114
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,966
Take this snake and throw her
into Evil Sealing Pagoda.

115
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:39,246
Nobody is to come near
without my orders.

116
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,886
- Yes.
- Spare my life, Heavenly Lord!

117
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:42,047
- Heavenly Lord!
- Father!

118
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,527
She cannot survive
in Evil Sealing Pagoda!

119
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:45,767
Father!

120
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:49,687
I am going to see how long
she can last in there.

121
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,687
How dare she seduce my son?

122
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:56,047
She didn't seduce me.
I truly do love her.

123
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,407
Sang Ji.

124
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:03,246
Do you want your nephew
to see you in such a disappointing state?

125
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,527
Keep on kneeling.

126
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,447
- Ye Hua.
- I am here.

127
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,086
You are not like your Second Uncle.

128
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:34,366
I have very high hopes for you.

129
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,246
You are the future Heavenly Lord.

130
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:42,366
In the Celestial Palace,
you can have many consorts

131
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,246
but you cannot have a woman
who will make you lose your principles.

132
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:52,006
You were born for the world,
not for a woman.

133
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,486
I understand.

134
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,527
Greetings, Your Majesty.

135
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,326
Your Highness.

136
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,246
What do you have to report?

137
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,287
Report, Heavenly Lord.

138
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,206
It is still the matter concerning
Zhong Rong State in the mortal realm.

139
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,567
I have already handed the matter
over to the Crown Prince.

140
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:13,807
The Scarlet Flame Golden Lion
is Qing Cang's mount.

141
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,365
Go subdue him yourself

142
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,567
to promote your prestige
throughout the four seas

143
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,366
in preparation for receiving
the Crown Prince's seal in the future.

144
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:22,606
Yes.

145
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:34,287
Your Highness, there is one thing
you must bear in mind.

146
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,287
What is it?

147
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,326
When you go to vanquish the Golden Lion

148
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:40,427
be sure not to interfere with
the fates of mortals.

149
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,447
When immortals become
involved with mortals

150
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,927
destiny will be thrown into disorder.

151
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,126
It could be detrimental to you.

152
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,366
The mortal realm has usually been
under your control.

153
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,126
I will not meddle.

154
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,966
I understand.

155
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,287
<i>Heavenly Lord, I have
finished my studies.</i>

156
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:27,206
Back in the day, Sang Ji also had
very high comprehension

157
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,246
but he did not perform as well you have.

158
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,767
I must reward you generously.

159
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,206
What would you like?

160
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,647
I want to see my mother.

161
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,246
A doting mother fails to raise
a child properly.

162
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,326
You will be inheriting
my legacy one day.

163
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:44,167
Your mother was destined to be unable
to raise you to be worthy enough.

164
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,126
She would only raise you
to be irresolute.

165
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:51,047
Not allowing you to see her
is for your own good.

166
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:54,366
I only wish to see Mother.

167
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,167
If you want me to permit you to see her

168
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,807
then ascend to high immortal
before you are 20,000 years old.

169
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,886
Heavenly Lord, these lightning bolts
are not ordinary lightning bolts.

170
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:39,726
They are lightning bolts experienced by
immortals facing ascension.

171
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,886
If he cannot endure them,
he will lose his life.

172
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,647
His Highness is merely 20,000 years old.

173
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,687
Stop talking.

174
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,567
Your Majesty promised me

175
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:11,767
if I could ascend to high immortal
before I am 20,000 years old

176
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,287
you would allow me to see Mother.

177
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,966
Today, I have passed the trial
and ascended.

178
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:20,366
When may I see Mother?

179
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:26,126
Take Ye Hua to see his mother.

180
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,006
Thank you, Father.

181
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:02,886
Ye Hua.

182
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,807
I only have this one son.

183
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,886
From the moment he was born,
he was given the status of Crown Prince.

184
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:27,606
He was taken from me for 20,000 years.

185
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:30,086
I have never seen him once.

186
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:36,527
Why is he covered with injuries
when I finally see him?

187
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:44,246
Was being born into the Celestial Palace
not his good fortune

188
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,647
but a calamity?

189
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:51,767
Ye Hua is the future Heavenly Lord.

190
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,846
It is only natural that
he is held in high regard.

191
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:57,486
So what if he is to be Heavenly Lord?

192
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,567
If he lives an unhappy life

193
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:04,206
he would be better off being
a lowly water king of some random land.

194
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,375
It would still be better
than this Celestial Palace.

195
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:14,567
Mother, do not blame Father.
It was my fault.

196
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:19,326
I knew I had to face the heavenly trial,
yet I still wore such light clothing.

197
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:22,726
From now on, I will
only wear black clothing

198
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,167
so that bloodstains
will no longer be visible

199
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,966
so as to avoid causing you distress.

200
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:35,326
Look at what your father and
Heavenly Lord turned you into.

201
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:40,287
Do you think you won't bleed
if you change your choice of clothing?

202
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:46,886
It will only be covered
and hidden from sight.

203
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:51,966
Your inclination to suffer in silence

204
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:54,966
will only bring yourself anguish.

205
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:51,287
You're awake?

206
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,126
What are you here for?

207
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,326
I brought you some food.

208
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,366
Here.

209
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,686
<i>Who does that figure belong to?</i>

210
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,846
<i>Why has it been
constantly appearing lately?</i>

211
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,926
<i>Could it be an ominous foreshadowing?</i>

212
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,366
Ye Hua.

213
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,606
I've made you many clothes.

214
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:32,047
Why have I only seen you wear
this black outfit?

215
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:35,646
It is so dismal and gloomy.
You do not look youthful at all.

216
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:41,846
I heard the palace maids talking today.

217
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:45,007
They said Second Prince went to
Qing Qiu specifically to propose marriage

218
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,926
yet he took a liking to
Bai Qian's maid instead.

219
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:52,007
I think it would be quite nice for
His Highness to marry a snake.

220
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:57,007
I heard Bai Qian of Qing Qiu has
already taken the throne as queen.

221
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,646
Her rank is extremely high.

222
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:00,926
You and I are both younger than her.

223
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,686
If she really does enter
the Celestial Palace one day

224
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,567
I'm afraid you and I
won't have an easy time.

225
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:10,767
Ye Hua!

226
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,366
Ye Hua!

227
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:29,007
Heavenly Lord's orders are that nobody
is to come near Evil Sealing Pagoda.

228
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,086
Impudence.

229
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,686
Do you dare block my way?

230
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,727
Step aside.

231
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,527
Step aside!

232
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,967
Your Highness, please control yourself.

233
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,007
You...

234
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,287
Second Brother.

235
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,247
Second Brother!

236
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,047
Those are Father's orders.
Do not make their jobs difficult.

237
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,967
I don't even know if
Shao Xing is still alive inside.

238
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,846
How can I be at ease?

239
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,846
Let me try.

240
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,487
Heavenly Lord's orders are to
not allow anyone to come near

241
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,727
for fear someone will
take the snake away.

242
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:09,166
However, he did not say
nobody is to speak with her.

243
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,406
Is that correct?

244
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:22,007
Second Brother, go talk to Miss Shao Xing
and see how she is doing first.

245
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,646
Then plan accordingly.

246
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,166
Do not behave recklessly.

247
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,567
Shao Xing, can you hear me?

248
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:39,567
<i>Shao Xing!</i>

249
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:41,967
<i>Shao Xing!</i>

250
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,886
Your Highness!

251
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,926
Shao Xing, have the
evil creatures inside injured you?

252
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,247
Your Highness!

253
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:58,366
Aside from Aunt,
only you have been good to me.

254
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,727
<i>I have lived for over 70,000 years.</i>

255
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,567
It is my good fortune to have met you.

256
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:07,886
Your Highness!

257
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,606
Shao Xing!

258
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:11,606
Shao Xing!

259
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,926
Your Highness!

260
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,287
<i>Your Highness!</i>

261
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,606
Second Brother. Second Brother!

262
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,446
Ye Hua.

263
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,886
It is time for you take a consort or two.

264
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,086
Are there any women you like?

265
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:06,606
No.

266
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:13,727
You...

267
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:16,166
just don't have any interest in women.

268
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,807
Yet, your second uncle...

269
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,287
It is clearly such a fine
marriage arrangement.

270
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:23,807
Others could only hope to have it.

271
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,807
Yet, he even wants to
cancel the arrangement.

272
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,967
Your Majesty, Second Prince
seeks an audience.

273
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,686
Seeks an audience?

274
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:36,287
Isn't he supposed to
reflect on his mistakes in quiet?

275
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,086
Send him away.

276
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:42,326
Your Majesty, His Highness is
kneeling outside Zichen Hall.

277
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,487
I dare not urge him to leave.

278
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,326
- Let him in.
- Yes.

279
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,007
You may go.

280
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,646
You need not step outside.

281
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,727
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:17,527
Second Uncle.

283
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,487
Father.

284
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,727
Are you afraid of embarrassment?

285
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,767
Do not be afraid.

286
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,926
Since you have
taken a liking to that snake

287
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:45,207
you are bound to be
the world's object of ridicule someday.

288
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,287
What do you have to be afraid of
in front of your nephew today?

289
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:49,446
Speak.

290
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:56,686
I came today to ask you to
set Shao Xing free.

291
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,606
You need not speak further
about this matter.

292
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,527
I will not change my mind.

293
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:11,727
Please do not pressure me anymore.

294
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,567
If you continue to insist

295
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,606
then I will have to
accompany her to death.

296
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:25,727
You want to die for her?

297
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:28,926
I am a prince of the Celestial Tribe.

298
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,567
Yet, I cannot even protect my woman.

299
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,007
Would death not be a better choice?

300
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,086
Very well.

301
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,807
Very well.

302
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,686
This is my son.

303
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:48,406
Sang Ji, listen well.

304
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,606
If you wish to die, I cannot stop you.

305
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,727
However, the life of that snake

306
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,886
is still in my hands.

307
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,767
Go ahead and destroy your spirit.

308
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,567
After you die...

309
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:06,686
I will have my ways
to torment that snake.

310
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:09,967
Why must you make
Shao Xing's life difficult, Father?

311
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,366
I merely want to take a consort.

312
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,287
Why can I not?

313
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,606
If you want to take a consort,
I would not stop you.

314
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,567
Yet, you go so far as to
defy me for a woman

315
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,567
and would even die for her!

316
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,166
As a prince of the Celestial Tribe

317
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,366
you can share your love
among all your women

318
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:35,326
but you absolutely must not

319
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:38,727
forget your priorities
because of a woman.

320
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:45,326
I am not purposely
making her life difficult.

321
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,207
You are the one who has implicated her.

322
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:52,007
Leave now.

323
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:17,727
This Second Prince really has
no sense of propriety.

324
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,126
In just a few days

325
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:22,911
news of the canceled marriage
has spread throughout the world.

326
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:26,606
Canceling the marriage is one thing.

327
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:30,606
But to use a maid
to humiliate my daughter?

328
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:32,446
That is too outrageous.

329
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:35,007
It is absolutely intolerable.

330
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:37,446
Indeed.

331
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,287
Intolerable.

332
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:42,886
Come now. Let's go to
the Celestial Palace.

333
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:49,207
They do not come and
we even have to go ourselves?

334
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,487
Do you not know?

335
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:53,926
Your daughter that is being
mocked by the entire world

336
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,166
has been staying at
my woods for five days now.

337
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,886
She does not want to marry either.

338
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:04,247
Why don't we take this chance
and have Qing Qiu cancel the marriage?

339
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:08,567
We be the ones to call off the marriage?

340
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,926
Yes, not only will we cancel the marriage

341
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:13,527
but we'll make Heavenly Lord
compensate us.

342
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:43,126
You have been sleeping ignorantly
for five days now.

343
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,567
Have I been sleeping for five days?

344
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:54,527
<i>The day after tomorrow will be
the day Qing Cang breaks out of the Bell.</i>

345
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,487
<i>I don't know if I'll be able to return.</i>

346
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:59,864
<i>Let me take a longer look at
the Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.</i>

347
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,527
Something seems amiss about you.

348
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:06,646
Don't tell me you're bothered about
Sang Ji canceling the marriage.

349
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,406
Because of Sang Ji?

350
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:17,727
I met him once when I was Si Yin.

351
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:20,086
I thought absolutely nothing of him.

352
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:24,567
So why would I care if he cancels
the marriage? Why would I be hurt?

353
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,926
That's good. Come.

354
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,846
Fourth Brother, let me
ask you a question.

355
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:34,126
If Qing Cang was not sealed away
70,000 years ago

356
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,767
what do you think
the world would be like now?

357
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:40,727
If Qing Cang was not sealed away,
then Mo Yuan would still be alive.

358
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:42,166
As long as Mo Yuan is alive

359
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,967
then the world would definitely
be at peace.

360
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:49,606
Yes, as long Master is alive,
the four seas would surely be at peace.

361
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,886
By the way, Fourth Brother,
where is Xiao Jiu?

362
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,406
Didn't you say she would be
here in the peach tree woods?

363
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,007
Xiao Jiu?

364
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:00,166
She hasn't been back in many days.

365
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,406
But, she will definitely return today.

366
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,567
Why today?

367
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:07,807
Have you forgotten?
It is your birthday today.

368
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,086
You have already lived
for hundreds of millenia

369
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:12,926
so there's nothing special
about a birthday.

370
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:15,287
But, Xiao Jiu has followed you
since she was young

371
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,047
and is more respectful to you
than to her own parents.

372
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,926
It is your birthday today.
She'll surely be back.

373
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,287
<i>I'm too slow.</i>

374
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,907
<i>I just need to pass through these woods
and I'll be at Qing Qiu.</i>

375
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,113
<i>Go!</i>

376
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:38,446
I... I didn't mean to trespass
into these woods.

377
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,366
I was just passing through.

378
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,366
I am Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu!
Don't be so rude!

379
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,126
Dong Hua Dijun?

380
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,967
Who are you?

381
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,527
Dong Hua Dijun.

382
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:47,287
How much longer do you intend on
hugging me like this?

383
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,527
Are you really Dong Hua Dijun?

384
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:57,926
Do I not look like him?

385
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,247
You don't.

386
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:03,207
I've seen a portrait of you before
in Zhe Yan's collection of books.

387
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:06,287
You really do not look like him.

388
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,007
Zhe Yan?

389
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:11,166
Yes, Zhe Yan, high god of
Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods.

390
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,247
Who are you to him?

391
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:15,807
I am the daughter of
Qing Qiu's Lord of the North

392
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:18,126
nine-tailed fox descendant,
Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.

393
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:23,767
Greetings to Dong Hua Dijun.

394
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,527
So it is the Bai family.

395
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,727
A member of the Bai family
would be afraid of a Golden Lion?

396
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,807
Have you not ascended
to high immortal yet?

397
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:34,767
Not yet.

398
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:47,487
Since you have saved my life,
I must repay your kindness.

399
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,926
That's not necessary.

400
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,487
What should I do?

401
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:53,926
My aunt often told me that there exists
a cycle of causality in this world.

402
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:57,446
A cause will have an effect,
and a debt must be repaid.

403
00:32:57,446 --> 00:33:00,926
Your aunt?
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

404
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:03,527
Do you know my aunt?

405
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,807
We had the chance to meet a few times.

406
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:09,606
Your aunt and the Celestial Tribe
have a much deeper relationship.

407
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,326
Is that so? How come I have never
heard her mention it?

408
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,086
She doesn't seem very willing to
mention the Celestial Tribe.

409
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:18,606
Do you not know

410
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:21,727
Zhe Yan and the Fox King Bai Zhi
are currently at the Celestial Palace

411
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:24,207
to speak up for your aunt?

412
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:25,446
Is that so?

413
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:35,287
How much longer do you
intend on following me?

414
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,967
I... just want to repay your kindness.

415
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:21,286
Dijun, I have been standing guard here
for nearly 70,000 years.

416
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:23,869
The Bell of the East Emperor
has never had any unusual activity.

417
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,007
I have observed the stars
in the past few days.

418
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:28,567
Qing Cang seems to
have made some movement.

419
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,047
How is that possible?

420
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:33,927
Hasn't Qing Cang been sealed away by
God Mo Yuan dozens of millenia ago?

421
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:41,726
If it really is as Dijun says,
I'm afraid I--

422
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:43,487
I know you cannot handle Qing Cang.

423
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,007
Keep an eye on the Bell at all times.

424
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,806
If there is any unusual activity
in the next ten days

425
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:52,206
shake this bell and
I will come immediately.

426
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,126
I shall do you as you bid.

427
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,887
Remember.

428
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,887
If there is any activity at all

429
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:04,407
you must use your powers
to ring this bell.

430
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:05,927
Yes.

431
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,527
Seeing as you are a princess of Qing Qiu

432
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:18,847
I will not dwell on
what happened before.

433
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:22,726
However, if you continue to follow me,
do not blame me for being rude.

434
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,487
- That is...
- Report, Princess.

435
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,086
That is Dong Hua Dijiun.

436
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:39,487
When I went to the Celestial Palace
with Ghost Lord 20,000 years ago

437
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,766
I had the fortune to catch
a glimpse of him.

438
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,246
Dijun has a very high standing
in the Celestial Palace.

439
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:46,927
Even the Heavenly Lord
shows him respect.

440
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,407
Why would he be here?

441
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,327
I... would have no way of knowing.

442
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,527
Let's not worry about them.

443
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,327
Father.

444
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,606
Ever since the day of the war

445
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,686
Li Yuan's whereabouts have been unknown.

446
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:24,126
Li Jing...

447
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:28,047
He is no longer who he once was.

448
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:33,487
He still bears a grudge for
what you had done to his mother.

449
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,367
It has been 70,000 years.

450
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,726
He still refuses to come see you.

451
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,487
Father.

452
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,726
Please bless me with the fortune
to find Li Yuan soon.

453
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,126
Have you followed me
all the way here

454
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,327
because you have something to say?

455
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,487
Do I?

456
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:06,887
Have we already walked all the way here?

457
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:09,646
If you have something to say,
please go ahead.

458
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,447
Ye Hua.

459
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:15,286
Ever since you became an immortal

460
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:19,126
you have accomplished
numerous unparalleled contributions.

461
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:21,887
You are also the current Crown Prince,
the future Heavenly Lord.

462
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:27,327
However, in my eyes,
you are still not perfect yet.

463
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,967
How am I not perfect?

464
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:38,047
Standing here now

465
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:41,447
a single glance is enough for one
to know the waxing and waning of a moon.

466
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,806
But to be perfect

467
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:46,047
one must experience
the taste of affection

468
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,606
to know the waxing and waning of life.

469
00:38:49,686 --> 00:38:51,527
You still lack affection.

470
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:53,847
Affection?

471
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:57,887
Look at you, as if
everything is beneath you.

472
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,726
Let me ask you this.

473
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:04,606
What do you think of
your second uncle's actions today?

474
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,166
It was a trap of his own making.

475
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:11,766
Then if you were to marry
a woman you had never met

476
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,847
someone whose temperament you don't know

477
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:15,567
would you be willing?

478
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,766
Let me make an analogy at random.

479
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:20,806
If you were to marry Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

480
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:22,086
what would you think?

481
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:25,606
Whether it is Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
or Qing Qian of Bai Qiu

482
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:27,246
there is no difference.

483
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:30,367
As long as Heavenly Lord bestows
the marriage, I will just marry her.

484
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,047
Is that the truth?

485
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:40,367
Are you trying to ascertain my opinion?

486
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:46,887
I am thinking of a way to
save your second uncle.

487
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,967
I think he has truly been carried away
by his emotions this time.

488
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:54,047
I'm afraid he will cause great trouble
because of that snake.

489
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:58,487
So you want me to
take Second Uncle's place

490
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:00,286
in marrying Qing Qiu's Bai Qian?

491
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:01,447
That is correct.

492
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:04,327
You are the Celestial Tribe's
heir apparent.

493
00:40:04,327 --> 00:40:07,606
Although you have yet to officially
receive the Crown Prince's seal

494
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,847
in the 20,000 years since you've become
involved in the governance of the tribe

495
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:15,126
the immortals of the world have
long since addressed you as Crown Prince.

496
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,847
Only you are able to settle this matter.

497
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:22,047
Only you can take the place of
your second uncle to appease Qing Qiu.

498
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:24,646
All right.

499
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:27,967
So quickly?

500
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,806
You better not be lying to me.

501
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:35,246
Bai Qian is 90,000 years older than you.

502
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:38,126
It is just one more person
sleeping on the bed next to me.

503
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,586
What is the difficulty in that?

504
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,686
Insightful.

505
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:48,166
You still are the astute one.

506
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:06,927
The marriage alliance between
Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu

507
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,206
was originally proposed
by you, Heavenly Lord.

508
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:11,766
Now that it has turned into
such an absurdity

509
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:15,567
what will the world think of
my daughter, Bai Qian?

510
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:18,086
Do you understand, Heavenly Lord?

511
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:20,927
Even aside from this matter

512
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:24,246
I feel ashamed
in front of you, Fox King.

513
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,527
This snake is truly hateful.

514
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,527
As Bai Qian's maid

515
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,086
she dared to seduce my son

516
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,726
and even tried to marry into
the Celestial Palace.

517
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,806
Even if you can tolerate it, I cannot.

518
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:41,447
In my opinion, Bai Qian did not
take the marriage very seriously either.

519
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:44,847
Why don't you cancel it? What do you say?

520
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:47,047
No.

521
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:49,367
This marriage must not be canceled.

522
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:05,126
