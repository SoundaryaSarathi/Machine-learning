1
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:06,311
I totally forgot
I’m supposed to cook dinner tonight!

2
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:15,318
Sorry about that!

3
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,507
Are you okay?

4
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,948
Ye… Yes!
Thank you very much!

5
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:43,254
You’re welcome.

6
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,757
I’ll see you again tomorrow.

7
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:53,660
Eh!

8
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:13,819
[Sakura and the Wonderful Teacher]

9
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,283
So she knows she’ll
see you again tomorrow…

10
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:21,826
Yeah.

11
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,319
What kinda person was she?

12
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,335
She was really pretty!

13
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,364
Hey!

14
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:34,874
Here!

15
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,004
Father made one for you.

16
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,441
Thanks.

17
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,859
He probably noticed it after all.

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,492
Since he was little,

19
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,268
he could see things
that other people couldn’t…

20
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:06,899
This jello is real good.

21
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,466
Leave some for me!

22
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,345
I’m late!

23
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,551
I overslept.

24
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,555
Today too.

25
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,879
G’morning, Sakura.

26
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,219
G’morning, Father.

27
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,623
You’re a little late. Hurry up and eat.

28
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:31,858
Bye. I’m leaving.

29
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,263
Take care yourself.

30
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,332
Thanks for the food! I’m leaving!

31
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,506
Take care!

32
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,937
There he is!

33
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:51,708
G’morning, Sakura.

34
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,450
Good morning!

35
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,688
You’ll fall
if you don’t watch where you’re going.

36
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,088
I’m fine!

37
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:58,646
Even when you said you’re fine,

38
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,720
you’d still fall into
a hole or something.

39
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,185
What did you say?!

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,934
G’morning!

41
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,070
You’re safe, Sakura.

42
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,369
The teacher’s not here yet.

43
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,074
Thank goodness.

44
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,611
You really just made it.

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,185
Eh!

46
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,687
I have an announcement
for everyone today.

47
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:36,189
Your math teacher, Miss Tsutsumi,
is taking a long vacation break.

48
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:39,892
So, from today on,

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,464
you’ll have a substitute math teacher.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,596
Miss Mizuki.

51
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,579
My name is Kaho Mizuki.
Nice to meet you.

52
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:01,816
The person from yesterday.

53
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,088
She is pretty, is she not?

54
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:06,749
Yes.

55
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,899
What about Miss Mizuki?

56
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,574
You couldn’t sense it?

57
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,513
Sense what?

58
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,674
Oh, Shao-Lang! There you are!

59
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:31,779
Mei Ling.

60
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,954
You promised me that you’ll
eat lunch with me, remember?

61
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,179
He… Hey, hold on a second.
We just started talking.

62
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,283
What did you just start talking about?

63
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,225
It is about Miss Mizuki.

64
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,895
What is this? You want to leave me out?

65
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,198
It’s not that I forgot about you!

66
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,861
Then what?

67
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,801
You really didn’t sense

68
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:53,734
the aura on that teacher?

69
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,196
Aura?

70
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,639
She has a good amount of power in her.
It’s better to be careful.

71
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:01,541
That’s going to be a problem.

72
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:03,583
Miss Mizuki!

73
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:08,247
She came right next to us,
and I didn’t notice her at all.

74
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,285
You’re Shao Lan Li, right?

75
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:15,423
I am your new math teacher.

76
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,588
You’ll be in trouble,

77
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,325
if you don’t study carefully.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,592
Isn’t that right, Tomoyo Daidouji?

79
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,592
And also, Mei Lin Li.

80
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,463
And, you’re Sakura Kinomoto.

81
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,903
Ye… Yes! Thank you for yesterday.

82
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,303
We meet again.

83
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,993
Miss Mizuki is so pretty.

84
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,317
She really is.

85
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,288
She’s nice and pretty.

86
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,030
I want to be like her too!

87
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,602
Then, maybe you should
buy a good-luck charm

88
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,564
from Tsukimine Shrine.

89
00:05:59,005 --> 00:05:59,972
Why?

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,006
People said those charms
would grant anything you wish for.

91
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:05,940
Especially on love relationships.

92
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:07,144
Love?!

93
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,042
Mei Ling?

94
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,352
The charms might be very accurate,

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,212
but since my relationship with
Shao Lan is in the best shape,

96
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,618
it doesn’t make any difference.

97
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,693
I didn’t know they sell love charms

98
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,262
in this shrine.

99
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,128
Naoko knows a lot about these things.

100
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,977
Love… Yukito…

101
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:40,136
Now, let’s go.

102
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:41,579
Okay.

103
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:46,950
Eh!

104
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,479
What is wrong?

105
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,084
Somehow, I had a strange feeling…

106
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,125
I did not feel anything…

107
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,198
Maybe I just imagined it.

108
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,994
The place that sells good-luck
charms is over there.

109
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,371
Hold on, Mei Ling.
This place…

110
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,841
In order to heal the wounds between us,

111
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,642
we must get these charms!

112
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:14,945
That’s not what I mean!

113
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,441
Eh!

114
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,011
Ki… Kinomoto! Um… m…
This is…

115
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:23,120
Li!

116
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:24,851
Did you feel something

117
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,249
when you entered the shrine?

118
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,260
You felt it too?

119
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,162
Huh? Felt what?

120
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:32,796
Eh!

121
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:33,795
What’s that?

122
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:56,546
What is this?!

123
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,187
This was the shrine just now.

124
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,317
Yes, it was no doubt.

125
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,261
Wh… Where’s the exit…

126
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,992
Hold on! Sense it yourself!

127
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:07,294
Yes.

128
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,238
I sense a Clow Card!

129
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,107
Then, this is the act
of a Clow Card too?

130
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,641
It’s most likely the card, Maze.

131
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,908
I see. That is why,
it turned into a maze.

132
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,249
Well, leave the rest to Shao Lan.

133
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,349
Now, let’s get
out of this maze quickly

134
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,387
and buy our charms.

135
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,649
It’s not as easily as you think.

136
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,752
This maze won’t disappear

137
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,087
until those who entered it find the exit.

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,760
It won’t disappear
until we find the exit?

139
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:10,861
Weird!

140
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:13,058
Weren’t we here just now?

141
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,266
Come to think of it, the view
didn’t change a bit since just now.

142
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,196
This is strange.

143
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,336
But we should eventually find the exit

144
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,801
if we walk with our hands on
the wall like this.

145
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,141
Li, you brought the compass,
right?

146
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:29,780
Yeah.

147
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,850
You can use it to find out directions,
right?

148
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,413
Oh no!

149
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,021
This compass is made only
to look for Clow Cards.

150
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,758
But if we cannot think of
a good way,

151
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,156
we would never be able
to get out of here.

152
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,429
I thought of one useful thing.

153
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,704
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

154
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,875
reveal thy true form before me.

155
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,648
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

156
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,414
Release!

157
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,529
Fly!

158
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,232
I’ll go look for an exit with this.

159
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,197
Hand it to you.

160
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:34,238
Yes.

161
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,080
Eh!

162
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,184
So there’s no way to search from above.

163
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,990
The Maze card is strict, don’t you think?

164
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,628
If we don’t something,
we won’t be able to buy the charms!

165
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,160
This pisses me off!

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,626
You can’t break it even if you do that.

167
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,266
But!

168
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,671
I get it! That’s right,
Mei Ling!

169
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,105
What!

170
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,666
If we aren’t able to look
for the exit from above…

171
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:15,681
Cut apart the object that
blocks our way! Sword!

172
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:26,957
Let’s try break it with this.

173
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,095
It worked!

174
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,134
It’s cut apart!

175
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:38,901
Eh!

176
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,138
So Sword doesn’t work either.

177
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,916
What’s going on?!

178
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,648
Mei Ling!

179
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:53,881
Sakura!

180
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,025
Tomoyo!

181
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,325
You okay?

182
00:11:58,598 --> 00:11:59,587
Shao Lan.

183
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,560
Tomoyo!

184
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,361
Sakura!

185
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,505
Wind Descend!

186
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,114
Are you okay?

187
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,249
I am fine. Thank you very much.

188
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:24,480
It’s strange.

189
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:37,300
It seems that it has become
more difficult to look for the exit.

190
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:38,762
Oh no.

191
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:41,503
Where’s Mei Ling?!

192
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:43,532
Shao Lan!

193
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,068
Mei Ling! Where are you?!

194
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,746
Here!

195
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,711
Over here!

196
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,315
Mei Ling!

197
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:53,712
Wait there, I’ll save you!

198
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,188
Wind Descend!

199
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,519
What happened?

200
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,058
The space’s twisted,
so the wind can’t get to her.

201
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,967
Shao Lan!

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,466
I said I’ll save you for sure,
so don’t move about.

203
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,267
But how?

204
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,768
It seems there’s no other way
than to walk there.

205
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,439
Yes… Is that right…? I see…

206
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:25,613
Said she left school at the usual time.

207
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:26,852
I’ll go look for her around here.

208
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,087
Father, why don’t you stay put,
since she might call.

209
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,222
Be careful!

210
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,344
Shao Lan, hurry!

211
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,510
Just a bit more!

212
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:05,990
If we go in here, we would
not be able to see Mei Ling.

213
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:07,591
Turn back?

214
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,758
But look, once we get
out from the other end,

215
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,086
we’d be able to see her again.

216
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,126
Right. Mei Ling!

217
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:16,557
What?

218
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,329
We’re going to enter this tunnel.

219
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,371
You’ll be hidden from us,

220
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:23,609
so you gotta tell us where you are.

221
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,808
Get it?

222
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,671
How should I tell you?

223
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,377
Count slowly.

224
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,180
I got it.

225
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,082
Let’s go.

226
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:34,943
One. Two.

227
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:39,591
Three. Four.

228
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,426
Five. Six.

229
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:51,401
Seven. Eight. Nin…

230
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,264
Mei Ling!

231
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:06,150
Mei Ling! Mei Ling!

232
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,016
Mei Ling!

233
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:09,782
Where are you?

234
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:18,294
I told her not to move.

235
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,567
Father and Touya must be worried.

236
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,766
Anyway, let’s look or her!

237
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,972
Mei Ling’s waiting for us.

238
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,603
Ye… Yeah.

239
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:37,471
This sound…

240
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,274
We heard it too
when the maze appeared.

241
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,326
Who is it?

242
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,027
Mei Ling!

243
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,094
Shao Lan!

244
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,356
Thank goodness.

245
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,624
But how did you get here?

246
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,764
I was saved.

247
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,900
By whom?

248
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,398
Miss Mizuki!

249
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,308
I thought I felt a strange
aura in our shrine.

250
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,747
It turns out it’s because
this maze suddenly appeared.

251
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,218
I was really surprised.

252
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,617
‘Our’ shrine?

253
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,650
I’m the daughter of
the priest of this shrine.

254
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,155
Eh!

255
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,550
But thank goodness.

256
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:23,393
I decided to walk around

257
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,056
because I was afraid someone
might have got lost in it.

258
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,795
And then, I heard Li’s cry.

259
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,794
Didn’t you hear this sound?

260
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,839
When we first got lost in the maze…

261
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:37,007
I was trying to warn people
to be careful by making some noise,

262
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,502
but I guess it was a little late.

263
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,678
It has an interesting shape.

264
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:43,811
It’s been past down in
the shrine from a long time ago.

265
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,842
This works like a bell too.

266
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,677
Eh!

267
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,386
Poor girl, you’re hungry, aren’t you?

268
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,425
Then, let’s get out of here.

269
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,696
We’ve been trying to look for
the exit all this time, but it
was nowhere to be found.

270
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,556
Do you know how you can
get out of a maze?

271
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,893
We tried many things,

272
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,328
but it seems we are really in trouble.

273
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,369
Then, what about this?

274
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:14,975
But even though you break the wall,
it quickly…

275
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,145
It’s weird?

276
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,179
Now, let’s go.

277
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:22,746
This seems to be okay.

278
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,682
I guess it’s fine as long
as we can get out.

279
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,917
The walls aren’t turning back
to the way they were.

280
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:29,724
She can break through this maze.

281
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:31,689
She has some amazing power after all.

282
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,368
Here’s the exit.

283
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,674
We got out!!

284
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:53,979
We finally got out!

285
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:55,277
Thank goodness.

286
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,488
It’s starting to form another maze!

287
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,156
Turn it back to a card quickly!

288
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,197
Bu… But…

289
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,193
Don’t mind me.

290
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:11,703
Um…

291
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,570
In that case, I’ll turn around.

292
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:18,101
Sure that’s okay?

293
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,203
Hurry! It’s forming another maze!

294
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,851
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

295
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,226
reveal thy true form before me.

296
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,093
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

297
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,188
Release!

298
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,207
Return to thy form which thou should be!

299
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,771
Clow Card!

300
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,497
U… Um… That’s…

301
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,060
I think it’s better
for you to have it. Here.

302
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:27,576
Sakura!

303
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,045
Touya!

304
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:30,943
What’ve you been doing?!

305
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,244
We got lost for a bit,

306
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:36,621
and then Miss Mizuki helped us out,

307
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:39,049
and led us towards the exit, and…

308
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,294
A lot of things happened.
Don’t scold her, okay?

309
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,627
Kaho…

310
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,369
You’ve grown up, Touya.

311
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,842
Eh!

312
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:02,573
I wonder what is wrong.

313
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:10,711
The charm store…

314
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:11,990
…is closed.

315
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,126
Here. Please have them.

316
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,924
Thank you very much!

317
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:23,084
You wanted that, right?

318
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,546
How did you know?
We didn’t say anything…

319
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:28,937
I just do.
My sixth sense.

320
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:33,211
See you tomorrow, okay?

321
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:34,310
See you tomorrow.

322
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,417
Be careful.

323
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,417
As I thought, that teacher
is more than just ordinary.

324
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,027
Wait for me!

325
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,891
See you later, Kinomoto.

326
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,531
Ye… Yes.

327
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:00,803
See you later, Touya.

328
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:12,514
Touya, you know Miss Mizuki?
