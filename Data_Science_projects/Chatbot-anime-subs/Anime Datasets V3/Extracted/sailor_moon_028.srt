1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:03,563
The illustrations done by a mysterious
beauty, Yumemi Yumeno,

2
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:06,332
are said to make romantic
wishes come true.

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:08,434
Somehow her illustrations
just feel very nostalgic.

4
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,670
What?! This innocent maiden

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,472
has one of the rainbow crystals?!

6
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:15,541
What'll I do?! Oh, I don't have time
to worry over this!

7
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,375
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

9
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

10
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,688
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

11
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

12
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

13
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

14
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

15
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

16
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

17
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,565
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

18
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,566
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior
of love and justice, Sailor Moon.

19
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,377
But it's not easy, you know.

20
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:08,313
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

21
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,315
before the bad guys get it,

22
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:15,187
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

23
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:19,625
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

24
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,456
so it'll work out somehow.

25
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:32,265
Illustrations Of Love, Are Usagi and
Mamoru Getting Closer?

26
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,686
Of the seven rainbow crystals,

27
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,622
two have been taken by
meddlesome outsiders

28
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,425
and only one is in my hands.

29
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:57,657
And three of the great Seven Monsters
have already been defeated.

30
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:02,067
Zoisite, how do you intend to take
responsibility for this?

31
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:06,003
Queen Beryl, please grant me
a short period of grace.

32
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,248
The next target is this girl.

33
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:19,706
I shall obtain the rainbow crystal,
even at the cost of my life.

34
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:24,181
I assume you know what will
happen if you fail?

35
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:26,651
Yes, my lady.

36
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,832
That's why...

37
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,470
It's definitely autumn.

38
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,405
There are couples everywhere.

39
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:52,272
Oh, Tuxedo Mask, are you
my enemy or my ally?

40
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:56,388
At any rate, he's got his eye on
our precious Silver Crystal,

41
00:03:56,388 --> 00:03:58,790
so we should consider him
our enemy for now.

42
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,849
No! No way!

43
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:04,363
Oh, I have no idea
who the man I adore is

44
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:06,431
and these scary monsters
just keep showing up!

45
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,035
Why am I the only one who
has to suffer like this?!

46
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,904
Usagi, sorry for making you wait!

47
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,140
Naru! So what is it?
What do you want to show me?!

48
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,576
You'll just have to wait until
you see it. Let's go!

49
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,101
Okay!
Let's have something to eat later!

50
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,471
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

51
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:24,349
The Crescent Moon Wand
is so important,

52
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,442
and she's so careless with it,
I can't believe it!

53
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:31,022
Yumemi Yumeno's Exhibition

54
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,599
Wow! They're so beautiful!

55
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,733
Aren't they?!

56
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,804
Yumemi Yumeno's illustrations
are really popular right now.

57
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:48,373
But there are only couples here.

58
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:52,244
That is because Yumemi's illustrations
are illustrations of love.

59
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:53,979
Umino!

60
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:54,446
Yes!

61
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:55,480
It's true.
Yes!

62
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,382
They say having one
of her illustrations

63
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,051
makes your romantic
wishes come true!

64
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,751
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
Makes your romantic
wishes come true!

65
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:00,274
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

66
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:03,285
I'm gonna buy a poster
on the way home!

67
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:06,825
Here, look. This is supposed to be
Yumemi's self-portrait.

68
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:09,259
Wow! She's so beautiful.

69
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:13,131
She totally fits the image of someone
who draws illustrations like these.

70
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,734
But the artist herself is
a mysterious beauty,

71
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:18,103
who never appears in public.

72
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:21,473
Wow, then she could actually
turn out to be ugly.

73
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:23,441
Oh, Usagi!

74
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,338
What?

75
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:35,742
It's no good. No good.
I'm not inspired at all.

76
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:40,759
But Yumemi hasn't put out
anything new lately.

77
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,194
Some rumors say she's in a slump

78
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,492
and no one knows where she is.

79
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,198
I'm right here.

80
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,099
Slump!

81
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,431
That's possible. Poor thing.

82
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,206
What's wrong, Usagi?

83
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:59,576
I don't know, this picture just
feels very nostalgic.

84
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:02,848
Yumemi Yumeno's Exhibition

85
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:03,348
Yumemi Yumeno's Exhibition
This is...

86
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:04,076
This is...

87
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,124
Please find the Silver Crystal!

88
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,796
It's similar to the dream
that I see all the time.

89
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:27,739
Now, then...

90
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:28,473
Come on, let's go this way next!
Now, then...

91
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,108
Come on, let's go this way next!
Hey, hey, don't pull me!

92
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:30,409
Hurry!
Hey, hey, don't pull me!

93
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,467
Hurry!

94
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,546
Oh, excuse me.

95
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,881
My glasses... My glasses...

96
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,348
Are you all right?

97
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,142
This is it! You're him!

98
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:50,156
Oh? Isn't that Motoki's friend?

99
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:54,029
Oh! That jerk!
He's with someone other than Rei!

100
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,403
I can't just ignore this! Sorry, Naru,
can you go home by yourself?

101
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,700
Usagi!

102
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,472
Umino, make sure you walk
Naru all the way home!

103
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,843
Oh, buy a poster for me!

104
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,708
Oh, yes, Ma'am! Leave it to me!

105
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,714
Oh, Usagi.

106
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:13,785
I'm all alone with Naru now, due to
unexpected circumstances.

107
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,253
Oh, this is strange.

108
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:18,950
I used to become sad when my Usagi
would leave me behind.

109
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:22,124
Am I a boy with many loves?

110
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,326
Umino, you sure you don't
have a fever?

111
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,231
Well, that is...

112
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,265
What is it?

113
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,434
If you want something, will you
just come out and say it?

114
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:33,572
That is, would you model...

115
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:37,109
I saw it, I saw it!
I'm gonna tell Rei about this!

116
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,044
You've got the wrong idea, Usagi.

117
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:43,174
How do I have the wrong idea?
You're holding her hand so tight.

118
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,487
What?

119
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:52,150
You fit my image perfectly!
I'm so lucky today!

120
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,227
Please model for me!

121
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,695
What?! A model?!

122
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:02,391
Please. Please come in.

123
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,336
Wow! Your garden is so pretty!

124
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,036
Please, um, Mamoru.

125
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,408
I will make some nice coffee
for us right away.

126
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,415
You pushed us into coming here,

127
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:19,179
but it's not like I have
a lot of free time.

128
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,752
Oh, come on!

129
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:23,812
College students goof off all the
time anyway, don't they?

130
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,082
But these look like
Yumemi Yumeno's illustrations.

131
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,787
What?! Could it be that you're
Miss Yumemi?

132
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,704
It doesn't fit your image, right?

133
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,339
Someone who does
illustrations like these

134
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,109
should be more wonderful and
more beautiful, right?

135
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,144
That's why I portray myself
as a beauty.

136
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:48,580
Don't tell anybody about this, please!

137
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,584
Don't tell anybody? You mean,
nobody knows about you?

138
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,586
Including your friends? Not anyone?

139
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,987
I don't have friends. But it's okay.

140
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:01,953
I'm satisfied as long as I can
create good illustrations.

141
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,586
Here, drink it while it's hot.

142
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,199
Usa, you sit here.

143
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,362
What?! You want to do a picture
of him and me together?!

144
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:11,536
Don't be so happy!

145
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:12,037
What?!
Don't be so happy!

146
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:12,571
What?!
What?!
Don't be so happy!

147
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,573
I don't want to model for
this kind of drawing.

148
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:17,442
Please! Have a seat.

149
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,077
I'm the kind of person

150
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,136
who can't envision a drawing
without models!

151
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:24,415
I've had a hard time finding the
right models these days.

152
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:27,746
It's just for today, so please!

153
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,116
Oh, fine.

154
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:35,891
Rei would hit me if she
saw me right now!

155
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:39,726
But now that I look closer,
he is handsome.

156
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,133
Oh, what am I thinking!

157
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,296
I'm supposed to be devoted
to Tuxedo Mask!

158
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,632
Ouch!

159
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,631
What are you doing?

160
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,637
None of your business!

161
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:59,417
Wow, I feel like this is going
to be a great drawing!

162
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,045
I think this could become
a masterpiece!

163
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:15,464
Oh, where did Usagi go?
She's so hopeless.

164
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:31,309
This is me? I can't believe it!

165
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,718
Just sit still. Sheesh.

166
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm doing it just this once out of
respect for the good coffee.

167
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:45,085
You're so lucky. How come you can
draw such wonderful drawings?

168
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:50,229
Whenever I'm drawing,
I always wish in my heart

169
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:54,629
that whoever looks at this picture
will become happy.

170
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,201
I wish they'll meet someone wonderful.

171
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:05,083
So, that's why they call your pictures
"illustrations of love."

172
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,218
You're so kind, Miss Yumemi.

173
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,153
But because of that, you can't
even make friends...

174
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:14,556
It can't be helped. Yumemi is supposed
to be incredibly beautiful.

175
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,818
If people find out that I'm her,
it'll ruin everyone's dream.

176
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:20,630
But...

177
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,503
A person who cannot
make herself happy

178
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,835
should have other concerns
than strangers' happiness.

179
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:32,911
You're so cold!

180
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,776
Wow, this drawing is wonderful!

181
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,919
Look! She draws wonderful
pictures like this one!

182
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,988
How could you say
something like that?!

183
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:43,989
Oh!

184
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,513
What?

185
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,495
This scene shows the girl
handing her lover a gift

186
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,963
as proof of her love.

187
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:57,629
But somehow, whenever I draw
these two, I always feel sad.

188
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,304
I know what you mean.

189
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:02,705
It feels so nostalgic,
it makes my heart ache.

190
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,142
As proof of her love?

191
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:10,682
Juban Construction

192
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:11,049

Yumemi Yumeno, soon, I will restore
you to your monster form.

193
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:16,146
Yumemi Yumeno, soon, I will restore
you to your monster form.

194
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,401
Your homemade cookies
were delicious!

195
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,937
I'm sorry for keeping you so late.

196
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:51,841
But maybe, you would have preferred
Mamoru to walk you home.

197
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,810
No way! Please!
You're misunderstanding!

198
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:57,241
Oh, it's Yumemi Yumeno!

199
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,748
It's so pretty!

200
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:01,979
Someone who can draw like this
must be a wonderful person.

201
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:04,616
Miss Yumemi, I think you're
thinking too much.

202
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,659
You can draw these wonderful pictures,

203
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,026
you're nice and you're really
good at baking cookies.

204
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,259
You're a very wonderful person!

205
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,227
Usa...

206
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,898
Cheer up! Okay? Good night!

207
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:27,240
You're a very wonderful person!

208
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,614
That was a great thing to say,
if I do say so myself!

209
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:34,550
I hope Miss Yumemi cheers up!

210
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,881
Usagi!

211
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,289
Oh, it's the Crescent Moon Wand.

212
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,795
You dropped it in the park.

213
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:49,732
If you don't want it, I'll have
someone else take care of it.

214
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:54,670
No, don't! It's just because I was
thinking about Tuxedo Mask.

215
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,073
But you seem all cheered up now.

216
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,342
What? Oh, well...

217
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:04,647
I'm so relieved. Your problems
are so small and simple.

218
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:06,148
And you recover quickly, too.

219
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:06,616
Ouch!
And you recover quickly, too.

220
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:07,249
Ouch!

221
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:10,707
Fine, so I'm simple! Luna, you jerk!

222
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:16,424
Oops. I just told her the truth.
Did I go too far?

223
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,263
Oh, Luna!

224
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:24,528
Girls worry a lot because
we're complicated!

225
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,803
It's responding in the direction
of Miss Yumemi's house!

226
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,605
Quietly hand over the rainbow crystal
and revert back into a monster.

227
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,939
He's beautiful, but he's also scary.
Who are you?

228
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,213
Zoi!

229
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,329
Wake up, monster Vena!

230
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:07,542
I had no idea Yumemi was a monster!

231
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:11,970
This can't be...

232
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:20,921
Oh, I'm scared.

233
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,591
I don't have time to be scared,
but I'm still scared.

234
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,421
Everyone, a monster's appeared!

235
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:30,861
Math III

236
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,303
Sailor warriors, gather together!

237
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,531
Okay!

238
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:40,107
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

239
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,192
How well it worked!

240
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:30,359
Safety First
Juban Construction
How well it worked!

241
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,027
Safety First
Juban Construction
Not so fast!

242
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:32,322
Safety First
Juban Construction

243
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:33,820
What?!

244
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,304
Miss Yumemi is so nice
and full of dreams,

245
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:45,205
I can't forgive you for taking her away!

246
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

247
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:56,107
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

248
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,480
Sailor Moon, whatever!
Go, monster Vena!

249
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,998
That's good, Vena!
Play with her more!

250
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,807
Oh, no!

251
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,405
Ouch!

252
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,277
No!

253
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,415
Tuxedo Mask!

254
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,428
Leaving so soon?
You're not getting away!

255
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:43,795
Oh, Tuxedo Mask!

256
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:49,669
Miss Yumemi, please don't
get in my way!

257
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,840
Remember the kindness in your heart!
Please!

258
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,744
Fire Soul!

259
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:09,091
Everyone!

260
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:12,026
Sailor Moon, you've done
well by yourself!

261
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,895
Bubble

262
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,033
Spray!

263
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:36,284
Everyone, she's a nice, good person!
Please go easy on her!

264
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,630
Let's have the rainbow crystal!

265
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,927
Impertinent bastard!

266
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,293
Zoi!

267
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,528
This will be the end of you!

268
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,674
Moon Tiara Action!

269
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,851
Sailor Moon!

270
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:17,253
Tuxedo Mask!

271
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:19,862
You saved me tonight.

272
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,489
Oh, no... Oh!

273
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,724
That is your pendant, isn't it?

274
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:31,970
Princess...

275
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:41,880
What? Do you know the princess?!
We're looking for her.

276
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,287
No, I don't know anything.

277
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,389
But if that is your mission,

278
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,824
you hold onto it.

279
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:50,792
Are you giving this to me?

280
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,529
Well, then could I have
something else, too?

281
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,760
Would you return the rainbow crystal
from the other day to me?

282
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,859
No. I cannot give that up.

283
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:03,499
The rainbow crystals are
significant to me as well.

284
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,241
Even the rainbow crystal
that you obtained...

285
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,011
Given the chance, I will take it
without hesitation.

286
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:11,844
What?!
Then are you our enemy after all?!

287
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:15,283
With regards to the rainbow
crystals, perhaps so.

288
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,015
Good-bye!

289
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,389
Tuxedo Mask...

290
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:26,854
Oh, no! It's not over yet!

293
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:42,542
Please stop attacking her!

294
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:46,777
She's pretty weak now.

295
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,151
Sailor Moon, now!

296
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,379
Okay!

297
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:59,217
Moon Healing Escalation!

298
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:04,588

Miss Yumemi!

302
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,453
Why did you invite us out here?

303
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,013
I thought you didn't want people
to find out what you look like?

304
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:31,686
I've quit hiding.

305
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,262
Wow! It's so beautiful!

306
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,400
It looks pretty good,
considering the model.

307
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh, you're so twisted.

308
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,338
Oh, this picture...

309
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,407
From now on, this will be
my self-portrait.

310
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,347
Thank you!

311
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:57,512
You gave me the courage to openly
announce that I'm me.

312
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,384
Wow, I'm so glad, Miss Yumemi!
