"A Nightmare Super-Transformation!!
Freeza's Battle Power of One Million"

2
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,070
What kind of transformation is this?
You're making us laugh!

3
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,410
To think that taking that off to become
more nimble is your idea of transforming...

4
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,020
Vegeta-san, I am so disappointed in you.
And after I looked after you the way I did.

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,430
If only you had peaceably submitted to me, you would
not have to experience this horror now.

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,230
What are you babbling about? I never submitted myself to you!

7
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,200
I was just pretending to submit, all the
while waiting for the right moment to
come along, so I could defeat you!

8
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,070
Yes, that is one of the poor habits you Saiyajins had.

9
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,810
Take your own father,

10
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,690
the king of Planet Vegeta, who was the same way.

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
What's this? You say the occupation of
Planet Tapp is still not complete?

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,720
Y- Yes, sir. The Tappans' resistance is
proving tougher than we anticipated.

13
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,990
They say it will take another three days to
complete the occupation.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,900
Three more days!?

15
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, sir. My humblest apologies.

16
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,310
Why, you! Have you forgotten that we promised
Freeza-sama the planet by tomorrow!?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,170
No, I would never do such a thing! However, the full moon
on Tapp will not appear for three more days.

18
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,740
Be gone.

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,250
Be gone! And let nothing remain!

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,770
As barbaric as always, I see.

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,910
I did not mind if it took another three days.

22
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,870
You've done something unfortunate here.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,610
Nonetheless, I came to speak about your son.

24
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,820
When do you intend to bring him to me?

25
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,050
Well, that is...

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
I know! You will please bring him in three days' time,

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,730
along with your announcement of the
successful occupation of Planet Tapp.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,730
You need not worry that I will not pamper him.

29
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,310
King Vegeta, are you really going to
deliver the prince to Freeza-sama?

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,750
Yeah.

31
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,290
But won't you be risking the prince's life?

32
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,020
I'm not concerned about things such as my son's life!

33
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
What I find unbearable is his attitude!

34
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,460
He has the mistaken idea that we
Saiyajins are his slaves or something!

35
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,130
King Vegeta!

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,900
Curse you, Freeza!

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,770
Someday, we'll teach you a lesson!

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,040
You really do resemble your dearly departed father,
both in your appearance and in your foolishness.

39
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,880
Foolish, you say?

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,380
That is right. If your father had not tried such a foolish stunt,

41
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,880
the Saiyajins would have gotten off
without being exterminated.

42
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,360
Listen up, you guys.

43
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,760
Freeza is afraid of us Saiyajins ganging up in large groups.

44
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,570
If you elite warriors combine your powers
as one, we are certain to defeat him!

45
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,750
Let's show him just how strong we Saiyajins are!

46
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,080
Freeza-sama,

47
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,760
some Saiyajins, including the Royal family, have just
arrived and are requesting an audience with you.

48
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,770
Freeza-sama?

49
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,500
Lately, there have been some disquieting
tendencies among the Saiyajins, yes?

50
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,390
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,710
They are indeed becoming quite an eyesore.

52
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,100
They are fools.

53
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,090
Quickly, men! Freeza is in here!

54
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,480
Take this!

55
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,070
Zarbon-san, open the door.

56
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,800
You will show the Saiyajins in.

57
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,530
Yes, sir.

58
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,670
A little exercise may be good for me.

59
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,740
Where is Freeza!?

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll kill you, and rule the universe myself!

61
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,020
Are you sure it will be as simple as that?

62
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,720
Are your men not trembling with fear even now?

63
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,670
Aw, crap.

64
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,520
King Vegeta!

65
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,610
Your king has just been defeated, do
you sirs not wish to avenge him?

66
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,510
Was that the best that even Saiyajins could do?

67
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,270
Freeza-sama, are you uninjured?

68
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,010
I did not even need to transform myself.

69
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,170
Now then, shall we be off?

70
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,190
We are going to go watch the fireworks of Planet Vegeta.

71
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,950
How wonderful!

72
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,300
Watch this, Zarbon-san, Dodoria-san!

73
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,680
Watch these beautiful fireworks!

74
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,330
I wanted to show it to you, too.

75
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,900
The fireworks of Planet Vegeta.

76
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,340
What a load of bull! If you were really
afraid of us Saiyajins,

77
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,710
simply blowing up Planet Vegeta would
be a completely fruitless measure.

78
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,710
I'm right, aren't I? I mean, you let me survive, after all!

79
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,450
Not to mention Kakarotto...

80
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,640
That's enough talk out of you.

81
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,160
So then, shall I begin the next part?

82
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,260
Your dearly departed father never saw this form.

83
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,860
What!?

84
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,110
What's this? What does he think he's doing?

85
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,550
Why me? Why am I the only one that has to go through this?

86
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,320
This isn't funny, for crying out loud.

87
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,500
W- What's this? What's going on?

88
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,320
Help me!

89
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,420
What... what's going on here?

90
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,930
What!?

91
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,620
Impossible! This can't be!

92
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,450
We'll be killed!

93
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
I- It's a nightmare!

94
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,230
Watch out, now! In this form, I won't be
as gentle as I was before.

95
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,220
W- What a Ki!

96
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,510
W- What's this? The strength of Freeza's
Ki has just increased several times over!

97
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,210
Oh, no!

98
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,550
Gohan!

99
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,170
Vegeta, what happened to those high
spirits you were in a moment ago?

100
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,640
You were spouting off all sorts of demands, weren't you?

101
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,610
Well, I really can't blame you. Not after having
been shown my overwhelming power.

102
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,890
Th- This guy's incredible!

103
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,970
Like I said, watch out!

104
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:20,270
You see, I have a lot more power now,
and I might just overdo things a little.

105
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,810
Incidentally, my battle power is now probably over 1,000,000.

106
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,780
Wh- What!?

107
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,810
Unbelievable!

108
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,090
N- Not even you could reach that high!

109
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,290
If you think I'm lying, I'll show you!

110
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,610
Dende!

111
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,070
No!

112
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,780
What's this!?

113
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,450
Freeza, you low-life, what have you done!?

114
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,010
What is the deal with this planet!?

115
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,430
Krillin-san?

116
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,300
What happened to Krillin-san?

117
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,270
Right here!

118
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,010
Y- You're bleeding!

119
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,450
It's nothing. I just got clipped by a flying rock fragment.

120
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,250
You all fled from that more quickly than
might be expected. You have my praise.

121
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,690
However, that was just my way of saying hello.

122
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,790
Even a Saiyajin could have done that.

123
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,160
Damn you!

124
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,340
That's such a pitiful face you're wearing, Vegeta.

125
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,740
I'd guess that you never imagined I could become this powerful.

126
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Now then, which one of you should I show to Hell first?

127
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,040
I've decided!

128
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,990
Krillin-san!

129
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,320
So... fast!

130
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,450
All too abruptly, Krillin is run through by Freeza.

131
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,680
Is this the strength of Freeza?

132
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,930
Krillin-san!
