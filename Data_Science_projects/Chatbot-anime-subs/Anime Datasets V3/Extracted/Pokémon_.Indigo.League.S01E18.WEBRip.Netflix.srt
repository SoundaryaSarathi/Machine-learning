Oh, we are terribly sorry.

Please leave your little Tentacool
extermination project to Team Rocket.

We sure will, Nastina.

00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,977
Sounds good.

the Tentacool completely,

We're going to make a million.

193
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,923
Just for getting rid of some jellyfish.

An overgrown squirt!

351
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,950
What's wrong with you, Nastina?
Don't you understand?

352
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,827
What you're trying to do
is wrong for everybody

353
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,870
because it hurts Pokémon and humans.

354
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:00,871
Horsea.

355
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,333
You stuck-up little brat!
Huh?

356
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,881
-Tentacruel?
-Horsea.

357
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,133
[laughs]

358
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,011
Well, Tentacruel,
glad to see you're wising up

359
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,887
and coming over to my way of thinking.

360
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,640
Now, why don't you and me
go into business together?

361
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,895
Whoa!

362
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,189
Uh...

363
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,357
So long!

364
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,193
Mm. Huh? Oh.

365
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,711
Goodbye, Tentacruel. We'll remember.

366
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,129
Horsea.

367
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,927
[hammering]

368
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,763
[groaning]

369
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,223
Whew. Huh?

370
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,059
[screaming]

371
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,894
[grunts]

372
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,191
[grunting]

373
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,526
You shouldn't drop in on me like this.

374
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,321
I thought that's what cousins are for.

375
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,447
Eesh.

376
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:23,079
[ship's klaxon blares]

377
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,832
It's kind of weird,
but Tentacruel turned out to be okay.

378
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
You're right.

379
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,671
So, Misty, you still think
jellyfish Pokémon are cute?

380
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,922
Sure do.

381
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,048
[both groan]

382
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:38,177
[chuckles] But right now
Horsea's the cutest Pokémon of all.

383
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,512
Come on, Horsea.

384
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,474
Horsea!

385
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,936
Horsea, you're my Pokémon.

386
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,814
Wait a minute.
That's supposed to be my pose.

387
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,817
I know, but I've always wanted
to try it out for myself. [giggles]

388
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,944
That's a good idea. Next time I'll try it.

389
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,155
Oh, why don't you guys
just think up your own poses, okay?

390
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,117
[Brock] You should be flattered
that people want to try out your pose.

391
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,869
-[Misty] That's right. Don't be so greedy.
-[Ash] What?
