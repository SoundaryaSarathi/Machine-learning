1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:06,162
[Sakura and the mysterious broach]

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:09,197
Good morning.

3
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:27,986
Good morning.

4
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:29,947
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan.

5
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,553
You seem down Sakura-chan.

6
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,953
Couldn’t you sleep well?

7
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,885
A bit.

8
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,658
Are you worried about last night?

9
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,433
Yes.

10
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,998
Come thunder and obey the command.

11
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:56,341
You can catch Thunder
after returning it to beast form.

12
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,246
Don’t you even know that?

13
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,653
Are you stupid?
Windy can’t counter Thunder.

14
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,561
You did catch the Thunder card.

15
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:16,763
Sakura,

16
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,535
you performed your duty

17
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:21,970
as the only Card Captor
in the world perfectly.

18
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:26,505
It’s nothing so impressive.

19
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,341
So that is the rod of sealing?

20
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,246
But you really don’t know anything.

21
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,685
Anyways, it is impossible for you

22
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,424
to gather the Clow Cards
with that level of power.

23
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:50,790
But I don’t know what
would have happened

24
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,266
if Li-kun hadn’t given me advice.

25
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:55,967
Morning.

26
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:57,240
Good morning.

27
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,842
Good morning, Sakura-chan.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,447
Rika-chan, good morning.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,955
You seem down.

30
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:18,630
Rika-chan.

31
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,088
Thank you!

32
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,797
Rika-chan is mature and kind.

33
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:31,400
She is wonderful.

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,789
Umm.

35
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,130
Thank you… umm…

36
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,433
For yesterday.

37
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,399
It was because you told me
various things

38
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,798
that I was able to catch the Clow Card.

39
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,406
If you are gathering Clow Cards,

40
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,075
it is only natural
you should know that much.

41
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:11,913
Umm,

42
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,152
the clothes you were
wearing yesterday were cool.

43
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:16,416
Does everybody wear
things like that in Hong Kong?

44
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,548
Umm, in my dream

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,153
I saw a boy wearing those green clothes.

46
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,519
That’s why it surprised me.

47
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,257
That was the ceremonial clothing
passed down through the Li clan.

48
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,534
There is no way you could know it.

49
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,963
I didn’t know it. I saw it in a dream.

50
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,867
So you have enough magic power
to have premonition dreams.

51
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:44,708
Umm.

52
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,780
Li-kun.

53
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,915
Yamazaki-kun.

54
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,579
This is right after transferring,
but you are cleaning monitor.

55
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:51,945
Cleaning monitor?

56
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:56,661
To be the cleaning monitor means
to keep the chalkboard clean,

57
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,357
write up the day.

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,458
During the break you sing, dance,

59
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,332
and do various other things.

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,860
Japanese schools have something
like that?

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,168
Yeah.

62
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:12,109
Did the cleaning monitor have
to sing and dance?

63
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,207
They don’t.

64
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,810
Well for the time being
shall we clean the board?

65
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:24,416
When this is done you sing.

66
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:26,488
Yeah.

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,404
Sakura-chan?

68
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:49,877
Who?

69
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:51,913
Who is it?

70
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,141
Kinomoto.

71
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,250
Not getting enough sleep?

72
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,158
Umm. Well…

73
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:05,855
Well then get some rest when you get home.

74
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,060
Homeroom is over.

75
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,399
Well, that is enough for today.

76
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,994
Good bye sensei!

77
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,299
Do your homework.

78
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,302
Yeah!

79
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:17,900
Good bye sensei!

80
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,441
Be careful.

81
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:22,309
That dream again?

82
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:34,354
Something wrong?

83
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,192
No, it’s nothing.

84
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,573
It must make you nervous
to have Li-kun behind you.

85
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,602
Sakura-chan

86
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,039
do you have free time today?

87
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,014
Yeah, I don’t have to make dinner tonight.

88
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,243
My dad is at school until late,

89
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:02,848
and my brother has work.

90
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,751
Rika-chan said she found a wonderful shop.

91
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:07,983
Do you want to come along?

92
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:13,996
Thank you.

93
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:18,266
You’re cheering me up

94
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,395
because I was spaced out all day.

95
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,305
Thank you.

96
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,303
I just wanted to be with you
a little bit longer.

97
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,418
Going somewhere on your way home is OK,

98
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,683
but after you finish cleaning.

99
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,890
Y… Yeah.

100
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:51,732
Over here.

101
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,361
Do you like this sort of shop too,
Sakura-chan?

102
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,358
Yeah!

103
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,565
They have lots of wonderful things.

104
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,172
Sorry to make you come along.

105
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,132
Sakura-chan was feeling down today.

106
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:33,968
It’s fine.

107
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:35,711
I was wondering about that too.

108
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,746
How cute.

109
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:43,381
They really are cute.

110
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,687
I’m sure it would look good on you.

111
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,188
I want it, but…

112
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,197
But…

113
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,259
Are you going to buy it?

114
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,997
Yeah, I just got my allowance.

115
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,542
But this means no snacks for a while.

116
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,183
Then, I will get this one.

117
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:14,782
That one is cute too.

118
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,544
I wanted a broach too.

119
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:20,556
Well then, I will take this one.

120
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:24,656
It’s a pin broach right?

121
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,720
I am sure it would look good on you.

122
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,544
Kero-chan I have a guest,

123
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:41,768
so don’t come downstairs.

124
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,237
I got ya. I got ya.

125
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,050
Shall I help?

126
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,156
No, I’m fine. Go ahead and sit.

127
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,660
Sorry to intrude before dinner.

128
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,765
My brother and dad will be late today.

129
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,537
I will pour the tea.

130
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,137
Thank you.

131
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,183
Ah, it looks delicious.

132
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,921
My dad made them.

133
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,653
Let’s eat them together.

134
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,292
Thanks for the food.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,498
Delicious.

136
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,359
Your father really is a good cook.

137
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:48,245
How cute.

138
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,738
It really was a nice shop.

139
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,778
Next time let’s invite Naoko-chan
and Chiharu-chan too.

140
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,050
Yeah.

141
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,416
It looks great.

142
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,752
You are very mature and pretty,

143
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,752
so things like that really suit you.

144
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:08,563
Rika-chan?

145
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,738
Rika-chan.

146
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,004
Rika-chan!

147
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,693
Sakura-chan.

148
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:15,930
What is it?

149
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,729
I just felt the aura of a Clow Card.

150
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:22,699
I smell pudding!

151
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:24,233
Without me!

152
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,167
More importantly,
Sakura-chan is in danger.

153
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:32,312
Rika-chan! Rika-chan!

154
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,612
Sakura!

155
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:38,952
Rika-chan is…

156
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,019
That is…

157
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,529
That’s the Sword card.

158
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,000
Rika-chan isn’t learning fencing,

159
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,506
so why?

160
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,434
The Sword makes

161
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,200
whoever uses it
an expert at swordplay.

162
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,439
This girl’s consciousness

163
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:04,643
is being controlled by Sword.

164
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,113
That can’t be.

165
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:07,816
Look out!

166
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,859
Key which hides the power of darkness,

167
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,697
show your true form before me.

168
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:27,529
Under the contract, I Sakura command you.

169
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,663
Release!

170
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,113
Jump.

171
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:54,928
If that sword hits you
it would be very bad.

172
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,801
The power of the Sword
depends on the heart of the person carrying it.

173
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,194
If it doesn’t want to cut you

174
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,865
it can hit you with the back of the sword,

175
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,740
but if it decides otherwise…

176
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,513
It can cut now.

177
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,349
But I can’t attack Rika-chan.

178
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,679
Then hurry and run away.

179
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,858
But… But… I can’t leave
Rika-chan like this.

180
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,666
Ri-kun!

181
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:30,862
You…

182
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:38,470
No!

183
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:41,837
What are you doing?

184
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:42,774
Sakura!

185
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:51,452
Are you OK?

186
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,152
Yeah, but Rika-chan is…

187
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,650
She almost got us.

188
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,561
You can’t hurt Rika-chan.

189
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,425
Everything would be OK

190
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,293
if she would only let go
of the sword for a second.

191
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:09,468
Sakura-chan!

192
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,402
What is it?

193
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,108
Tomoyo-chan and Ri-kun help me too.

194
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,106
That idiot.

195
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,744
It’s painful…

196
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,149
Be quiet and watch.

197
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:32,518
Display the form of the person
she thinks of the most.

198
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,761
Illusion!

199
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,688
Sensei…

200
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,187
Sakura, now!

201
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,041
Return to your rightful form,

202
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,067
Clow Card!

203
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:33,983
All right!

204
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,121
She did it.

205
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,392
Rika-chan! Rika-chan!

206
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,129
She just passed out.

207
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:50,104
Sakura caught the card all on her own.

208
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,175
Sword is among the weakest of cards,

209
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,102
that was easy.

210
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,175
What’s that?

211
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:57,636
It’s painful…

212
00:15:58,983 --> 00:15:59,847
Kero-chan!

213
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,311
Sakura-chan, I hear footsteps.

214
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,918
Stops.

215
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,019
Somebody is coming.

216
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,652
Kero-chan go to my room.

217
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,287
Is Touya here?

218
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,899
I came to return a CD I borrowed.

219
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,426
What’s wrong?

220
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,024
Are you OK?

221
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:05,446
Rika-chan.

222
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,217
Sakura-chan.

223
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:11,082
Sorry about yesterday.

224
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:15,822
For me to suddenly pass out like that.

225
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:17,355
But I don’t remember anything
after putting on that broach.

226
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,029
It’s strange.

227
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:21,129
Here.

228
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,665
Can I open it?

229
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,739
This is the one you bought.

230
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,414
I looked for your broach

231
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:41,746
as hard as I could,

232
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:43,647
but I couldn’t find it.

233
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:44,987
So…

234
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:46,412
Don’t worry about it.

235
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,983
It was my fault.

236
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,287
But… but…

237
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:51,652
But I really want you to take this.

238
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,200
The broach Rika-chan bought

239
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,401
is a card so I can’t give it back,

240
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,294
and I can’t tell her that.

241
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,101
I can’t explain it well.

242
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,637
Thank you, I’ll take good care of it.

243
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:10,603
Eh!

244
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:14,848
She isn’t asking anything

245
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,784
because I seemed troubled.

246
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:22,715
Rika-chan really is mature
and kind, and wonderful.

247
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,722
Good morning.

248
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:30,828
Morning.

249
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,606
What?

250
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,903
That brat was near our house?

251
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,006
He left right away though.

252
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,814
I guess I have to let him off this one time.

253
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,950
Have you chased away all the boys

254
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,650
that get close to Sakura-chan?

255
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:56,293
The only one allowed to pick on her is me.

256
00:18:57,662 --> 00:18:59,960
You do have a sister complex after all.

257
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:01,663
Shut up.

258
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,801
It is just about the time she promised.

259
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,670
What did Sakura-chan need me for?

260
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,047
She said she had something
she wanted to give you.

261
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,313
In return for me telling you,

262
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,417
she has to make dinner tonight.

263
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:25,787
Picking on her again.

264
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:35,559
Why you…

265
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,598
Sorry to keep you waiting.

266
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,705
Sakura-chan, you needed me for something?

267
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:44,603
Umm,

268
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,244
thank you for helping to
carry Rika-chan yesterday.

269
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,939
Thank you.

270
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,806
This is in thanks.

271
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,843
Really? Thank you.

272
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,278
Ah, chocolate.

273
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,121
I love sweets.

274
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,226
It looks great.

275
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,287
But you needn’t have worried about it.

276
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:07,928
Wait!

277
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:12,259
Here.

278
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,862
I can have this?

279
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,776
Thank you.

280
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:22,913
What did he give you?

281
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,177
Chocolate. Do you want some?

282
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,107
Sakura-chan!

283
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:29,917
Tomoyo-chan?

284
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:34,252
Because I couldn’t film
you getting the card yesterday,

285
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:37,125
I filmed a Sakura-chan
giving a present episode.

286
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,758
It looks like Li-kun likes
Tsukishiro-san too.

287
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,564
A rival has appeared in
both gathering cards

288
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,235
and in love.
