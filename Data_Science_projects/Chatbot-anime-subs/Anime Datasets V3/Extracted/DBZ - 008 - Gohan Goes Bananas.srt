00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,741
Mother...

2
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,058
I can't do anythin' at all with Goku-<i>sa</i>!

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,423
I'm sure that right now, he's keepin'
Gohan up, no doubt about it!

4
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,991
And right now is the most
important time for him, too!

5
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,207
With everyone gathered
at the Kame House,

6
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,877
there's not a single person who can
serve as a good example for Gohan!

7
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:30,280
Goku-<i>sa</i> has to know that it's not good
for him from an educational standpoint!

8
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,721
I can see from this how
Gohan's future is goin' to be.

9
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,974
<i>l've really had it this time.</i>

10
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,617
<i>There's no way that I can tell them</i>
<i>that Goku has died now...</i>

11
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:14,882
<i>l guess that for me to return to the</i>
<i>Kame House would be best for now.</i>

12
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,202
Goku-<i>sa</i>...

13
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:28,502
Eat some more. We've got
barbecued elephant this time...

14
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,875
No need to be shy. You can
start by gnawin' on its head...

15
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,757
<i>Goku...</i>

16
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,855
<i>Nobody would have been</i>
<i>able to tell them, right?</i>

17
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,854
Wah! It's too bright!

18
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:42,377
I can't get down!
And I'm hungry!

19
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:49,044
If you're hungry, you can just climb down
from there and find something to eat.

20
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,824
What? You couldn't tell them?

21
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:55,054
I'm very sorry.

22
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,831
Don't tell me you didn't say anything!

23
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,166
No...

24
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,170
What's the use?
Geez, you're so spineless!

25
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,972
T- that's easy for you to say,

26
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,874
but if any normal person
saw Chichi-<i>san</i>'s face,

27
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,843
they'd be unable to tell her!

28
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:15,847
Oh? So you're saying
that I'm no normal person!?

29
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,183
T- that's not what I meant...

30
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,518
Well, I suppose it's no surprise.

31
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,854
But we can't just keep quiet like this.

32
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:25,523
If we wrote her a letter
explaining what happened,

33
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:27,525
perhaps she would understand.

34
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,528
R- right! That will work!

35
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:34,899
By the way, Kuririn,
what about the Dragon Balls?

36
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,231
There were two of them
at Son-<i>kun</i>'s house, right?

37
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,205
I forgot.

38
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:41,467
You're good for nothing!

39
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,582
I wonder what happened to Kuririn.

40
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,157
Chichi, don't get so worked-up,
I tell ya. Kuririn was just-

41
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:02,160
Pa, would you shut up!?

42
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,830
He told me he'd be sure
to be back by nighttime!

43
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,133
Goku ain't been to the
Kame House in a long time.

44
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:13,838
He must've just accidentally lost track
of time talkin' about the old days!

45
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:18,176
That may be fine for Goku-<i>sa</i>,
but Gohan has his cram school!

46
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:22,180
D- don't be silly!
Gohan is four years old!

47
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,183
It won't hurt for him to skip
just one day of cram school.

48
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,851
You're too soft, Pa!

49
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:30,685
In these coming times, it's those
who can study that will win out!

50
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:40,995
Chichi! Chichi! I ain't fastened in!

51
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,977
I wonder if this is it...

52
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,621
Hey there, it's finally finished!

53
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,066
How nice of you guys to be
napping around at a time like this!

54
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,838
Now then, you there,
Grandpa Turtle, stand on up.

55
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,186
G- Grandpa Turtle?

56
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,644
I changed the display numbers
to make it easier to understand.

57
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,791
Let's see, 139...

58
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:49,467
139? I'm not as young as that!

59
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,804
This is the number that represents
your strength, Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>.

60
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:57,609
The number that represents my strength?
Whoa, that's an incredible device.

61
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:00,144
It can even tell that?

62
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:04,046
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, what would my number be?

63
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:11,713
Amazing! It says 206!

64
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,494
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, I really
have surpassed you, huh?

65
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:19,831
H- hey, are you sure
it's not malfunctioning?

66
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,166
Malfunctioning?

67
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,532
That could not be.

68
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,471
Just 0.001!

69
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,183
It's not malfunctioning, all right!

70
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,852
Yahoo!

71
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:42,186
Is that right?

72
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:45,123
I don't mean to brag,
but when it comes to my skills-

73
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,792
Hey! Hey!

74
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,460
Who could it be, this early?

75
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,464
Hey, I say, hey! Hey!

76
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,800
Hey! Hey!

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,803
Who's out here calling
to us so unusually?

78
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,472
It's me!

79
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,975
Y- you're that guy who was
at Karin-<i>sama</i>'s place,

80
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,476
as I recall- Armadillo!

81
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:07,412
That's Yajirobe, ya dumb bastard!

82
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,480
I'll just betcha ya got
my name wrong on purpose!

83
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,749
What're ya doin' buildin'
a house way out here?

84
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,818
Makes it a real hassle to find.

85
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:18,156
I came here at Karin's
askin' to give ya a message.

86
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:21,159
A message from Karin-<i>sama</i>?

87
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,828
" I know the whole situation," he says.

88
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,764
So you, along with that Yamucha guy,

89
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:30,029
and that Ten-whatever-guy
and Chaozu are to come immediately.

90
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,503
Everyone is to go to Karin-to Tower?

91
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,172
What for?

92
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:39,844
Kami-<i>sama</i>, see, is gonna give us trainin',
he says. I'm in there with ya too.

93
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,179
R- really!?

94
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,880
Yeah. For my part,

95
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,185
I told 'em that I don't wanna fight
no whatever-their-face-is aliens,

96
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:51,189
but they says I gotta do it no
matter what. I've had it with 'em.

97
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,885
U- understood! I'll go find
everyone and head there right away!

98
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,760
Catch ya later. I told ya everythin',
that's for sure.

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,668
Oh yeah, right. I forgot.

100
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:10,541
Goku says not to bring him back
to life 'fore those enemies come.

101
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,210
W- why not?

102
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,313
He says he's gonna train
in the Other World.

103
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:16,547
If ya wanna know details,

104
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:21,041
some old hag named Uranai Baba's
supposed to be along pretty soon. Ask her.

105
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,689
W- what? When?

106
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,896
T- training in the Other World?

107
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,864
O- of all things!

108
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:38,236
Huh?

109
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,534
He turned around again.

110
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,105
It's a different kind of plane.

111
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:57,518
Ahoy! Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>!

112
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,582
It's Chichi and Gyumao!

113
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:09,697
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, what do we do!?

114
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:14,603
I still haven't written their letter!

115
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:31,055
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>,

116
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:35,754
it's been a terribly long time!
Have you been well?

117
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:38,896
I- I suppose so.

118
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,796
--Y- yikes...
--Y- yikes...

119
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,837
My Goku-<i>sa</i> and Gohan
are supposed to be here!

120
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:50,174
Where are they?
Are they inside the house?

121
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:53,769
U- um, the f- fact of the matter is...

122
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,856
He was taken away by Piccolo Daimao!?

123
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:08,192
W- what happened to Goku!?

124
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,319
He d- died...

125
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,234
Chichi! Steady!

126
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,557
Hey! Hey!

127
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,889
Let me down!

128
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,198
Hey!

129
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,463
They're gone...

130
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,402
Mother... Father...
I can't get down...

131
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,683
What have we here?

132
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:05,965
You don't have to run away.
I won't do anything mean to you.

133
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,454
Hold on...

134
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:34,266
Ah, so that's how you get down.
But still...

135
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:43,408
I want to get down!

136
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,073
Urinating, huh?

137
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:24,450
Why is this happening to me?

138
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,159
Why is it this bright out?

139
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,200
It's the moon!

140
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,658
Wow! It's completely round!

141
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:44,201
This is the first time
I've ever seen a full moo-

142
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,087
What is it?

143
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:53,534
What!?

144
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,140
I- impossible!

145
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:28,903
What's going on!? He's got
extraordinary destructive power!

146
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:41,818
A- at this rate, earth will be annihilated
before the Saiyans even get here!

147
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,860
How can this be?

148
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,636
Don't play stupid! It is when
the moon is at its fullest

149
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,730
that we Saiyans are
at our best, you know!

150
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,477
<i>That's it!</i>

151
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,308
<i>lt's the full moon!</i>

152
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,181
Get lost!

153
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:52,796
T- to think that he could transform!
It must be his Saiyan blood.

154
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:56,755
I get the feeling that I've discovered
the secret to him and Son Goku's strength.

155
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,498
Looks like blowing the moon
away was the right thing to do.

156
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:07,209
I shudder to think of those Saiyan
guys turning into monsters like that.

157
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,317
He said something or other
about their tails,

158
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:16,820
but it appears that both the tails
and a full moon are required to transform.

159
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,223
Maybe I'll pull out his tail, too.

160
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,159
There's no need to worry
about him transforming like this,

161
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,856
but Saiyan tails seem
to be their weak spots.

162
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,168
All right, then.

163
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:34,160
I think I'll provide him clothes
and a sword at no charge...

164
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:38,300
I'll let you have the same
design as your father's.

165
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,748
Although the character
may be a little different.

166
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:53,157
I have to go do my own training.
I'm leaving now.

167
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:57,027
If you can survive here without anything
happening to you for six months,

168
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:01,031
I, Piccolo-<i>sama</i>, will personally put
you through some hellish training!

169
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:05,369
