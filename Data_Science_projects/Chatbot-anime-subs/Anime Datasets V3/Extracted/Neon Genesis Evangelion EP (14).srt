1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,920
<i>Anno Domini 2015.</i>
<i>The third angel ...</i>

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,990
<i>The attack of Sachiel.</i>

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,130
<i>Conventional weaponry is</i>
<i>ineffective against the angel.</i>

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,410
<i>The UN transfers full</i>
<i>command authority to NERV.</i>

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,890
<i>The angel arrives</i>
<i>at NERV headquarters.</i>

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,210
<i>At the same day, the</i>
<i>Third Child arrives aswell.</i>

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,170
<i>Shinji Ikari.</i>
<i>He agrees to pilot the Eva.</i>

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,690
<i>The first sortie</i>
<i>of Evangelion-01.</i>

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,770
<i>NERV's first mission.</i>

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,520
<i>Eva-01, head damage.</i>
<i>Out of control.</i>

32
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,570
<i>Complete silence.</i>
<i>But then...</i>

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,120
<i>Running Amok</i>

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,050
Although there was a great deal
of damage as a result,

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,780
the fact that a boy with no
prior experience

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,990
completed a mission against
an unknown enemy

37
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,550
makes Shinji Ikari deserving
of special notice.

38
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,250
<i>Eva-01 erodes</i>
<i>the enemy's AT field.</i>

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,160
However, for the Department
of Strategic Operations,

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,330
it was a battle that revealed
many problems.

41
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,850
<i>Angel destroyed.</i>

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,360
<i>Intercept systems destroyed.</i>
<i>Eva-01, medium damage.</i>

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,730
<i>The suffering of the</i>
<i>victims was not mentioned.</i>

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,450
My sister's only in the
second grade.

45
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,520
She got hurt in that stupid
disturbance,

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,630
and she was hurt by our own
stupid robot, not by the enemy.

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,030
I can't forgive anyone who did
something so stupid.

48
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,230
I'm going to let them
feel my anger,

49
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,930
and teach the jerks who hurt
my sister a lesson.

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,810
<i>The fourth angel</i>

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,970
<i>The attack of Shamusiel.</i>

52
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,490
<i>Interception effectivity</i>
<i>back then: 48,2%</i>

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,170
<i>Mission performance</i>
<i>of Neo-Tokyo 3: 96,8%</i>

54
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,690
We'd already had a lot of
evacuation training at the school,

55
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,860
so we didn't really think
it was so serious.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,370
All the guys acted like jerks,
like they were on a field trip,

57
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,860
and none of the girls
were afraid either.

58
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,130
<i>The angel arrives at Neo-Tokyo 3.</i>

59
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,130
<i>The second battle at Neo-Tokyo 3.</i>

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,410
<i>External power cable severed.</i>
<i>Regardless of this accident,</i>

61
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,090
<i>the angel was destroyed.</i>

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,240
<i>As a result, NERV salvages</i>
<i>an angel in its original form.</i>

63
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,210
<i>However, the final</i>
<i>report is still missing.</i>

64
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,840
<i>The fifth angel.</i>

65
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,850
<i>The attack of Ramiel.</i>

66
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,170
<i>Captain Katsuragis "Yashima-Plan"</i>
<i>against the enemy is approved</i>

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,210
<i>First Child.</i>

68
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,410
<i>The designated pilot of Eva-00.</i>

69
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,730
<i>Rei Ayanami.</i>

70
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,330
<i>Her first sortie with the</i>
<i>repaired Eva-00.</i>

71
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,590
<i>In this night, the angel</i>
<i>penetrates the Geo-Front.</i>

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,360
<i>The "Yashima-Plan"</i>
<i>is executed.</i>

73
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,000
Ikari didn't tell me anything, so
this is just a guess on my part.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,300
I think Ayanami tried
to sacrifice herself

75
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,670
to protect Unit 01 from the
enemy's particle beam attack.

76
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,070
I'm really sure about this,

77
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,410
and the reason I'm so positive
is Ayanami herself.

78
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,980
She seems to hold little respect
for the value of her own existence.

79
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,530
<i>"Yashima-Plan" successful.</i>
She seems to hold little respect
for the value of her own existence.

80
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,620
It's not just that she's more
pessimistic than most teenagers,
<i>Eva-00, severely damaged. Pilot survives</i>

81
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,880
it's something much, much more.
<i>Eva-00, severely damaged. Pilot survives</i>

82
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,210
<i>The sixth angel.</i>

83
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,570
<i>The encounter with Gagiel.</i>

84
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,130
This did not occur in accordance
with our scenario.

85
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,270
Nevertheless, the result was within
the projected parameters.

86
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,740
We can make the necessary
adjustments.

87
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,290
<i>Second Child.</i>

88
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,410
<i>The designated pilot of Eva-02.</i>

89
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,810
<i>Soryu Asuka Langley.</i>

90
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,130
<i>Her first sortie with Eva-02.</i>

91
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,410
<i>Melee at high sea.</i>

92
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,290
<i>and...</i>

93
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,650
<i>...the first underwater fight.</i>

94
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,880
<i>At the heights of Old-Ito,</i>

95
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,850
<i>Angel destroyed.</i>

96
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,760
The UN Navy lost a third of its
entire fleet in this encounter.

97
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,500
The lost ships belonged to your
country. The damage is negligible.

98
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,060
True, it's fortunate that so much
of the damage was minor.

99
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,370
<i>The seventh angel.</i>

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,770
<i>The attack of Israfel,</i>

101
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,110
<i>which can split and remerge.</i>

102
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,290
<i>However, a synchronized attack</i>
<i>of Eva-01 and Eva-02...</i>

103
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,810
<i>...destroys the angel.</i>

104
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,000
<i>The eighth angel.</i>

105
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,250
<i>Sandarphone is located</i>
<i>in the depths of the Asama-Volcano.</i>

106
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,170
<i>NERV releases special directive A-17.</i>

107
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,490
<i>With the highest priority</i>
<i>a capture mission is commenced.</i>

108
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,330
<i>Capture in the electromagnetic</i>
<i>cage is temporarily succesful...</i>

109
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,999
<i>but the magnetic cage is damaged.</i>
<i>Mission aborted.</i>

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,730
<i>New objective:</i>
<i>Termination of the angel.</i>

111
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,560
<i>Eva-02 continues the operation.</i>

112
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,890
<i>Angel destroyed.</i>

113
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,000
<i>Repair and regeneration</i>
<i>of Eva-00 complete.</i>

114
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,090
<i>Eva-00 operational.</i>

115
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,560
<i>The ninth angel.</i>

116
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,000
<i>The attack of Matriel.</i>

117
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,280
<i>During the simultaneous</i>
<i>mission of the three Evas</i>

118
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,490
<i>the angel is destroyed.</i>

119
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,040
<i>The tenth angel.</i>

120
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,890
<i>The attack of Tzachquiel.</i>

121
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,770
<i>The target falling</i>
<i>from the stratosphere</i>

122
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,290
<i>is directly intercepted</i>
<i>by the three Evas</i>

123
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,250
<i>Angel destroyed.</i>

124
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,570
<i>The eleventh angel.</i>

125
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,770
<i>Attack unconfirmed. Rumors about</i>
<i>success in compromising the HQ.</i>

126
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,780
This is no good.

127
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,620
It's happening too early.

128
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,990
That's true. This did not occur in
accordance with our predictions

129
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,990
of when an Angel would
invade NERV.

130
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,530
And to make it worse, you let it
intrude into Central Dogma itself.

131
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,500
If contact had occurred then,

132
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,570
our entire project could have
ended in disaster.

133
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,300
The report to this committee
was in error.

134
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,040
There is no truth behind this
tale of an Angel invasion.

135
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,550
Are you saying the Eleventh
Angel's intrusion did not occur?

136
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,310
Correct.

137
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,210
Correct.
Speak with caution, Ikari.

138
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,480
Speak with caution, Ikari.

139
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,690
Making false statements to this
conference is punishable by death.

140
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,160
Check the MAGI's recorders.

141
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,430
Nothing concerning such an
incident was recorded.

142
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,130
This is absurd. Hiding the
truth is your specialty.

143
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,370
The time schedule follows what
the Dead Sea Scrolls prescribes.

144
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,000
All right.

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,130
We won't discuss any possible
guilt or punishment this time.

146
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,900
But let me remind you that you
cannot create a new scenario.

147
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,270
I understand.

148
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,910
Everything is proceeding
according to Seele's plan.

149
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,370
Episode 14
Weaving a Story

150
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Mountain...

151
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,810
Heavy are the mountains, but
that changes over time.

152
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,390
Sky...

153
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,880
Blue sky.

154
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,120
What your eyes can't see.

155
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,490
What your eyes can see.

156
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,160
Sun...

157
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,820
There is only one.

158
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,530
Water... Comforting.

159
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,340
Commander Ikari?

160
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,640
Flower...

161
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,670
So many alike.

162
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,010
So many useless.

163
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,480
Sky...

164
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,600
Red, red sky.

165
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,610
Red is the color.

166
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,680
Red is the color I hate.

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,050
Water flowing.

168
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,450
Blood...

169
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,690
The smell of blood.

170
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,920
A woman who never bleeds.

171
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,860
From the red earth comes man,
from the soil.

172
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,620
Born of man and woman is Man.

173
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,730
Town... A human creation.

174
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,930
Eva... A human creation as well.

175
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,560
What is a human?
A creation of God?

176
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,100
Is it a human creation?

177
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,510
The things I possess are
my life and soul.

178
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,080
I am a vessel for my heart.

179
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,450
Entry Plug, the throne for a soul.

180
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,020
Who is this? This is me.

181
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,980
Who am I? What am I? What am I?
What am I? What am I?

182
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,990
I am myself.

183
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,830
This, that which is, is myself.
That which is formed is me.

184
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,140
This is the me that can be seen,
yet feels as if this is not myself.

185
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,770
A strange feeling.

186
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,140
I feel as if my body is melting.

187
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,650
I can no longer see myself.
My shape is fading.

188
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,320
I feel the presence of someone
who is not me.

189
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,340
Who is there, beyond me here?

190
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,390
Ikari?

191
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,120
I know this person. She is
Captain Katsuragi.

192
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Doctor Akagi...

193
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,860
Others...

194
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,090
Classmates...

195
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,330
The pilot of Unit 02.

196
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,860
Commander Ikari?

197
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,170
Who are you?

198
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,730
Who are you?

199
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,100
Who are you?

200
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>So, how does it feel to be piloting</i>
<i>Unit 01 for the first time?</i>

201
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,100
It smells like Ikari.

202
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,360
<i>First compatibility test</i>

203
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,620
Her synch ratio is almost the
same as with Unit 00.

204
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,760
Unit 00 and 01's personal data
patterns are also almost identical.

205
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,020
That's what makes this synch
experiment possible.

206
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,120
Error is plus or minus zero point
zero three. Harmonics are normal.

207

No compatibility problems
detected between Rei and Unit 01.

He's a bit nervous, but no

221
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
This is his first time in Unit 00,

222
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,750
and his first time piloting any
other Eva. That's natural.

223
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,680
Nonsense, why should he care?

224
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,190
<i>That's what makes him Shinji.</i>

225
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,350
I know, and that's why he's stupid.

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,060
Speaking of which, why am I not
taking the compatibility test?

227
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,860
<i>You don't want to pilot any</i>

229
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,200

be compatible.

Not like that, but...

It smells like Rei.

238
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,560

249
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,410
But these are still good readings.

250
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,420
This means that we can
implement the plan.

251
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,020
The dummy system, you mean?
I disagree.

252
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,530
I understand your feelings on this,
but we always have to be prepared

256
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,440
People with a fastidious nature

257
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,460
will always feel some difficulty
living amongst others.

258
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,710
Once you've been sullied, you'll
regretfully find the truth in this.

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,630

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,220
I can't tell you much right now.

309
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,230
I only know we must reconfigure
Unit 00 for Rei's personal data,

310
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,360
and run a new synch test between
them as soon as possible.

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,000
As Director of Strategic Ops, I ask
you do so as soon as possible,

<i>crazy bastards, you know?</i>

339
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
And Shinji doesn't know anything.
<i>What I can't stand is those idiots</i>
<i>that involve innocent people!</i>

340
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,790
Just what is the First Child?
<i>What I can't stand is those idiots</i>
<i>that involve innocent people!</i>

341
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,580
About that Angel invasion that
deviated from the plan.

342
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,810
The committee is applying
pressure over the incident.

343
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
They're just riff-raff who can't do
anything except complain.

344
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,090
We hold all the tiles. There
is nothing they can do.

345
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,990
But we don't want to irritate them.

346
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,160
If SEELE starts interfering,
there could be trouble.

347
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,070
Everything has been carried out
as the scenario required.

348
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,040
There is no problem.

349
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,030
What about the Unit 00 incident?
That wasn't in my scenario.

350
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,800
It will not interfere.

351
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,480
The re-synchronization test for Rei
and Unit 00 was successful.

352
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>Ikari is too concerned about Rei.</i>

353
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,620
What is the status of the
Adam Project?

354
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,420
Proceeding smoothly. It is less
than two percent behind schedule.

355
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,690
Then, the Lance of Longinus is...

356
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,990
It's going as we planned.

357
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,720
Rei is carrying out the operation.

358
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>To be continued...</i>

359
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Vorschau

360
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,000
Misato feels pressure while many
of her friends get married.

361
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,800
Her twenties are almost over,
and the thirties are arriving fast.

362
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,900
Is a reunion with
Kaji her last chance?

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,900

"A Lie and Silence"
