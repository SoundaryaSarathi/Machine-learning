1
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,654
Would you go with him,

2
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:11,071
and see what's happening
in the conductor's compartment for me?

3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,364
This is bad! This is bad!

4
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,244
Barnes was apparently
successful in getting two bottles

5
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,791
of the finished product
out from the site of the fire.

6
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,541
Where is your daughter?

7
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,958
She's been taken away,

8
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,127
by those men in the white suits.

9
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,438
You were threatened, and couldn't help it?

10
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,608
Yes, sir. Gustavo Baggetta's
monstrous strength is most extraordinary,

11
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:04,698
and thinking that I was about
to be killed, it just happened.

12
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:08,578
I told you, don't say anything
that will put Eve-<i>chan</i> in danger!

13
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:12,038
Yeah, sorry about that. I've taken all measures.

14
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:15,345
Even if you were in fear for your life,

15
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:19,237
as with Elean-<i>kun,</i>
I don't think much of you using

16
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:22,018
that sweet girl as an excuse.

17
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:28,858
Nicholas-<i>kun</i>, you ultimately bear
personal responsibility for this incident.

18
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,388
See to it that you are more careful.

19
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:33,613
Understand?

20
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:35,907
Very well.

21
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:42,648
Any word?

22
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:45,698
None. They don't appear to have moved yet.

23
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,488
Let me know if there is
even the slightest action.

24
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:52,618
If Gustavo and the Gandors
get into an argument over Dallas,

25
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:56,162
a piece or two of detailed
information should turn up.

26
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:58,832
Tell me what it is, and don't leak anything.

27
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:00,264
Understood.

28
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>H-Help me</i>! <i>This is the freight hold</i>!
<i>This is the freight hold</i>!

29
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,807
This is Spike. What's going on?

30
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:26,192
<i>They're gone</i>! <i>They've both disappeared</i>!

31
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,778
<i>Send backup</i>!<i>Send backup immediately</i>!

32
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:32,130
Calm down! What happened?
What happened?!

33
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,680
Stop! Stay back!

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,391
Stop! Stop! Stop!!

35
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,930
I must refuse.

36
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,382
What obligation do you think we are under,

37
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:35,558
that we must assist you in
carrying out your retaliation?

38
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,861
Well...

39
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,812
That outsider, that guy named
Firo, is having his run of the place--

40
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,955
You, who are not even members of the family,

41
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,165
do not need to worry
about our business affairs.

42
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,918
Then, how about this, Luck-<i>san</i>?

43
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,817
If you'd be willing to help us out,
we will join your organization.

44
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:01,135
That's not a bad offer, right?

45
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:06,708
Listen, Dallas-<i>san</i>, tell me the truth,

46
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:13,105
have you ever wondered why we
haven't ever reached out to you before?

47
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,932
You don't think that we
have turned a blind eye

48
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:24,742
to your impudent conduct
because we were afraid of you, do you?

49
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,148
I'm going to say this clearly for you.

50
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:30,278
The reason we haven't
invited you into our organization

51
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:33,668
is because we haven't seen
an ounce of worth in it for us.

52
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,242
Because of all of the muggings
that you have been perpetrating,

53
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:41,248
the attention of the police has
been drawn toward your direction.

54
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:43,344
That's why we haven't gotten involved.

55
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,016
That's all that people
like you are good for, at best.

56
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,298
What do you know about us?

57
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,689
I know that you got
the snot beaten out of you

58
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,401
by a young man who clearly
looked younger than all of you.

59
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,028
Why, you--

60
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,444
Ber--

61
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:05,898
Luck, who are these ill-mannered runts?

62
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,285
No one I know.

63
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,216
Huh?

64
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,181
Liquor?

65
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,264
Beats me.

66
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,608
Okay, Mary, you get in here.

67
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,358
You'll be able to hide in here by yourself.

68
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,528
But Czes-<i>kun</i>, what about you?

69
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,988
I'm going to go on
ahead and check things out.

70
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:03,793
Mary, you stay hidden in here.
Be absolutely sure not to move.

71
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:07,136
It's okay. I'll be right back, okay?

72
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,053
<i>That takes care of the kid being underfoot.</i>

73
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,524
<i>Now I just have to find the immortals.</i>

74
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:37,791
Jacuzzi?!

75
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,028
Nick! You're all right!

76
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,492
Yeah, I got all muddled up.

77
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:44,452
Where did the lookouts go?

78
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:48,094
Uh, I'm not even sure about that.

79
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,157
Thank you, fuck you, the villain arrives!

80
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:58,672
Huh? There aren't any lookouts, are there?

81
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:00,106
That's no fun.

82
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:05,388
Be that as it may, though,
thank goodness you're safe, Lua!

83
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:07,238
She made it, Ladd.

84
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,728
H-Hey! Untie my ropes, too!

85
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:16,414
Huh? Why? Something in it for me?

86
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,402
If you were a woman,
I'd expect a kiss or something,

87
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:22,211
but you're a man!

88
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,828
Or instead, what if you were to die like this?

89
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,328
In fact, die.

90
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:30,487
Your fate is to die!

91
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,122
Who was that guy?

92
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:33,556
Search me.

93
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,392
J-Jacuzzi...

94
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,571
I found you!

95
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,018
No screaming allowed.
I hate to do this to you, Ladd,

96
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:38,795
but it'd be okay if
<i>I</i> got this little girl, right?

97
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:44,251
Unlike Ladd, I only like to
torture weak people to death--

98
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,918
There they are! Those are the guys!

99
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,078
Yo! Those guys are
here with you, are they?

100
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,633
Jacuzzi-<i>kun</i>?

101
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,498
How do you know my name?

102
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:38,708
Whoops... Did I neglect to introduce myself?

103
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,628
I'm Ladd Russo.

104
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:44,775
Now you understand how
I know who you are, right?

105
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:49,150
Russo... You're a member of the Russo Family?

106
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,154
What do you all think you're
doing, being aboard this train?

107
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,865
Or rather, who do you think you are?

108
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,898
We are going to be taking
complete control of this train,

109
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:03,318
or kill off half of the passengers,

110
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:06,208
or, depending on the
circumstances, kill off all of them.

111
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,238
If you're not planning on being killed by us,

112
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,504
then hop off and die, right now!

113
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,049
Are you the ones that killed the conductor?

114
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,553
The conductor... has been killed?

115
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,809
Let's go, to the conductor's compartment.

116
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,922
You're lucky.

117
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:29,655
At the moment,
we don't have time to deal with you.

118
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,985
And this is no time for us
to be dealing with you, either.

119
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:37,156
But later, we're going to make sure you pay.

120
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,577
Oh, you're pretty tough, aren't you, crybaby?

121
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,830
Let me just tell you,

122
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:49,501
we're not the ones who got
to the conductor, or that room.

123
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,716
Are you just letting them go, Jacuzzi?

124
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,137
For now. There's someone else
we have to take care of first.

125
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:27,232
That hit-and-run bastard!
Next time we meet, it's gonna be brutal!

126
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,457
Brutal!

127
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,631
I'll hit it!

128
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,341
You'll break your hand!

129
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:38,008
Then, I'll hit the one driving it!

130
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,828
How are you going
to pull him out of there?

131
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,681
Then, I'll spit on the car!

132
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,100
That's perfect!

133
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,598
What are we going to do, Dallas?
We can't take on the Gandors.

134
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:59,558
Shut up! Damn that miserable punk Firo!

135
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:05,478
Just you watch. Someday, we're
gonna kill him <i>and</i> the Gandors!

136
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:09,192
Still, your family is loaded, right?

137
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:13,322
Can't you come up with some idle money?

138
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:17,532
They said it all went to a burglar, last month.

139
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,908
That's cold.

140
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,208
Even so, you've at least
got something to eat, right?

141
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,512
There's that cute sister of yours.

142
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,502
--You stay away from Eve.
--H-Hey...

143
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:31,132
You do anything to her, and I'll make you pay.

144
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,104
A-All right!

145
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,507
Now then, our journey is just about at its end.

146
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:44,602
It's been a long one, huh?

147
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:45,688
Yeah.

148
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:49,528
At the beginning, we were time thieves.

149
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,623
When we stole those watches, right?

150
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,408
There was that time when we
tried to steal that whole museum, too!

151
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:57,532
That was impossible, huh?

152
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,213
Yeah.

153
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,467
So, to at least keep anyone else from going in,

154
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,828
we stole the entrance!

155
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,054
That was heavy, huh?

156
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,838
What made us reconsider our ways,
and decide to do good from then on,

157
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:12,462
was when we stole the
inheritance of that rich man.

158
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:15,048
Now there won't be a
fight over the inheritance, huh?

159
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:18,178
I'm sure they're thanking us right about now.

160
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:19,547
And so...

161
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,667
since it feels so good to do good things,

162
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,257
let's do something good for our last job!

163
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,312
Like what?

164
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:29,022
We're going to steal the mafia's black money!

165
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:32,873
Yay! Isaac, you're so cool!

166
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,448
Hey, now, watch out!

167
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,752
Watch out!

168
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,004
What did you say?!

169
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,808
That's Eve Genoard, right?

170
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:04,222
So it seems.

171
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:05,531
Call her down.

172
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,438
How do I do that?

173
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,244
It's your job to figure that out, isn't it?

174
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,714
Want some?

175
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:22,423
No!

176
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,137
All right.

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,127
Yes, Genoard residence.

178
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,671
From the newspaper?

179
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:05,674
Yeah.

180
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,970
They says they got somethin' to say
to you, Miss, 'bout Master Dallas.

181
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,748
About Big Brother?

182
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:14,850
Somethin' 'bout havin'
new information, or such.

183
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,468
Thing is, it can't be over the phone.

184
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:23,984
They says it gotta be in
person, or they can't tell you.

185
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,363
Then let's go over to the newspaper.

186
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,384
Jacuzzi...

187
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:40,018
How did that much blood get up there?

188
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,576
Hey, guys.

189
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,621
There's something up on the forward coupling.

190
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,167
Guys, let's all take a look on "go."

191
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,132
Ready, set...

192
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:19,141
Is that... the Rail Tracer?

193
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,263
What's with you, girlie? You're dressed funny--

194
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:27,612
A-All right! I'll let them go! So lay off of me!

195
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,504
You're the one I have business with.

196
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,328
Amazing! You got them, all by yourself!

197
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,737
Incredible!

198
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:38,637
--Thank you!
--Thank you!

199
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,458
Imagine, you helping us, total strangers!

200
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,018
We owe you our lives, missy!

201
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,882
Be careful. Why did you hit them?

202
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,877
I'm terribly sorry.

203
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:52,275
They suddenly ran out into the street.

204
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,678
Ask us for anything!

205
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,196
We'll do anything for you!

206
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,864
Well...

207
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,996
could you help me carry
these four back to my car?

208
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,041
Kindapped? Miss Eve?

209
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,925
Yes, sir.

210
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,988
We just received word.

211
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:14,242
I told you so! What do you
plan to do about it?! Huh?

212
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:19,636
Now, Gustavo probably isn't thinking of
doing anything to Miss Eve right away.

213
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,832
Elean-<i>kun</i>, calm down.

214
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,753
But sir!

215
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:27,172
What concerns me is the
company's responsibility

216
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:31,132
in fanning the conflict between
the Gandors and the Runoratas.

217
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:35,250
Nicholas-<i>kun</i>, you have
considered that, haven't you?

218
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,587
Yes. I'm taking every precaution
to see that it doesn't happen.

219
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:42,492
See that you do. Now, go on.

220
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:52,227
Mr. President, I'm sure from his
face that he's plotting something!

221
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:56,089
I know. Nicholas-<i>kun</i> is probably...

222
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,748
...intentionally driving
Gustavo toward the Gandors,

223
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:02,845
and hoping to uncover some dirt.

224
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,349
He probably wants to find out
some top-secret facts, in his own way.

225
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,313
Mr. President, are you
saying I should leave it alone?

226
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,802
Top-secret facts notwithstanding,

227
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:17,638
there is a lot about
Dallas Genoard that is unclear.

228
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:21,547
Has he really become immortal, or hasn't he?

229
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:25,619
If something is cleared up
because of this, it's just what we want.

230
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,807
Besides, there is the threat
of conflict between the Gandors

231
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:34,227
and the Runoratas
without us doing anything at all.

232
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,837
How do you mean?

233
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:40,940
The legendary assassin,
Vino, a.k.a. Claire Stanfield,

234
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,344
is headed toward New York.

235
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,248
Word is, at the behest of Luck Gandor.

236
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:46,208
Vino...

237
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,462
Aboard the transcontinental
express out of Chicago,

238
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,603
the <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

239
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,392
Doesn't look like I'd get
much knowledge out of him

240
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:05,242
if I <i>did</i> devour him,

241
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,161
but I've brought it on myself.

242
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,017
Ennis...

243
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,039
Yes, sir.

244
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:07,501
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

245
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:21,682
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

246
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:33,278
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

247
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:40,282
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

248
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:47,328
<i>I believe so</i>

249
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:54,378
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

250
00:23:54,378 --> 00:24:01,888
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

251
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:08,558
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

252
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:18,614
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

253
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,925
<i>Miria, everything is going to start</i>!

254
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,384
<i>The beginning, huh?</i>

255
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,975
<i>Uh, "Ad-wee-na..."</i>

256
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:31,554
<i>It's "Ad-weh-na."</i>

257
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,264
<i>Oh, right."Ad-wee-na... A-wehss</i>

258
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,771
<i>You've reversed it, Isaac.</i>

259
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,938
<i>"A-weh-nass... Ad-na..."</i>
