<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,020
Big Brother.

4
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,020
Did Li Jing have you
come here to kill me?

5
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,920
Big Brother, I'm here to get you out.

6
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,230
You're awake.

7
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,320
Xuan Nu?

8
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,110
It's me.

9
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:31,790
Where exactly have you been
for the last 70,000 years?

10
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,181
A-Yin again?

11
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:38,061
It's been 70,000 years! Why are you still
thinking of that celestial immortal?

12
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,721
So what if she's a celestial immortal?

13
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,911
The 3,000 women in my harem
don't even measure up to her finger.

14
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,781
What exactly has A-Yin done for you?

15
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,110
She only uses you.

16
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,121
Even after Mo Yuan died, she used your
love for her to ask for the soul jade.

17
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,571
My lord.

18
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,641
Shouldn't you be in the Arctic Lands?

19
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,730
The princess took Li Yuan away.

20
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,100
What did you say?

21
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,480
Princess had the military seal.

22
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,170
I didn't dare to stop her. I could
only come here to report it to you.

23
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,500
Why would Yan Zhi have my military seal?

24
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,841
My military seal was put in...

25
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,540
Did you take my military seal?

26
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,841
She asked me for it.

27
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,120
How can you give away
something as important

28
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,521
as the military seal
just because she asked!

29
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,790
Do you know that Li Yuan got taken away!

30
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,161
You dote on her so much that I thought...

31
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,430
She wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

32
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,490
Li Yuan's mother is
from the mermaid clan.

33
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,461
He will definitely flee to the Chang Sea.

34
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,821
If the mermaid clan revolts
and the ghost realm goes into chaos

35
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,240
I'll make you pay for it!

36
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,821
Anyone there!

37
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,100
- My Lord.
- Tell all the generals quickly.

38
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,920
Rebel Li Yuan was
rescued by the princess.

39
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,560
He is probably heading to the Chang Sea.

40
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,091
Hurry and go arrest the criminal.

41
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,951
- Yes.
- Wait.

42
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,810
This matter can't get out.

43
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,000
The Nine Heavens must not know about it.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,901
You must do this secretly.

45
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,471
Yes.

46
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,771
Aren't you afraid that my old bones
aren't suitable for cloud leaping?

47
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,380
I came running here step by step.

48
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,901
Where's Su Jin?

49
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,060
She went to serve tea to those generals.

50
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,940
I don't think she'll be here
for a while.

51
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
Hurry and go.

52
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,901
Anyone there?

53
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,901
Here.

54
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,730
No one is to come in
without my permission.

55
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,120
Yes.

56
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,180
Your Highness.

57
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,091
I need to go see His Highness.

58
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,100
His Highness said that
no one is allowed to go in.

59
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,201
Your Highness,
Su Jin would like to see you.

60
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,401
Su Jin would like to see Your Highness.

61
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,620
<i>This Su Jin...</i>

62
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,480
<i>Didn't she go to serve tea?
Why is she here all of a sudden?</i>

63
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,360
<i>What should I do?</i>

64
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,701
<i>If I don't respond, and she gets
suspicious and tells Heavenly Lord</i>

65
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,341
<i>then we're done for.</i>

66
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,550
Your Highness.

67
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:47,180
His Highness usually
doesn't go to bed this early.

68
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,290
Is he's feeling sick?

69
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,360
Shouldn't someone go check on him?

70
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,350
Your Highness, please leave. When
His Highness doesn't want to see anyone

71
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,471
I'm afraid only
Heavenly Lord can make him.

72
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,591
Don't you think it's strange?

73
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:05,511
If His Highness doesn't want to see me,
there should be some response.

74
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:09,841
Maybe His Highness... didn't hear you.

75
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:15,980
Your Highness, did you see?
His Highness blew out the candle.

76
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm afraid he's telling us
that he's going to rest.

77
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,430
Your Highness,
you know His Highness best.

78
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,730
If he doesn't want to say anything,
he won't say anything for the whole day.

79
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,620
Since he's blown out his candle

80
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,061
I'm afraid that means he doesn't
want you to disturb him anymore.

81
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,230
Take care of His Highness.

82
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,860
Don't be negligent.

83
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,561
Yes.

84
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,341
This isn't a long-term solution.

85
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,081
As the crown prince
of the Celestial Tribe

86
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:16,571
if Ye Hua locks himself
in his room every day

87
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,270
he'll be caught eventually.

88
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,880
Su Su!

89
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:39,110
Where did she go?

90
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,150
Ye Hua.

91
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm back.

92
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:04,630
Do you know that you've been gone
for over half a year?

93
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,620
You left without saying anything.

94
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,191
Was something a matter of life and death?

95
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:14,221
No.

96
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:19,671
No?

97
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,160
Do you know that you've been gone
for over half a year?

98
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,600
You want me to drop this
by just answering no?

99
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,250
I had something
important to take care of.

100
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:35,541
What's so important that you couldn't
have told me about it before leaving?

101
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,971
It's my bad.

102
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:46,490
Do you know that everything
about you is good

103
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,760
except that you never tell me everything.

104
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,360
So I can never completely
know everything about you.

105
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,750
No matter how much I tell you

106
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,270
it's fine as long as you trust me.

107
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,431
Okay. I lose.

108
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,791
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

109
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,530
But if you just take on
all these burdens yourself

110
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,260
it makes me think I'm not your wife.

111
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,240
Look at you.
You're not saying anything again.

112
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,431
You taciturn person, I'm not mad anymore.

113
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:40,020
Can't you just coax me?

114
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,250
It's my fault.

115
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:52,640
You... You disappeared
for over half a year.

116
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,451
All you can say is that it's your fault.

117
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:59,801
You're the only one in this world.

118
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:07,081
Were you hurt?

119
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:11,841
No. There are very few people
in this world that can hurt me.

120
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,270
Liar.

121
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,721
Why?

122
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,510
On the day I first met you

123
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,591
you were dripping with
blood in front of my house.

124
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,860
That day was an exception.

125
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,671
Su Su.

126
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,400
I have to go.

127
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:58,730
Ye Hua, you're leaving again?

128
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:01,931
How long will you be gone for this time?

129
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,400
One year.

130
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,880
Or maybe two years.

131
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,961
One or two years?

132
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,961
Do you know how long one or two years is?

133
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,360
When I married you back then

135
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,951
I just wanted you to
always be by my side.

136
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:35,071
I can't believe that
after half a year of bliss

137
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:38,350
I've had to go years without seeing you.

138
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,500
It's fine.

139
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,711
It's just two years.

140
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,191
I can wait.

141
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,441
Go.

142
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:01,081
I'll give you something.

143
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,341
Take this copper mirror.

144
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,681
If you speak into it

145
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:22,561
I'll be able to hear it
no matter where I am.

146
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:26,280
If I'm not busy,
I'll be able to talk to you.

147
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,191
Ye Hua.

148
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,880
Before you came here

149
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,630
I lived on this mountain alone.

150
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,370
I didn't think much about it.

151
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,951
But now that we're already married

152
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,681
please don't make me
keep waiting for you.

153
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,591
If I wait too long

154
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:57,850
I'll get angry.

155
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm really scared that one day

156
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,000
you'll lie drenched in blood
before the grass hut.

157
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,551
What would I do then?

158
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,240
Su Su.

159
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,740
If I had nothing,
would you still be with me?

160
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:30,270
Besides the sword in the corner

161
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,061
you don't have anything anyway.

162
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:38,880
And I only use that sword to chop wood.

163
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,390
I can't use it for much.

164
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,591
I'm still with you.

165
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:48,921
That's true. You've never left me.

166
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:57,701
Close your eyes.

167
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,070
Wait for me to come back.

168
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,080
Ye Hua.

169
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:22,671
Ye Hua!

170
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,121
Ye Hua!

171
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,040
Ye Hua!

172
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,760
You're back so soon.

173
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,961
It's a long night.
You still have a few hours.

174
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:02,800
You could spend a few more months,
with her in the mortal world.

175
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,931
I just got rid of Su Jin,
and you've come back.

176
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,181
This is celestial land.

177
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:12,911
If they find out that I disappeared using
my magic, things might get complicated.

178
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:15,000
That's true.

179
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,631
Hurry and get some rest.

180
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,750
After we meet with the generals
tomorrow, they'll probably leave.

181
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,060
Have you really thought it through?

182
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,340
You're going to fake your death?

183
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,800
I've thought about it all night,
comparing all the options.

184
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,851
Although faking my death
is the most dangerous option

185
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:56,830
it's the only permanent option.

186
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,040
If I want to be with Su Su

187
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,250
I'll have to trick all the immortals
into believing that I'm dead.

188
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,510
Only then can I protect her life

189
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,151
and our love can have a happy ending.

190
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,490
It's very difficult to
deceive the Heavenly Lord.

191
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,840
That's why I have to fake
my death before many eyes.

192
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,661
I can't let Heavenly Lord
have any doubts.

193
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:28,010
Now, there's a good
opportunity before us.

194
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,260
- What opportunity?
- The mermaid clan.

195
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,351
You want to fake your death during
the war with the mermaid clan?

196
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,730
It's a golden opportunity to escape.

197
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,280
Are you determined to do this?

198
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,780
Ye Hua, you're not an ordinary citizen.

199
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,901
You're the crown prince
of the Celestial Tribe.

200
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,681
If you fake your death,
it means that you abandon the tribe.

201
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,520
I am the crown prince,
but I'm also her husband.

202
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
If the Celestial Tribe loses Ye Hua

203
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,961
someone else will inherit
the crown prince position.

204
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,951
But if I don't get out
of this situation now

205
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:06,111
someone will discover
her existence eventually.

206
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:10,000
When that happens,
Heavenly Lord won't let her off easy.

207
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,921
Looks like this isn't
just an infatuation.

208
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,381
You're very serious about her.

209
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:21,230
If I need to choose between her life,
and my position as the crown prince

210
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,300
I only want her.

211
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,030
But in order to fulfill
my duty as crown prince

212
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,421
I will definitely get them to send troops
to pacify the mermaid clan's revolt.

213
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,240
That's the last thing
I can do for Heavenly Lord

214
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,471
and Celestial Tribe as the crown prince.

215
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,881
Generals, it's been 70,000
years since I've seen you.

216
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,280
Third Prince, I trust you've
been well since we last met.

217
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,830
I've been doing very well.

218
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,500
Your Highness.

219
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:11,391
I didn't expect Your Highness to
come with Su Jin to give offerings

220
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:14,381
and to visit useless generals like us.

221
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,760
What a surprise.

222
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,090
You are all my elders.

223
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,131
This isn't the Celestial Palace.
Don't be mired by etiquette.

224
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:25,560
Heavenly Lord wanted me to come
to become closer to you all.

225
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,681
There's no crown prince here today.

226
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:31,050
I will address you all as uncles.

227
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,361
Your Highness, you can
just be straightforward.

228
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,230
This is because of the
mermaid clan, right?

229
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,340
I heard the mermaid clan, supporters of
the Ghost Tribe, are getting restless.

230
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,861
What? Will there be
another armed rebellion?

231
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:50,090
That's right.
Then I won't beat around the bush.

232
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,090
Let's go and have a chat.

233
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,060
I'll have fine wine and food for you all.

234
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,361
Okay. Let's go eat and drink
and hear you out about those traitors.

235
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,020
- This way.
- This way.

236
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,161
I always heard that you looked
very much like the God of War, Mo Yuan.

237
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:28,891
Now that I've seen you,
it is indeed the case.

238
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,971
When I saw you, I thought
Mo Yuan had come back.

239
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,111
You can't say that.

240
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:38,020
His Highness is someone who became
a high immortal at the age of 20,000.

241
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,611
For our Celestial Tribe, that's rare.

242
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,661
That's right! Even Mo Yuan was 25,000
when he became a high immortal.

243
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,441
Your Highness is on another level.

244
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:55,240
Yes, that's right. I was being silly.

245
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,871
If someone looks even remotely
like His Highness and Mo Yuan

246
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:02,330
it means they're destined to
stand out from the masses.

247
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,721
That you all mistakenly
think I was Mo Yuan

248
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:12,171
speaks volumes about
his place in your heart.

249
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:17,371
I haven't had any military merits,
so I can't accept your praise.

250
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,351
Your Highness, it really pains me
to hear you talk about him.

251
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:30,441
I really miss Mo Yuan.

252
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,520
Yes.

253
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,040
I will never forget his charms.

254
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:43,760
Back then, you all followed Mo Yuan
in times of peace and war.

255
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,131
You all have outstanding military merits.

256
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:52,480
But now that our world is at peace and
Mo Yuan has returned to nothingness

257
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,661
are you still inclined
to protect our world?

258
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,840
I won't hide it from you all.

259
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,310
On the surface, I'm here
to ask that you send troops

260
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,691
to help us against the mermaid clan.

261
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:13,760
But I'm actually here
to strengthen the friendship

262
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,671
between the Celestial Tribe
and each of your clans.

263
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:25,780
You're funny. Even though
we fight for our clans

264
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,471
we're all still Celestials.
Isn't that right?

265
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,280
The friendship is still there.

266
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,980
Yes.

267
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,351
It's still there.

268
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,681
Even though the friendship is still there

269
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,070
your hearts are far from it.

270
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,520
You are all my elders.

271
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,560
Please forgive me for
being so forthright.

272
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,631
After the war of the four seas,
Dong Hua Dijun gave up his position

273
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:05,101
to the current Heavenly Lord.

274
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:09,401
You were all unhappy about that

275
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:14,040
and that's why you're more
loyal to your clans now.

276
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,780
Am I right?

277
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,621
It's been a long time since then.

278
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:21,601
You've made it sound so serious.

279
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:25,980
We're all so old now.
We've forgotten all about past events.

280
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,131
Yes, we've forgotten.

281
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,441
You're right.

282
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:37,711
I'm willing to believe
that this is all in the past.

283
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,641
Don't worry, Your Highness.

284
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,861
We are of one mind with the Nine Heavens.

285
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,111
Back when the Celestial Tribe
was at war with the Ghost Tribe

286
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,840
we were at the front line.

287
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,681
For our world, the entire Su Jin clan
willingly sacrificed themselves as bait.

288
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,340
Your Highness,
you heard about that, right?

289
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,381
I have.

290
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:01,391
I've not only heard about it,
but I've also kept it in my heart.

291
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,121
Although the Celestial Tribe won
the war 70,000 years ago

292
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,881
we paid a painful price for it.

293
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,300
Not just the Su Jin clan

294
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,300
but 2,000 people from your clan died.

295
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,230
And over half of the young adults
from your clan died.

296
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,330
As for you, Uncle...

297
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Even woman from
your clan fought in the war.

298
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,010
1,760 people died.

299
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,000
The sacrifice that these comrades made...

300
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:55,020
I know about them.

301
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:06,750
Here I'd like to make a toast to you

302
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,221
and the heroes who died.

303
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

304
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,000
I would like to ask you all something.

305
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:26,421
Why did Mo Yuan sacrifice
his soul 70,000 years ago?

306
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:28,891
Do you all remember?

307
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,740
Of course it was for our world.

308
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,230
That's right. It was for our world.

309
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,020
Although he was the son of
Heavenly Father and the God of War

310
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,421
Mo Yuan was willing to sacrifice his life
to seal the Bell of the East Emperor.

311
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:46,570
He did it for this land and the
hundreds of thousands of immortals.

312
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,191
Now, I want the mermaid clan to surrender

313
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:54,151
for the same reason:
for the people of our land.

314
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,941
I earnestly request that you all let go
of your animosity

315
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,980
and give me your troops.

316
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,810
I will attack the mermaid clan
to return our world to peace.

317
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,730
Seeing Your Highness today,
you are indeed a capable and wise man.

318
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,300
You truly uphold your reputation.

319
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,730
But ever since the war against Qing Cang,
my clan has been discouraged.

320
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,030
What His Highness just said

321
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,230
made me remember my father and clansmen.

322
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:18,780
Everyone, I ask that you don't forget

323
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,441
that my father and clan

324
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:27,901
willingly died to protect the Celestial
Tribe and the world 70,000 years ago.

325
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:32,861
I ask that you all to
let bygones be bygones

326
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:37,911
and fight alongside His Highness
to protect our world.

327
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:41,840
It would also allow my father
to rest in peace.

328
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,421
Okay! We will trust Your Highness.

329
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:55,770
That's right. That's right!

330
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,030
We're good men. Why should we
hesitate because of the past?

331
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,060
If there's something we want to do,
we should do it.

332
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,530
That's right. Our troops can be deployed
at any time. We await your command.

333
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,441
Good.

334
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:10,881
I thank you all for your trust.

335
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,371
The mermaid clan has been causing trouble
in Chang Sea for thousands of years.

336
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,500
I will pacify the armed
rebellion within half a month.

337
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,911
I toast to you.

338
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,361
During the battle,
I will be at the front line.

339
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,121
We pledge our lives
to follow Your Highness!

340
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:58,820
You Highness, do you know the reason why

341
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,911
the mermaid clan is causing
trouble at Chang Sea?

342
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,951
I heard that

343
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:07,820
the admiral of the Chang Sea navy is not
a good leader and has a weak personality.

344
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,560
So it has led the mermaid clan
to strengthen, causing disaster.

345
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,351
That's right. It's because of the
Water King of Chang Sea's indulgence.

346
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:20,260
That's why Your Highness must find
a good assistant before you go.

347
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,530
An assistant?

348
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,590
For the past thousands of years,
the Water King of Chang Sea

349
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,641
would often ask the second prince
of Water King of West Sea for help.

350
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:29,780
Back in the day, the second prince
was Mo Yuan's disciple.

351
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,080
Ever since Kunlun Mountain was abandoned

352
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,070
he left to search for
his master and Seventeenth.

353
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,681
Whenever Chang Sea was
in a state of emergency

354
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:40,111
he would lead troops there to help.

355
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:43,550
He has already fought with
the Mermaid Clan multiple times.

356
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,030
Mo Yuan's disciple?

357
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,711
Mo Yuan's senior disciple, Die Feng.

358
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,990
Die Feng.

359
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,681
I've heard Father mention him before.
I got it.

360
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:56,520
Recently, I've heard that
Water King of Chang Sea

361
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,951
wants to marry one of his daughters
to the Mermaid King to preserve peace.

362
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:03,101
If you want to start a war

363
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:05,800
the Water King could be an obstacle.

364
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,721
I'm afraid that if we lead troops there

365
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,800
the Water King might speak
up for the mermaid clan

366
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,861
then we'd look really bad.

367
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:20,361
Before we start the war,
I will go meet the Water King.

368
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:22,300
I've said all that I should say.

369
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,161
I won't disturb you anymore.

370
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,681
I will take my leave.

371
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,730
Su Su.

372
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:46,701
You're there.
I thought the copper mirror was broken.

373
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,030
It wasn't a convenient time
to talk just now.

374
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,921
It's nothing much.

375
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:57,320
I just wanted to ask you what
you wanted to eat when you came back.

376
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,881
I'll prepare it for you.

377
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,070
Su Su.

378
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,840
What?

379
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,191
Just be honest.

380
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,270
Are you angry?

381
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,621
No. I'm playing with my bird.

382
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,891
I don't feel like bickering with you.

383
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,891
I wish you'd bicker with me more.

384
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:31,040
Why?

385
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,800
If you bicker with me more,
then you'd talk to me more.

386
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,730
Ye Hua, I thought about something today.

387
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,060
I want to discuss it with you.

388
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,800
What is it?

389
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,691
I thought...

390
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:04,310
If... If we had a child
who could stay by my side

391
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,770
then I wouldn't be afraid
of you leaving all the time.

392
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,860
But I was scared that
you wouldn't like children.

393
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,050
So I wanted to discuss it with you.

394
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:24,860
It's okay if you don't like children.

395
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,581
Really.

396
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:29,900
Without children,
it's more peaceful and quiet.

397
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:33,990
Do you want a boy or girl?

398
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,001
Huh?

399
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:39,900
Tell me when I come back.

400
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,530
Okay.

401
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:56,090
Heavenly Lord.

402
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,731
You may leave for now.

403
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,581
Yes.

404
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,960
I asked you to come here
because I wanted to ask about

405
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,860
what happened during the
meeting you went to with Su Jin.

406
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,920
What happened?

407
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,081
After meeting with those generals

408
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:33,911
what are your thoughts on the
situation with the Mermaid Clan?

409
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:36,751
I would like to go to Chang Sea.

410
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,150
You want to go to Chang Sea?

411
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,221
Yes. I want to go to Chang Sea
to meet the Water King

412
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:48,621
to see if he is as the rumors say

413
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:50,860
backing down to the Mermaid Clan
and giving them his land.

414
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:56,570
Secondly, I want to watch Mermaid
Clan's every move from Chang Sea

415
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,320
in order to find the opportunity
to start the war against them.

416
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,791
We have to resolve this situation with
the Mermaid Clan eventually.

417
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:10,960
But isn't it too early
to start a war now?

418
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,550
I think it's better to
do it soon rather than later.

419
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,141
We should catch them off guard.

420
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,681
That's how we can win.

421
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:30,010
Okay. I will allow you
to go to Chang Sea.

422
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,101
Yes.

423
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,601
As the crown prince
of the Celestial Tribe

424
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:38,960
going to your own land to see
the local conditions and customs

425
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,681
shouldn't raise any suspicions.

426
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:47,871
But Ye Hua, the mermaid clan has been
a danger to Chang Sea for 70,000 years.

427
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,731
It's called a danger because
it's a perennial problem.

428
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:53,471
So you can't rush things.

429
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:55,380
I think so too.

430
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,400
So I don't want to go there
this time as the crown prince.

431
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,871
You want to go undercover?

432
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,070
It's what Your Majesty
is worried about too.

433
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,460
Although Chang Sea is our territory

434
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,871
and the mermaid clan is a problem for us

435
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm going there this time
to find an opportunity

436
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,030
to break all ties between Water King
of Chang Sea and the mermaid clan.

437
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,030
If we have Water King
request for our troops

438
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,920
then we can send our troops
righteously and properly.

439
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,590
That's true. You've thought
about things meticulously.

440
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,010
I haven't interfered with the
mermaid clan situation

441
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,110
because I was afraid the other
water kings would get suspicious

442
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,190
that the Celestial Tribe is using
the mermaid clan as an excuse

443
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,280
to take away their authority,
starting with Chang Sea.

444
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,590
I understand.

445
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,740
Okay. Then we'll do as you say.

446
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,420
Yes.

447
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,510
Dijun?

448
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,931
Have you seen Si Ming?

449
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,231
No.

450
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:30,311
What are you eating?

451
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,650
Fruits.

452
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,510
Who gave them to you?

453
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,420
Who exactly gave them to you?

454
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,911
I think it was Cheng Yu.

455
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:00,201
You dare to eat food
that she has given you?

456
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:18,831
There are so many fruits that
I can't finish them all anyway.

457
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,780
Dijun, have one.

458
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,840
Judging from the way you look now

459
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,371
you probably don't even
know what I'm saying.

460
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,161
Dijun, honestly...

461
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,670
I like you.

462
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,420
I like you so much.

463
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,190
Even if you didn't tell me

464
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,460
I would still know that.

465
00:39:54,411 --> 00:40:00,721
I... I heard the views at Taichen Palace
are especially amazing.

466
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:04,701
But I've been living at
Taichen Palace the whole time.

467
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,130
How come I've never realized that?

468
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,360
When you're free, you can ask
Si Ming to take you around.

469
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,291
You don't have to waste your time on
worthless activities with me, an old man.

470
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,510
You're not old.

471
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:27,530
When I was the heavenly lord,
your grandfather wasn't even married yet.

472
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,481
So you dislike that I'm younger than you.

473
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:48,701
All right, sit here
and don't mess around.

474
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,291
I'll get two celestial swans
to take you home.

475
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:59,431
No. If I go back,
Crown Prince's cousin will yell at me.

476
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,090
Does she yell at you often?

477
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,710
Yes.

478
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:19,880
Let's go. It's none of our business.

479
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,081
Why?

480
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:24,951
You write the mortals' stories every day.

481
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:27,460
You don't get it?

482
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,880
The little princess is dazed right now.

483
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,831
Everything she says will just make
others fall for her charms.

484
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:42,201
I'm sure there will be some sparks
between her and that old Dijun.

485
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:47,561
Oh! You sealed the deal with Third Prince
back then after giving him that to eat.

486
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:50,010
Right? Right?

487
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,541
Don't talk to me about that wanderer!

488
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,951
I won't, I won't.

489
