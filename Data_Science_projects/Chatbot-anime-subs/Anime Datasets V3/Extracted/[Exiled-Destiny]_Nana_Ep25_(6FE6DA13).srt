1
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:06,303
During the two weeks
that Nana was gone,

2
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:10,343
I took on extra work,
so I'd be busy every day,

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:13,053
and worked until I was
absolutely exhausted.

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,543
I did this to keep my mind off
of how lonely I was.

5
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:20,323
Yet I went to the practice sessions
at the studio without fail.

6
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:24,053
Then Nobu would always
walk me home.

7
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,833
I hadn't heard from Takumi at all.

8
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:45,653
Blinking eyes call the wind

9
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:53,293
A smile clears all the noise away

10
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:59,863
The angel in your eyes whispers

11
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:05,043
"Everything begins now"

12
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:07,273
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

13
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:11,083
It's like being caught in a wave

14
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,253
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

15
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,723
Breath held, arms reaching out

16
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:23,953
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

17
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:28,593
You're the only one I can see

18
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:32,533
Baby my wish on a wing

19
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:35,503
This sky is torn

20
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:40,903
By a single overflowing word

21
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,793
I'm thinking about going on a trip.

22
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,333
Hey, that sounds nice.

23
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,663
Buy me a gift from wherever
you're going.

24
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,373
I'm finished.

25
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:18,503
Where do you wanna go?

26
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:20,443
Go on your own.

27
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,813
You might have the time,
but I'm busy.

28
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,513
Take some time off work.

29
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,353
We have an important concert
coming up,

30
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:27,683
so I hafta practice every day.

31
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,753
What's that?
Are you on the pill again?

32
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,033
It's your fault!
If you want a child that badly,

33
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,363
have some other woman
give birth to one for you.

34
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,593
You don't mind if I slept
with another woman?

35
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,103
You're such a cold woman.

36
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:43,833
You just realized that now?

37
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:48,603
I'm gonna go write a song.

38
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:50,713
For the cute Reira.

39
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,193
Oh, Shin. You're awake.

40
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,253
Good morning, Miss Ryoko.

41
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,823
I'll be flying out again tomorrow.
To the States.

42
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,173
So I won't be seeing you for
a while.

43
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:22,203
But I'll bring back a bunch of gifts.
You can keep your hopes high.

44
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,573
So you'll be going.

45
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:26,373
I'll be lonely without you,
Miss Ryoko.

46
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,883
Oh, my. You're not only good
with your technique,

47
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,513
you've also improved
your choice of words.

48
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,853
Perhaps it's due to
my great teaching skills.

49
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:36,083
I am grateful.
Thanks to you, business is thriving.

50
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,293
I've turned an angel into a devil.

51
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:45,433
Upon a closer look,

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,063
I guess you don't look much
like her, after all.

53
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,163
Huh? What?

54
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,633
No. Nothing. Seconds please?

55
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:01,883
Yasu!

56
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:04,853
Long time no see.

57
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,823
You haven't changed
one bit. Mhm. Mhm.

58
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,423
Oh, stout beer please.
How are you doing?

59
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:12,193
I'm glad to finally meet up with you.

60
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,383
That's because you keep
pestering me.

61
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:18,163
I invited Reira too,
but she's back in her hometown.

62
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,323
She really wanted to come.

63
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:20,553
Is that so?

64
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,533
By the way, Naoki,
your voice is too loud.

65
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,403
You're a celebrity now,

66
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:25,563
so you'd be wise to keep
a low profile.

67
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,043
Not to worry.

68
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,803
The customers here are all from
the entertainment industry.

69
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:30,033
Really?

70
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:33,503
By the way, Yasu, I heard you came
to Tokyo to go pro.

71
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,253
Reira was complaining that
she's not happy with your decision.

72
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,323
Yeah, I guessed as much.
That's why I don't wanna meet her.

73
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,013
She'll keep on teasing me about it.

74
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:43,353
Well, of course she'd tease you.

75
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,693
What in the world happened to
make you change your mind?

76
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:47,693
Let's see.

77
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:51,423
You could say I feel responsible
for the band like it's my child.

78
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,533
What's that supposed to mean?
You really haven't changed, Yasu.

79
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:56,533
You need to let it
all out sometimes.

80
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,233
Go wild for a change.

81
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,663
Though I suggest not becoming
as violent as Takumi.

82
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,433
When he loses it,
he becomes a criminal.

83
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:05,783
Although he's been quite calm
as of late,

84
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,373
perhaps from fear of becoming
the next gossip item.

85
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,483
Back in junior high school,

86
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,543
none of the windows had
glass because of him.

87
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:12,943
Yeah, I remember that.

88
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,823
Speaking of Takumi,

89
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,623
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

90
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:17,613
What's he up to?

91
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,353
I don't know, but...

92
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,963
He's probably visiting women,
one after another.

93
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,723
There's no need to worry about him.

94
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,653
Is that so?

95
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,573
Reira, what are you doing?

96
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:13,833
Visiting my hometown.

97
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:15,873
Oh right. Of course.

98
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,813
You startled me.
How long have you been here?

99
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:20,113
Thirty minutes.

100
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:20,883
Huh?!

101
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,693
I've been here staring at you
like this for thirty minutes,

102
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,923
but you didn't notice me at all, Takumi.

103
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,563
It's got me exhausted.

104
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,333
No, I meant how long have
you been in town.

105
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,433
Anyway, if you've been
staring at me,

106
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,493
the least you could do
is say something!

107
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:34,893
I've been here for three days.

108
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,833
I was visiting mother's
grave just now.

109
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,433
But your mother is still alive.

110
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,003
Your mother, Takumi.

111
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,883
Due to work, you couldn't be
here for the ceremony

112
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:46,403
marking seven years after
her passing,

113
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:51,123
so I prayed that she may
warmly protect her careless son

114
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,713
from the wrath of the gods.

115
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,253
Well, thanks for that.

116
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:59,013
Is your father doing okay?
Maybe I should go and say hi.

117
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:00,093
Don't bother.

118
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,523
He's the same as always,
drinking from early in the day.

119
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,833
That's gotta be tough for
your elder sister and her husband.

120
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,163
With a little brother like this
on top of it.

121
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,033
You know, if you're gonna worry
about someone,

122
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,563
worry about your own mother!

123
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,803
Leaving her alone way out here
in the countryside.

124
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:18,543
But she says
she doesn't wanna go to Tokyo.

125
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,543
She really likes this place.

126
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,413
I don't get it.

127
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,153
What's so good about this place
way out in the country?

128
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:31,153
Especially given the fact
she lived in New York at one point.

129
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:35,933
Isn't that why?
Living abroad didn't suit her at all.

130
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,023
I've been telling her Tokyo
isn't a foreign country.

131
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:45,193
But I kinda miss New York.
It's my birthplace after all.

132
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:46,533
Why not go there?

133
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:49,143
Though we only have
two more days off.

134
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:50,603
You should've gone.

135
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,943
Hmm... But I had a number
of things to do.

136
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,313
Besides, we all should pay
our respects to our parents once in a while.

137
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:59,053
We came so close on our tour
the other day,

138
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,283
but I couldn't visit because of
our tight schedule.

139
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,423
What about you, Takumi?

140
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,583
As long as I stay in Tokyo,
I end up working.

141
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,493
So I thought I'd wander off
to the country.

142
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:08,623
Call it an escape.

143
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:13,033
But I can't keep my mind off work,
so I'll be returning now.

144
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,003
I just stopped by here for a bit.

145
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,233
Huh, you're going back?!

146
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,603
We got to meet here,
so why not have some fun together?

147
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,143
Give me a break.

148
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:26,643
Give me a chance to be alone
on our off days. See ya.

149
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:35,783
Oh, Reira...

150
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,633
We've got a photo shoot for
a magazine next week,

151
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:42,893
so don't get tanned.

152
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,293
I'm aware of that, leader.

153
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,733
What is that guy doing?

154
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:54,833
Their free time is coming to an end.

155
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,343
But I didn't contact him, either.

156
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:00,503
Why didn't you?
You've got no reason to hold back.

157
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:04,273
You should send him a bunch of
emails daily and keep his mind on you.

158
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,383
But I don't wanna contact him
only to be ignored.

159
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,453
He may be in less of a position
to contact you

160
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:10,513
once they're back to work.

161
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,823
Yes. But it's okay
if that's how it goes.

162
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:18,433
Yasu! Aren't you worried
about Hachi?!

163
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,563
Don't you get the urge to call Takumi
and give him an earful?!

164
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,893
Sure. But I can't get through
to him on his cell.

165
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:25,873
Nana!

166
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,743
If he came to see me because someone
around him told him to,

167
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:29,973
that's not gonna make me too happy!

168
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,803
I really am fine, so don't worry!

169
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,673
The way I said that...

170
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:39,653
to them it probably sounds like
I'm trying to be strong about this.

171
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,623
But the honest truth is,

172
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,953
if Takumi were to never
call me again,

173
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:46,893
I'd be fine with that.

174
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,153
Or in fact,
it would be better that way.

175
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,963
Hachi! Buy one for me too!

176
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,493
Buy it yourself.

177
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,233
What should I get?

178
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:37,973
Thank you.

179
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,283
You know, Nana's singing seems
to be improving day by day,

180
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,723
don't you think?

181
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:49,553
Maybe because of the sit-ups.

182
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,193
I'm sure we'd be able to go pro, right?

183
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,233
Trapnest will be on their break
for two more days.

184
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,563
If I don't hear from Takumi again,

185
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,603
I can become the poor girl

186
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:03,503
who was tricked and
dumped by a nasty guy.

187
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,143
I can make it all Takumi's fault,
and move on to a new love.

188
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:15,043
But if he found out about
my cunning thoughts,

189
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:16,873
he'll end up hating me.

190
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,023
First of all, I'd be dreaming

191
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:21,993
to think someone would
make me their girlfriend

192
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,153
because Takumi dumped me.

193
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:27,153
I don't want Nobu thinking
I'm such an easy woman.

194
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,763
But the fact is,
I am that type of woman.

195
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:38,133
A black four-wheel drive Mercedes Benz.

196
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:43,443
Nobu!

197
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:45,373
Thank you for walking me home.

198
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,003
Huh?

199
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,743
I'll be fine on my own from here on.

200
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,143
I'm almost home.

201
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,553
I'm sorry for having you take
a longer route home

202
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:52,813
to walk me home every day.

203
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:55,613
No, I don't mind it.

204
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:56,823
If you're bothered by it,

205
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:57,983
I'll have Shin or Yasu walk you home
from tomorrow...

206
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,783
No, it doesn't bother me.

207
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:00,723
Nana!

208
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:08,633
If he's gonna come at this stage,

209
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,473
he could've sent me
an email ahead of time.

210
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,533
Such a selfish man who
makes decisions on a whim.

211
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:18,273
Well, well. It's you.

212
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:24,683
Where were you this late
at night?

213
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:27,653
I worry, you know.
I've been waiting for an hour.

214
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:32,383
Ah, sorry. I was at the studio
to see Nana and her band practice.

215
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:35,123
Nana's staying with Ren now,

216
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:38,893
so Nobu walked me home because
I'm afraid to walk home alone.

217
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,893
Is that so?
Well, thank you very much for that.

218
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,593
Okay, then. Thank you, Nobu.

219
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:47,673
Good night.

220
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:51,913
I'm the worst.

221
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:56,343
Sorry for coming like this
outta the blue.

222
00:12:56,413 --> 00:13:00,083
I left my place without my cell phone
and came here before returning,

223
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,553
so I couldn't call you.

224
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,163
This is what happens when
I think cunning thoughts

225
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,593
and take advantage of
someone's kindness

226
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:06,963
by having him walk me home.

227
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,323
I must've really hurt his feelings.

228
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:15,923
What am I gonna do?
I can't go to the studio anymore.

229
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:19,503
I won't be able to look him
in the eye!

230
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,383
Oh, Takumi, want me to
make you something?

231
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,353
Are you hungry?

232
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:30,083
No.

233
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:34,623
Then, do you want
something to drink?

234
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:35,813
There's cold beer.

235
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:36,713
Sure.

236
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:39,353
I mustn't let my guard down.

237
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:43,063
To Takumi, I'm nothing
but a convenient woman

238
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,393
who will sleep with him when
he wants to do it.

239
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,453
It's one thing to get involved
once or twice,

240
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,063
but this is the third time.

241
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,303
If I don't put a stop to this,

242
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:56,433
this pathetic relationship may
continue on.

243
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,003
If I'm gonna end this,
I've gotta do it now.

244
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,613
Before it's too late.

245
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:05,213
I just hafta tell him never
to come here again.

246
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,083
But...

247
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,963
am I able to say such a thing?

248
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,143
I can't say it.

249
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:34,503
Why are you drinking on your own?

250
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:35,573
Give me some.

251
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,523
I know he's not that great a guy.

252
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,723
So why can't I... end it?

253
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,793
Oh, welcome home, Nobu.

254
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:03,943
Don't!

255
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:05,533
What are you watching?!

256
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,613
Erotic videos. I'm studying.

257
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,373
Cut it out. Not at a time like this.

258
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,783
Are you doing it to make fun
of me?

259
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:14,513
I can't take it anymore.

260
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:15,923
Take what?

261
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,463
What's the matter?

262
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:24,523
Nothing! It's none of your business!

263
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,823
Um, sorry. Please leave me alone.

264
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:50,523
Shin.

265
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,463
A man and a woman are
simply opposing creatures

266
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:55,763
driven toward each other by lust.

267
00:15:57,703 --> 00:16:00,323
Can they be connected by love?

268
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,773
Sorry, I don't know either.

269
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:21,023
The truth is, I'm just a girl
who wanted to get close

270
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,113
to Trapnest's Takumi outta curiosity.

271
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,453
I'm not as pure as Nana thinks.

272
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:30,493
And I'm sure I'm different from
the ideal Nobu pictures me as.

273
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:37,463
But Takumi understands me...
me who's helplessly empty.

274
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,843
And me too.

275
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:44,733
I know Takumi
is a pathetic man.

276
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:47,443
Nana...

277
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:49,773
It's strange.

278
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,313
He lived in a world
farthest away from mine.

279
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,123
But only Takumi...

280
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:04,053
will forgive me for who I am.

281
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,323
As if he was the sole accomplice
to my actions.

282
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:18,643
Thanks for your concerns
about everything.

283
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,813
THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
TAKUMI CAME BY LAST NIGHT,
AND SAYS HE'LL BE WITH ME
ALL DAY TOMORROW,
UNTIL THE END OF HIS BREAK.
BUT I HAVE WORK.
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE DAY OFF.

289
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,753
WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN MAKE IT HOME, NANA?
WITH THE LIVE CONCERT
COMING UP, I DON'T WANT
TO GET IN THE WAY OF
YOUR PRACTICE, SO I WON'T
BE DROPPING BY THE STUDIO.
GOOD LUCK.

so I won't be dropping by
the studio. Good luck.

296
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:42,033
Give my best to everyone. Hachiko.

297
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:45,003
GIVE MY BEST TO EVERYONE.
HACHIKO.
Give my best to everyone. Hachiko.

298
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,613
Trapnest's time off came
to an end,

299
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,243
but Nana didn't come home.

300
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:59,583
I simply assumed
she was with Ren.

301
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,253
I wanted to at least drop by
the studio and see Nana.

302
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:08,213
But I didn't because
I didn't have the guts to see Nobu.

303
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,893
As usual Takumi didn't send me
a single email.

304
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:17,003
But surprisingly, I accepted that
with an open mind,

305
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:19,493
casually thinking he'll eventually
come to see me again.

306
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:26,243
I couldn't tell if that was
a feeling of trust or resignation.

307
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:29,843
Misato!

308
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:36,843
Thank you for coming all
the way out to pick me up, Miss Komatsu.

309
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:39,013
It's not a problem.
And call me Hachiko.

310
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,623
That's such a cute nickname.

311
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,193
We still have time before
the concert,

312
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:46,533
so why don't we go home first
so you can leave your bags?

313
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,063
I'll carry one.

314
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,663
Thank you so much.

315
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,943
Is it really okay to stay
at your place again?

316
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,703
Mhm. You can stay for as
many nights as you wish.

317
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,113
It's summer vacation,
so you have free time, don't you?

318
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,183
Yes.

319
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:03,753
To be honest, I would love to spend all
of my summer vacation here,

320
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,413
but I couldn't possibly impose
on you for a full month.

321
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:07,713
That's totally okay with me!

322
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,523
Then spend your whole
summer vacation here!

323
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,823
Or rather, I want you to stay!

324
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:13,383
Are you sure? I'm thrilled!

325
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,333
I'm just as glad about it.

326
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,533
- Nana's staying with Ren...
- A train will be arriving on track one.

327
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:18,903
and shows no sign of returning.

328
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,763
- I was feeling all lonely living alone.
- Please stay inside the yellow line.

329
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:27,503
You know, I still can't get over
the excitement

330
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:30,033
after learning that Nana and Ren
are all lovey-dovey.

331
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:35,973
I carelessly blurted it out.
I assumed you would already know.

332
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:40,023
But I did secretly find out when
they were back in my hometown

333
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,043
that the two were living together.

334
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:45,563
I've been wondering what had
happened between them after that,

335
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:46,753
so this news is such a relief to me.

336
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,983
Please don't tell anyone, okay?

337
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:52,863
Rest assured.
Please have faith in me, Miss Hachiko.

338
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,173
The concert starts at seven, right?

339
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,103
I can't wait to see
the band members.

340
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:05,413
I wonder if they're still rehearsing.

341
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,173
Actually, I haven't seen them
for a week.

342
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:12,113
But I thought you visited the studio
every day to see them practice.

343
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:13,883
Well, yeah, but...

344
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:15,913
I didn't wanna bother them
so close to their live performance.

345
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:18,023
I see. You're right.

346
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:20,963
Let's hope that BLAST's professional
debut becomes a reality.

347
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,193
Mhm.

348
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:29,563
If I were to see Nobu today,
what expression should I make?

349
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:39,273
Nobu may never smile for me again.

350
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,343
That thought almost made me cry.

351
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:53,923
That other night, when Nana sang
that song that Nobu wrote.

352
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:57,853
She was wishing for something
as she sang it with such passion...

353
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,033
so her voice would reach me.

354
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,673
Right now, I realize
what she was wishing.

355
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:12,903
I reached into the sky

356
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:19,423
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

357
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:24,793
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

358
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:30,783
Like colorful balloons

359
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:32,903
I'm alone

360
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:36,633
My hand had no place to go

361
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:43,263
And gently you took it

362
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:44,443
Starless night

363
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:48,643
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

364
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:54,443
I want to feel your warmth

365
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,323
Tears are falling down

366
00:21:56,323 --> 00:22:00,423
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

367
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:06,923
Of your hand holding mine
