1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,340
I got it.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,670
The reprogramming
of the surveillance satellite,

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,010
the mobilizing of personnel...

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,610
Everything's completed.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,710
The time has finally come.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,010
Bastard, do you know what you are...

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,350
Takami-kun, what are you afraid of?

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,610
I'm not afraid, I'm simply fed up.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,630
Everything is inevitable.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,360
It has been ever since we
touched the corpse of the god,

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,460
when I qualified as game master.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,160
Then, eh?

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,710
"Kamikura Island"

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,540
"Kamikura Island"
We've come all the way
to this unknown island.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,880
We've come all the way
to this unknown island.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,610
If you're a man, you must go on a
journey of adventure at the end of century!

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,380
Dungeons! Go forth and quest for treasure...

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,720
That hurts, Takami-kun!

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,120
If you don't shut up,
I'll give you another!

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,960
This island appeared as a result of
a geologically impossible upheaval.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,630
We can't predict what
will happen at any moment!

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,840
Even so, you came here as if you're
going to a picnic, saying, "I wanna go see!"

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,440
This is supposed to be the super genius,

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,310
the smartest person since
our university was founded...

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,080
But he's one mere step from a nutcase!

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,710
Hey, wait, Minaka!

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,180
Wait, Minaka!

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,350
Takami-kun!

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,720
A discovery! A discovery!

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,250
The King of Terror!

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,100
What is this?

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,770
If it's the end of the century,
it's obvious this is the King of Terror.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,610
No way...

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,490
She... doesn't look like the King of Terror.

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,640
Now my life is blooming then falling

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,650
I grab destiny tight

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,050
There's no more hesitation anymore

38
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,650
Tying our bond

39
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,660
To the sky waiting for the dawn

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,490
Holding you, my love, tightly

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,660
I present an unbreakable prayer

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,870
We all are still in the darkness

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,500
Right now I just

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,510
Want to touch you deep in your heart

45
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,680
And give you all of my overflowing passion

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,180
I spread out my wings

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,350
Toward the future of our dreams

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,690
On them are engraved

49
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,690
The feeling you gave me that day

50
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,200
The words of our oath

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,360
Will make a miracle happen

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,370
My pounding heart, take off now!

53
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:33,400
My wish can fly high, high up

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,920
Feather 7:
"The Black Sekirei"

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,910
Get away from there!

56
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,910
Only the real wife can share his bed!

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm his wife, too!

58
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,920
I-I had a feeling this would happen...

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,520
Well, Ku-chan, it's time to go to sleep.

60
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,260
Art thou retreating, Minato?!

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm just taking Ku-chan
to the landlady's room...

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,930
Little brat, art thou challenging me?

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,270
This is such a typical scene of carnage.

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,270
Matsu-san, you too.
You'll get in trouble with landlady again.

65
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,510
I'm simply observing these
unruly and wild women fight.

66
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,280
And in the end, I let them have their way...

67
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,550
Sahashi-san...

68
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,560
I told you illicit sexual
relations are not permitted.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,870
U-Um... it's not like that...

70
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,060
Even Ku-chan...

71
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,640
And so I have decided
to formally allocate the rooms.

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,850
Ku-chan will keep
sleeping in my room as before.

73
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,320
Musubi-san and Tsukiumi-san
will be in the vacant room 204.

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,820
I can't understand! I'm his wife.

75
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,660
It's unreasonable to be
separated from one's husband!

76
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,250
I'm his wife, too!

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,130
It is already done.

78
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,560
"Hisssss..."
It is already done.

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:35,860
"Hisssss..."

80
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,670
Understood?

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,330
Yes...

82
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,000
Well...
as the landlady has decided so...

83
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,370
Now the obstacles to my
experiment are eliminated...

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,020
The private army's deployment has changed.

85
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,140
Why so suddenly?

86
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,690
That wench! Why must I, the real wife,
be kicked out from Minato's room?

87
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,360
Honestly, I cannot accept this at all!

88
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,030
I'll be out shopping,

89
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,530
so please water the garden.

90
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,370
Yes, have a safe trip, landlady.

91
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,370
See you!

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,670
Huh? Where is Tsukiumi-san?

93
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,340
If she'd join us watering the garden,
I'm sure it'd be a lot of fun...

94
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,380
Why must I help with these chores?

95
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,290
They had better not think of me
as a water sprinkler or something!

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,220
H-Hi.

97
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,060
You really look alike...

98
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,960
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,570
See you later.

100
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll be back soon.

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,270
I just came to see her today.

102
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,080
I wonder if Mu-chan's doing well.

103
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,920
No, Ku-chan. You'll get wet.

104
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,440
I-I'm sorry!

105
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
You're still a scatterbrain as always...

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,780
...Mu-chan.

107
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Karasuba-sama!

108
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,180
Why are you here?

109
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,780
I heard a rumor about you.

110
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,120
Am I causing trouble?

111
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,460
No, not at all. I'm very glad you're here!

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,860
Musubi-chan, is someone here?

113
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,800
Please wear my clothes until yours get dry.

114
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,130
I'm really sorry about that.

115
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,140
Don't worry.

116
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,470
By the way, that guy is your Ashikabi?

117
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,540
Yes, he's Minato-san.

118
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,940
A Sekirei symbol!

119
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,480
Right. I've emerged, too.

120
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Congratulations!

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,150
I heard you crushed number 43.

122
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,550
Number 43?

123
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,860
Ah! The sickle person!

124
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,730
She was such a bully. So I...

125
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,160
You haven't changed, Mu-chan.

126
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,500
Tell you the truth, I came here to confirm.

127
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Confirm?

128
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,510
Do you remember that promise, Musubi?

129
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,940
Of course!

130
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,350
Mina-tan, Mina-tan! I have to talk to you.

131
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,120
Is somebody here?

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,190
Yeah, an acquaintance of Musubi-chan...

133
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,660
An acquaintance?

134
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,030
I wonder if my clothes are dry now.

135
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,520
Probably.

136
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,200
W-Why is that here?

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
- Um... Matsu-san?
- I'm not here!

138
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,270
There's no such person as "Matsu" here!

139
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,340
Excuse me, but I'm leaving now.

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,510
Ah, I see...

141
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,550
I wanted to talk with you more!

142
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,550
Somebody's waiting for me. Later.

143
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,650
Later!

144
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,240
Sekirei number 04, Karasuba.

145
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,280
MBI's hound.

146
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,340
Called the "Black Sekirei."

147
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,120
Matsu-san, she's left.

148
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,250
L... will... be... killed!

149
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,920
What do you mean you'll be killed?

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,600
Mina-tan! Watch the TV!

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
That hurt... TV?

152
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,270
Ladies and gentlemen in Shintou Teito,

153
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,810
I'm MBI's Hiroto Minaka.

154
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,940
I now declare to you,

155
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,620
the capital has been seized by us, MBI.

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Seized?

157
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,350
Now the new age of
the god has begun here!

158
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,960
There's no need to worry at all
even though the capital is seized.

159
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,300
- What's going on? Ah, Professor!
- Please continue living as usual.

160
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,740
However, please allow us to inspect
your persons when leaving the capital city.

161
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,040
Thou hast done it, Minaka.

162
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,650
Inspection? By MBI?

163
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,980
It's finally started. The Sekirei Plan, Phase 2.

164
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,540
Phase 2...

165
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,490
I have just noticed a little while ago.

166
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,490
As you see, this capital city,
Shintou Teito, is surrounded by rivers,

167
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,330
and MBI's private army has been
deployed to all the city's exit bridges.

168
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,000
But why would they inspect?

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,010
Mina-tan, me, and everyone else...
At last, we must prepare ourselves.

170
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,670
Prepare...

171
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:27,240
MBI... that is, Hiroto Minaka is going
to make this Shintou Teito into a battlefield.

172
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh?

173
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,690
That's a nice place... Maison Izumo, right?

174
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,030
I didn't touch anything... at least not today.

175
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,700
This is the only time I'll overlook this.

176
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,200
I will not forgive you if you
step into Maison Izumo next time.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,370
Ah... you are as good as ever.

178
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,380
You haven't changed. Scary, so scary...

179
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,280
You give me a chill.

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,400
Too bad. I didn't bring my sword today.

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,990
Are you going to fight with that?

182
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,440
Go away! Your sinister form
is too repulsive to look upon!

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,410
You're the same as always...

184
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,970
Number 01, Miya.

185
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,010
Let's meet again.
Next time, let's both bring prey.

186
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,740
Wait.

187
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,020
That apple costs 143 yen!

188
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,980
Looks like... it has begun, Takehito-san...

189
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,450
What happened?
You look like you're having fun.

190
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,790
Can you tell?

191
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,790
Yes, I can tell. I'm your "Ashikabi"
or whatever, and we're connected, right?

192
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,530
You're flippant, Natsuo.

193
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,790
Flippant? You're not nice.

194
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,770
Stop the car, Natsuo.

195
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
What?

196
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,410
I got too excited because of Number 01.

197
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,540
I'll go out to play a bit.

198
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,220
The plan's gone into Phase 2,

199
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,820
and there are only a few un-emerged
Sekireis left to present to Master.

200
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,320
It's getting tough to perform our duty!

201
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,490
Ever since we let number
107 get away, we've been out of luck.

202
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,160
I wonder if it's time to quit this task.

203
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Hey, you guys.

204
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,840
If you have time to spare,
could you be my opponents?

205
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,870
What are you? A Sekirei?

206
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,000
Get out.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
She's the Black Sekirei.

208
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,180
Are you saying to run away
from one who challenges me?

209
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,510
Impossible!

210
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,850
Anyway, who is this Black Sekirei?

211
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,180
Ignorant and arrogant...

212
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,850
I kinda like that.

213
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,850
Shut up!

214
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,320
Who do you think you are?!

215
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,160
Can you do it?

216
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,250
Ah, she ran away...

217
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,440
I have to ask them to pick this up.

218
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,990
I don't know how to respond,
being told to "prepare" all of a sudden...

219
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,730
And who was that person who came here?

220
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,160
Ku-chan's taking a nap.

221
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,230
I see.

222
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,900
Do you know where Tsukiumi is?

223
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,230
I haven't seen her for a while.

224
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,830
Beats me...

225
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,840
It's kind of quiet here.

226
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,440
Uzume-san's been
out since this morning too.

227
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,810
She said she had something to do.

228
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,080
What?

229
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,250
We're all alone right now, aren't we?

230
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,090
Yes, we are...

231
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,590
So this is the best time.

232
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,530
There's something I must tell you. Only you.

233
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,260
The promise I made with Karasuba-sama...

234
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,600
The promise between a Sekirei and a Sekirei.

235
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
A promise?

236
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,060
Yes, it is the promise we must keep.

237
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,080
Humans are an unnecessary
species on this planet.

238
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,620
My Ashikabi-sama who I will meet someday...

239
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,620
I'm really sure I will like
that person very, very much.

240
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,690
They are not an unnecessary species.

241
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,630
You say the same thing as Yume said.

242
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,300
Yume-sama did, too?

243
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Then, how about this?

244
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,300
We will fight and survive until
we are the last two remaining.

245
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,970
Then, we fight until one of us loses.

246
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,710
Karasuba-sama and me?

247
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,910
If you win, what you are saying is right.

248
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,710
If it's the opposite and...

249
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,460
My promise with Karasuba-sama is to survive
the fights until we are the last two remaining.

250
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,830
And I will definitely win over her,

251
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,000
and free all the broken-winged
Sekireis into the sky again.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,270
Being separated from their
Ashikabi-sama forever... It's too sad.

253
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,670
Musubi-chan...

254
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,900
I like you very much!

255
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,670
Thanks.

256
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,420
Here!

257
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,020
Can you feel it?

258
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,550
It's beating so hard.

259
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,350
Y-Yes...

260
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,690
It's so warm...
I'm grateful to the gods and goddesses.

261
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,660
For the happiness that I
have here, for the people I love.

262
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,330
Landlady, Ku-chan, Matsu-san, Tsukiumi-san...

263
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,710
For the miracle I could meet everybody.

264
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,340
This feeling...

265
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,050
How this feeling of loving
someone makes us much stronger.

266
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,050
I want Karasuba-sama
to know this feeling too.

267
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,050
That person who doesn't
know anything, like a child...

268
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,780
I really want her to know no matter what.

269
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
That's my ambition!

270
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,730
Is it too big?

271
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,390
Not at all.

272
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,060
You can do it, Musubi-chan.

273
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
I believe in you.

274
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,130
Yes!

275
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:58,130
I believe in your strong words. Your smile.

276
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,410
What a farce!

277
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,580
You should've known.

278
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,250
Homura!

279
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,420
The plan was always for this city to be
readied as a battle arena for Sekireis someday.

280
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,760
I shan't fight against a convalescent.

281
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,090
You're the one who's always
one-sidedly starting the fights.

282
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,090
Then leave now.

283
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,730
The Sekirei Plan has progressed to Phase 2.

284
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,770
This means a certain number of
Sekireis completed their emergence.

285
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,670
Is it... because I became Minato's Sekirei?

286
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,160
Anything wrong?

287
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,680
N-None of thy business!

288
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,640
If thou hast no intention of doing battle,
do not show thyself without good reason!

289
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,750
We're together all the time, actually...

290
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,130
The seizing of the capital in order
to bring Sekireis to fight full scale...

291
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,690
From now on, any Sekireis who show
their backs will be squashed instantly.

292
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,800
Yukari-san, are you sure
this outfit isn't strange?

293
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,140
You look good! You look good!

294
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,470
You definitely look like a girl!

295
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,410
I-Is that so?

296
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,940
They'd never notice you looking like that!

297
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,150
Interesting...

298
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,320
Is something up, Mikogami?

299
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,820
That little bird who flew away from
me doesn't seem to be emerged yet.

300
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,160
A Sekirei, huh?

301
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Once I look at it, I really want it.

302
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,730
That's your bad habit.
Well, do whatever you want.

303
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,270
I left it to the Sekireis,
but they failed twice.

304
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,730
I'll grab that kid by myself.

305
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,080
What is this?!

306
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,650
The clothes Uzume-san gave me.

307
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm not asking thee that! I'm asking why
the heck I have to be dressed in such things!

308
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,530
Because your dress is so
frilly and not suitable for chores!

309
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,530
Chores?

310
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,560
Why the hell do I have to do such?!

311
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,870
What?

312
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,200
Shopping.

313
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,210
I'm counting on you.

314
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,840
So, why do I have to?!

315
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,800
Those who don't work don't eat.

316
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,210
But...

317
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,210
The one who comes back first will sit
next to Sahashi-san at the dinner table.

318
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,190
This side is mine!

319
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,960
What's the matter?

320
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,100
Well, how should I put it...

321
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,240
I wonder if it's okay
to be so ordinary like this.

322
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
Because it's ordinary...

323
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,260
It's good.

324
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,600
Ashi... kabi... sama...

325
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,740
My veil of the pact,
dispel my Ashikabi's nightmares.

326
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Wind...

327
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,090
An unpleasantly colored wind is blowing...

328
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

329
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is the textbook of love

330
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, don't get upset so

331
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without false starts, it's show time!

332
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,280
Get the funky beat!

333
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,820
First ones win?

334
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090
No such thing in this case! No, no!

335
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,000
That's perfect for me

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,660
A sudden scramble!

337
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,100
But I'm a woman, I can't lose. No, no!

338
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
My feelings grow

339
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,970
No, and then a big bang!

340
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,610
Don't seduce him

341
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,770
Get away from him

342
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,110
My heart is pounding hard, so hard!

343
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,110
Secret, going off by myself

344
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,680
Big success, just two of us

345
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,520
Sweet and dazzling night

346
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,620
To tell you the truth, I want him to

347
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,130
Hold only me, just me

348
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,130
I want to monopolize him so badly

349
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,130
I wonder if I could stick a flag on him?

350
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,140
I knew it, he's so wimpy, what should I do?

351
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,140
He's just too gentle

352
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,150
I love that about him

353
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,380
So we are devoted to him

354
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,370
Dear Sweet Heart!

355
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,960
