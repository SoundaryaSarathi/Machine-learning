347
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:20,290
I thought I understood the ethics of all this world expanding</font></font>

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:50,980
The dividing line between the cheek mixing red, dark blue</font></font>

00:22:50,980 --> 00:23:02,410
And before I know about it, it made it hard to say inside or outside my heart</font></font>

353
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:10,290
Do not disappear in the twilight, near to see what it all I</font></font>
