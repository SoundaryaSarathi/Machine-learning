00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,360
"How I've Waited for this Moment!!
Son Goku Revived"

2
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,430
I can see you!

3
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,770
What!?

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,710
No way!

5
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,720
His speed is...

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,300
Damn! To think that Freeza still
hasn't gone all-out yet...

7
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,400
What a monster!

8
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,640
Vegeta, quite frankly, using the
attacks and speed you just did,

9
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,410
there's no way you can win against me.

10
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,920
As I recall, you said something
about being a Super Saiyajin.

11
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,090
If you are as you say,

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,430
does that mean that's the best the
"strongest in history" can do?

13
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,050
Up until this point, I could see him...

14
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,630
Don't make me laugh.

15
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,400
The Super Saiyajin is then no more
than a trivial legend after all.

16
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:53,410
Does this mean I've reached my limit?
Have I not yet become a Super Saiyajin?

17
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,760
Or for that matter, is Freeza an opponent
not even a Super Saiyajin can beat?

18
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,420
Nonsense! There's no reason that should be so!

19
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,690
Vegeta...

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,370
How can such a thing be!?

21
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,040
Such a thing... could never be!!

22
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,730
You fool.

23
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,070
I see you!

24
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,030
I see you, Freeza!

25
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,880
Vegeta, you...

26
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Vegeta isn't blasting away blindly,
he's carefully aiming every shot!

27
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,370
And yet Freeza is decidedly keeping
clear of them. They're both unbelievable!

28
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,370
- Piccolo...
- Piccolo-san...

29
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,720
What!?

30
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,760
I- I am...

31
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,440
I am a Super Saiyajin!

32
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,430
Burn in Hell, Freeza!

33
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,800
Are you trying to destroy the whole planet, Vegeta!?

34
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,420
What!?

35
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,100
It's just about time, I suppose. I can't
have him getting too carried away.

36
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,430
H- How could he...?

37
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,340
He bounced all that back with just a simple kick!?

38
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,110
Vegeta had to have launched that attack at his full power!

39
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,780
He's incredible! He's more than incredible!

40
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,800
And now, you will experience a pain even greater than hell.

41
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,560
This time, you'll let me lead off.

42
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,290
Mildly.

43
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,630
Vegeta...

44
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,310
For the first time in his life, Vegeta is
trembling, from the bottom of his heart.

45
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,320
Both from genuine terror, and from
his conclusive frustration.

46
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,260
He's even shedding tears over his fright
and hopelessness. This is another first.

47
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,610
Here goes. Are you ready?

48
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,640
Vegeta-Vegeta has already lost the will to fight.

49
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,590
Vegeta!

50
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,610
Don't!

51
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,610
He's had it.

52
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,640
Vegeta, I can't have you giving up after so little.
You'll have to go through more than this...

53
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,380
...for a terror greater than hell's.

54
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,820
Well? Have you started to regret how foolish you've been?

55
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,920
You lower-life-form, nothing-in-your-mind-
but-fighting Saiyajin-san?

56
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,510
I thought you at least were different,

57
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,610
and I pampered you, but you're just like the others, aren't you?

58
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,510
If you hadn't turned against me,

59
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,460
we would have gotten by without having to go through this.

60
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,440
V- Vegeta!

61
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,440
If you want to save him, feel free at any time.

62
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:34,200
Piccolo and the others, faced with the terror of Freeza,
battle power of a different dimension,

63
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:40,300
seem to be bound in place or something,
all three of them unable to move.

64
00:16:50,650 --> 00:17:00,220
Vegeta's Ki is rapidly shrinking and he was
supposed to have gotten incredibly stronger.

65
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,820
Is this Freeza that strong!?

66
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm healed!

67
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,490
I've gotten stronger! It's like the
power is welling up inside!

68
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:19,500
Unbelievable! And here I thought I'd
reached my limit. It's enough to scare me!

69
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,940
But you know, it feels good! Even at a
terrible time like this.

70
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,510
My apologies, Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo!

71
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,610
I'm coming now! Something might just become of this!

72
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:43,630
Goku at last recovers. How eagerly
has this moment been anticipated?

73
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,530
You're the only one left who can still offer resistance
to the overwhelming power of Freeza!

74
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,630
We're counting on you, Goku!

75
