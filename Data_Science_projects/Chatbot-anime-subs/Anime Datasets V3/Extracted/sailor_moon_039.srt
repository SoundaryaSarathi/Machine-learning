1
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:04,497
Figure skating is the beautiful
winter sport everyone loves!

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:09,235
How dare you use it as a weapon
to hurt an innocent girl?!

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:11,362
It's totally unforgivable!

4
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:16,037
In the name of my favorite skaters,
Katarina Witt and Midori Ito,

5
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:19,736
Sailor Moon is gonna
punish you, okay?!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

8
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

9
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

12
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

13
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

15
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:05,198
They're wonderful!

16
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:09,498
You can tell why Janelyn and Misha
are Olympic gold medallists.

17
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,101
So beautiful!

18
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:16,543
Ouch!

19
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,177
Oh!
Ouch!

20
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:17,778
Oh!
Usagi!

21
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:18,938
Usagi!

22
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,183
But if she likes figure skating,

23
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:26,175
maybe she's becoming more aware
of herself as the princess.

24
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:34,294
Yes. After all, figure skating was
the most popular sport

25
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,763
in the world of the moon.

26
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:40,667
I know! The princess's skating
was especially beautiful!

27
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,396
What?! Really?!

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,074
I guess I was gifted with
a lot of talent!

29
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,140
Stare...

30
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:05,153
Paired With a Monster?! Ice Queen Mako

31
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,883
Figure skating...

32
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,398
If I use this sport, supposedly
the most popular

33
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,600
among the girls on the moon...

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,635
You could lure Sailor Moon out

35
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:18,238
and finally take the Silver Crystal
away from her.

36
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:20,073
Is that what you are saying?

37
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,141
On my honor...

38
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,542
You will lure her out

39
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:26,137
and stake your honor on
this makeshift trap?

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,747
Endymion!

41
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:29,583
If you are a proud warrior,

42
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,018
should you not attack your
enemy head on?

43
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,588
A battle is meaningless
without a victory.

44
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:36,723
If you had not interfered unnecessarily,

45
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:39,659
we would already have the
Silver Crystal in our hands!

46
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,627
Heh, I wouldn't know about that.

47
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,725
Well, enough of that.

48
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:50,435
Kunzite, you may set that plan
into motion immediately.

49
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:51,998
Yes, my lady.

50
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,439
What are you doing, Misha?!

51
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,950
What about you?!

52
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,752
What kind of timing was that
on that jump?!

53
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:06,820
That's because you...

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,855
Oh, damn it all! That's enough
practice for today!

55
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,557
Wait a second!

56
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:15,392
Janelyn, I thought we were
Olympic gold medallists!

57
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,460
If these terrible practices continue,

58
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:21,256
I'm going to go look for
a new partner!

59
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,303
That's my line!

60
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,203
I cannot allow you to break up.

61
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,975
You two have been given a mission,

62
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:31,068
and that is to work for
the Dark Kingdom.

63
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:37,450
Wow! I had no idea we had
a skating rink like this.

64
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,452
Yeah, they just built it!

65
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:43,023
And to commemorate its opening,
the Olympic gold medallists,

66
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,525
Janelyn and Misha are
going to coach us!

67
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,960
Isn't that amazing?!

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,329
But, so, why did we have
to come, too?

69
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,133
I have an open national
mock exam tomorrow,

70
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,267
so I need to go home to study.

71
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:54,801
Oh, the thing is...
so I need to go home to study.

72
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,069
Oh, the thing is...

73
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,406
Only groups of five girls get in free!

74
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:00,574
Yup, yup!

75
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:01,675
Groups of five?

76
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:02,943
Why?

77
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:03,209
See?!
Why?

78
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,210
See?!
There's something suspicious!

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:04,744
There's something suspicious!

80
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:06,974
It makes you want to check it out,
doesn't it?!

81
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,951
It's one of those, "Ask, and you
shall be answered," things!

82
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:13,620
Shouldn't that be, "Ask, and
you shall receive?"

83
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,321
Oops!
Shouldn't that be, "Ask, and
you shall receive?"

84
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:14,582
Oops!

85
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,289
Oh, really?

86
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:20,020
It doesn't matter which it is!
Come on, let's go ask!

87
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:33,340
Wow! There are so many people!

88
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,575
They're all just here
out of curiosity.

89
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,877
A skating rink... Brings back
memories, doesn't it?

90
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,879
I know! Oh? Where's Usagi?

91
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,406
Oh! Oops! Hey, wait, everyone!

92
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,446
It hurts!

93
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,255
Oh, it's the usual pattern.

94
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,824
She certainly delivers, doesn't she?

95
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:52,359
Oh, Usagi.

96
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,725
This is just so embarrassing!

97
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,330
Janelyn! Misha!

98
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,164
Where?! Where?!
Janelyn! Misha!

99
00:05:58,164 --> 00:05:58,459
Where?! Where?!

100
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:05,070
It's really them!

101
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,599
They're skating!

102
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,642
Oh, Misha!

103
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,254
He looks just like him...

104
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,614
Everyone, thank you for coming!

105
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,950
Let's all have fun today,
skating together!

106
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,352
Yeah!

107
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,320
Of course, we will!

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,389
No matter what you're doing,
the basics are important.

109
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,391
The first step is getting
used to the ice.

110
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,726
Okay!

111
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:00,886
Okay!

112
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,897
Then, since you're an energetic group,

113
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:05,031
come on out into the rink first.

114
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,466
Oh, yes!

115
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:08,368
Oh, no! I still don't have
my skates on!

116
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,536
What are you doing?! Hurry up!

117
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,470
Oh, but...
What are you doing?! Hurry up!

118
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,404
Oh, but...
Usagi, you slowpoke!

119
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,205
Rei's being mean to me again!
Usagi, you slowpoke!

120
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:13,638
Rei's being mean to me again!

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,873
Okay, here we go, then! Now!

122
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:19,979
There!

123
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,181
Usagi?

124
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:22,415
What?

125
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,213
Is this your first time skating?

126
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,188
Don't you worry!

127
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:32,454
After all, I was an expert at this
on the moon world!

128
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,327
Then, I'll be going.

129
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:41,629
One, two. One, two. One...

130
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:48,942
Mako...

131
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,577
She's good!

132
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:55,515
Not bad. I'm gonna do it, too!

133
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,450
Usagi, time for your brilliant debut!

134
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,293
Usagi!

135
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:08,394
I knew it.

136
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,521
This isn't how it's supposed to go...

137
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,725
That's not right!

138
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,868
Oh, boy.

139
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:24,572
I'm not going to expect
a lot out of Usagi.

140
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,194
Wow!

141
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:42,195
I remember now.

142
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,164
Sailor Jupiter was also an expert,

143
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:46,598
considered to be as good
as the princess.

144
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,500
Mako looks so wonderful.

145
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,249
Wow! That was amazing!

146
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:09,856
Very nice! Now, everyone,
let us all skate!

147
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,380
Okay!

148
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,101
Usagi!

149
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,903
Hang in there.

150
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:26,633
My brilliant debut...

151
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,368
Ouch!

152
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:36,076
No...

153
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,414
No...

154
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:41,915
No...

155
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:44,324
Master Kunzite!

156
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:48,328
Find Sailor Moon through her
athletic abilities and agility.

157
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,029
Does it look like it will work?

158
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,097
You can count on me.

159
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:53,967
My judgment as an Olympic
gold medallist is flawless.

160
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:58,461
Good. However, you have never
actually met the sailor warriors.

161
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,340
Do not let you guard down.

162
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,898
Yes, Sir!

163
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,305
No...

164
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,843
No...

165
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,553
Sailor Moon is known to be
a superb warrior.

166
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:17,387
They say she has a clumsy side,
but this is out of the question.

167
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,422
Misha?

168
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,626
Wonderful girl, would you please
skate with me?

169
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:29,828
Excuse me, if you'd like,
I'm free any time to be...

170
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,306
He's so gorgeous.

171
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:37,403
The way his hair hangs...

172
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:40,004
It looks exactly like my senior at
school who broke my heart.

173
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,685
Oh, Coach?

174
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,485
Something isn't right.
Is this girl Sailor Moon?

175
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:56,696
Then, here we go.

176
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:58,323
What?

177
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,535
Oh, I'm sorry! I know I'm heavy.

178
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,336
Not at all...

179
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:03,770
In apology...
Not at all...

180
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,101
In apology...

181
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,933
Wow! It's amazing!

182
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,079
She lifted a man up into the air...

183
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,741
It's a technique no one in the world
has accomplished yet!

184
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,313
This is...

185
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,066
Amazing.

186
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:41,436
Misha, how could you pass over me?!

187
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,038
Were you serious about breaking up?!

188
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,207
Today's free lesson is now over.

189
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,916
Everyone, please leave the rink
and go home immediately.

190
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,454
Why?!

191
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,012
That's no fun!

192
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:59,348
Excuse me, I have to go home now.

193
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,498
I won't let you go.

194
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:08,865
You are the best partner
for me in the world.

195
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,133
Coach...

196
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,666
Too bad. I hope they do it again.

197
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,705
But at least we got to
see them in person.

198
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:46,507
Hey, everyone.

199
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,175
Where are Usagi and Mako?

200
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,610
Mako has to stay behind.

201
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,012
The coach is giving her
a special lesson.

202
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,570
I'm so jealous!

203
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:57,418
Oh? Usagi was with us until
just a minute ago.

204
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,511
She's such a turtle!

205
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,126
What's going on?!

206
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,161
Something's wrong!

207
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,897
Could it really have been another trap
set by the Dark Kingdom?!

208
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,194
Shoot!

209
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,968
And I run swiftly over here.

210
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:15,102
Employees Only
And I run swiftly over here.

211
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,437
Employees Only

212
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,205
Employees Only
I can't just back down and go home!

213
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,973
Employees Only
I'm gonna get them to
give me lessons, too!

214
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:20,405
I'm gonna get them to
give me lessons, too!

215
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:24,835
That girl is skating so nimbly
with my Misha!

216
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:26,872
Misha!

217
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,004
This isn't fair!

218
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:31,341
This is just so exciting!

219
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,255
That's so mean!

220
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,484
What the heck is this?

221
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,229
Oh! Don't tell me this is...

222
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:53,603
You must have had some
figure skating experience.

223
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:58,043
Won't you tell me the truth?

224
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,007
Coach...

225
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,910
Misha!

226
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,950
Misha, so you and I are
really over, aren't we?!

227
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:12,292
If I have to give you up to
an amateur like that,

228
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,760
I'd rather kill you!

229
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,261
What?!

230
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,028
Wait!
What?!

231
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:15,426
Wait!

232
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,368
Oh! Coach, run!

233
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,131
Don't jump to conclusions, Janelyn!

234
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:28,006
I was just trying to find out whether
she was Sailor Moon!

235
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,278
That's a lie!

236
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:33,881
It's true, her technique is first class,

237
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,550
but you cannot form a pair
based solely on that!

238
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,485
I thought you knew that!

239
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,420
Coach, you weren't...

240
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,947
Misha, it's too late! I can't stop now!

241
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,427
Take your hands off her!

242
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,801
A monster?!

243
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:55,135
Janelyn!
A monster?!

244
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:55,999
Janelyn!

245
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,071
Triple Axle Kick!

246
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:09,372
Janelyn!

247
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,410
Come with me, Misha, my partner.

248
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,917
We are the greatest pair.

249
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,838
Coach was a monster?!

250
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,346
We are amazing after all!

251
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,648
We are the best pair in the world!

252
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,083
Misha!

253
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,585
Janelyn!

254
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:47,383
Together, we are the Zoyrin Geller!

255
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,059
Now that you have seen us,

256
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,727
we cannot let you return alive!

257
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:54,785
Coach!

258
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:01,757
Combination Jump Attack!

259
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,708
Oh, Mako! That's it!

260
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:16,910
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

261
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:51,482
I'm a sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

262
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:56,290
We will deliver the finishing blow!

263
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,291
Go right ahead!

264
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,623
How dare you use graceful
figure skating as a weapon

265
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,096
to hurt an innocent girl?!

266
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,132
Sailor Moon will not let you
get away with it!

267
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,896
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

268
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,703
Sailor Moon!

269
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:10,871
We have been waiting for you!

270
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,362
The Silver Crystal will be ours!

271
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,305
I won't let you have it!

272
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,650
No way! I can't skate, even
when I'm transformed?!

273
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,321
Sailor Moon, prepare yourself!

274
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,028
Death

275
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,461
Spiral!

276
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:41,729
Die!

277
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,871
What?!

278
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,065
That was...

279
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:49,806
Tuxedo Mask! You rescued me!

280
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,678
Do not misunderstand.

281
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:53,780
I just do not like their
underhanded method,

282
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,316
which has dragged an innocent
bystander into this mess.

283
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,417
What?

284
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,453
After I have brought the monsters
under control,

285
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,421
I will return for the Silver Crystal.

286
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,989
No, you wouldn't...

287
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:05,258
Master Endymion, your help
is not necessary!

288
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,994
We will not hold back,
even for you!

289
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,630
Do you think you could win
in a fight against me?

290
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,133
I think it'd be better if you
didn't taunt them.

291
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,067
Interesting!

292
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,035
Have a taste of the techniques
of gold medallists!

293
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,038
I told you so!

294
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,768
Double Spin Kick!

295
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,843
Jump!

296
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,435
Here we go!

297
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,283
I'm skating!

298
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,209
What impudence!

299
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:35,489
They're coming!

300
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,923
Jump! High!

301
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:39,493
Easy for you to say!

302
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,926
Die!

303
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,256
Oh, fine! To hell with it!

304
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,793
I jumped! I jumped all on my own!
I'm so amazing!

305
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,439
A nice jump, Sailor Moon!

306
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,642
Thanks.

307
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,304
Sit Spin Kick!

308
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,344
This is it!

309
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,417
Supreme

310
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,184
Thunder!

311
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,660
Jupiter!

312
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,695
Coach, please stop!
Go back to who you were!

313
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,131
Why you!

314
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,508
Everyone!

315
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:38,009
So, you are all here,
sailor warriors.

316
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:43,190
I pity you, Endymion.
If you had not interfered,

317
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,715
this need not have happened.

318
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,508
What is this?!

319
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:02,941
It's cold!

320
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,241
Master Kunzite...

321
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:15,286
This is the icy hell of
absolute zero temperature.

322
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:18,859
Once you have all turned
into ice figures,

323
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,556
I will return and take my sweet time
getting the Silver Crystal.

324
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,922
Damn you, Kunzite!

325
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:26,700
It's cold!

326
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,300
I can't hold out much longer!
It's cold!

327
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,168
I can't hold out much longer!

328
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,533
We're going to die!

329
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,911
So, that's it!

330
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:48,688
It stopped.

331
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:49,780
We're saved.

332
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,861
Sailor Moon, hurry!

333
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,351
Oh?! Okay!

334
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:07,897
Moon Healing Escalation!

335
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,106
Refresh!

336
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,686
Janelyn...

337
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,880
Misha...

338
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:29,089
Oh? Huh? Tuxedo Mask,
where are you?! Tuxedo Mask?!

339
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,267
Mako...

340
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:38,038
Mako...

341
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,242
What? Don't think my feelings
have been hurt!

342
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:44,107
I'm not gonna let it bother me!

343
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:47,903
Man, I better just find another
nice guy soon and...

344
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,243
Huh?

345
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:53,977
He's gorgeous!

346
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,323
The shape of his nose

347
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:59,019
looks just like my senior at school
who broke my heart!

348
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,057
Oh, Mako!

349
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:14,696
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

350
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:18,312
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

351
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:26,048
It's a world no one knows about

352
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,952
With white shoes clicking

353
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,761
Cross the white moon bridge

354
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:41,827
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

355
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:48,471
Offer a prayer to the moon

356
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:57,245
It will surely bring you happiness

357
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:04,419
Go round and round,
the moon's merry-go-round

358
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:12,729
Make that serene dress made of glass
flutter in the wind

359
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:20,274
She's always watching over us

360
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:26,770
Moon, moon princess
