00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>Oni</i>?

2
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,055
Something's coming <i>oni</i>.

3
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,256
Watch out <i>oni</i>! Stop <i>oni</i>!

4
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,169
I <i>thought</i> he had fallen off
the Serpentine Road earlier <i>oni</i>.

5
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,570
Be that as it may, it looks like
he's a lot faster this time <i>oni</i>-

6
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,103
Aaa <i>oni</i>!!

7
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,606
Uncle Piccolo is awesome!

8
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:49,494
Well, with this many of us members here,
I'm not at all afraid of those Saiyans.

9
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:54,022
I can't wait to see what kind of
training Kami-<i>sama</i> puts us through.

10
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,378
Thanks to my eating that fruit,
I've already come this far in a flash.

11
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,714
What's that?

12
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:23,354
I wonder if this is
Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s residence.

13
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,007
What is this!? What is this!?

14
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:53,048
Welcome to our lobby, honored guest!

15
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,167
Snake Princess-<i>sama</i>, we have a visitor.

16
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,397
What? A visitor?

17
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,338
My!

18
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:23,919
Such a handsome gentleman!
He's just my type!

19
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,522
The Snake Princess-<i>sama</i> approaches!

20
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,560
Then Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you're...

21
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:43,301
...a woman? You're cute, huh?

22
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,810
Cute, you say?

23
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,814
<i>Such a gallant gentleman! For some reason,</i>
<i>my heart is all a-flutter!</i>

24
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:52,884
The Snake Princess-<i>sama</i>
hasn't been this worked up

25
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:55,487
since Great King Yama-<i>sama</i>, has she?

26
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,323
Yes! He was quite handsome too!

27
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:01,159
It's been nearly five
hundred years, I'll bet.

28
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,649
F- five hundred years!?

29
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:09,501
Well, no matter. Never mind that,
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, teach me some martial arts.

30
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,504
M- martial arts?

31
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:15,940
How about instead,
we dance the tango?

32
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:39,797
This is so romantic! Surely we
were destined to come together.

33
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:44,135
<i>The tango is a lot like the</i>
<i>dance we did at my wedding.</i>

34
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,501
<i>So this is Kaio-sama's</i>
<i>martial arts technique.</i>

35
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,079
I get it! This is a technique to
get your opponent off their guard,

36
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,706
then clobber them!

37
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,819
--Ee-yow!
--Kaio-<i>sama</i> is a lot weaker than I thought...

38
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,822
What are you doing!?
She is not Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

39
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,624
This is the Snake Princess-<i>sama</i>,

40
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:09,827
who shone in the glory of victory
at the Other World Beauty Contest!

41
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,490
What? You ain't Kaio-<i>sama</i>?
I'm leaving.

42
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,833
G- goodness, no!

43
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,168
Please wait!

44
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm in a hurry!

45
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,173
A- at least have dinner before you go.

46
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,109
D- dinner? Come to think of it...

47
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,122
...I ain't eaten anything since that piece
of fruit. I guess I'll eat before I go.

48
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:42,460
I'm so happy! Okay, okay, you guys,
quickly prepare something for dinner!

49
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,449
--Right!
--Right!

50
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:54,138
You guys understand, right? We'll do
whatever it takes to keep that man here!

51
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:57,342
After all, he's the kind of nice man
we haven't had for five hundred years.

52
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,143
I won't have him get away from us!

53
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:02,513
Snake Princess-<i>sama</i>, if I mix this
sleeping potion in with the cooking,

54
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,483
it will bring on an
irresistible urge to sleep,

55
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:09,180
he'll doze off,
and won't leave here!

56
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:14,386
Well, it's not a very elegant method,
but what choice do we have?

57
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,862
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,804
We have foie gras,
made from the bird of paradise,

59
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:29,440
sauté of bear's paw,
from Needle Mountain,

60
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,537
baked crocodile, taken from the
River Sanzu, and mussels au gratin.

61
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,016
Let's dig in!

62
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,785
Yes, yes, be my guest!
Help yourself to as much as you like.

63
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:42,912
All right, I'm eating!

64
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:07,478
I- if you like, help yourself
to my serving as well.

65
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,481
Really? Thanks!

66
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,642
Okay, then... I'll take it...

67
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,099
I'm full, I'm full!

68
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,840
Well then, I guess I should go.

69
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,843
Please, wait!
Are you not sleepy?

70
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:44,182
I ain't got time to sleep. I've got
to go meet Kaio-<i>sama</i> and everything.

71
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,852
You're sure you put
the sleeping stuff in, right?

72
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,854
Yes, plenty of it.

73
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,523
Thanks for dinner.
Okay then, I'm going.

74
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,358
You guys!

75
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:59,197
Please, wait. We have a bath warmed up.
How about if you took a bath before going?

76
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:02,257
Kaio-<i>sama</i> dislikes dirty people.

77
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:07,205
Yeah, maybe I am a little sweaty.
Maybe I should freshen up before I go.

78
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,332
--Yes, yes!
--Yes, yes!

79
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,388
This feels great.

80
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,504
How is the water?

81
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,735
Fine. It's a little bit hot,
but it's okay.

82
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,779
This originally comes from
the steam baths of hell.

83
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,680
He should be warmed
clear through to the bone!

84
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,574
Okay.

85
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,464
Huh? Suddenly it's become night.

86
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:17,708
Goku-<i>sama</i>, there are so many stars.

87
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,212
To think that I should be together with you
on such a wonderful evening, Goku-<i>sama</i>,

88
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,373
it makes the Snake Princess so happy...

89
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:28,152
Say there, Goku-<i>sama</i>?

90
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:30,488
Goku-<i>sama</i>?

91
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,750
Oh, my...

92
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:40,824
T- this is terrible!
He's been boiled alive!

93
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,932
98... 99... 100!

94
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,834
Oh, that's refreshing!

95
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:00,518
How embarrassing! But still,
what a manly figure he has.

96
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:02,854
Wow, that was revitalizing!
Okay then, I'll be going.

97
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,651
Ah, wait!

98
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:08,860
Hey you guys, stop him!

99
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,864
--Just a moment!
--What is it? I'm in a hurry!

100
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:16,868
I have to hurry and see Kaio-<i>sama</i>,
and learn martial arts from him!

101
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:21,669
In that case, then we have
just the thing! How about this?

102
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,277
A thrilling, spine-tingling
game of Russian Roulette!

103
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:29,480
You can help train your mind
to overcome fear with this!

104
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,611
Russian Roulette?
How does it train your mind?

105
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,917
First, you take one bullet
and place it into the pistol.

106
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,830
Then you spin it round and round.

107
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,966
The chances of the bullet
being shot are one in six.

108
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,835
When it does,
that's the end of the story.

109
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,929
It's a game brimming with thrills,
in exchange for one's life!

110
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,770
That ended all too easily, huh?
I ain't doing anything that dangerous.

111
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,640
Thank you for waiting!
It is now showtime!

112
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,189
Yes, yes, please leave after
you've watched this show!

113
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,858
Is this martial arts too?

114
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,986
Yes! It is a new martial art.

115
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,369
Snake Princess-<i>sama</i>,

116
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,472
this time I made sure to use
all the sleeping potion we had left.

117
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:30,099
Make it good.

118
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,148
Here, have some specially prepared juice.

119
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,581
Wow, thanks.

120
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,487
Yummy!

121
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>For this guy to have eaten and drank</i>
<i>that much sleeping potion and still be alive</i>-

122
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,666
<i>what is he, a monster?</i>

123
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:18,856
We did it! He should be asleep
for three days and nights like this!

124
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,358
He's pretty tough, huh?

125
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,027
Yes. He is no ordinary person.

126
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:25,529
But you know, he has such
a lovely face when he's asleep.

127
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,799
He really is my type.

128
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,267
Chichi... Gohan...

129
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,706
He's having some kind of dream.
Bring the dream-viewing mirror.

130
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,475
Right.

131
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:40,638
This will reflect whatever
dream he is having.

132
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,147
Chichi... Gohan...

133
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,483
--Father!
--Goku-<i>sa</i>!

134
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:48,152
What's this?
A woman and a boy?

135
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:51,489
Ah, apparently they
are his wife and child.

136
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,494
He's not single!? He still
looks delicious, though!

137
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:58,162
Are you going to eat this one too?

138
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,998
I wonder if there will be
any for us this time.

139
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:04,957
After all, the only one to get out of here
safely has been Great King Yama.

140
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:13,677
Good, Gohan!

141
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:17,515
Once you've finished doin' those drills,
your studyin' is done for today.

142
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:20,575
Mm-hmm. I want to hurry up
and go out and play.

143
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:31,185
W- who are you!?

144
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:36,562
I'm scared! Father!

145
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:39,766
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

146
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,145
Gohan!

147
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,134
Chichi!

148
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:55,152
Oh, it was a dream, was it?
Did I fall asleep?

149
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:57,488
He's awake already, isn't he?

150
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,823
Yeah...

151
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:01,826
That's right! I was on
my way to see Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

152
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:03,828
Please, don't go!

153
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:08,197
Sorry, but I'm going. Everyone on
earth is waiting for me to come back.

154
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,835
You're going, no matter what?

155
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,200
Yeah, no matter what.

156
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,764
Why, you-!

157
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,516
I am the Serpentine Road Goddess,

158
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:28,786
who has lived on the Serpentine Road
for a thousand and five hundred years!

159
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:32,790
How dare you bring disgrace upon me!

160
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,591
Now listen to me! You will
never return home from here!

161
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,401
What is this?

162
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:56,204
If you cannot realize my charms,
then you can just dissolve away!

163
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:06,285
This is bad! I've got to
get out of here quick!

164
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,597
Dammit...

165
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,782
That was close!

166
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,118
Why, you-!

167
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,609
You're not getting away!

168
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,471
Damn! In that case...

169
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,474
<i>Ka... me...</i>

170
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,812
No, I won't. She did feed me
all that food, after all.

171
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,882
Hey, let me pass!

172
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:08,477
I have to hurry and go see Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

173
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,453
No way! If you want to live,
you'll have to defeat me!

174
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,795
Damn... I know!

175
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,500
Wait up!

176
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,457
See you! Thanks for the meal!

177
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:48,125
And the bath, too!

178
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,719
This is so degrading!

179
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,521
<i>The journey to Kaio-sama is still far.</i>

180
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:54,287
<i>The Saiyans' assault is drawing near.</i>

181
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,194
<i>Hurry, Goku! Run the length</i>
<i>of the Serpentine Road!</i>
