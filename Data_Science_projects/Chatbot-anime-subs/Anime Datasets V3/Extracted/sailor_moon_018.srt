1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,188
The doll with blue eyes was
stomped flat by a monster!

2
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:12,215
A doll has all the heart and
soul of its creator!

3
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:14,890
I bet even the dolls for the
Girl's Day Festival are upset!

4
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:19,428
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

6
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

7
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,688
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

8
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

9
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

10
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

11
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,115
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

12
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

13
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

14
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,479
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

15
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:00,223
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

16
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,392
and fight against bad guys.

17
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,556
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:12,362
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

19
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,806
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

20
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,536
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

21
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,000
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

22
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:32,019
Shingo's Innocent Love!
A Sorrowful French Doll

23
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:40,224
Nephrite, how are things going
with the sailor warriors?

24
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,364
I believe you had entrusted
that matter to me.

25
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:49,439
It seems you are having
quite a hard time.

26
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,975
I would be more than happy
to help you.

27
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:55,712
The operations are bound to go better
with two of us rather than one.

28
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:57,681
Don't you think so, Queen Beryl?

29
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:01,251
That is a good idea.
Nephrite, work with Zoisite and...

30
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:01,885
I refuse.
That is a good idea.
Nephrite, work with Zoisite and...

31
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,586
I refuse.

32
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,989
Oh, dear. Do you intend to
defy Queen Beryl?

33
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,049
I am not doing this for Queen Beryl!

34
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,957
I am doing this for myself!

35
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:13,961
Excuse me!

36
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:16,532
Nephrite...

37
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,106
Everything went just as planned.

38
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:28,203
Now, Queen Beryl will have lost
confidence in Nephrite.

39
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,379
Oh, Usagi. You're early today.

40
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,882
This is what normal people do,
stupid Usagi!

41
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:45,295
Shingo, it seems Mika won
the French doll contest.

42
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,296
Really?!

43
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:50,400
I seem to remember that Mika's
mother is a famous doll maker.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,035
Like mother, like daughter.

45
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:53,737
Well, Mr. Shingo Tsukino,

46
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:56,940
how do you feel about having
a celebrity for a girlfriend?

47
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,308
Stop it!

48
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:00,610
This was brought to you live
from the Tsukino residence.

49
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,309
Stupid Usagi! You're gonna be
late again! I'm leaving!

50
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:09,186
I got up early this morning,
there is no way I...

51
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:12,747
Look at the time!
I'm gonna be late!

52
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,191
Miss Tsukino, out in the
hallway you go.

53
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,529
It's amazing how you never get
tired of being late every day.

54
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,098
Leave me alone.

55
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:23,464
Excuse me, are you
Shingo's older sister?

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,901
Yes, I am.

57
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,267
Shingo is so mean!

58
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,006
Did Shingo do something?

59
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,701
Today, at school...

60
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,571
Shingo. Shingo.

61
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,516
Oh, Mika. Congratulations on
winning the contest!

62
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:42,076
Shingo, here.

63
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,946
What is it?

64
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,788
This is the French doll that
won in the contest.

65
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,727
Is it okay? It must mean a lot to you.

66
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:54,219
Yeah, because you were always
there when I needed to talk.

67
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,730
They're so in love!

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,462
So, when's the wedding?!

69
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:03,796
I don't want it!

70
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,516
It's not my fault.

71
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,480
And Shingo didn't even
apologize to her!

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,846
I felt so bad for Mika.

73
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,352
Please talk to Shingo about this.

74
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,684
Shingo's definitely in the wrong!

75
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,583
Usagi...

76
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,987
As his older sister, you should
have a word with him.

77
00:05:57,227 --> 00:06:01,598
Right. Anyway, just let this wise and
pretty older sister handle this!

78
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,226
I'll make sure that Shingo
apologizes to Mika!

79
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,887
Come in.

80
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,656
What's wrong? Why do you have
all the curtains closed?

81
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,758
I can concentrate better this way.

82
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:31,226
Oh, are you already making
the next one?

83
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,362
She looks like she's
about to start crying.

84
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,521
You think so?

85
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:39,336
But I don't think that's a bad thing.

86
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:42,737
Show me the doll that won the
contest. Let's compare them!

87
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,470
I don't have it.

88
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,741
I'm letting someone
borrow it for a while.

89
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:51,648
Who?

90
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:52,876
Well...

91
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:57,020
Show me when you get it back then.

92
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,009
Okay.

93
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:31,052
The stars know everything.

94
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,402
The Lyre's Orpheus is beginning
to play his harp of sorrow.

95
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:01,644
The target Orpheus has chosen
is Mika Kayama.

96
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:04,484
I will take your energy.

97
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:12,462
I'm sorry Mika. It was my fault.

98
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:15,158
I know you worked so hard
to make that doll...

99
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:16,866
Oh, I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't write this letter!

100
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,435
Shingo! Your sister
needs to talk to you!
Oh, I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't write this letter!

101
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:19,424
Shingo! Your sister
needs to talk to you!

102
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,237
Come in.

103
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:28,845
Ouch! What was that for?!

104
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,814
That was for Mika!

105
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:31,748
What?!

106
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,551
You broke Mika's doll
today, didn't you?!

107
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,853
Go apologize to her immediately!

108
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,322
I don't want to hear about
that anymore! Get out!

109
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,958
Okay, then I'll tell Mom
and Dad about this!

110
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,727
What do you think will happen?

111
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:44,227
Uh-oh
Uh-oh.

112
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,095
Uh-oh.

113
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,163
You'll do exactly as I say, won't you?

114
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:48,465
Okay.

115
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:51,201
Then, go to Mika's house and
apologize right away.

116
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,669
Got it?!

117
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,227
I get it.

118
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,342
I'm sorry! It was my fault!

119
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:02,072
I'll make this up to you, even if it
takes me the rest of my life!

120
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,310
Okay, I'll go with that!

121
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,916
Wow! Awesome car!

122
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,295
Kayama

123
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:19,696
Kayama
Yes?

124
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,397
Yes?

125
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,423
I am Masato Sanjoin. I spoke
with you on the phone earlier.

126
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,527
Wait just a moment, please.

127
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,735
They've got a guest.
I guess I'll come back later.

128
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:33,042
I had thought that Pierre Dumoe
was the only one

129
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:36,813
who could make such classic dolls,

130
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,882
but this has changed my mind.

131
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,683
My, you are such a flatterer.

132
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:43,550
I see that your daughter
is also very talented.

133
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,721
Her name is Mika.

134
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:51,752
The doll you entered in the contest
the other day was wonderful.

135
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,925
I would love to see that doll.

136
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,859
Oh, the doll is...

137
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,628
Mika, why don't you show him the
doll you're making right now?

138
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:02,230
Okay.

139
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,575
Oh, this is wonderful!

140
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:09,709
Excuse me.

141
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:13,138
Her sad expression is just so...

142
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:20,690
Monster, Jumo!

143
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,717
Bring Mika Kayama's energy to
its peak level and steal it!

144
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:30,859
Isn't that great, Mika?

145
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,728
Would you make ten more dolls
just like this one?

146
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,508
What? Ten?

147
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:41,044
This doll will sell out very quickly.

148
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:43,713
We are holding a private exhibition
starting this Saturday.

149
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:46,149
Of course, my daughter's work
will be there as well.

150
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,717
Please come see the exhibit.

151
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,309
I will be looking forward to it.

152
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,785
You finished it awfully quickly.

153
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,196
It's strange, but suddenly
I feel so motivated.

154
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,098
Now, I have to make the second one.

155
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,234
I understand how you feel, but
why don't you go to bed?

156
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,701
You have school tomorrow, remember?

157
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:07,970
I'll be fine.

158
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,440
Now, don't say that.
Come on, let's clean up.

159
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,576
Shut up!

160
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,260
What? Mika is?

161
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:11,302
She's been making dolls since
yesterday without any sleep.

162
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:13,395
I tried to stop her, but she
wouldn't listen to me.

163
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,839
I don't know what to do.

164
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,932
I'll talk to her.

165
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,911
Mika, Shingo's here to see you.

166
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,413
I don't want to see him.

167
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:23,847
Mika, I need to talk...

168
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:24,582
Go away!
Mika, I need to talk...

169
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:25,173
Go away!

170
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,022
I wonder if Mika's still mad at me?

171
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,064
Shingo, here you go.

172
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,735
Huh? What is this?

173
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:49,229
As a caring sister, I can't ignore
my kid brother when he's upset.

174
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:52,439
You apologized to Mika, didn't you?

175
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,774
Well, the thing is...

176
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,543
I didn't know that.

177
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:02,545
Mika's always been so sweet,
I couldn't believe it.

178
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:06,254
Did I hurt Mika's feelings that badly?

179
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,693
Cheer up! Oh, I know!

180
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:12,029
Why don't you bring her a present
when you visit next time?

181
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,122
Girls love getting presents!

182
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,658
Okay.

183
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,529
Usagi, what's wrong?

184
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,437
I know what I told Shingo,

185
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,773
but Mika still isn't acting
normal, you know?

186
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:25,435
Usagi, you're very sharp today!

187
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:30,014
When it comes to my darling kid
brother, I do everything I can!

188
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:33,384
Besides, cursed dolls
sound interesting!

189
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:36,420
Spare me the scary stuff!

190
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,490
Well, it could be something to do
with the Dark Kingdom;

191
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,424
we should keep an eye on Mika.

192
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:46,463
Oh, right. In that case, let's have
Ami and Rei handle it!

193
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,657
Usagi!

194
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:49,592
Okay, I got it.

195
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,337
Yoshiko Kayama
Doll Exhibition
Well? Do you see anything, Luna?

196
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,041
No. The curtains are closed,
so I can't see inside.

197
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,000
According to Shingo, Mika hasn't
been going to school either.

198
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,713
The only lead we have left

199
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:03,247
Yoshiko Kayama
Doll Exhibition
Classic Dolls
The only lead we have left

200
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,449
Yoshiko Kayama
Doll Exhibition
Classic Dolls
is this private exhibition
that starts tomorrow.

201
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:05,949
Is this private exhibition
that starts tomorrow.

202
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:09,820
New Sailor V

203
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,412
New Sailor V

204
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:18,095
Sailor V is nice, but I like
Sailor Moon better.

205
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,756
Yeah, me, too.

206
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:23,057
Okay, that's what I'm going to get her!

207
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:26,103
A present for Mika?

208
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,404
Yeah.

209
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:30,107
Wow! It's cute! Good job!

210
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,475
You think so?

211
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:33,966
I'm sure she'll love that piggy!

212
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,612
It's Sailor Moon!

213
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:38,979
Oh, really. The real Sailor Moon
would cry if she saw it.

214
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,885
It's the thought that counts!
The thought!

215
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,555
Well, she's the envoy of love
and justice after all, right?

216
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:45,715
Right!

217
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,518
And the dolls that this person
makes are really adorable!

218
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:54,530
Oh, here we are.

219
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:57,265
Juban Art Museum

220
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,638
It's wonderful. This exhibition
seems like a success.

221
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:03,307
Thank you very much.

222
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:04,408
Where is Miss Mika?

223
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:07,809
She's making the last one
in the anteroom.

224
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,877
She worked herself to exhaustion
to make those dolls.

225
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:12,578
Is that right?

226
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,489
Nothing looks particularly out of place.

227
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, that's Rei!

228
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,235
Oh, you're right.

229
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:35,672
Wow! They're so adorable! Mamoru,
don't you think they're adorable?

230
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:36,540
Yeah...

231
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,611
Oh, that doll is made by the
doll maker's daughter! Look!

232
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:40,911
What?
Oh, that doll is made by the
doll maker's daughter! Look!

233
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:41,245
What?

234
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:41,745
What?
Oh, don't you know?

235
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:42,579
Oh, don't you know?

236
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:43,013
I'm not too much into dolls.
Oh, don't you know?

237
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,674
I'm not too much into dolls.

238
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,484
Oh, Mamoru, you don't like dolls?

239
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:50,521
No, it's not like I hate them.

240
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:53,290
I'm so glad! Then shall we go?

241
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,757
Sure...

242
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,836
Do you want something?

243
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,874
No, pardon me.
I mistook you for somebody else.

244
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,808
Mamoru! Hurry!

245
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,046
Reception
How is Mika?

246
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:16,947
Reception
Well, actually...

247
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:17,242
Well, actually...

248
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:20,284
Sis, I changed my mind.

249
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:21,718
What are you talking about?!

250
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:26,087
Mika is in the anteroom.
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

251
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,926
Okay! Come on, let's go, Shingo!

252
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:30,086
Okay.

253
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:32,892
Usagi...

254
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,267
Finished!

255
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,167
Mika, here...

256
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:54,716
The energy level has peaked!
Now, Jumo!

257
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,323
Mika!

258
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,425
Mika!

259
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:24,246
Usagi, transform now!

260
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:28,016
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

261
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:08,020
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

262
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,827
Sailor Moon!

263
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:19,136
How dare you break the doll Shingo
worked so hard to make?!

264
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:23,640
A doll has all the heart and
soul of its creator!

265
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,943
I bet even the dolls for the
Girl's Day Festival are upset!

266
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,605
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

267
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,541
She's incredibly enthusiastic today.
I hope she'll be all right.

268
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,563
Oh, no! Help!

269
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:48,394
I knew it.

270
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,495
You won't escape!

271
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,067
Sailor Moon!

272
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,198
Bubble

273
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:01,767
Spray!

274
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,151
Oh, saved.

275
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,020
Sailor Moon, are you okay?

276
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,352
We should have come a little later.

277
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,449
Watch out, Sailor Moon!

278
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:18,895
Not again?!

279
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:19,730
Begone, Evil Spirits

280
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:27,432
Begone, Evil Spirits
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu,
Zai, Zen! Begone, evil spirits!

281
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,772
I can't breathe!

282
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,312
Usagi!

283
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,846
Fire

284
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:47,213
Soul!

285
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:52,061
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

286
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,587
Your attacks are all useless!

287
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,467
They can cut like knives!

288
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:10,645
I'm getting an energy reading from
the monster's right leg!

289
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:14,613
Sailor Moon!
Aim for the monster's right foot!

290
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:19,355
Moon Tiara...
It's no use! I can't do it!

291
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,889
Who's there?!

292
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:28,765
Tuxedo Mask!

293
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:29,599
Now!

294
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,896
Right!

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,976
Moon Tiara Action!

296
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,660
What have I been doing?

297
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:10,671
Shingo!

298
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:13,435
You're awake.

299
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,012
Oh, Sailor Moon!

300
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,615
I punished the bad monster!

301
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:20,583
I hope you two get along well
together forever.

302
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:25,744
Sailor Moon rescued us!

303
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:29,126
Look what happened to the
present I made for you...

304
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:30,360
A present for me?

305
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,063
Um, I'm sorry about what
I did the other day.

306
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:37,100
It's okay.
After all, you came to my rescue.

307
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,691
Thank you!

308
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,166
Juban Municipal Primary School

309
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,573
Shingo, this is for what you did
for me the other day.

310
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:45,809
Wow! It looks just like her!

311
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,579
Sailor Moon is just
so cool, you know?!

312
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,115
So, you like Sailor Moon that much?!

313
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:56,279
Oh, that's not what I meant.
Wait, Mika!

314
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:59,552
It's not easy being a popular guy.

315
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:13,571
