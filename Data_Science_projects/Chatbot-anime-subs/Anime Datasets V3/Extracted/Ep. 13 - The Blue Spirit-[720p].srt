1
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,908
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,775
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,879
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,166
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,349
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,416
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:23,713
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:26,864
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:31,013
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,846
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,044
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:38,766
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:19,991
Absolutely not.
The Yu Yan archers stay here.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,242
Your request is denied Commander Zhao.

16
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:28,886
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary.

17
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:35,800
The Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away... without killing it.

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,625
You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.

19
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:45,336
I can do whatever I want with their talents. They're my archers and what I say goes.

20
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,212
But my search for the Avatar is...

21
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,940
...Is nothing but a vanity project!

22
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:54,714
We're fighting a real war here and I need every man I've got, Commander.

23
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:55,315
But...

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:01,471
That's final! I don't want to hear another word about it.

25
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:13,495
News from Fire Lord Ozai?

26
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:22,487
It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order.

27
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,926
This should bring your fever down.

28
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:48,534
You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.

29
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,845
That's nice. I'll tell him.

30
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,173
Classic Appa.

31
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:56,369
How's Sokka doing?

32
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:02,751
Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.

33
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:07,308
I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.

34
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:10,053
There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain.

35
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:12,317
We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.

36
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:16,569
Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest.

37
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:20,516
I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

38
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,230
Not you too!

39
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:29,550
Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine...

40
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,872
That's how Sokka started yesterday.

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,679
Now look at him... he thinks he's an earthbender!

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,850
Take that, you rock!

43
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,651
A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.

44
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:47,508
I'm going to find some medicine.

45
00:03:52,453 --> 00:04:00,709
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. Keep an eye on 'em guys.

46
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:04,323
You guys are killin' me!

47
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:18,317
We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm.

48
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:22,520
But, if we continue heading northeast...

49
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,062
What do they want?

50
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:29,247
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!

51
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,376
The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance.

52
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:39,822
All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.

53
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:44,787
Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!

54
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:50,136
I've got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.

55
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:54,234
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.

56
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,823
Off my ship!

57
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,190
Excellent! I take the pot. But, you're all improving.

58
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:08,245
I'm certain you will win if we play again.

59
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:16,833
Says here that the Avatar can create tornados and run faster than the wind.

60
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,969
Pretty amazing.

61
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:25,801
Ehh, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda. There's no way that's true.

62
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:41,467
Katara... please... water...

63
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:51,231
Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.

64
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,199
Got it?

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,407
Hello! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends.

66
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,000
They have fevers and they've been coughing and...

67
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:24,564
Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine.

68
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:29,835
I've been up here for over fourty years you know, used to be others,...

69
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:35,728
...but they all left years ago. Now it's just me and Miyuki.

70
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:36,763
That's nice.

71
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:42,666
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys,...

72
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:48,602
...and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.

73
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,599
That's nice. Are you almost done?

74
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:55,257
Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient.

75
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,167
Oh, sandalwood... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf?

76
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:09,378
Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?

77
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:20,935
Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.

78
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,614
I don't care what they do.

79
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:27,557
Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.

80
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,659
How, Uncle?

81
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:33,135
With Zhao's resources it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar.

82
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:40,417
My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all.

83
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:46,667
Oh, here's what I was looking for! Plum blossom!

84
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,279
Finally!

85
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:49,313
Thanks for all your help!

86
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:52,212
Hands off! What do you think you're doing?

87
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:55,132
Taking the cure to my friends!

88
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:58,537
This isn't a cure, it's Miyuki's dinner.

89
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,103
Plum blossom is her favorite.

90
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,701
What about my friends?

91
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:06,280
Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs.

92
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,949
There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.

93
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,393
What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?

94
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,857
Why, suck on them of course!

95
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,181
Suck on them!?

96
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:19,484
The frog's skin excretes a substance that'll cure your friends,...

97
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:26,688
...but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!

98
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,177
You're insane aren't you?

99
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,171
Thaaat's right.

100
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:37,011
Well, don't stand there all day. Go!

101
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,182
Uhh, I think you dropped this.

102
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,890
A frog!

103
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:34,202
So this is the great Avatar? Master of all the elements.

104
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,805
I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years,...

105
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,596
...but your little game of hide and seek is over.

106
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:46,457
I've never hidden from you. Untie me and I'll fight you right now!

107
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:53,561
Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?

108
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:56,927
Do you miss your people?

109
00:10:56,986 --> 00:11:01,104
Oh, don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.

110
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,976
See, if you die you'll just be reborn...

111
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:07,679
...and the Fire Nation will have to being its search for the Avatar all over again.

112
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:14,232
So, I'll keep you alive... but just barely.

113
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:22,236
Blow all the wind you want! Your situation is futile.

114
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:31,019
There is no escaping this fortress... and no one is coming to rescue you.

115
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:36,093
Water...

116
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:41,012
Momo should be back any minute.

117
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,956
Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter!

118
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:57,706
Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?

119
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,198
All clear.

120
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:46,485
All clear. Go on in.

121
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:11,066
We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element!

122
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:15,524
Until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory.

123
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:24,616
The Avatar! I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!

124
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:31,527
This is the year Sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!

125
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:36,562
This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se...

126
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:41,718
...and burns the city to the ground!

127
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:02,662
What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you!

128
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,113
Please go back to being frozen!

129
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:25,456
Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me?

130
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,044
I'll take that as a "yes."

131
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:38,393
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out!

132
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:44,181
Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!

133
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:56,202
How many times do I have to tell you, Momo, we need water. Wa-ter.

134
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,564
Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.

135
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:06,714
Who's this "Aang" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?

136
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,032
I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord,...

137
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:42,609
...along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and...

138
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:57,239
Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

139
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,254
There, on the wall!

140
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,594
The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately!

141
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,966
Stay close to me!

142
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:47,394
Take this. Jump on my back!

143
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,038
Gimme the next one!

144
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:18,822
Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!

145
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,569
Open the gate.

146
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,364
Admiral, what are you doing?

147
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:31,041
Let them out, now!

148
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,511
How could you let them go?

149
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,028
A situation like this requires... precision.

150
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:56,244
Do you have a clear shot?

151
00:19:56,331 --> 00:20:04,303
Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.

152
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,200
Quick! Recover the Avatar!

153
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:07,197
You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is?

154
00:21:07,256 --> 00:21:09,912
I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.

155
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:13,681
Before the war started, I used to always my friend Kuzan.

156
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:18,203
The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.

157
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,953
He was one of the best friends I ever had...

158
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:24,365
...and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.

159
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:30,380
If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends too?

160
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,036
Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

161
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:58,035
You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.

162
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:03,310
I'm going to bed. No disturbances.

163
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:17,415
Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.

164
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,085
Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends?

165
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:27,308
No, I don't think I did.

166
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:46,974
This is tasty!
