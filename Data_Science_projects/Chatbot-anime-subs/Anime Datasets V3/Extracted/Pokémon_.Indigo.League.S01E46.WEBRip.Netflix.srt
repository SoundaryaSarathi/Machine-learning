[grunts] Psy-ay-ay.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,667
-Uh, is this the one, Brock?
-Yeah. It's called Farfetch'd.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,544
-Wow.
-Pika?

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,255
Hey, what are you looking at,
a new kind of Pokémon?

18
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,383
Uh, there was a rumor that one's been
spotted right near here.

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,304
It looks like it's holding a leek
in its wing.

20
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,263
Yeah.

21
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,016
[Pokédex] <i>Farfetch'd,</i>
<i>a wild duck Pokémon.</i>

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,769

23
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,689

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,277
Hey, if it's that valuable,
I'll capture it.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,739
There's supposed to be a spring nearby
and we need to get some water.

27
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,199
-You want to come?
-Yeah, I'll go with you.

28
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,036
-Great.
-Will you get some for me?

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,371
-Pretty please, Brock?
-Sure, Misty.

-Let's go, Pikachu.
-Pika.

31
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,959
Thanks, you guys.

32
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,465
Ah, my legs are tired from walking.

-Huh?

34
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,468
Psy-i-i!

00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,845
Hey, I don't have the energy
to deal with you.

36
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,890
If I have to look at that face,
I'm going to get a headache.

-Psy.
-[sighs]

Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.

45
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,679
Wow, I don't believe it.
That's Farfetch'd, the rare Pokémon.

46
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:05,894
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...

00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,687
Look at that.

48
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,275
Ha, that's the coolest Pokémon ever.

49
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,238
Oh! While Ash and Brock are gone,
I'm going to capture it myself.

-Hey, wait!
-Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...

52
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,164
Wait. Come back, Farfetch'd!
Little Farfetch'd!

[panting]

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,710
Where are you hiding?
Come out, Farfetch'd!

55
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,215
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
[gibbering]

56
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,846
There it is. Uh.
Hey, wait! Come back, little Farfetch'd!

57
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,226
Hold on! Please wait for me!

58
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,522
-I won't hurt you, Farfetch'd.
-[Farfetch'd] Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...

59
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:58,405
I'm in no mood for a marathon, Farfetch'd.
[groans]

60
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,158
-You won't get away from me!
-[Misty and man groan]

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,160
Ow, that hurt.

62
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,288
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

63
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,957
It's my fault.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,878
Well, I wasn't paying attention either.
I was chasing a Pokémon.

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,338
-Oh. Here you go.
-Thanks.

66
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,799
-See you.
-[Misty] Bye.

67
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,180
Oh, now I've lost track of Farfetch'd.
[groans]

68
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,348
[both] Huh? Hey, there she is.

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,726
Oh, how could I let it get away?

70
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,352
-[Ash] Misty!
-Huh?

71
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,354
Where'd you run off to?

72
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,066
Oh, I found a Farfetch'd
and tried to capture it but it got away.

73
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,526
[both] You tried to capture it?

74
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,945
Have you been sneaking around
behind our backs?

75
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,947
Huh? Of course not.

76
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,116
If I caught it,
it would have been all of ours.

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,034
Yeah, right.

78
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,120
Anyway, Farfetch'd is
an incredible Pokémon.

79
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,956
Oh, it's so cute
and it twirls it's leek like a baton.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,417
-Huh?
-No lie?

81
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,211
I'm telling the truth this time.

82
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
-This time?
-Oops.

83
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,965
-Here, I brought you your water.
-Thanks, Brock.

84
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,177
[hums]

85
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,054
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

86
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,474
-Pikachu?
-I must have picked up the wrong backpack.

87
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,892
-[all gasp]
-Look.

88
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,728
[all gasping]

89
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,147
[laughs]

90
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,984
Just like taking candy from a baby,
eh, Farfetch'd?

91
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,986
Fetch. Far Farfetch'd...

92
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,532
Now, let's see what's inside.
Five Poké Balls?

93
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,409
This must be all of her Pokémon.
[laughs]

94
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,413
-And now they're mine.
-[both laugh]

95
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,374
You bumped into him?

96
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,085
That must have been
when the backpacks were switched.

97
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,170
How could this happen?

98
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,465
I had all the Pokémon
I ever caught in that backpack!

99
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,092
-[sobs]
-Pikachu.

100
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,684
[chuckles] That was too easy.

101
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,602
-[footsteps approaching]
-Huh?

102
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,273
-Farfetch'd. Far. Far. Farfetch'd.
What is it, Farfetch'd?

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,526
-Farfetch'd.
-Hm? Ah.

104
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,698
Are you sure there are Farfetch'd
out here in the middle of nowhere?

105
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,866
Trust me, we'll find some.

106
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,495
I hear people are spotting Farfetch'd
in this forest all the time.

107
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,372
-[Farfetch'd] Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
-[both] Huh?

108
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,042
-What's that?
-Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...

109
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,962
Far. Far. Farfetch'd.

110
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,174
What amazing luck. We come to
look for it and it comes to us.

111
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,802
It tastes good and has good taste.

112
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,556
And it looks so happy to see us.
This Farfetch'd is mine.

113
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,726
Hi. Sounds like you guys
like my Farfetch'd.

114
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,271
-It's your Farfetch'd?
-It already has a master.

115
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,023
[all groan]

116
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,233
-But this is just perfect.
-[all] Huh?

117
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,653
I was just planning on getting rid
of my Farfetch'd anyway.

118
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,864
You guys want
to make a deal with me?

119
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,158
-[Meowth] For that Farfetch'd?
-Yeah.

120
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,161
I have a Starmie and a Staryu
in here too.

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,122
I guess I'm sort of getting tired
of raising Pokémon.

122
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,916
I'd be happy to find somebody
who'd take them off my hands.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,586
Far. Farfetched'd!

124
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,629
[all] Huh?

125
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,089
[all laugh]

126
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:13,308
Aw, I'm sorry.
I forgot something back in the forest.

127
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,020
Would you mind watching my Poké Balls
and my Farfetch'd while I run and get it?

128
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,271
[all] Huh?

129
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,191
-Sure, we'd be glad to.
-Leave it to us.

130
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,525
We'll take care of them.

131
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,278
Thank you so much.
And I'll be right back.

132
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,114
-Be careful.
-Take your time.

133
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,078
-[man] Thanks!
-No problem.

134
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,998
-[chuckling]
-That sucker just lost one Farfetch'd.

135
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,126
This is easier than taking candy
from a baby.

136
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,879
Letting Team Rocket guard
your Pokémon is like

137
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,048
letting your cat guard your canary.

138
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,884
[laughs] I can't believe how stupid he is.

139
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,013
And look, he even left a boat for us
to make our getaway.

140
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,808
He's done all the work for us.

141
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,103
Too bad he didn't leave his recipe
for Farfetch'd flambé.

142
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,396
[laughing]

143
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,606
-[Jessie] Let's get going.
-[James] Right.

144
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,069
-And he left a Starmie and Staryu.
-Now they belong to us.

145
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,737
[laughs]

146
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:15,161
Heh, this was the simplest Pokémon
capture in Team Rocket history.

147
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,330
Maybe that's the key to success.

148
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,500
Maybe we should just let good things
happen to bad people.

149
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,712
-And Pokémon.
-We've found our winning formula.

150
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,171
[laughing]

151
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,342
[screams]

152
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,760
[all grunt]

153
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,098
-Quick, plug that hole before we sink.
-That kid rigged the boat.

154
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,851
[both gasp and grunt]

155
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,935
[laughs]

156
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,770
[both groaning]

157
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,648
Plug it up tighter!
The water's getting in. We're going to--

158
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,984
[all gurgling]

159
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,071
[all gasping]

160
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,450
-My Weezing!
-Arbok and Lickitung are floating away.

161
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,453
We can use his Starmie and Staryu
to bring them back.

162
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,079
Right. Good idea.

163
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,875
-Huh? What's this?
-What's what?

164
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,795
-Ah. Oh, no.
-That little twerp tricked us!

165
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,798
-But why would he do it?
-Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.

166
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,634
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...

167
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,637
Back off, birdbrain!
Those are my Pokémon!

168
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,890
-And that's my Weezing.
-[groans]

169
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,058
Come back here.

170
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,060
[both] Give us back our Pokémon.

171
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,563
[grunts]

172
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,735
[all screaming]

173
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,320
Far-far-far-far-far-far!

174
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,697
[all screaming]

175
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,119
-Farfetch'd.
-Hey, that's nice work, Farfetch'd.

176
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,915
[laughs] Now they're mine. All mine.

177
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,959
[Misty] And then he ran off.

178
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,962
I think he might have taken
my backpack by accident.

179
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,174
-The Farfetch'd came and then did a trick.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,512
-I'm sorry but that was no accident.
-What do you mean by that?

181
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,472
This has happened before?

182
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,017
You're the fifth victim of
the backpack-switching thief this week.

183
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,685
[gasping]

184
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,522
You were tricked by that boy
and his Farfetch'd.

185
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,023
Jenny, you have to help me.

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,818
That thief and Farfetch'd stole
every Pokémon I had.

187
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,780
I've been trying to track him down for
a while but never he stays in one place.

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,159
-He's a slippery one, that kid.
-[sighs]

189
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,621
We've been together for a long time,
Farfetch'd.

190
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,291
Right after I found you injured on
the road and nursed you back to health,

191
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,544
-we started stealing.
-Farfetch'd.

192
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,923
I wish there was some other way
for us to get by,

193
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,635
but... how else are we
ever going to survive?

194
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,098
-We're just too weak to battle.
-Farfetch'd.

195
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:53,570
Psyduck. Psyduck.

196
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,367
[man] Well, I think our stew is ready.

197
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,664
We're going to find that no-good,
rotten crook and show him

198
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,332
what good rotten crooks are like.

199
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,794
I can't wait. And I can't believe
he tricked us so easily.

200
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,922
-It's because you were so stupid.
-Ah!

201
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,134
But Meowth was the one
who fell for his trick in the first place.

202
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,888
Let's not fight. Let's save all
our nastiness for that lousy kid.

203
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,099
This is it.
This is the place I ran into him.

204
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,561
-Maybe he lives somewhere nearby.
-Hmm.

205
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,522
Oh, I can't believe
he stole all my Pokémon.

206
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,275
Staryu, Starmie, Goldeen and Horsea.

207
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,905
-Misty, you forgot Psyduck.
-Oh, I wish I could forget Psyduck.

208
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,366
Psy. Psy. Psyduck.

209
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,452
-Look, it's Psyduck.
-[all] Huh?

210
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,080
Ah, I'm so happy to see you.
I missed you so much.

211
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,791
-But how did you get back here?
-Psyduck.

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,128
-Where's my backpack now?
-Psyduck.

213
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,423
-What about the other Pokémon?
-Psyduck.

214
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,885
-Where did he take you?
-Psyduck.

215
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,013
-Well, then how did you get away?
-Psyduck.

216
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,975
-[Misty] Where's the guy who stole you?
-Psyduck.

217
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,853
-And where's that Farfetch'd?
-Psyduck.

218
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,814
Come on, you dumb duck!
Start thinking straight!

219
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,693
-Ah, now you're giving me a headache!
-Psyduck.

220
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,242
Okay, Psyduck, tell us which way to go.
Left or right?

221
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,787
-Psyduck.
-[grunts angrily]

222
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,498
What's wrong with you?
Can't you remember anything?

223
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:33,544
-Hey, Misty, chill out.
-Yeah, Misty, you've got to relax.

224
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,798
Psyduck's trying as hard as he can
to remember where the others are.

225
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,842
-Psy-ay.
-Huh? To the left?

226
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,596
-Are you sure about this?
-Psy-ay.

227
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,808
-You better be!
-Following directions from a Psyduck

228
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,769
-doesn't sound like a good idea.
-Pikachu.

229
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,108
-We keep getting more Pokémon.
-Farfetch'd.

230
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,487
Well, if we meet someone on the road,
we'll just have to take their Pokémon too.

231
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,823
-Farfetch'd. Far.
-[Meowth] There he is!

232
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,408
Huh?

233
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,369
-Hold it, buster.
-You won't get away now.

234
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,080
-What are you doing here?
-Fetch'd far.

235
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,708
You thought you were going
to get away with it, didn't you?

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,085
Sinking that boat
and grabbing our Pokémon.

237
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,796
Now we're going to make you pay
for making fools of us.

238
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,467
Hey, come on, can't you guys take a joke?
I meant what I said.

239
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,971
I really am sick of raising Pokémon.
I've got so many.

240
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,684
Look, I'll give you Arbok and Weezing
and Lickitung and we'll call it even.

241
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,144
Nice try.

242
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,563
You can't make it up
by just giving them back.

243
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,398
-[man] No, you're right.
-[all] Huh?

244
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,651
So I'll give you all of these
and my apologies.

245
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,112
What? You mean all of these?

246
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,448
Don't worry about it.
Go ahead and take them.

247
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,410
-Well, since he's being so generous.
-We'll have to forgive him.

248
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
I'm glad I ran into you guys.

249
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,666
I was planning on moving anyway
but I just had too much stuff to carry.

250
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,877
-Oh, lucky you.
-Yeah.

251
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,087
So please forgive me
and good luck.

252
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,468
-[all] What a haul.
-There's so many of them.

253
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,179
Well, it looks like the kid
wasn't so bad after all.

254
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,263
[both] Mm-hmm.

255
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,851
-Psy.
-That's the kid.

256
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,604
[all] Huh?
-Good work, Psyduck. You found him.

257
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,940
You act like a quack most of the time
but you're pretty smart, Psyduck.

258
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,442
Psy?

259
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,862
-Well, I guess we better get going.
-Fetch'd far, far.

260
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,155
-[Misty] Stop right there.
-Ah!

261
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,033
Give me back my Pokémon right now,
you thief.

262
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,869
-Pika, Pika.
-Oh, no.

263
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,538
You're under arrest
for grand theft Pokémon.

264
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,875
-You're crime spree is over.
-Farfetch'd far.

265
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,544
What makes you think it was okay
to lie and cheat people

266
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,921
so you could steal their Pokémon?

267
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,924
It takes a lot of love and care
to raise Pokémon.

268
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,677
We worked real hard to train them all
to win their Pokémon battles.

269
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,097
-That's right.
-Maybe we should start off

270
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,600
by showing this kid just how
difficult a Pokémon match is.

271
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,352
-Good idea.
-Huh?

272
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,898
-That's right, a battle.
-Wait a minute.

273
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,441
Farfetch'd is too weak.
We had no other choice.

274
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,734
That's not true at all.

275
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,487
Pokémon will become stronger
with trainers who work with them.

276
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,864
-But Farfetch'd isn't--
-Fetch'd far, far.

277
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,035
-Huh? You mean you want to battle?
-Far Farfetch'd.

278
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:16,165
-But Farfetch'd--
-Good. Let's start our Pokémon battle.

279
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,795
-Bulbasaur.
-Fetch'd. Far. Far.

280
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,591
-Wait, Farfetch'd.
-Go for it, Bulbasaur! Tackle attack!

281
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,971
[grunting]

282
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,807
-Farfetch'd!
-Farfetch'd, stop.

283
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,393
-Bulbasaur, vine whip attack.
-Bulba.

284
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,858
Farfetch'd, no!

285
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,570
At least now you can see the right way
to capture Pokémon in the wild.

286
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,031
-Farfetch'd
-Please stop, Farfetch'd!

287
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,453
-You can't win this!
-Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd!

288
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,205
-Farfetch'd!
-Bulbasaur!

289
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,709
Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd!

290
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,794
-Huh?
-What's that?

291
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,422
-It's Farfetch'd's agility.
-Pika.

292
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,632
I didn't know Farfetch'd could do that.

293
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,594
[grunting]

294
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,068
[singing]

295
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,405
-Bulbasaur, are you okay?
-Pika?

296
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,781
[groans]

297
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,743
I never thought Farfetch'd
had attacks like that.

298
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,579
Huh? You really didn't know
about its powers?

299
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,791
No. If I had known it was this strong,
I wouldn't have used it to steal.

300
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,168
[sighs]

301
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,504
You can't judge a Pokémon
by the way it looks.

302
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,796
[groans]

303
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,511
-All right, Pikachu, your turn.
-Pika.

304
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,888
-Pika, pika.
-Hold it.

305
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,224
He robbed me,
so it's my job to battle him.

306
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,935
I choose you, Staryu!

307
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,438
Oh, I forgot.
I didn't get my Poké Balls back yet.

308
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,190
[both grunt]

309
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,484
-Psyduch-si.
-Far.

310
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,945
-Psyduck?
-Psy?

311
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,989
[laughs]

312
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,075
[grunting]

313
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,535
[Misty in mind] <i>Here's my chance.</i>

314
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,538
Come on, Farfetch'd!
Give Psyduck your best shot!

315
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,706
Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit...

316
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,167
Psy!

317
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,170
It's working.
Psyduck's headache is getting worse.

318
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,130
-Just a little more.
-Pikachu.

319
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:33,094
-Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit...
-Psy!

320
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,680
-Hit... [squawks]
-Farfetch'd, no!

321
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,558
That's it! Psyduck's absolute
migraine attack, disable.

322
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,274
[both screaming]

323
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,654
[both groaning]

324
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,825
-You did it, Psyduck!
-Psyduck!

325
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,580
I'm embarrassed
for ever doubting that kid.

326
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,123
Let's open up these Poké Balls

327
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,709
and find out what kind
of great Pokémon he gave us.

328
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,840
-Voltorb.
-All of them are Voltorb.

329
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,177
-That two timer.
-He tricked us two times in one episode.

330
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,013
[all] We'll get him for this.

331
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,518
[screaming]

332
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,565
I'm sorry!
I won't do anything bad anymore!

333
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,899
Farfetch'd!

334
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,409
Forgive me.
I'll give back all the Pokémon I stole.

335
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,746
None the victims are going
to press charges

336
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,706
since they all got their Pokémon back.

337
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,501
-[man] That's good.
-It's great to have my old backpack back.

338
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:52,298
It was wrong to steal and it was wrong
not to believe in Farfetch'd.

339
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:53,924
Fetch'd far, far.

340
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,969
Now I'm going to train Farfetch'd
to become even stronger.

341
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,763
Great. That's the way it should be.

342
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,391
Now you see that Pokémon can be
anything a good trainer wants it to be.

343
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,811
-Yeah. Thanks a lot.
-Far Farfetch'd.

344
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,192
-See you. Let's go, Farfetch'd.
-Farfetch'd.

345
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,613
-Good luck, you two.
-Take care.

346
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,075
[gibbers]

347
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,538
[narrator] <i>Misty might have lost her</i>
<i>Pokémon for good,</i>

348
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,624
<i>but thanks to a little help</i>
<i>from Psyduck.</i>

349
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,042
Psy-ay.

350
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,586
<i>Or rather, thanks to a lot</i>
<i>of help from Psyduck.</i>

351
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,587
Psy.

352
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>Her Pokémon were returned safely</i>

353
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>and everyone learned an important lesson</i>
<i>about honesty, bravery and trust.</i>

354
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,976
[Meowth] Are you sure you want
to tell the boss about this?

355
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,605
[James] Team Rocket can't allow anyone
to steal Pokémon. That's our job.

356
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,981
[Jessie] Right, James.

357
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,441
-[Meowth] Wrong.
-[both] Huh?

358
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,528
If we tell the boss
how the kid outsmarted us,

359
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,780
he'll want to make him part
of Team Rocket.

360
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,950
-Ah, and then...
-He'll be in and we'll be out.

361
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,244
-[Meowth] Exactly.
-[both] Oh, no!

362
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,830
Then we'll just have to tell him...

363
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,249
Absolutely nothing about that kid
or Farfetch'd.

364
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,252
-[both] Okay?
-Precisely. That's what we'll do.

365
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,630
-Voltorb. Voltorb.
-Oh, no, there's one left.

366
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,798
Voltorb.

367
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,719
