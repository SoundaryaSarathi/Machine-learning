16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18

<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,600
Correct, I have already arranged
it with the committee.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,070
The cargo left from Sasebo
Port yesterday,

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,860
and is now making its way here
across the Pacific ocean.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,240
A MIG-55 D transport helicopter!

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,910
I'd never have believed I'd
get chance to fly in one.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,680
Thank God I have a buddy
like you, Shinji!

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,290
I thought you guys must be sick
of being cramped up,

29
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,420
so I just invited you on a date!

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,590
What?! Today is really a date?

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,230
I bought this cap for
today, Misato!

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,130
Where are we headed?

33
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,260
We'll take a little jaunt across the
Pacific on that gorgeous cruiser.

34
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,240
Wow! Five aircraft carriers and
four battleships! What a fleet!

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm absolutely sure the best thing
in life is having a great buddy!

36
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,310
That's your "gorgeous cruiser"?

37
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,750
Yeah, she sure is gorgeous!

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,950
That's the pride of the U.N.,
the glorious regular carrier

39
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,820
"Over the Rainbow"!

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,250
It's huge.

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,320
I'm surprised that such
a relic is still afloat.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,690
Naw, it's not so bad.

43
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,630
It's a vintage model from just
before the Second Impact.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,400
Damn, give me a break!

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,270
That shrew's gone and brought
a socket for that kid's toy,

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,390
so the little gophers
can run amuck!

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh! Cool! Awesome!

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,750
Cool! Incredible!

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,820
Cool! Mega-cool! Wow!

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,920
This is way too cool!

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,080
This kind of thing brings a tear
to the heart of a real man!

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,890
Cool! Awesome! Neat! Wow! Wow!

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,160
Hey, wait! Wait!

54
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,040
Damn it!

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,900
Stop! Stop, now!

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,680
Hello, Misato.

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,980
How have you been?

58
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,950
Fine. How 'bout you? You've
grown some, haven't you?

59
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,620
And how!

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm not just taller, my figure's
filled out as well.

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,690
Let me introduce you.

62
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,060
This is the pilot of Evangelion
Unit 02, the Second Child,

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,050
Asuka Langley Sohryu.

Arrives at Japan

67
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,390
What did you do that for?!

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,810
That's the viewing fee. Quite
a bargain, don't you think?

69
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,440
What? You think it's worth that?!
Here, take a look at mine!

70
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,940
You insolent dork!

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,050
So, which one is the famous
Third Child?

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,950
Don't tell me it's him.

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,090
Don't worry, here he is.

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,290
Well, he looks kind of dull.

75
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,900
I thought you were the leader
of this gang of Boy Scouts,

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,300
but I was obviously mistaken.

77
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you for your
understanding, Captain.

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,540
Oh no, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to baby-sit more kids.

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,150
We appreciate your assistance in
the marine transport of Unit 02.

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,310
Here are the specs for the
emergency power supply socket.

81
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,350
In the first place, I'd never
approve any request

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,490
to activate that toy while at sea.

83
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,100
Why don't you just think of this as
being prepared for an emergency?

84
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,300
That's why the Pacific
Fleet is guarding it.

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,570
When did the U.N. transform us
into a bloody cargo service?

86
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,540
It was just after a certain
organization was established.

87
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,980
Guarding a toy! What a grandiose
assignment for the Pacific Fleet!

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,680
It's still not enough considering
the importance of the Eva.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,490
Would you sign this document?

90
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,820
Not yet. Eva Unit 02 and its pilot
have been entrusted to us

91
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,760
by the Third Branch in Germany.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,000
I won't let you just waltz in,
and do as you please!

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,860
Then, when will you transfer
them to us?

94
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,670
Once we've unloaded in
New Yokosuka.

95
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,400
The ocean is our jurisdiction.

96
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,340
You will follow our orders here.

97
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,970
I understand.

98
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,940
However, I should remind you that,
in the case of an emergency,

99
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,710
our, NERV's, authority
overrides yours.

100
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,380
She's cool!

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,920
She looks like Ritsuko.

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, you're as gallant as always.

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Kaji!

104
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,120
Mr. Kaji, I must insist that you not
invite yourself onto the bridge.

105
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh, sorry about that.

106
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,990
Well, excuse us. Transport us to
New Yokosuka as ordered.

107
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,200
This is a date?
Well, excuse us. Transport us to
New Yokosuka as ordered.

108
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,960
Cool! This is just cool!
Well, excuse us. Transport us to
New Yokosuka as ordered.

109
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,670
Those kids are really going
to save the Earth?

110
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,840
Times have changed.

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,070
I understand that Congress has
pinned its hopes on that robot.

112
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,680
On that toy? Idiots!

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,240
If they've got money to blow,
they ought to give us a little more.

114
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,750
What are you doing here?!

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,390
Accompanying her.

116
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm on a business trip
from Germany.

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,000
Man, was I careless. I should
have anticipated this.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,860
Hey! Don't touch me!

119
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,370
I can't help it!

120
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,000
<i>Squadron 3 will sortie as scheduled.</i>
<i> </i>

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
<i>Squadron 3 will sortie as scheduled.</i>
<i>My God, why are you so cold?</i>

122
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:42,970

<i>My God, why are you so cold?</i>

123
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,670
Do you have a boyfriend now?
<i>My God, why are you so cold?</i>

124
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,810
Do you have a boyfriend now?
<i>Because your fire has gone out.</i>

125
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:45,940
Do you have a boyfriend now?
<i>Outside it's a red hot summer, over 100 degrees.</i>

126
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,340
That's none of your business, is it?
<i>Outside it's a red hot summer, over 100 degrees.</i>

127
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,810
How can you be so mean?
<i>Outside it's a red hot summer, over 100 degrees.</i>

128
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,940
How can you be so mean?
<i>What is this freezing cold?</i>

129
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,710
<i>My heart is below freezing.</i>

130
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,380
You're living with Katsuragi here, aren't you?
<i>My heart is below freezing.</i>

131
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,280
You're living with Katsuragi here, aren't you?
<i>My beer is frozen too. I need a coat.</i>

132
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,780
Yes.
<i>My beer is frozen too. I need a coat.</i>

133
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes.
<i>Your heart has too much air conditioning.</i>

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,520
So, tell me, is she still wild in bed?
<i>Your heart has too much air conditioning.</i>

135
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,390
So, tell me, is she still wild in bed?
<i>Why don't you raise the temperature?</i>

136
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,120
<i>Why don't you raise the temperature?</i>

137
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,190
<i>You're the air conditioner.</i>

138
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,290
Wha... wha...
<i>You're the air conditioner.</i>

139
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,290
Wha... wha...
<i>You're so stupid, venting your heat externally.</i>

140
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,990
What are you implying?!
<i>You're so stupid, venting your heat externally.</i>

141
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,090
What are you implying?!
<i>The more heat you vent, the colder my heart.</i>

142
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,130
<i>The more heat you vent, the colder my heart.</i>

143
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,990
So, she hasn't changed, has she, Shinji Ikari?
<i>The more heat you vent, the colder my heart.</i>

144
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,700
So, she hasn't changed, has she, Shinji Ikari?
<i>Then, let us warm your frozen body together!</i>

145
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,130
Well...
<i>Then, let us warm your frozen body together!</i>

146
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,260
Well...
<i>I'm sorry, you can't light my heart,</i>

147
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,730
How do you know my name?
<i>I'm sorry, you can't light my heart,</i>

148
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,300
Well, I ought to know you.
<i>I'm sorry, you can't light my heart,</i>

149
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,270
Well, I ought to know you.
<i>Put logs on my fire, and stoke me with oil.</i>

150
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,100
You're pretty famous in our business.
<i>Put logs on my fire, and stoke me with oil.</i>

151

152
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,670
The Third Child, who piloted an
Eva in battle with no training.
<i>Who is it? It can't be... Is it that guy?</i>

153
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,940
The Third Child, who piloted an
Eva in battle with no training.
<i>No, it's this puppy.</i>

154
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,640
<i>No, it's this puppy.</i>

155
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,910
It was just luck.
<i>No, it's this puppy.</i>

156
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,610
It was just luck.
<i>You're telling me that I lost to this puppy?</i>

157
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,350
Luck is a part of your destiny. It's a talent.
<i>You're telling me that I lost to this puppy?</i>

158
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,280
Luck is a part of your destiny. It's a talent.
<i>Yes, he's a good boy.</i>

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,980
<i>Yes, he's a good boy.</i>

160
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,520
Well, I'll see you later.
<i>And he's faithful, unlike some people!</i>

161
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,150
See you.
<i>And he's faithful, unlike some people!</i>

162
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,880
This has got to be a bad joke.
No, a nightmare.

163
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,060
So, what do you think about
Mister Shinji Ikari?

164
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,730
He's boring. That's the great Third
Child? What a disappointment.

165
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,430
Yet his sync ratio was well over
40% in combat with no training.

166
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,040
That can't be!

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,840
That captain's attitude
gets on my nerves.

168
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
He's got a lot of pride.

169
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,510
Too much pride's bound to make
him cynical about us.

170
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,880
That Mr. Kaji is pretty lively.

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,380
He hasn't changed at all, that jerk.

172
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,780
Hey, Third Child!

173
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,480
Come with me!

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,100
Red? I didn't know that
Unit 02 was red.

175
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,340
The color isn't the only difference.

176
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
After all, Units 00 and 01
were created

177
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,510
as part of a developing process,
prototype and test type.

178
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,340
The fact that it synchronized with
an untrained pilot like you

179
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,450
is proof of that.

180
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,880
However, Unit 02 is
a little different.

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,050
Created for actual combat
conditions,

182
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,220
this is the world's first
true Evangelion.

183
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,710
This is the final model!

184
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,520
What was that?

185
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,190
An undersea shock wave!

186
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,630
Something exploded nearby!

187
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,460
What's that?

188
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,940
Is that an Angel?!

189
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,800
Is that a real one?

190
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,970
Oh, my gosh! We've got to go
back, and find Misato.

191
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,510
This is my chance!

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

193
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,620
<i>All ships maintain formation,</i>
<i>and take evasive action!</i>

194
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,220
Status report!

195
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,430
<i>The Cymbeline's gone silent. Titus</i>
<i>Andronicus can't locate the target!</i>

196
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,160
Damn it! What in the hell
is going on here?!

197
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,630
Hello, NERV delivery.

198
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,130
Would you like to order
information on this enemy

199
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,500
and countermeasures to
use against it?

200
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,700
This is a combat situation! No
unauthorized personnel allowed!

201
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,370
This is just my opinion, but I'd say
this must be an Angel attack.

202
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,380
All ships, fire at will!

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,360
It's pointless.

204
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,760
An AT field can't be penetrated
with this kind of fire power.

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
But why is an Angel here?

206
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,930
My God, is it after Unit 02?

207
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,030
Where are you taking me?

208
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,910
Just wait there a second.

209
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,370
I can't believe this.

210
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,150
Don't peep, you pervert!

211
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,150
Sorry!
Don't peep, you pervert!

212
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,080
Don't peep, you pervert!

213
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Why are all boys such
perverted jerks?

214
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,520
Here we go, Asuka.

215
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,940
Why won't it sink?!

216
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,340
I knew it. Only an Eva can beat it!

217
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,680
Let's go.

218
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,170
Come with me!

219
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,960
Hey, what are these
entry-plug suits for?

220
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,290
Are you dense?

221
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,460
We're going to beat it
with my Unit 02!

222
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,970
No way! Do you have approval
from Misato?

223
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll get permission after
I've beaten it.

224
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,540
Now, I'll show you how
magnificent my piloting is!

225
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,640
Just don't disturb me.

226
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,890
This is odd. It seems to be
looking for something.

227
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,120
I didn't expect to see
an Angel here.

228
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,020
This isn't how it's supposed
to be, is it?

229
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,990
<i>This is what Unit 02 is for,</i>

230
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,260
<i>and I've generously provided</i>
<i>a second pilot as a reserve.</i>

231
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,800
<i>If worse comes to worst,</i>
<i>you can escape by yourself.</i>

232
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,860
I know.

233
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,813
L.C.L. Füllung!
<i>[Fill in the L.C.L.!]</i>

234
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,613
Anfang der Bewegung!
<i>[Initiating the startup sequence!]</i>

235
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,454
Anfang des Nervenanschlusses!
<i>[Connecting the neural interface!]</i>

236
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,860
Auslösen von Linksneigung!
<i>[Release of the left pitch]</i>

237
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,888
Synchro, Start!

238
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,460
Program error? What happened?

239
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,460
Thought noise! I told you
not to disturb me.

240
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,490
What do you mean?

241
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,860
You're thinking in Japanese,
aren't you? Think in German.

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,470
Oh, okay. Baumkuchen...

243
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,960
Fine, stop trying. Switch the
language to basic Japanese.

244
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,210
Evangelion Unit 02, activate.

245
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,180
<i>Telexfrom the Othello! Unit 02</i>
<i>is in the process of activation.</i>

246
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,250
What the...

247
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,580
Nice going, Asuka!

248
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,690
No! Abort the activation
sequence! Reset it!

249
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,730
I don't care! Asuka! Go for it!

250
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,500
What are you doing?! Eva and its
pilot are under our control!

251
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
You're violating my
command authority!

252
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,870
What are you talking about?
This is an emergency!

253
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,970
Who gives a damn about
your procedures?

254
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,800
You and your procedures!

255
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,440
You're not serious?!
You and your procedures!

256
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,240
You do know that Unit 02 is still
using the type-B equipment?

257
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,640
If we fall in the sea,
we're done for!

258
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,250
And if we don't, we'll
be fine, all right?

259
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,880
Shinji, are you in there too?

260
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
Yes.

261
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,380
Kids! Two kids!
Yes.

262
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,180
Kids! Two kids!
<i> </i>

263
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,020
This is a good opportunity...

264
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,380
Asuka, launch!

265
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,820
It's coming!

266
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,310
Launching!

267
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,170
Where is it?

268
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,430
That way!

269
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,040
We've only got 58 seconds left!

270
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,840
I am well aware of that! Misato!

271
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,270
Get the external power supply
socket onto the flight deck.

272
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,280
I've got it.

273
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,610
What is she going to do?

274
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,210
Here we go! Jump!

275
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,700
Jump?

276
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,240
Run!

277
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,670
<i>The power socket is in place!</i>

278
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,600
<i>Reactor connection completed!</i>

279
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,940
<i>The deck is ready for Eva landing!</i>

280
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,940
All hands, prepare for impact!

281
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,770
I can't believe this!

282
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,440
Eva 02, landing on deck!
I can't believe this!

283
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,240
Eva 02, landing on deck!
<i> </i>

284
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,890
No! What a waste!

285
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,560
<i>Target is approaching rapidly!</i>

286
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
It's coming! 9 o'clock!

287
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,250
Switching to external power!

288
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,200
<i>Switch completed.</i>

289
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,730
But we don't have any weapons.

290
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,290
The progressive knife should
be good enough.

291
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,450
It's bigger than I thought.

292
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,710
That's what I figured!

293
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,450
What are they going to do?!

294
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,220
Hand-to-hand combat is the
best way to defeat Angels.

295
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,800
Good work, Asuka!

296
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,930
This isn't a game! Look at the
mess you've made of the deck!

297
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,680
See?! It's sinking!

298
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,550
Asuka!

299
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,480
It's impossible to fight under water
with the type-B equipment!

300
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,050
You never know,

301
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,310
unless you try!

302
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,770
What a waste!

303
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,070
How much cable is left?

304
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,980
Another 1,200 meters!

305
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,550
What are you going to do?

306
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,550
We can deal with it somehow.

307
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,950
I've got to do something.

308
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,580
The cable's going to run out!
Brace for the shock!

309
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,500
Damn it!

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,300
<i>Eva missed the target!</i>

311
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,100
I've got time to change the disk.

312
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,970
My God! A Yak 38 Custom!

313
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,910
<i>Hey, Katsuragi!</i>

314
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,740
Kaji!

315
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,470
I've got something to deliver,
so I'll be taking off now.

316
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,250
Launch!

317
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,980
<i>Take care of the rest of this,</i>
<i>Captain Katsuragi.</i>

318
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,790
He ran away. I don't believe it!

319
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,980
<i>The target is approaching</i>
<i>Eva again!</i>

320
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,660
It's coming again!

321
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,350
I'll finish it off this time.

322
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,370
What?! It's not working!

323
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,900
That's because this is
B-type equipment.

324
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,570
What're you going to do?!

325
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,600
What am I going to do?

326
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,670
You're the Third Child, aren't
you? Do something!

327
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,470
Here it comes!

328
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,780
A mouth?!

329
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,250
That's because it's an Angel.

330
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,760
<i>Eva 02 has entered the</i>
<i>target's body.</i>

331
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,660
Does that mean that the
Eva's been eaten?

332
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,130
This is like fishing!

333
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,490
Fishing? Yes, fishing!

334
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,700
From a bad situation
to a worse one.

335
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,930
Shut up!

336
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,270
Hey, get off me already,
you pervert!

337
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,270
But we've got to free ourselves.

338
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,780
Asuka, do you read me?

339
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,440
Don't let go of it!

340
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,950
Captain...

341
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,150
What?

342
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm requesting your cooperation.

343
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,360
A point-blank assault by two of
the surviving battleships?!

344
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,320
Correct.

345
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,430
We'll scuttle two of the
evacuated battleships

346
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,230
on top of the umbilical
cable to set a trap.

347
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,900
When the Eva opens the target's
mouth, both ships will rush in.

348
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,240
They will fire all of their
bow turret cannons,

349
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,640
and then self-destruct,
destroying the target.

350
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,140
That's absurd!

351
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,410
Absurd, perhaps, but
not impossible.

352
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,410
I understand.

353
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,350
All hands abandon ship! Repeat,
all hands, abandon ship!

354
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,690
The frigates will rescue
the lifeboats!

355
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,660
But what about the Eva?

356
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,190
Not to worry. They'll be fine.

357
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,330
Hey! Don't use Unit 02
without my permission!

358
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,970
Do the two of you understand
the operation?

359
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll do my best.

360
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,530
I'm counting on you.

361
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,040
<i>All ships, open the Kingston valve!</i>
<i>Scuttle at point Z.</i>

362
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,140
Roger!

363
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,300
Cable reverse!

364
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,290
<i>Eva has started to surface!</i>

365
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,050

366
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,060
Hey, you're touching my... get off!

367
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,390
But we've got to open its mouth,
or we'll be killed!

368
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,770
<i>T-minus 60 to contact.</i>

369
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,670
Status on the Angel's mouth?

370
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,270
It's still not open!

No, it won't open!

375
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,970
No time left!

<i>Target has passed beneath</i>

377

Hurry! Or you won't make it!

378
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,130
Don't get any strange ideas.

379
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,960
What?

380
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,460
Anyway, just concentrate
on your thoughts.

381
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,450
You can say that again!

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,600
Open! Open! Open! Open!

386
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,750
Fire!

387
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,410
<i>Neo-Yokosuka (Old-Odawara)</i>

388
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,650
Christ! That was rather
spectacular!

389
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,220
I had to improvise. I should have
anticipated underwater combat.

390
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,490
It's rare for you to regret anything.
Is this some kind of self-analysis?

391
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,990
Cut it out. We've collected
a lot of valuable data.

392
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,980
Yeah.

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,030
Misato...

394
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,520
This really is something special.

395
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,040
A pair of... Look!

396
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,180
I don't believe this!

397
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,310
They broke their synchronization
ratio records, didn't they?

398
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,950
For only seven seconds. It must
have been due to the danger.

399
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,690
Hey, where's Kaji?

400
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,550
He ran off. That idiot's got to be
back at headquarters by now!

401
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,630
It was a pretty eventful trip.

402
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,530
Was it caused by this, I wonder?

403
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,100
It's already restored itself this far.

404
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,210
It's frozen inside dura-bakelite,
but it's still alive.

405
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,250
This is the keystone of the Human
Instrumentality Project, isn't it?

406
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,210
Correct.

407
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,350
This is the first human being.

408
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,340
Adam.

409
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,160
She may have looked cute,
but she was a real bitch.

410
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,260
Well, we won't have
to see her again.

411
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,860
Yeah, old Mister Big Shot has
to see her at work though.

412
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,420
I really feel sorry for you.

413
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,780
My name is Asuka Langley Sohryu.

414
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,470
I'm very pleased to meet you.

It's the first combination
attack with two Evas...

418
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,000
...but Shinji and Asuka's
minds are out of synch.

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Misato develops a plan to coach
them into perfect unison.

420
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,600
Next time:
"Momentarily Unite the Minds"

421
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,600
And, of course, fanservice!
