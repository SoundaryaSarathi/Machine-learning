1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,400
Hey, Nana.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,770
Do you remember
the first time we met?

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,830
I'm the type who believes
in things like fate.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,570
So I think it was fate.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,140
You can laugh if you want.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,040
When I was darkness at that time

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,880
With trembling lips

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,970
In a corner of a room I cry

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,050
The more I struggle

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,890
The more this wound deepens

11
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,050
The broken promise hurt me

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,790
Nobody can save me

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,970
God, I have only one request

14
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,590
Stop tearing apart my love

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,940
I need your love

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,170
I'm a broken rose

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,110
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,280
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,050
I need your love

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,350
I'm a broken rose

21
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,290
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,250
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,220
I wanna need your love

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,460
I'm a broken rose

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,790
I wanna need your love

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,410
You have a new message
Unopened messages: 1

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,120
Dear God! Great Buddha!
Demon Lord!

28
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,120
Shoji
The sakura has blossomed

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,720
All right!

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,860
E-Excuse me, this...

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,770
Nana! What are you shouting for?
You're working, remember?

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,170
Got into my top-choice university!!
Yay! Call me.
Nana! What are you shouting for?
You're working, remember?

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,360
Yay!

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,860
It's spring!
Spring has finally come!

35
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,700
After the long wait,
spring has arrived!

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,280
Now that I think back about it,

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,410
it was like I was running away
from home.

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,150
To Dad and Mom,
I'm going to Tokyo! I'll be in touch
as soon as I find a place,
so please send me the boxes in my room.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,550
To Dad and Mom,
I'm going to Tokyo! I'll be in touch
as soon as I find a place,
so please send me the boxes in my room.
But apparently,
my parents weren't really shocked.

40
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,150
To Dad and Mom,
I'm going to Tokyo! I'll be in touch
as soon as I find a place,
so please send me the boxes in my room.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,860
I have a sister two years
older than me

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,620
and a sister two years
younger than me.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,570
The family was already loud
as it was,

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,400
but back then,
whether awake or asleep,

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,670
I'd always nag about

46
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,330
how I "want to go to Tokyo"
or "want to live in Tokyo."

47
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,740
Perhaps my parents were
more relieved that

48
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,040
they'd hafta worry about
one less noisy daughter.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,220
When I left, I didn't feel any loneliness
for leaving my family

50
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,720
or sentiment for parting with the city
I had lived in for twenty years.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,190
I was just so happy about
going to Tokyo.

52
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,160
My heart was filled with hope
and expectations.

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,840
I'll meet your train. What time are
you arriving? Which train?
I'll wait for you at the platform.
Am I nice or what?

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,740
I'll meet your train. What time are
you arriving? Which train?
I'll wait for you at the platform.
Am I nice or what?
From now on, under the skies of Tokyo,
I'll be able to see Shoji every day.

55
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,440
From now on, under the skies of Tokyo,
I'll be able to see Shoji every day.

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,480
I can talk to him a lot, not by phone
or email, but face to face.

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,610
Thank you for using
the Tohoku bullet train today.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,890
- Due to the snow, the train's departure, .,
- What's this? It's packed.

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,660
- was delayed by 40 minutes.
- I wanna find a seat quickly,

60
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,690
- We apologize for the inconvenience.
- so I can email Shoji.

61
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,580
Um...

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,650
Um, excuse!

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,360
What? Why did it suddenly stop?
An accident?

64
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,770
Are you all right?

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,140
I'm fine. Sorry.

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm sorry too.

67
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,480
You got flattened by this, didn't you?

68
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm fine.

69
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,180
Er... by the way...
is this seat open?

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,590
Go ahead.

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,930
What a beautiful person.
More like, so cool.

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,010
She has an aura different
from that of a commoner.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,000
She's skinny and has a small face.
Could she be a celebrity?

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
And such long eyelashes!

75
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,720
I envy how the loud makeup
looks good on her.

76
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,720
Beautiful people look great,
no matter what they do.

77
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,920
Wow, a well-worn Vivienne Westwood ring!

78
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,430
So cool!

79
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,330
Sorry. Is the smoke bothering you?

80
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,560
No, I'm totally fine.

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,170
It's not moving.

82
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,670
The train.

83
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,300
It's been running like this
for a while now.

84
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,110
Is that so?

85
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,440
What am I gonna do?
I'm in a hurry.

86
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,750
Really? That's a problem.

87
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,250
No, it's all right.

88
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,780
I'll send an email.

89
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,280
Okay!

90
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,950
Wow, you're really fast!

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm amazed at what high school students
can do nowadays.

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,590
But I'm twenty years old.

93
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,730
Sorry. Then I guess we're the same age.

94
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,770
She's so cute when she laughs.

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,940
What? The same age?

96
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,930
No way, you don't look it.
That's fraud!

97
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,650
The way you said
"high school students nowadays"

98
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,910
makes you seem a lot older!

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,550
Yeah, it's a habit.
I live in the analog world.

100
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,820
An announcement to our passengers.

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Due to the snow, we will be proceeding
at low speeds for a while.

102
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,290
- We apologize for the inconvenience
- No way!

103
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,200
- this delay is causing you.
- When will we get to Tokyo?

104
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,960
What is the purpose of
your stay in Tokyo?

105
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,040
Nothing in particular.

106
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm moving there.
I'll look for a job in Tokyo.

107
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,770
Really. Same for me.

108
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,270
What, you're moving there too?

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,230
Uh-huh.

110
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,640
Really? I thought you were from Tokyo.

111
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,540
So you're not returning home
from a tour around the country.

112
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,440
A tour?

113
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,350
Like concerts.
You have a guitar, after all.

114
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,110
I figured you were
a professional musician.

115
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,020
So, are you in a band?

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,590
Back in my hometown I was.

117
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,490
That's so cool!
Where is your hometown?

118
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,060
An email.

119
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,960
Or, no, it's the phone.

120
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,070
Hello, Nana here.

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,970
Oh, Shoji? Yeah, that's right.
The train has stopped.

122
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,670
I've got no idea when we'll arrive.

123
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,940
Huh? You sure?

124
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,010
But it could be around midnight.

125
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,840
You sure it's okay?

126
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,280
Mm, thanks.

127
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,210
Then I'll call you again when I know
what time we're arriving.

128
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,890
Bye-bye.

129
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,990
Is your boyfriend from Tokyo?

130
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,790
You sure are lovey-dovey.

131
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,760
I get it.

132
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,960
So you're chasing after
a guy who moved to Tokyo.

133
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,760
You're wro--!

134
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,300
Well, I guess you're right about that.

135
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,060
Which is it?

136
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,840
Well, he's not from Tokyo.

137
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,810
We went to the same college
at our hometown.

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,950
But he came to Tokyo
a year ago to study art.

139
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,280
Why didn't you go with him then?

140
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,620
I told him that I'd go too.

141
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,030
But Shoji...
he insisted I shouldn't.

142
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,320
Why's that?

143
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,790
Because I have no objective
or money.

144
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
He says it's not wise to make
such a move without a plan.

145
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,310
I see.

146
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,930
So I tearfully stayed back and
saved up money to make the move.

147
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,250
We made a promise that if Shoji passed
the entrance exams to University,

148
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,440
then I'd move to Tokyo!

149
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,320
When I get to Tokyo,

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm gonna find a job
and give every effort

151
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,850
so he doesn't tell me to go home!

152
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,750
Say... What am I doing telling
all this to a stranger?

153
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,690
A total stranger!

154
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,660
What's wrong with that?
Tell me more.

155
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,560
From the look of things,
we've got lots of time.

156
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,560
Yeah, you have a point.

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,300
Then, will you hear me out
so we can kill time together?

158
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,340
To be honest, I was dying to talk
to someone about him.

159
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,670
His name's Shoji,
and he's kind, reliable, and pretty cool.

160
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,780
But when he talks,
he acts like a fool.

161
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,910
Like a fool?

162
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,650
Hey, wanna have some beer?

163
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,620
Sure, I would.

164
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,680
Two beers please!

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,390
Okay, then. Let's make a toast.

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
A toast to what?

167
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,360
Well...

168
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,430
To Shoji passing
the University exams!

169
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,120
No, that has nothing to do with me.

170
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,700
Then, can we at least drink
to this unique moment?

171
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,130
Hey, I like that.

172
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,870
To two girls, the same age,

173
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,600
arriving in Tokyo at the same time
on the same train.

174
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,210
That's quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

175
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,910
And to one more thing.

176
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,980
My name is Nana too, Nana.

177
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you remember
the first time we met?!

178
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,560
Before we knew it,
there was a snowstorm outside.

179
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,000
The train was stop and go
all the way,

180
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,570
and it took us five hours
to get to Tokyo.

181
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,470
But I wasn't at all bored.

182
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,810
I kept talking about myself

183
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,240
and didn't bother to ask
about you at all.

184
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,750
But knowing you,

185
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,420
you likely would've just changed
the subject or something, anyway.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,730
Nana!

187
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,630
Shoji!

188
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,220
Why are you crying?

189
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,450
You're so mean to be laughing!

190
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,820
You really had a tough time.
Five hours, right?

191
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,860
But you know...

192
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,300
What's the matter?

193
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,470
I became friends with
the girl sitting next to me.

194
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,670
Oh?

195
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,740
But she's not here, even though
we got off the train together.

196
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,170
Has she already left?

197
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,010
I should've given her
my cell number and stuff.

198
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,980
You didn't do that?
Then you can hardly call yourself friends.

199
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,490
Don't cry. Kyosuke and Junko
are waiting downstairs.

200
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,630
Jun-chan!

201
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,750
See you!

202
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,580
Good night.

203
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,550
Huh?

204
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,990
What are you doing, Nana?
Let's go.

205
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,320
Ah, right.

206
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,500
Shoji Endo

207
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,530
Shoji Endo
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
Is it all right to be staying over...

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,120
- like it's the natural thing to do?
- Come on in.

210
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,790
Though the place is a mess
since you came on sudden notice.

211
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,730
Sorry 'bout that.

212
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,500
Huh?

213
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,770
I'm being a bother by suddenly
coming like this, aren't I?

214
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,770
I was hoping to stay with Jun-chan
until I found my own place.

215
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,140
But that wouldn't be
too considerate, would it?

216
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,680
Those two are living together now.

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,090
I had no idea!

218
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,780
Jun-chan never told me!
Since when?!

219
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,490
I wonder.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,430
It was like, before I knew it,

221
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,730
Kyosuke had moved
to Junko's place.

222
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,500
I see. I never knew.

223
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,200
Hey, you've still got your shoes on!

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,100
Tokyo is not a foreign country,
you know!

225
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,270
That's totally great!

226
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,500
What?!

227
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,440
Hey, are you taking
my clothes off already? You pervert!

228
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,410
I wonder, can Shoji and I
gradually become like that too?

229
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,180
I wanna make up for
all the time we were apart.

230
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,850
I'm so happy.

231
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,960
I should be back around 6.
When you go out,
leave the key in the mailbox. Shoji

232
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,230
I should be back around 6.
When you go out,
leave the key in the mailbox. Shoji
Damn!

233
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,690
I wanted to be sure to get up early
and make breakfast for him.

234
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,630
I'll make up for it before
Shoji gets back.

235
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,770
Doing stuff like this makes me feel
like a newlywed wife.

236
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,310
Just to imagine how happy I'd be
to help him out like this every day.

237
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
This is pretty tasty.

238
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
What's with that surprised look?

239
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,890
Because you come across as the type
that doesn't do much cooking.

240
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,450
Th-That's not true.

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,990
Just joking. But this is really good.

242
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,530
I'm impressed.

243
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,130
This was worth the three hours
it took me to make it.

244
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,330
By the way, how did it go
with the real estate agent?

245
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,040
Did you find a place?

246
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,370
I didn't have time today,
so I couldn't go.

247
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,340
Why? Oh, of course.

248
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,670
You were looking for a job.
Did you find something?

249
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,110
That's right.
I've gotta look for a job.

250
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,780
Don't tell me you were sleeping
the whole time.

251
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,560
No way! I cleaned the house,
did laundry and stuff.

252
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,420
It was a super productive day!

253
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,390
You serious?

254
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,730
You didn't come all the way to Tokyo
to do that, did you?

255
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,900
You promised you'd find a job that
would allow you to make it on your own,

256
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,300
and give it every effort, right?

257
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,040
How can you say such a thing?

258
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,400
I did this all for you, Shoji!

259
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,410
I shouldn't have talked
to him like that.

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,410
It's like I'm trying to
make him feel guilty.

261
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,590
Thanks for the meal.

262
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,460
I'll clean up.

263
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,090
It's all right.

264
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,660
I can take care of myself.

265
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,630
You won't find a nice place for
fifty thousand yen a month or less.

266
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,610
If I work hard, I might be able
to afford a bit more for the rent,

267
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,010
but can't I get a better deal
on the deposit?

268
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,970
Hmm... if you don't mind living
in an older building.

269
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,580
No deposit!
And it's very reasonable for this space!

270
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,410
I can have pets, too?

271
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,090
Do you wanna go and see it?

272
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,950
Yes!

273
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,840
There it is.
That old brick building.

274
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,180
That mansion,
built long before I was even born,

275
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,480
had such a high-class feel to it.

276
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,950
I fell in love with the elegant
western design the moment I saw it.

277
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,890
The only problem was that
the seven-story building had no elevator.

278
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,730
Being a country girl,

279
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,130
the riverside location and
green environment

280
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,430
was an added bonus.

281
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,210
Huh?

282
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,810
Too bad! Someone beat us to it.

283
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,940
Would it be all right if I show
this person the place too?

284
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,980
Huh? Sorry, but that would be a problem.

285
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,420
This customer has pretty well
decided on this place.

286
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,620
Nana!

287
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,660
That's you, right, Nana?!
No way!

288
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,960
What a coincidence!

289
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,590
Who are you?

290
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,660
Am I such a forgettable person?

291
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,790
Sorry, sorry.

292
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,440
Are you all right, Nana?

293
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,660
So you do remember.

294
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,640
I didn't recognize you at first.

295
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,170
You look different with
these clothes and hairdo.

296
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,440
You don't have a fixed style,
do you?

297
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,670
So, are you two friends?

298
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,010
- Well, I wouldn't really say we're friends.
- Yes, we are!

299
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,310
Anyway, you. Miss Osaki?

300
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,680
What's your decision?
Are you renting the place?

301
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,490
I'm still thinking.

302
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,860
If you haven't made a decision yet,

303
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,020
can you please allow
this young lady to see the place?

304
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,030
The kitchen's so cute!

305
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,760
The rooms are so big!

306
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,000
You're kidding!
An old-fashioned bathtub with legs!

307
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,240
- I'll take it!
- Is that so?

308
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,180
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!

309
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,740
I found this place first!
You can't just decide like that!

310
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,220
I see. I'm sorry.

311
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,880
That's right.
What are you thinking?

312
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,790
But you seemed to be having a problem
making up your mind.

313
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,150
No, I've decided. I'll take it. Yokoi.

314
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,060
Wait a minute!

315
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,050
I'm not waiting.

316
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,190
I am tired of staying
at crappy capsule hotels.

317
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,100
I just wanna hurry up and
live any place that's available.

318
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,700
If any place will do, look elsewhere.
For me, it has to be this place!

319
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,300
What's wrong with you staying
at your boyfriend's place?!

320
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,970
Did he dump you?

321
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,270
No! But as things are now,
it's only a matter of time!

322
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,210
Why? You were all lovey-dovey
about him.

323
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,870
That's true, but let me tell you!

324
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,950
Now, come on.
Rather than discussing nonsense,

325
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,760
what are you gonna do
about renting this...

326
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,980
- Nonsense?
- Nonsense?

327
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,050
How cruel!
Here I am seriously suffering!

328
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,120
- Yokoi!
- Yes!

329
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,030
For someone in the business
of serving customers,

330
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,860
you've got no delicacy!

331
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,120
I-I'm sorry.

332
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,760
There's more to doing your job
than just go through the motions!

333
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,960
Try to pursue the romance!

334
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,660
Now, now. Calm down, ladies.

335
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,570
Romance?

336
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,870
I have a suggestion.

337
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,540
Who is this carefree old man?

338
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,370
This is Mr. Ando from
the real estate agency at the train station.

339
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,680
He's a 52-year veteran
in this business.

340
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,520
You two seem to be
special acquaintances.

341
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,550
Why don't the two of you
share this place?

342
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,260
This place is designed with
the dining room in the middle,

343
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,750
so with a room on opposite sides,
you can maintain your privacy.

344
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,160
Yet you'll be there for
each other when needed.

345
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,610
Flat-sharing can be very nice.

346
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,230
Plus, you'll only be paying
half the rent and living expenses.

347
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,800
- Half the rent?!
- Half the rent?!

348
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,180
- Half of seventy thousand yen is...
...thirty-five thousand yen?

349
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,040
- That's cheap!
- That's cheap!

350
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,850
- Let's go for it, Nana! It's like a dream...
- I guess that means...

351
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,510
- This place is great and so cheap!
- we'll hafta split our fees, too.

352
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,120
Sounds good,
but are you the kind of person

353
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,990
who properly respects
the privacy of others?

354
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,020
I will! For sure!

355
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,800
If privacy is an issue,
you can put locks on your room doors.

356
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,290
I'll arrange for that right away.

357
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,510
Thank you, Mr. Ando!

358
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,170
You are such a nice person.
Isn't he, Nana?

359
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,580
Miss Osaki,
sure it'll be cheaper,

360
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,200
but you really should think this through.

361
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,940
Sharing a flat with a stranger
is nothing but annoying.

362
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,940
I don't agree.

363
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,210
You are a lonely man,
aren't you, Yokoi?

364
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,290
Say, Mr. Ando, how soon
can the locks be arranged?

365
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,500
If I made arrangements right away,

366
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,490
then it'll be done sometime
tomorrow morning.

367
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,960
Then please.

368
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,230
I'll be moving in
tomorrow afternoon.

369
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,030
What about you?

370
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,440
Th-Then me too.

371
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,250
Then starting tomorrow,
we're roommates, Nana-chan.

372
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,770
That moment, for some reason
I felt a bit like crying.

373
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,280
I really can't explain why,
but when I shook Nana's hand,

374
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,720
the warmth was so great that
it even warmed my heart.

375
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,920
I reached into the sky

376
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,440
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

377
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,810
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

378
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:31,810
Like colorful balloons

379
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm alone

380
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,650
My hand had no place to go

381
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,290
And gently you took it

382
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,470
Starless night

383
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,660
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

384
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,470
I want to feel your warmth

385
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,340
Tears are falling down

386
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,440
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

387
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,940
Of your hand holding mine
