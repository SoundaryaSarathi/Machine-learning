4
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,939
But you don't have to be scared.

5
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,780
Only Xin Nu and I know about this.

6
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,860
We'll think of a way so that you can
become the crown prince's woman.

7
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,460
We'll use a wedding
to cover this matter up.

8
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,719
Are you really going to do that?

9
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,780
Of course. I like you.

10
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,680
Naturally, I'll help you. Don't worry.

11
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,169
Okay.

12
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,000
In any case, it is over.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,090
You may leave.

14
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,219
Thank you for saving my son.

15
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,879
I will repay you one day.

16
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,800
You don't have to.

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,020
This was entirely because of
my past relationship with Shao Xing.

18
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,389
It has nothing to do with you.

19
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,169
If you were to come to me

20
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,789
I'm afraid you wouldn't have been
able to make it to the fox den.

21
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,550
You may leave.

22
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,419
Farewell.

23
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,300
Your Majesty, you can't leave me.

24
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,000
I won't leave you.

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,870
If you leave...

26
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,219
<i>I'm embarrassing myself again.</i>

27
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,530
Your Majesty, the empress and other
concubines have been waiting a long time.

28
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,280
I should--

29
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,959
If I tell you to stay, you should stay.

30
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,670
How about I bestow you
the title Pure Consort?

31
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,779
Huh?

32
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,850
Your Majesty,
that isn't proper etiquette.

33
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,089
Is it rare for things in my harem
to not follow proper etiquette?

34
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,029
What is your name?

35
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,720
Xiao Jiu.

36
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,220
Then I'll call you Jiu'er
from now on, okay?

37
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,939
Okay.

38
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,500
The sun has set.

39
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,250
That girl should be normal.

40
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,560
Come here.

41
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,480
Master, do you want to eat dinner?

42
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,839
Take me to Handan Quarters.

43
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,339
Yes.

44
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,269
Your Highness.

45
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:45,009
Master, I have something
to discuss with you.

46
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,740
Can you go over there with me?

47
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,879
Master, look at this.

48
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,689
Master, look. Isn't it cute?

49
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,420
- A sealed-soul bell?
- Yes.

50
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,240
My previous master gave this to me.

51
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,509
It's always just sitting there.
There was not much use for it.

52
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,629
So I put it on Xiao Guai Guai.

53
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,290
It's a pity that the one in your
hands already has an owner.

54
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,370
If you keep it, it will cause trouble
if its owner looks for it.

55
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,180
That's why I wanted to
discuss it with you.

56
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,670
You're very capable.

57
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,600
Can you help me to keep Xiao Guai Guai?

58
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,490
I am a mortal.

59
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,279
I have a limited life here.

60
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,819
But when I return to the immortal world

61
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,329
I'll give Xiao Guai Guai
back to its owner.

62
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:44,509
<i>No, High God! No!</i>

63
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,269
Master, see? Xiao Guai Guai is really
excited that I'm taking care of it.

64
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:54,040
Since you call me master,
I should help you.

65
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,470
Fine. I'll talk to its master for you.

66
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,759
It shouldn't be hard
to let it stay here.

67
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,779
Really?

68
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,769
Master, you're agreeing to help me!

69
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,959
I'm not dreaming, right?

70
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,480
What are you two doing?

71
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,459
It's a new moon tonight and it's windy.

72
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:26,029
You two should come down
so that you don't scare others to death.

73
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,500
Live deities! I'm actually
seeing live deities!

74
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,439
This is my first time
seeing live deities.

75
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,560
Are you two coming here so late at night

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,899
because my father is a wise and kind
ruler who is about to go to heaven?

77
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,689
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

78
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,180
I'm here to see my wife.

79
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,420
Here... Here to see me?

80
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,240
In any case, I should leave you now.

81
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,439
See your wife?

82
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,879
You do not have to worry.

83
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,430
I erased his memory.

84
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,495
Luckily, because of your skills

85
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,560
Yuan Zhen's fate
was transferred perfectly.

86
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,980
But Dijun's fate was slightly changed.

87
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,500
I ask that you lead the way.

88
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,800
I need to find Feng Jiu
to ask for her help.

89
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,220
You're asking her to lead the way?

90
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,930
You'd be looking all night and you still
wouldn't be able to find Feng Jiu.

91
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,500
You should ask an earth deity.

92
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,269
Star Lord.

93
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,799
Take us to Handan Quarters.

94
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,080
Yes.

95
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,779
Wait.

96
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,419
My magic powers are sealed.

97
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,460
Can you use your magic to
send my disciple to his palace?

98
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,029
Qian Qian, you treat
my cousin quite well.

99
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,860
He's my only disciple.

100
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,759
Then he can't address me as cousin.

101
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,480
He'll have to address me
as master's husband.

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,659
Why are you taking advantage of this?

103
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,299
You still harbor hurt feelings because
he took liberties with your consort?

104
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,340
If you hadn't brought it up

105
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,960
I would've forgotten why he was
punished to the mortal realm.

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,919
For taking liberties with a consort
who's not really a consort

107
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,480
he was punished to the
mortal realm for 60 years.

108
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,460
Then how should he be punished for
holding my wife's hands before my eyes?

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,330
Let's go.

110
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,639
You said you came here to see your wife.

111
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,450
Why are you in such a hurry to
see Feng Jiu?

112
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,769
Si Ming came to fix
Dong Hua Dijun's fate.

113
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,860
I just came along to come see you.

114
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,360
To see me?

115
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,360
Today, His Highness called me
out of the Feast of Peaches

116
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,379
just so he could see how you had others
push Dijun into the water.

117
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,450
When Dijun finds out in the future,
I'm afraid he'll kick me down here.

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,909
When that time comes

119
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,370
the crown prince will plea
on your behalf.

120
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,830
Little Princess Feng Jiu and
Dijun's fate have come together.

121
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,879
This is the reason why
I've come to ask for your help.

122
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,480
What does this have to do with Feng Jiu?

123
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,639
Please come with me.

124
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,110
Then you will understand.

125
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,610
This way.

126
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,309
Your Highness, High Goddess, Star Lord.

127
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,450
This is Handan Quarters.

128
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,480
I will take my leave now.

129
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Okay. Go on.

130
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,470
Since His Highness has already
broken the seal on your powers

131
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,090
let's secretly head inside.

132
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,129
Yu Dang, guests are here. Pour some tea.

133
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,169
Little brat, turn around.

134
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,379
Aunt.

135
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,809
I've embarrassed myself today.

136
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,960
It's okay since you're using
Honored Lady Chen's mortal body.

137
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,529
You're not embarrassing Qing Qiu.

138
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,360
I won't tell your father.

139
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,389
But I messed up Dijun's fate.

140
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,620
His time and his life as well.

141
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,980
Why is His Highness here too?

142
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,559
Does my father know?

143
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,659
Star Lord Si Ming and I hurried over
here because we saw that you messed up.

144
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,830
Besides the people here,
no one else knows.

145
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,620
Don't worry.

146
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,320
Aunt, what do I do?

147
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,370
When Dijun was in a coma today,
he kept holding on to my hand.

148
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,970
When he woke up,
his eyes kept starring at me.

149
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,779
They were filled with such emotion
that tears were about to come out.

150
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,769
Did you see wrong?

151
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,919
Maybe it's because he was
in the water for too long

152
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,919
that it looked like tears.

153
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,940
But he said that he would
promote my rank.

154
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,720
You saved his life.
He should do that.

155
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,159
Little Princess, you mean Dijun
has already fallen for you?

156
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,690
Si Ming! What rotten fate
have you created.

157
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,009
Since Dijun has already fallen for you

158
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,259
then I can only ask that you go
along with this act with him.

159
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:52,879
What act?

160
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,210
Originally, he was to fall for
the woman who fell into the water.

161
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,470
But now, you'll have to play that part.

162
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,460
You're not going to help me think
of a way to get out of this?

163
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,340
Instead, you want me to
stay to continue this act?

164
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,759
Some friend you are.

165
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,490
Little Princess, you're the one
who messed up his fate.

166
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,970
I don't care. In any case, I don't want
to go to Taichen Palace anymore.

167
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,799
Actually, it's not Xiao Jiu's fault.

168
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,570
Maybe things turned out like this
because I altered Yuan Zhen's fate.

169
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,850
Since Little Princess is involved in this

170
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,679
if Dijun's fate goes
through a huge change

171
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,080
it'll be hard for her to avoid disaster.

172
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,000
The method I mentioned
just now is the only way.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,090
It'll continue Dijun's love fate and
help Little Princess avoid disaster.

174
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,480
Looks like there's no other way.

175
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,340
Then...

176
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,259
Then how do I continue this fate for him?

177
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,799
That's easy.

178
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,120
You just have to first give Dijun
a sweet taste of something.

179
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,950
Once you have a hold on his heart
and he becomes devoted to you

180
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,120
take out his heart and
trample it again and again.

181
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,529
You want me to trample on his heart?

182
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,480
When the time comes,
I'll give you the script.

183
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,840
It'll teach you how to
trample on his heart.

184
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,100
Aunt.

185
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,360
Your Highness.

186
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,470
How can I repay for
his kindness this way?

187
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,320
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty.</i>

188
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,179
I've broken your Two Lives Curse.

189
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,409
You can slowly repay his kindness.

190
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,100
Your Majesty.

191
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,490
You're not asleep yet?

192
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,529
I can't fall asleep.

193
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,279
I can't fall asleep either.

194
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,210
I just wanted to come see you.

195
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,940
If you were asleep

196
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,210
I would just stay here to look at
the place where you sleep.

197
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,990
It's very late at night.
You should come in.

198
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,759
I still have some things to take care of.

199
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,399
You should go back to Qing Qiu tomorrow.

200
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,590
I'll come see you in a few days.

201
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,090
Please don't be offended.

202
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,250
We snuck out of the Feast of Peaches,
so we have to hurry back.

203
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,600
I will take my leave.

204
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,159
Jiu'er, you're still not going to sleep?

205
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,149
I had such a scare today,
maybe that's why I can't fall asleep.

206
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
Then I'll play go with you.

207
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,990
I don't really know how to play.

208
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,380
No matter what you do,
I'll just give you your way.

209
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,460
<i>First you have to first give Dijun
a taste of something sweet.</i>

210
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,299
Once you have a hold on his heart
and he becomes devoted to you

211
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,450
<i>take out his heart and
trample on it again and again.</i>

212
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,839
<i>A taste of something sweet?</i>

213
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,190
<i>Back when I was in the Celestial Palace,
I couldn't get any part of his heart.</i>

214
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,980
<i>Now... what do I do now?</i>

215
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,210
Jiu'er.

216
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,369
Huh?

217
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,160
When did you enter the palace?

218
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,410
When I was 17 years old.

219
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:51,170
When I was in my resting quarters,
I was trying to recall how we first met

220
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,450
but I couldn't remember anything.

221
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,390
Even though you're already
an honored lady

222
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,740
and you have already slept with me

223
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:06,859
I can't remember the night
when you first became my wife.

224
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you hate me for it?

225
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,839
I wouldn't dare.

226
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,890
You have many things to deal with.

227
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,319
I wouldn't dare.

228
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,980
What is Your Majesty looking at?

229
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,890
I heard from the empress that

230
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,950
I doted on you back then
because you were excellent at go.

231
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,410
What?

232
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,400
After falling into the water,
you forgot how to play go?

233
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,450
Maybe Her Highness was mistaken.

234
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,700
My expertise is in cooking, not games.

235
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh?

236
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:51,319
Then when I wake up tomorrow, will I be
able to eat a meal that you've cooked?

237
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,359
Your Majesty, you're really
going to spend the night here?

238
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,539
Is something inappropriate about that?

239
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,059
No.

240
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,059
Do you blame me for giving you
the cold shoulder back then?

241
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,099
You have many things to deal with.

242
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,170
How could I dare to--

243
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,240
Is that all you know how to say?

244
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,049
<i>What should I do?</i>

245
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,180
<i>The people of Qing Qiu have
always been simple and honest</i>

246
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,640
<i>and only come together
through mutual consent</i>

247
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,710
<i>if Father finds out that Dijun and I...</i>

248
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,099
I'll give you a wedding ceremony.

249
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,599
I'll marry you again in a ceremony
according to commoner traditions.

250
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,940
Your Majesty, to do this
without conforming to palace rules...

251
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,599
If Her Highness finds out,
I'm afraid she'll blame me.

252
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,670
No one in this palace will ever dare
to make things hard for you again.

253
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,930
Crown Prince. Third Prince...

254
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,009
The message you gave Bai Feng Jiu
was full of mistakes.

255
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:23,759
Are you hiding something from me?

256
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,880
Since you've seen through me,
I'll just tell you.

257
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,380
Dong Hua Dijun went to the
mortal realm to repay her debt of love.

258
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,420
Debt of love?

259
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,309
When Bai Feng Jiu was at Taichen Palace,
she was deeply in love.

260
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,900
But Dijun and Bai Feng Jiu
aren't fated to be.

261
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,900
So Dijun went to the mortal
realm to give her a mortal love.

262
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,589
But this fate will only
last a mortal's lifetime.

263
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,829
Nothing will come out of it.

264
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:59,490
So this time, you fulfilled
Qian Qian's wish to help Yuan Zhen

265
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,549
and the wish of making Dong Hua Dijun
and Bai Feng Jiu fated to be.

266
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,460
Fortunately Bai Qian came up with this.

267
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,539
Otherwise, I'd have to think of

268
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,609
another way to make the
mortal Dijun fall for Bai Feng Jiu.

269
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,430
Your Highness.

270
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,039
Your Highness.

271
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,250
I have results for what
you had me investigate.

272
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,819
Tell me.

273
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:31,210
Those ambushed immortals
don't have much in common except...

274
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,890
they're all of high immortal rank.

275
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,789
High immortal rank?

276
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,710
Aunt, you're back.

277
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,630
Mi Gu, without me sending
you on errands these days

278
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,130
you've been living quite freely.

279
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,539
Aunt, you came back yesterday
and took care of something big.

280
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:02,220
Why are you saying it
like you just came back?

281
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,710
I was still in the mortal realm
yesterday. When did I come back?

282
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:10,079
That's not right. You came back...

283
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,180
I think you told me to stay at Fox Den
and not go anywhere else.

284
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,019
Who put an enchanting spell on you?

285
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:24,259
Enchanting spell?
There's no enchanting spell.

286
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,210
What happened?

287
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,809
Aunt, you're finally back!
Something horrible happened.

288
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,759
Xuan Nu took on your appearance
and took away Mo Yuan's body

289
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,079
and Imperial great-grandson!

290
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,049
Fan, I'm afraid you'll get a taste
of blood again today.

291
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,099
Aunt!

292
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,819
Why am I so inept?
How could I let her go alone?

293
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,180
What should I do?

294
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,529
Crown Prince. Yes, Crown Prince!

295
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,829
Celestial high immortals
keep getting killed.

296
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,410
It must be because of that sick child
born to the ghost queen.

297
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,180
What?

298
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,210
It's a sinister kind of magic.

299
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,180
In the ancient times,
there was a woman named Jie Yu.

300
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,109
Because her murder aura was too strong
all the children she birthed were ill.

301
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,509
So she came up with an idea.

302
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,539
She murdered high immortals

303
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,049
and turned their bodies into an elixir
for her sick children to take.

304
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,000
Her children were able to recover.

305
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,599
How could such vicious magic exist?

306
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,960
To be able to control so many puppets

307
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,619
and to have the audacity
to kill high immortals...

308
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,220
I don't think it's Ghost Lord Li Jing.

309
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,140
Rather, it must be
the Ghost Queen Xuan Nu

310
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,160
who betrayed Kunlun Mountain and
the Celestial Tribe 70,000 years ago.

311
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,920
If it's Xuan Nu's doing, Li Jing must be
somewhat responsible as well.

312
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,650
I'll go and report this
to Father right now.

313
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,450
Third Uncle, wait.

314
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,329
This is a huge matter between two tribes.

315
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,769
We can't come to a conclusion
solely from my speculation.

316
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,950
Wait until I go to Grand Ziming Palace
to investigate.

317
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay. Then let's go together
after the Feast of Peaches.

318
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,740
<i>This entrance to the palace was
heavily guarded 70,000 years ago.</i>

319
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,900
<i>But today, no one is here to guard it?</i>

320
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,079
<i>Xuan Nu, are you inviting me in?</i>

321
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,369
Your Highness, Qing Qiu's
Mi Gu would like to see you.

322
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,809
Bring him in.

323
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,259
Yes.

324
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,539
Your Highness.

325
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,210
Your Highness, please help Aunt.

326
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,940
She went to Grand Ziming Palace
all alone.

327
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,970
What did you say?

328
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,769
The Ghost Queen stole High God Mo Yuan's
body and Imperial Great-Grandson.

329
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:32,880
Aunt's eyes were red with
fury and went over there.

330
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,059
Your Highness...

331
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
Who is that tree spirit?

332
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,160
How dare he intrude
during the Feast of Peaches?

333
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,380
What unacceptable behavior.

334
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,410
See? Because of that woman

335
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,490
His Highness doesn't respect
Celestial customs.

336
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,789
If you really marry into
Xiwu Palace in the future

337
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:00,059
you must not be that way.

338
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,660
Yes.

339
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,440
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun!

340
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,329
Go back to the palace!

341
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:30,579
Qian Qian, I trust you've been well
since we last met 70,000 years ago.

342
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:34,119
I heard His Majesty say that Si Yin
is a woman from the fox tribe

343
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,619
so I guessed it was you.

344
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:41,309
When I first saw Si Yin
at Kunlun Mountain, I was stunned

345
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:47,049
that someone else in this world
resembles Qian Qian more than I do.

346
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,049
You say you resemble me?

347
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:59,359
Did you forget what
you used to look like?

348
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,019
It just so happens that Zhe Yan of the
Ten Miles of Peach Woods

349
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:08,000
has had a lot of free time lately.

350
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,819
Why don't we invite him over
to help you remember?

351
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:15,630
No matter what you say,
I will take your life today.

352
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,740
Then no one would look the same as me.

353
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,750
Yesterday, I took Mo Yuan's
body and your son.

354
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,480
I knew you'd come find me.

355
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,380
I've been waiting here
for you the whole time.

356
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,529
You've been preserving
Mo Yuan's body quite well.

357
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:42,750
I'm really happy about it.

358
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,779
My son will get
High God Mo Yuan's vitality.

359
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:53,069
Because of your contributions,
I'll have them kill you quickly.

360
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:56,819
That depends on whether
you have the ability to do so.

361
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,009
<i>Her eyes aren't good.
Is she afraid of the light?</i>

362
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,799
<i>What a blessing.</i>

363
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,819
Seeing you covered in wounds
really makes my heart ache for you.

364
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,910
Who will you call upon to save you now?

365
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,509
Since things have come to this,
I'll tell you this.

366
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:27,809
Back then, I used your face to get
His Majesty to sleep with me.

367
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,400
So what if you can take on my appearance?

368
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,119
You're just deceiving yourself.

369
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,329
I've loved His Majesty for thousands of
years, yet he can't forget about you.

370
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,170
Today, I'll take your life.

371
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,950
Then, I'll be the only one
in the world with this face.

372
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,950
Naturally, His Majesty
will protect me forever.

373
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,130
Let me tell you something, Xuan Nu.

374
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,049
As a high goddess,
even if I close my eyes

375
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,359
I'll still be able to wipe out
these useless people by your side.

376
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:16,500
Kill her for me.

377
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,611
Qian Qian.

378
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:02,121
If you came an hour earlier,
I wouldn't have been injured like this.

379
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,490
I'm sorry for coming late.

380
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:19,541
Tell me who injured you.

381
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:23,811
I've already killed everyone
who injured me.

382
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,251
That woman is the only one left.

383
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:35,141
Do you want to take care of it yourself
or do you want me to help you?

384
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:39,630
She humiliated my master
and hurt my loved ones.

385
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,621
I will finish her myself.

386
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,920
- A-Yin?
- Your Majesty.

387
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,581
Your Majesty, I'm Xuan Nu.

388
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,731
Why do you look just like A-Yin?

389
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,630
Exactly the same, right?

390
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,510
Your Majesty, if we just
kill that wench Bai Qian

391
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:15,601
then I'll be the only one
in this world with this face.

392
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:19,061
If you like it,
you can stare at me all day.

393
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,780
I'll also keep protecting you.

394
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:26,900
You... What's going on?

395
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,900
That woman took my master and your son.

396
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,420
He's also your son.

397
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,331
Son?

398
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:39,550
Your Majesty, our son will
get better soon.

399
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,221
Really.

400
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,931
Look. Look at Mo Yuan.

401
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,380
We'll turn him into an elixir.

402
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,190
You Majesty, you were jealous of
Mo Yuan in the past, right?

403
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,001
You don't have to be jealous any more.

404
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:56,451
Our son will have
Mo Yuan's vitality soon.

405
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,150
Shut your mouth.

406
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,150
Am I wrong?

407
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,811
You didn't give the soul jade
to Bai Qian back then

408
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,510
because you were
jealous of Mo Yuan, right?

409
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,820
Your Majesty, you don't know yet, do you?

410
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,621
She is Si Yin.

411
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,771
Xuan Nu, let me tell you something.

412
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:18,490
My master's body is extremely precious.

413
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,411
It's received blood from
my heart for 70,000 years.

414
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,621
I'm afraid your son won't
be able to handle that.

415
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:26,811
Blood from your heart?

416
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:28,740
You mean...

417
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,911
Li Jing, let's not talk about
your past for the time being.

418
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:39,740
I want to ask you how you plan
on taking care of today's matters.

419
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,440
Do you want to do it
privately or publicly?

420
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,050
What happens if it's private?
What happens if it's public?

421
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,940
If privately, then pull the limbs of
and skin your ghost queen

422
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,400
who doesn't know her place,
to alleviate my anger.

423
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,840
If publicly, the Celestial soldiers
haven't fought a battle in a long time.

424
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,661
They have a lot of free time.

425
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:05,130
We can use this opportunity to see

426
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,811
whose army has been training better
after all these years.

427
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,291
Your Majesty, are you really going
to punish me that harshly?

428
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,820
No, right?

429
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,420
Your Majesty, did you forget?

430
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,661
Did you forget all the
things I've done for you?

431
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:30,780
Without me, would you be ghost lord?

432
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:38,661
He wouldn't dare to deploy troops!
He wouldn't dare.

433
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,621
Don't think I don't know that you
wouldn't dare to deploy troops.

434
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,900
You don't have that power!

435
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,521
You're just the Celestial Crown Prince.

436
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:53,300
Heavenly Lord wouldn't agree to deploy
the troops for the sake of one woman.

437
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,931
I'm not deploying troops
for the sake of one woman.

438
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:00,661
High God Mo Yuan is a highly-respected
God of the Celestial Tribe.

439
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:03,010
High Goddess Bai Qian
is the future Heavenly Empress.

440
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,320
And A-Li will succeed
my position in the future.

441
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,701
Right now, these three people

442
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:12,041
have suffered extraordinary
humiliation at Grand Ziming Palace.

443
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:17,221
Do you think the Celestial soldiers
will just let this slide?

444
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:28,610
Xuan Nu was always a little crazy.

445
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,900
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
made such a grave mistake.

446
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,541
Your Majesty.

447
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,271
I ask that Your Highness show mercy.

448
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,130
Qian Qian.

449
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,590
Do you think we should show mercy?

450
00:38:54,161 --> 00:39:01,570
Celestial Crown Prince, so much for
you treating that wench Bai Qian so well.

451
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,590
You don't know, do you?

452
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,431
She and her master...

453
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,710
Qian Qian said her face
looks like yours...

454
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:23,380
But I don't see any similarities at all.

455
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:33,391
I didn't mind giving you
my appearance back then.

456
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:38,090
But now that I see you
using this appearance

457
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,780
it really makes me unhappy.

458
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,041
What are you going to do?

459
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,650
What are you trying to do?

460
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,490
I've always had this appearance.

461
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,481
Don't even think about
taking away my beauty!

462
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:55,420
I wouldn't be scared of you even
if you brought Zhe Yan here.

463
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,920
Why would I bring Zhe Yan here?

464
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,780
I was just joking with you back then.

465
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,210
Did you really think Zhe Yan
is the only one in the world

466
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,641
who can use magic to change appearances?

467
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:19,231
I'm not talented but I had nothing to do
these past 70,000 years

468
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:22,740
so I became proficient
at this kind of magic.

469
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,791
If you're really going to be skinned
and have your limbs pulled

470
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:30,041
you shouldn't have this appearance
while going through that.

471
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,150
What are you going to do? No! No!

472
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,550
No!

473
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,641
Go take a good look at your face.

474
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,001
I told you

475
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,860
if you use Zhe Yan's
magic to do evil deeds

476
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,271
it'll come back to bite you.

477
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,760
Qian Qian, can you take care of yourself?

478
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,990
If you can't, just sleep for a bit.

479
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,210
Li Jing.

480
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,311
You do as you see fit.

481
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,150
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

482
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,871
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

483
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:37,771
This is what I look like!
This is what I look like!

484
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,981
I don't want to see this face!
I don't want to!

485
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:06,221
