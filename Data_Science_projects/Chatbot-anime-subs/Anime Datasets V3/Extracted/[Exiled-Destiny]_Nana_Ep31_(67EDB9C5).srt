1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,900
I knew that Ren wanted a child.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,300
I also knew that having a child
wouldn't stop me from singing.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,340
I think I just didn't have the confidence
to become a mother.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,870
Blinking eyes call the wind

5
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:46,510
A smile clears all the noise away

6
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,070
The angel in your eyes whispers

7
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,250
"Everything begins now"

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,490
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

9
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,290
It's like being caught in a wave

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,460
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

11
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,930
Breath held, arms reaching out

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,170
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,810
You're the only one I can see

14
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,750
Baby my wish on a wing

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,720
This sky is torn

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,120
By a single overflowing word

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,150
REN
FROM 1:00 A.M.
PLEASE RECORD "HUTCH" FOR ME.

18
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,850
You're here again?

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,550
You're the one who called me over!

20
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,220
Did you videotape it?

21
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,730
You keep making such dumb excuses
to get me to come over every day!

22
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,660
What do you mean dumb excuses?

23
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,960
We were both orphans, too.

24
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,070
Watch it,
and you're sure to be in tears.

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,070
Cry on your own!
I'm going to sleep.

26
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,780
Good morning.

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,540
How are you feeling today,
Miss Hachiko?

28
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,110
Fine. Sorry if I made you worry.

29
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,710
I think it's just the summer heat
getting to me,

30
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,220
but I'll go see a doctor
just in case.

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,050
I'd better get well soon or
I won't be able to go to work, right?

32
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,950
That's a good idea!
I'll come with you!

33
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,350
What are you saying?

34
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,360
You need to stay here and
finish your homework today.

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,860
Please don't remind me
about that.

36
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,700
Now, stay focused.
I'll help you when I get back.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,230
Thank you so much.

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,210
Also, please don't tell
Nana or the others

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,250
that I'm not feeling well, okay?

40
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,040
It's an important time for them
with their debut coming up,

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,020
so I don't want them
worrying about me.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,310
But I'll be returning home tomorrow.
Will you be all right on your own?

43
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,320
You should at least talk with
Miss Nana and have her look after you.

44
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,060
Thanks, but I'll be all right.

45
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,400
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,370
Miss Komatsu. Miss Nana Komatsu.

47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,810
Your urine test came back positive.
When was your last period?

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,180
July sixteenth.
It lasted about five days.

49
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,410
Should you be pregnant,
are you planning on keeping it?

50
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,530
We'll begin with a pelvic examination.
Over there please.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,790
Please come in, Miss Komatsu.

52
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,310
Please take off your underwear
and sit on the examination table.

53
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,650
You may keep your skirt on.

54
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,940
Ah, yes.

55
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,830
I don't deal well with
inconveniences like that.

56
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,710
Miss Komatsu, please relax.

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,050
I'll be waiting faithfully.

58
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,850
You are pregnant.

59
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,390
This small black circle you see
is the sack that contains your baby.

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,890
And the little dot you see
inside it is your baby.

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,560
Now, we count the first week
from the day of your last period

62
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
as week zero,

63
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,770
so you're in the middle
of your sixth week.

64
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,770
If you're planning on keeping
your child,

65
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,580
come for another check-up
in two weeks.

66
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,320
If you wish to have an abortion,

67
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,910
the sooner the better
for your body's sake.

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,820
Would you like to take home
the photo?

69
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,130
Yes.

70
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,750
What? He grew up abroad?

71
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,010
Where?

72
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,780
I didn't get around to asking him.
So you didn't know either.

73
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,050
Did you know about it?

74
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,920
No. I heard about it from
Misato as well,

75
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,320
and was surprised at first.

76
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,760
But thinking back, for one,

77
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,950
he didn't know about
the Tanabata festivities.

78
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,900
This explains some things
I thought were odd about him.

79
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,370
Yeah, I guess so.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,300
But if his parents are Japanese,

81
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,430
I'd think they would've at least
told him about Tanabata.

82
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,070
Are you ready to order?

83
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,210
Have you decided, Miss Hachiko?

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
I'll have the grapefruit juice.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,250
Aren't you eating?

87
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,470
I'm not hungry.

88
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,180
Really? Also, two mixed sandwiches
and two café au laits.

89
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,220
All right.

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,120
Miss Nana, would it be
possible for you

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,180
to return to your home for
a while starting tonight?

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,200
The truth is, Miss Hachiko hasn't
been feeling well lately.

93
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,660
Really? Is that why you look like
you're under the weather?

94
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,270
Oh, but it's just the summer heat.
I'm all right.

95
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800
The doctor said so, too.

96
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,460
It's bad enough that
you had to see a doctor?!

97
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,270
That's definitely not all right!

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,340
But the doctor said I'm fine,
so it's all right.

99
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,310
That's not the issue here.

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,180
All right, Misato. I'll return home
starting tonight, so don't worry.

101
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,940
Yes. Thank you very much.

102
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,780
Oh, going back to what
I was saying about Shin...

103
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,760
I assumed he was half Japanese.
So without thinking, I told him

104
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,360
I wasn't convinced that
his parents were both Japanese.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,370
Then he told me
he wasn't convinced either.

106
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,440
That his parents shouldn't have
given birth to him.

107
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,180
Miss Hachiko and I were discussing that

108
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,550
that sorta thinking is like him
denying his own existence.

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,620
I'll come back to get you, Nana, okay?

110
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,860
I'll be back right away.

111
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,740
No. Denying his parents and
denying his own existence

112
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,430
are two different issues.

113
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,380
Shin's not a kid anymore.

114
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,610
He should be capable of figuring out
why he deserves to exist.

115
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,810
You think so?

116
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,540
If we put our minds to it,

117
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,750
we're all capable of determining
our own fates.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,190
Right now, he's got the purpose
in life to work hard

119
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,490
toward the band's debut.

120
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,750
You're right! A purpose in life!

121
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,450
Here you are.

122
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,090
Me too.

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,190
Ever since I found
my purpose in life,

124
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,990
to become a die hard BLAST fan,
my life has been nothing but roses.

125
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,170
Roses?

126
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,000
ROSES!
Roses?

127
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,930
Well then, Miss Nana, Miss Hachiko...

128
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,800
I am really grateful for
your hospitality.

129
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,840
Please give my regards
to the band members.

130
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,610
Take care, Misato.
Come stay with us again anytime.

131
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,350
We'll definitely become
Japan's number one band.

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,380
For the sake of
your purpose in life, too.

133
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,800
What are you crying for?

134
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,100
You made her cry on purpose.
Come on, Nana!

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,110
Misato, you would always come
to our shows alone,

136
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,440
ever since you were in
junior high school.

137
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,440
I was always worried about that.

138
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,450
Back home, you probably don't
get along with your parents,

139
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,350
and you didn't seem to have
any friends to speak of.

140
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,410
But for you to say out loud
what others may consider foolish,

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,120
that this is your purpose in life,

142
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,860
you have no idea how much
it means to me.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,130
Please understand that, Misato.

144
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,100
Now, regarding the situation
with Shin's family...

145
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,670
Am I the only one who believes
Shin was probably a child

146
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,330
that resulted from
his mother's affair abroad,

147
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,670
leading to his family falling apart?

148
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,450
I wonder.
It certainly seems possible.

149
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,580
But why did she have the baby?

150
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,250
It's such a gamble not knowing
who the father is.

151
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,420
Even if the guy she was having
the affair with was using protection,

152
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,290
you can never really be sure,
can you?

153
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,160
When people get carried away
with passion and lose reason,

154
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,700
you're not always as careful
as you should be.

155
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,990
Regardless, whatever the situation,

156
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,440
there's no doubt that Shin's parents
are being irresponsible.

157
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,400
If they're not able to raise
a child properly,

158
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,630
they shouldn't have
given birth to him.

159
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,240
No, I haven't seen her
since I was four.

160
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,050
She ran off with a guy.

161
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,710
There are too many
mothers in this world

162
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,940
who think giving birth
is a joke.

163
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,920
I don't think she thought
it was a joke.

164
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,900
Maybe there was a reason
she couldn't raise him right.

165
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,530
Maybe there were circumstances
beyond her control.

166
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
It's only natural that
an expectant mother

167
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,940
would wanna give birth
and raise her child.

168
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,100
Why is it only natural?

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,210
Well, you see...

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,910
I can't really explain it.

171
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,020
Like, maternal instinct?

172
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,050
Is something wrong?

173
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,650
No. I've been so busy,

174
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,020
I thought I'd come to get them
when I can,

175
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,060
in case I'm not able to
come when I need to.

176
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,020
Then should I write you
a two month prescription?

177
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,540
What's the matter?

178
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,070
Um, this may be
a strange thing to ask, but...

179
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,740
I'm not so sure what people mean
when they talk about maternal instinct.

180
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,080
Is it something every woman
normally has?

181
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,880
I believe so.
It's a female instinct, after all.

182
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,690
However, just because all women
have it within them

183
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,790
doesn't mean all women use it.
I think that applies to anything.

184
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,910
I believe it's something within a woman

185
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,240
that is awakened by
the woman's situation and needs.

186
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,740
Then, if for example,
I was expecting Ren's baby right now,

187
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,810
would I wanna give birth
even though I'd know

188
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,150
it would be nothing but trouble
just before my professional debut?

189
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,630
And not for Ren's sake,
but due to my instinct?

190
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,970
That's just not possible.

191
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,300
My stomach hurts.

192
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,640
Why does your stomach hurt
like this every day?!

193
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
Do you hate to practice
that much?!

194
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,410
I hate you, Nana!

195
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,120
Hachi would be
a lot kinder to me!

196
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,590
I wanna see Hachi!
Why won't she come to the studio?!

197
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,390
Because she doesn't wanna
bother us.

198
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,060
This isn't some playground, after all.

199
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,390
But Mr. Kawano said it's okay.

200
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,370
He may have said so,

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,730
but still, you'd normally
feel uncomfortable coming.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,860
That's not fair, Nobu.
Keeping Hachi all to yourself.

203
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,570
I haven't seen her since the day
of the fireworks either!

204
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,840
Huh? Why?

205
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,910
We've got band practice until
late every night,

206
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,610
and we both work during the day.

207
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,040
We have no time to meet.

208
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,510
But she'd come see you
every night until recently.

209
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,710
She won't come even if I ask.

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,190
She's probably having her period.

211
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,760
CONVINCED

212
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,390
You went together with Nana
to see Misato off today, right?

213
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,560
You should've insisted on
having her come today.

214
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,530
No, she wasn't looking too well.

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,870
What do you mean
she wasn't looking well?!

216
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,630
It's just summer heat fatigue.

217
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,170
I guess that's what the doctor said, too.
She'll be fine.

218
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,600
It's bad enough she had
to see a doctor?

219
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,470
Bye.

220
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,010
If you wanna become number one,

221
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,310
be prepared to not take a break
even to be by your parents' deathbed.

222
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,720
I don't like this strict band...

223
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,420
SHE'S A MANIACAL COACH.
I don't like this strict band...

224
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,320
Hey, Shin! Where are you going?!

225
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,250
I told you, my stomach hurts!

226
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,460
Does he really wanna do this?

227
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,760
At least let him go to the bathroom
when he has to.

228
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,150
You seriously lack the sense
of kindness to others!

229
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,670
And you guys lack the sense
to be suspicious of others.

230
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,130
Or maybe Shin's body reacts funny
when the nicotine level gets low,

231
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,070
and he gets a stomachache.

232
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,550
I enjoyed commuting to that
cheap studio we used before a lot more.

233
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,820
I could smoke and
Hachi was there, too.

234
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,020
Like I said, Mr. Kawano...

235
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,420
It's ludicrous to try and

236
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,190
make a top-selling band
outta some punk band.

237
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,030
I know it's a dream you've had
for a long time,

238
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,070
but during these tough times,

239
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,840
you've gotta realize that the company's
not about to invest in a risky new band.

240
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,740
But there aren't any competitors
in the same genre.

241
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,040
If they do well, this'll be big.

242
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,210
And the sheer presence of Nana,
the vocal, is simply breathtaking.

243
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,410
Sure, overall, they're
a visually attractive band,

244
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,920
but punks in bondage outfits
are so outdated.

245
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,380
BONDAGE

246
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,290
Actually, I think it's a fresh look
for teenagers.

247
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,760
I used to dress like that
when I was young.

248
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,030
I was leaner, too.

249
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,900
NOSTALGIC
I was leaner, too.

250
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:05,930
NOSTALGIC

251
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,400
NOSTALGIC
Well, we could always hire a stylist

252
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,430
NOSTALGIC

253
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,470
NOSTALGIC
and get their fashion up to date.

254
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,230
and get their fashion up to date.

255
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,430
I wouldn't want that!

256
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,160
...but the main problem
is their sound.

257
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,540
It's not bad, but it's too ordinary.

258
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,370
They may be popular performing live,

259
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,740
but on a CD, their music
will lack any true impact.

260
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,980
But that's where you as
the director need to show your skills.

261
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,750
If we can't get a decent budget
to promote them,

262
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,980
I can't find the motivation.

263
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,790
I wish you'd
give this up already.

264
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,830
If they're not able to raise
a child properly,

265
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,070
they shouldn't have
given birth to him.

266
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,880
There are too many
mothers in this world

267
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,910
who think giving birth
is a joke.

268
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,210
NOBU
I'M ON MY WAY HOME.
WE JUST FINISHED PRACTICE.
I HEAR YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL.
IF YOU'RE STILL AWAKE GIVE ME
A CALL AND I'LL COME BY.

269
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,160
If you wish to
have an abortion,

270
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,160
the sooner the better.

271
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,140
I'll return home starting tonight,
so don't worry.

272
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,420
Nana?

273
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,010
It's me.

274
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,800
Nana, open up.

275
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,060
Please open the door.

276
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,970
Oh, shoot!
Someone's coming!

277
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,110
Don't believe a thing I say.

278
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,080
What are you doing here? Go home!

279
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,590
At times like this,

280
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,130
what's the best thing to do
if I don't wanna leave?

281
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,940
Hey, this isn't funny.

282
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,550
Hey, are you all right?

283
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,030
Do you wanna see a doctor?

284
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,090
Morning sickness?

285
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,690
I won't keep it, so don't worry!

286
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,080
There's no need for you
to feel responsible, Takumi.

287
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,940
I'm the foolish one.

288
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,110
And of course, this child could
be my boyfriend's.

289
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,520
Go home.
And don't come back again.

290
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,620
Is your boyfriend Nobu?

291
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,130
All right. I get it.

292
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,680
Takumi?

293
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,870
What are you doing?

294
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,620
A cell phone?

295
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,180
Hey...

296
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,690
Takumi...

297
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,620
NOBU

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,490
Don't tell Nobu!

299
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,140
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE

300
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,040
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE
Garlic is the best for
summer heat fatigue.

301
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,370
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE

302
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:39,810
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE
Are you thinking of
coming with me?

303
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,170
Are you thinking of
coming with me?

304
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,410
She didn't call you,
so she must be sleeping.

305
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me at least see
her sleeping face.

306
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,180
HACHI

307
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,350
HACHI
Telepathy!

308
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,380
HACHI

309
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,720
HACHI
I got it, so answer already!
You're so annoying!

310
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,290
Hello!

311
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,650
Oh, Nobu?
It's Takumi.

312
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,230
What is it?

313
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,230
Hey, can you hear me?

314
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,800
Yes.

315
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,440
Nana's pregnant.

316
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,770
I don't know if it's yours or mine,
but regardless,

317
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,410
if Nana wants to keep it,

318
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,210
I intend on becoming its guardian
and raising it as my own.

319
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,930
What do you think?

320
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:48,700
You know, Hachi. I still believe
life is what we make of it.

321
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,000
But I'm now able to recognize that

322
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,680
not everyone can be strong
all the time.

323
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,950
Because of that,

324
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,510
I've become that much kinder
than I was back then.

325
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,060
I can't count
how many nights

326
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,830
I wished tomorrow
would never come

327
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,600
To live as I am
without being fake

328
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,200
What do I need

329
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,350
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

330
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,520
The answer is
too close to see

331
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,760
Black tears are
falling down

332
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:53,710
I have nothing,
only sadness

333
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,800
I can't put it
into words

334
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,880
My whole body
starts to ache

335
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,290
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
