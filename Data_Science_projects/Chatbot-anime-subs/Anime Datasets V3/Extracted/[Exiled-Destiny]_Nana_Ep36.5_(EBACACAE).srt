1
00:00:03,272 --> 00:00:04,902
Say, Nana Komatsu.

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,542
We used to spend
so much time together,

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:10,032
but I didn't understand you one bit.

4
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:15,122
Well, you see... to understand you
is usually impossible!

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,322
So give me a break, will you?

6
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:33,772
Blinking eyes call the wind

7
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:41,412
A smile clears all the noise away

8
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:47,972
The angel in your eyes whispers

9
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:53,152
"Everything begins now"

10
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,392
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

11
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:59,192
It's like being caught in a wave

12
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,362
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

13
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,832
Breath held, arms reaching out

14
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:12,072
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

15
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:16,712
You're the only one I can see

16
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:20,652
Baby my wish on a wing

17
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,622
This sky is torn

18
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:29,022
By a single overflowing word

19
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:57,122
Hello! Welcome to Junko's room.

20
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:00,512
Long time no see. I wonder what
customers we'll have today.

21
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,682
Welcome!

22
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:06,832
Wow! I've wanted to come here
for so long! "Junko's room"!

23
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,702
Um, who are you?

24
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:13,192
Ooh, Naoki of Trapnest. Welcome.

25
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,672
Oh, right. Welcome. But wait.

26
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:17,672
Why is a guy with a bigger role here?!

27
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,402
Could it possibly be,
you're here because...

28
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:22,302
- Naoki, is your role in jeopardy?!
- Naoki, is your role in jeopardy?!

29
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,212
Papa-rakkyo!

30
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:27,282
Oh, don't worry about this.

31
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:31,012
He's like a zashiki warashi or jizo statue
of Junko's room.

32
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:31,722
Really?

33
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,152
Who are you calling a jizo statue?!

34
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,462
You know,
I'm being treated terribly lately.

35
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:39,532
In the last "Junko's room," I was here...

36
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:42,122
- By the way, isn't Hachiko here today?
- but didn't have a single line.

37
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,822
By Hachiko,
do you mean Nana Komatsu?

38
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,862
Yeah. I hear she's quite something.

39
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,102
She's not only a great strategist,
but she's a great cook and great in bed.

40
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:54,572
In addition, she thinks of Takumi
and Takumi only.

41
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,012
- Um...
- I wonder about that.

42
00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:58,672
Huh?

43
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:00,912
Why don't we watch the video?

44
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:09,852
Hey, Hachi...

45
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:27,642
That Takumi is so annoying.
Hachi is our pet.

46
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:28,842
Don't talk of her like she's a dog.

47
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,312
But doesn't it piss you off?
Get her back, Nobu.

48
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:33,752
You like Hachi, don't you?

49
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,392
It may have very well happened
in the heat of the moment,

50
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:41,152
but knowing Hachi, she may become
more and more serious about him.

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,092
But if Takumi continues treating
this relationship in that manner,

52
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,332
Hachi is obviously gonna get hurt.

53
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:51,292
Are you okay with that, Nobu?
I don't like it one bit.

54
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,272
If you want her, go for it.

55
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:31,942
I'm sorry about suddenly
coming over last night

56
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,412
and blurting out weird nonsense.

57
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,612
So, now that I've come to
see you like this again,

58
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,282
this time I'm gonna be direct with you.

59
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:52,862
I love you.

60
00:04:55,502 --> 00:05:00,132
I know that I'm not being fair
by saying this now.

61
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,062
Since I know about you and Takumi.

62
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,412
I'm sorry. You didn't come
to the studio today

63
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:12,282
even if you wanted to because
of what I said, right?

64
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,322
I'm sorry, that's not it!
I was working today!

65
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:19,182
I don't mind, so please drop by
like you've been doing.

66
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,592
Everyone feels a bit lonely
without your presence, Hachi.

67
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:23,392
Actually, it's me who gets sad.

68
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:26,952
Thank you.

69
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:30,952
Thank goodness.

70
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,772
That's good enough for me.

71
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,242
Nobu! Thank you for
walking me home.

72
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:15,782
Huh?

73
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,542
I'll be fine on my own from here on.
I'm almost home.

74
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,412
I'm sorry for having you take
a longer route home

75
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,782
in order to walk me home every day.

76
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,622
No, I don't mind it.

77
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:25,212
Nana!

78
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:32,652
Well, well. It's you.

79
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,822
Well, thank you very much for that.

80
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:37,332
Okay, then. Thank you, Nobu.

81
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,542
Good night.

82
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:46,302
I can't take it anymore.

83
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,212
What's the matter?

84
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,042
Nothing! It's none of your business!

85
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:56,212
Um, sorry. Please leave me alone.

86
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,592
Shin.

87
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,762
A man and a woman are
simply opposing creatures

88
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,322
driven toward each other by lust.

89
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,592
Can they be connected by love?

90
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,602
Sorry, I don't know either.

91
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:23,112
- Yes.
- Takumi, .,

92
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,252
I wanna see you.

93
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:44,262
Nana...

94
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,252
- Thank you!
- F-For what?

95
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,052
I thought you would
never talk to me again.

96
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:15,392
So I'm glad that you came tonight.

97
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,292
What are you talking about?

98
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,632
That's nonsense.
Of course I'd talk to you.

99
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:22,462
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:25,732
Why are you apologizing?
You've done nothing wrong.

101
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,142
That's not true.

102
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:32,402
The truth is...
I'm a really horrible woman!

103
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,922
What's this about being
a horrible woman?

104
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:37,942
A really horrible woman?

105
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:40,592
But it's true.
You're idealizing me for sure, Nobu!

106
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,752
Otherwise there's no way
you'd fall in love with me!

107
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,532
If you knew the real me...

108
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:47,552
you'd be disappointed.

109
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,812
Then, disappoint me.

110
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,242
I want you to.

111
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:07,242
Because I don't know what else
I can do to stop loving you.

112
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:16,872
I'm sorry. I'll break it off with Takumi.

113
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:22,852
I really didn't want anyone to know
about what happened with Takumi.

114
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,432
I thought, then I could act like
nothing happened

115
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,262
and become your girlfriend.

116
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,162
I had such cunning thoughts.
Lots of them.

117
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:34,532
Do you hate me now?

118
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,272
Huh?

119
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,932
No. I'm happy.

120
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:44,112
I can't take you from him by force.

121
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:48,242
I can't have you do something
that'll make you a horrible woman.

122
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,442
I don't find you cunning.

123
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,912
Don't be so hard on yourself.

124
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,522
It can't be helped that
you're attracted to Takumi.

125
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:02,132
And no matter how hard I try,

126
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:03,152
I'll probably never be able
to compete with him.

127
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:05,002
That's not true! I!

128
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:06,232
But if you tell me that

129
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,632
you're still gonna break it off with him
and be my woman...

130
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,402
I'll do everything I can
to make you happy.

131
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:21,512
For the sake of your happiness,
I will do everything within my power.

132
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:26,252
I mean, with you by my side,
I feel like I can do anything.

133
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:31,652
When you break it off with Takumi...
and sort out your feelings...

134
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:33,782
then come to me.

135
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,952
I'll be waiting faithfully.

136
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,152
Sorry, I have to go now.

137
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,122
I'll call you when I have some time.

138
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:55,922
You don't have to!

139
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,252
In fact, don't ever call me again!

140
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:58,022
Huh?

141
00:11:58,222 --> 00:11:58,982
Goodbye!

142
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:04,962
Hi there!

143
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,122
Stop startling me!

144
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:08,662
I told you yesterday.

145
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,222
Put an end to things first,
and then come to me.

146
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:11,992
But I did. That's why I came.

147
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:12,692
Too fast!

148
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,332
Nana...

149
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,072
Hmm?

150
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:18,062
You know, I... Nobu...

151
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:26,142
I think I'm head over heels
in love with Nobu.

152
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,512
Isn't it natural?

153
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,882
Huh? Nobu and Takumi?

154
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,492
Um, Nana Osaki and Ren of
our band are back together.

155
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,652
She lives with Hachiko, and...

156
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,492
Lately, the relationships are
becoming so confusing.

157
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:47,732
Hey, look here!

158
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,672
It's a diagram of the character
relationships in the anime, Nana,

159
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,102
that I made to clarify things.

160
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:52,872
Wow!

161
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,242
It doesn't really clarify anything.

162
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:59,212
Huh? Naoki's not connected to anyone.

163
00:12:59,312 --> 00:12:59,842
Huh?

164
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,822
Wh-What are you saying!
I'm Yasu's best friend!

165
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,342
Even now,
he's supposed to be meeting me...

166
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,112
FROM: YASU
I HAVE OTHER PLANS
STOP CALLING ME OVER AND OVER!

167
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,392
Is he really your best friend?

168
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:13,432
Sure he is!

169
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,952
Come to think of it, he said this.

170
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:19,292
MR. Y. T. (AGE 23) OF TOKYO
How are you doing?
I'm glad I could finally see you!

171
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:21,362
Because you were being such a pest.

172
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,532
And there also was this comment.

173
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:29,172
MR. T. I. (AGE 23) OF TOKYO
Then go home. Our band can make it
without you, Naoki.

174
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,242
Why?! Why do you two
know so much?!

175
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:36,082
Junko's room is that sorta place.

176
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:36,812
That's right.

177
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:45,522
No matter who says what,
Yasu and I are best friends!

178
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:47,432
- I'm gonna draw one!
- Ahh!

179
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:48,992
- I'm gonna draw a line here!
- Don't do it!

180
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,862
Now he's completely isolated.

181
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:09,982
You are pregnant.

182
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:14,052
This small black circle you see is
the sack that contains your baby.

183
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,582
And the little dot you see inside it
is your baby.

184
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:23,822
Morning sickness?

185
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:25,492
I won't keep it, so don't worry!

186
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,962
There's no need for you to
feel responsible, Takumi.

187
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,572
I'm the foolish one.
This child could be my boyfriend's.

188
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,242
Go home.

189
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:38,082
And don't come back again.

190
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:41,952
Is your boyfriend Nobu?

191
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,362
Takumi?

192
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,352
What are you doing?

193
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,162
Takumi...

194
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:02,572
NOBU

195
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,232
Don't tell Nobu!

196
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,102
What is it?

197
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,912
Hey, can you hear me?

198
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:12,102
Yes.

199
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:14,442
Nana's pregnant.

200
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,582
I don't know if it's yours or mine,
but regardless,

201
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,982
if Nana wants to keep it,

202
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,152
I intend on becoming its guardian
and raising it as my own.

203
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,332
What do you think?

204
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:51,352
Nana... Is it true that you're pregnant?

205
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:53,012
Hey...

206
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,282
I wanna hear it directly from you.

207
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,492
It could be my child.
There's no need to hide it from me.

208
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:02,452
And I knew that you had just
broken things off with Takumi.

209
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:03,762
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,142
Why...

211
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,372
are you apologizing?

212
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,542
Didn't you break it off with him?!

213
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:39,002
Please make up an excuse.

214
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,832
I don't care if it's a lie. I'll believe you.

215
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,542
I'm sorry!

216
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:05,222
I wanna have this child and
raise it as your child, Takumi.

217
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:06,852
If it's okay with you.

218
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:12,662
Wanna get married?

219
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,162
Huh?

220
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:18,442
If I marry an ordinary girl, the media
won't go too crazy over this.

221
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:22,772
No?

222
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:33,522
Married?

223
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:38,552
So I'm sorry, but...
could you find a new roommate?

224
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:45,002
But sure, that's not fair to you
having her move out so suddenly,

225
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:48,332
so I'll pay half the rent until
you find a new roommate.

226
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,202
I don't need it!

227
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,812
I can't stand the thought of you
doing it with some other man.

228
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:05,322
Don't you worry about a thing and
just focus on pleasing me.

229
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,522
You're a lot more important
to me than my boyfriend, Nana.

230
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:19,162
I think I'm head over heels
in love with Nobu.

231
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,572
Could you find a new roommate?

232
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:30,112
If you don't like it, I don't want it either.
I wanna use it as a set.

233
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,942
Why don't you use
the strawberry glass?

234
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:36,112
Because there are only two of them.
What if I break one?

235
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,612
But if you don't use them,
what's the point of having them?

236
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:41,022
Yeah, but still,
it's too sad if one of a set breaks.

237
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,952
You can use it,
but be sure to be careful, okay?

238
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,152
Nana?

239
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,492
Leave her alone.

240
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,082
TO NANA

241
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,962
TO NANA

242
00:19:58,402 --> 00:19:59,732
What's this?

243
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:08,742
Hachi!

244
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:19,782
Hachiko, are you here?

245
00:20:54,152 --> 00:21:00,062
I can't count
how many nights

246
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:04,832
I wished tomorrow
would never come

247
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:11,602
To live as I am
without being fake

248
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:15,202
What do I need

249
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:23,342
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

250
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:28,512
The answer is
too close to see

251
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:34,752
Black tears are
falling down

252
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:41,702
I have nothing,
only sadness

253
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:46,802
I can't put it
into words

254
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:52,872
My whole body
starts to ache

255
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:58,282
I can't stand it anymore
on my own

256
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:07,532
So there you have it.

257
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:11,122
Did you enjoy the third installment
of Junko's room?

258
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:13,002
Until we meet again some day.

259
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:14,402
- Bye-bye.
- Huh? Wait a minute.

260
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:15,002
Good bye.

261
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,202
I-I-I should have more lines.
Huh? Huh? Wait!
