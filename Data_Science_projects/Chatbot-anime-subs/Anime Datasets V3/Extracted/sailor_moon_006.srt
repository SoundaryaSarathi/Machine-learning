1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,242
It's inexcusable to use music for evil.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,215
I can't forgive anybody who tries to
take away a man's right to love.

3
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:12,920
Bach, the father of music, is angry too.

4
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:19,593
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

6
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

7
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,620
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

8
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

9
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,568
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

10
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

11
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

13
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

14
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,449
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

15
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,489
I'm a Cancer. My blood type is O
positive and my birthstone is the pearl.

16
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:04,219
I'm clumsier than others and a
bit of a crybaby. That's about it.

17
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,462
One day, a strange black cat
named Luna

18
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,698
gave me a peculiar
transforming brooch

19
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,700
making me into a sailor warrior.

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,294
But, she wants me to fight bad guys.

21
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,070
That makes me really nervous.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,404
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

23
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:31,576
Protect the Melody of Love!
Usagi is a Cupid

24
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:34,876
It stole the plant's energy, this music...

25
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:41,187
Queen Beryl, this music has subliminal
high-frequency waves hidden inside it.

26
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,856
The humans that listen to this
will become like the plant...

27
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,224
Interesting...

28
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,134
Try it.

29
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,367
At once!

30
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,302
Kurene.

31
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,341
Place the high-frequency wave on
this tape into the humans' music.

32
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,279
As you wish.

33
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,982
Jewelry

34
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,230
Naru, this is a good song.

35
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,295
Isn't it? I highly recommend it.

36
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,032
This is jazz, right?

37
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,240
Naru, you are so mature.

38
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,904
I know... If you have any questions,
just ask me.

39
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,912
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,981
Hmm, Yusuke Amade, huh?

41
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,186
Isn't he great?

42
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,655
He's probably a wonderful
and mature man.

43
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,646
I'd like to go out with him.

44
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,819
I'll pass.

45
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,287
They'd turn you down first.

46
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,933
Today... Today, I'm going to confess.

47
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,268
Jam Records

48
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:29,626
The stereo that plays this tape will
become infected with the evil virus.

49
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,334
In other words, any music
recorded in this studio

50
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,428
will have the subliminal
high-frequency wave in it.

51
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,746
Here it is!

52
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,490
I can't believe I left it here.

53
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,287
Yusuke is going to be mad at me.

54
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,158
Ms. Akiko.

55
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:07,235
Mr. Amade is here to see you.
He is in the lobby on the first floor.

56
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,862
I'm coming.

57
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:12,597
Yusuke didn't have to come on
such a rainy day like this.

58
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:23,912
Yusuke!

59
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,955
Oh my, you're soaked.

60
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:28,855
You didn't use an umbrella?

61
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:32,827
You were probably too busy thinking
about music, weren't you?

62
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,124
Uh, yeah.

63
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,091
Here is the demo tape
from the other day.

64
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,757
It was really good. Let's discuss
the recording next week or so.

65
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:45,663
Um, it's your birthday today, right?

66
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:48,343
Oh, you're right...

67
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:49,640
Ms. Akiko!

68
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,610
It's terrible! We made a
mistake with the mixing.

69
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,576
What? Again?

70
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,341
Sorry, I've got to go already.

71
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,716
I'm working late again tonight.

72
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:02,484
Here.

73
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:07,090
Use my umbrella on your way home.
It's the pink one at the entrance.

74
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:12,355
And think of a title by next week!

75
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,329
Okay?

76
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,629
Look more carefully...

77
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,070
I wrote the title. It says,
"A Waltz for Akiko."

78
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:35,083
What annoying rain.

79
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,192
They do say spring showers are long.

80
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,285
Oh well.

81
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,198
Well, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

82
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,722
Okay, bye.

83
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,840
Maybe I'll play a little.

84
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,571
You shouldn't be at an arcade
so late at night.

85
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,038
Come on, it's only for a little bit.

86
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:00,744
Honestly!

87
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:03,751
Look out!

88
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,519
What?
Look out!

89
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,008
What?

90
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,094
Oh, my new outfit is all wet!

91
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,998
Ouch!

92
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,829
You!

93
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,570
Help me! Don't kill me.
Please don't... Not my life!

94
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,776
Wait a second...

95
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,915
I'm not going to kill you.

96
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,382
Huh?

97
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:40,855
What? You're being targeted?

98
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:44,655
Yeah, and you probably wouldn't
believe me, but...

99
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,728
What is it?

100
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,753
The thing that is after me is actually...

101
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,798
A monster...

102
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,163
A monster?!

103
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,764
Yeah...

104
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:47,320
It was probably my imagination.

105
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,684
Sorry for telling you
such a stupid story.

106
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,059
This is fine.

107
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:52,960
What?
This is fine.

108
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,394
What?
I've got a job at that music club.

109
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,692
I've got a job at that music club.

110
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,765
Music club?

111
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,861
Oh yeah, dry cleaning money...

112
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,605
Sorry, I don't have any money
with me right now.

113
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,974
Will you call me at this number later?

114
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:07,108
Pianist
Yusuke Amade
Will you call me at this number later?

115
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:07,675
Pianist
Yusuke Amade

116
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,277
Pianist
Yusuke Amade
Yusuke Amade...

117
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:09,766
Yusuke Amade...

118
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,106
Yusuke Amade!

119
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:14,245
See ya!

120
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:20,420
So that was the Yusuke Amade
from that CD.

121
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,857
That's not important, Usagi!

122
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,326
The thing that's after him is a monster.

123
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,061
We can't leave him alone.

124
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:30,588
Yeah, it's a chance to understand
the world as a grown-up.

125
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,662
We can't not do anything.

126
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,628
Does she really understand?

127
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:41,268
You idiot! You haven't gotten
the tape back yet?

128
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:46,345
I'm sorry, I almost had him,
but he got away.

129
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,115
Stop giving me excuses.

130
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,183
Yes, Sir.

131
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:52,118
Anyway, proceed as planned.
Do you understand?

132
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,623
If the tape is not returned,
consider your life to be over.

133
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,690
Yes, Sir.

134
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,088
So this is the music club?

135
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:40,168
Won't they refuse to let children in?

136
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,261
What are you talking about?

137
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:48,800
Moon Power, change me into
a cool grown-up musician.

138
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:05,883
So? Don't I look like an adult now?

139
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:09,929
But, they may not let cats in.

140
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:22,766
There he is!

141
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,682
No, you have to stay still!

142
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:29,276
You're supposed to be an accessory.

143
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,822
Have you decided what
you would like?

144
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:37,626
Um, a cream soda.

145
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:42,427
What?! I'm sorry, we don't
have that here.

146
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,700
Oh, nothing then.

147
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,973
That old guy looks pretty cool when
he is playing the piano.

148
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,512
Usagi!

149
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,188
He's gone!

150
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:15,397
Oh, Mr. Amade, I'll give you a ride.

151
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:18,730
Just meet me in the parking lot.
The car is already running.

152
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:26,469
I wrote that song just for her...

153
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,002
I wonder if she's just a bit dense.

154
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,411
It's that old guy's voice!

155
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:03,145
Hurry!
It's that old guy's voice!

156
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:03,945
Hurry!
Okay.

157
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:04,411
Okay.

158
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:11,019
I'm going to kill you for
wasting my time.

159
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,316
Mister!

160
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,832
Mister? Are you okay?

161
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:27,199
My tape... Give it back.

162
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,033
Tape?

163
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,341
"A Waltz for Akiko."

164
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:37,778
Usagi, the monster is trying to do
something terrible with that tape!

165
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:46,921
Hey mister, you're driving
like a maniac!

166
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:52,259
I won't let anyone have that tape!
Not anyone!

167
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,496
Even if it's a monster.

168
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,364
You're awfully angry...

169
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,958
That wasn't just an ordinary
demo tape.

170
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,065
Because you made it for
Ms. Akiko, right?

171
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,896
How did you know that?

172
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:08,342
I might not look it, but I'm
pretty mature too.

173
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,969
Of course, I'd notice.

174
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:14,842
It's only a crush. I know it
must be funny at this age.

175
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,716
Age has nothing to do with it.

176
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:20,353
Even an old guy like you has
the right to be in love.

177
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,520
Oh, thanks.

178
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:27,596
Anyway, why are you following
the monster with me?

179
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm on the side of those in love,
on the side of justice.

180
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,194
Oh, I get it.

181
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,005
Over there! There it is!

182
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:39,940
The rain has stopped. You can see it
with the lights from the city.

183
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,539
Okay.

184
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:54,189
Hey, little girl.
Are you sure it landed here?

185
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,423
Yes, I'm sure of it.

Jam Records

187
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:03,598
Oh no, Ms. Akiko and the
others are inside.

188
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:04,895
What?

189
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,936
I'm going to have you
sleep for a while.

190
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:20,882
When you wake up and start
recording again,

191
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:25,251
all the music will contain subliminal
high-frequency waves.

192
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:28,617
Ms. Akiko!

193
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,328
Stop right there.

194
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,764
You!

195
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,491
Give me back the tape.

196
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,201
What?

197
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:13,969
Huh?
What?

198
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:14,536
Huh?
That isn't my tape.

199
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,561
That isn't my tape.

200
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,473
What?

201
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,236
Give me back the tape!

202
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,746
Are you okay?

203
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,236
I'm not okay.

204
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,157
If you want her to live,
give me the tape.

205
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:37,425
Ms. Akiko!

206
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:38,493
That's so mean!

207
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:39,824
Hurry up!

208
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,497
Yusuke.

209
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:43,964
All right...

210
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,105
Akiko!

211
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:09,449
This is the end. Give it up.

212
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,865
Usagi!

213
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,066
Okay!

Sailor Moon.

218
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,795
I won't allow you to use music for evil.

219
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,703
Even the father of music Haydn
is mad, you know!

220
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,194
The father of music is Bach!

221
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,534
If you hadn't said anything,
they wouldn't have noticed.

222
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,140
Anyway...

223
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,642
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you.

224
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,962
This is bad! It's some kind of
high-frequency sound wave!

225
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:55,623
High-frequency sound wave?

226
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,659
I get it. Sound, right?

227
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,124
So, how does it feel to get attacked
by your own amplified sound waves?

228
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:24,785
Usagi, now!

229
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:43,933

Yusuke, you are so stupid. What would
you do if you hurt your hand?

232
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:09,968
Yusuke, you are so stupid. What would
you do if you hurt your hand?

233
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:13,497
Then you wouldn't be able
to play the piano.

234
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,341
I know.

235
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:19,044
But if something had
happened to you...

236
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:22,612
Then I really wouldn't have been
able to play the piano.

237
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,214
What?

238
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,518
Yusuke...

239
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:32,657
I envy Ms. Akiko. Having someone
like Mr. Amade in love with her.

Usagi, did you hear that
Yusuke Amade got married?

242
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,335
Usagi, did you hear that
Yusuke Amade got married?

243
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,303
Yeah, that's what I heard.

244
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:47,865
I'm devastated. I had a crush on him.

245
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:51,907
Yeah, he's nice and brave...

246
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:55,705
What? You sound like you guys
know each other.

247
00:21:57,252 --> 00:22:00,813
Because we do!

248
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,673
