1
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:02,365
Miyazawa?

2
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:09,623
Thanks for the notes.

3
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:11,092
They really saved my butt.

4
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:12,492
They were so neat.

5
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,927
Just what I'd expect from you.

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,979
Oh, they're nothing, really.
Are you over your cold?

7
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,100
Feeling great.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,050
Miyazawa!

9
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,370
The sewing class assignment
was due today, wasn't it?

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,820
We're not done yet.

11
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:27,456
Well, I can talk to the teacher and

12
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:29,310
get an extension until after school.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,310
All right!

14
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:31,494
Miyazawa!

15
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,096
Miyazawa!

16
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:34,564
Miyazawa!

17
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,667
Miyazawa, you're amazing!

18
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:39,719
Yes!

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,273
She's smart... sweet... cute...

20
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:45,275
...and not at all stuck up
about being a model student.

21
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:45,925
Yes!

22
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,227
I wish I could be like you.

23
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:48,628
I never would have thought

24
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,228
such perfect people existed.

25
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:50,930
Yes!

26
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,433
Miyazawa, you're amazing!

27
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,483
She's smart... sweet... cute...

28
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,736
So that's how I look in other people's eyes.

29
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,223
Towering above the crowd.

30
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,058
The object of admiration.

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,844
That's what I love about myself.

32
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:08,647
But...since entering this high school,

33
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,783
I've been irritated.

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,653
Both our class chairs are

35
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:13,903
really awesome,

36
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:15,022
aren't they?

37
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:15,722
Why?

38
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,490
Because...

39
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:21,095
We're so glad we're in
the same class as you!

40
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:22,795
It's all because of him!

41
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,330
Oh, Arima!

42
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:42,865
We're home!

43
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:48,421
Sis! We're home!

44
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,561
Welcome home, Tsuki, Kano!

45
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:00,334
Sis, you always dress so goofy.

46
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,384
Hey, what's wrong with this?

47
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:05,104
I study best wearing this.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,975
Everyone, you may be thinking...

50
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,125
"Ain't there some major difference

51
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,500
between this and school?"

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes, I'm...

53
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:14,565
...a showoff!

54
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,952
That "graceful image" is just a facade.

55
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:18,702
Being sweet is a big lie.

56
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,088
I really love

57
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,438
being esteemed...

58
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,224
...being admired...treated as special...

59
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,295
...being the center of attention...

60
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:29,645
...being first...

61
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:34,182
In other words, I'm just...the Queen of Vanity!

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,840
Sis, you're trying to strike a pose
even when you're dressed like that...?

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's's eat!

65
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:46,347
But you know, Sis' passion for

66
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,748
showing off is really something.

67
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:48,916
If it means being number one,

68
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,618
she'll pull an all-nighter in a heartbeat.

69
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,019
To be the heroine of P.E.

70
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,754
she won't hesitate to do secret special training.

71
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,723
And to look even slightly more beautiful,

72
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,725
she goes to the trouble of researching beauty.

73
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,260
But at home you totally loaf around

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,595
and are a selfish, stubborn, spoiled brat.

75
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,497
Mmm, this grilled eggplant is good...l

76
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:06,433
It's like, "You'd really go that
far to get people to admire you?!"

77
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,968
What's wrong with that?!

78
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,870
If I can't let things slide at home,

79
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,005
I'm gonna get exhausted!

80
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:12,806
Then why don't you just knock off the acting?

81
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,742
Yeah. When we see you outside

82
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,011
we don't even recognize you for a moment.

83
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:19,380
I mean, until last year she was
in the same middle school as us.

84
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,016
Every time I saw her breezing
through the halls it gave me the shivers.

85
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:23,966
Though once I got used to it,

86
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,584
it was pretty funny.

87
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,770
Yeah.

88
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:29,156
She scatters her charm all over the neighborhood.

89
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:30,391
Every time people tell me

90
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,192
You have such an elegant daughter...

91
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:34,242
...I nearly burst out laughing.

92
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:39,565
Yukino's put on an act in public
ever since kindergarten.

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,900
Maybe that vanity has become

96
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,000
an integral part of her.

97
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,471
I just can't see

98
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,306
how you can all stand to act normally.

99
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:52,494
Whenever they look at me with eyes
full of respect and admiration...

101
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,448
...I get shivers up my spine!

102
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,948
There's a pervert...

103
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,466
There's a pervert among us.

104
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,353
Keeping up that "wonderful image"...

105
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:05,192
...and not letting it slip, even
for a moment, is a bit tiring though.

106
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,342
I think being carefree is better,

107
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,030
even if it means being ordinary...

108
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,166
It's better than being 
a pervert, anyway.

110
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,166
Yeah...

112
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,602
But, Sis, you recently got an enemy, didn't you?

113
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:16,402
Right!

114
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,570
I can't let him beat me now!

115
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,091
That's right.

116
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:26,347
I was able to keep on fooling the world just fine
all the way up through middle school.

117
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:28,982
But then an enemy appeared for the first time.

118
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,885
The story goes back to the April Opening Ceremony.

119
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:34,188
I was a bit miffed.

120
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,638
Because even though

121
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:37,206
I worked my butt off...

122
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,495
...to be number one on the entrance
exams and become the class speaker...

123
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,095
...I didn't get named.

124
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,065
And after I studied so hard...!

125
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,368
How could someone be better than me?!

126
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:50,671
I was planning on becoming the speaker and
instantly dropping a bomb with my presence.

128
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:51,672
My plans for my high school debut are all screwed up.

129
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:55,840
Whoever's standing in the way of my plans
must be some dreary, hard-core nerd!

131
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,213
The Representative Speaker for
the Incoming Class, Arima Souichirou...

132
00:04:59,213 --> 00:04:59,963
Here.

134
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:12,941
Just as I feared, he monopolized
the attention of the entire class

136
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,163
This is the worst humiliation
in all my 15 years.

138
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,816
So I've made up my mind!

139
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,770
I'm gonna defeat him no matter what!

141
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,905
And I've got to make everyone
notice how wonderful I am!

142
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,707
In other words, what was supposed to be

143
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,776
your debut turned into his debut instead.

144
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,777
Sis, you'd go that far to
be the center of attention...?

146
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:32,962
Hell yes!

147
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,164
Words of praise are the
source of life energy!

148
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,151
And to make matters worse,

149
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:41,555
they say he's nice, and good at sports...

150
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:44,425
...not to mention the only son
of the director of a major hospital.

151
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,275
He makes me so mad!

152
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,629
I'll never let him be number one again!

153
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,998
I'll obstruct him again and again and again...

154
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:54,316
I'll show that little mister rich-boy
just how tough life can be!

157
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,520
Sis, petty jealousy is pathetic.

158
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,508
Let's's not blame others for
your own personal problems.

159
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:04,011
Shouldn't you be thanking him for showing
you that you're a big fish in a small pond...

160
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,111
...and that there are even bigger fish in the ocean?

161
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:08,864
Kano, just shut up,

162
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,066
you little smart-aleck!

163
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,335
I'm scared.

164
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:18,654
Who would've thought that my sister could hate
someone this much because of vanity.

165
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,795
one , two, one , two, one , two...

166
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,198
one , two, one , two, one , two...

167
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,088
Good morning, Miyazawa.

168
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,574
Oh, good morning, Arima.

169
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:36,876
Gack, Arima!

170
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,312
You arrive pretty early every morning.

171
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,681
Oh, not really. So do you.

172
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:44,500
Great, I manage to run into the LAST guy
I want to see first thing in the morning.

174
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
But it's gonna take more than
that to crack my impregnable mask.

175
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,305
I have sports practice, so...

176
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,524
You're in the Kendo Club right?
Practice must be tough.

177
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:55,896
Yeah, every day from 6 in the morning

178
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,096
to 8 at night.

179
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,698
That much?

180
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,702
It's great that you can keep up with
both practice and studying like that.

181
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:03,900
I'm impressed.

182
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:05,288
W...well...

183
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,390
What's he blushing about?

184
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,000
But you're so responsible, 
and smart too.

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,983
You're so efficient at your
Academic Assembly duties...

188
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:19,000
I guess there are people like that
when you get up to high school.

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've realized all over again
how big the world is...

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,023
...and that I was just a big
fish in a small pond until now.

191
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:25,250
Oh, but I'm nothing...

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,601
Foolish Arima...

193
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:39,805
The nice partner you see before you
is the woman who will
ultimately send you to Hell!

196
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,178
Finally solved it.

197
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:51,000
What? I don't get this at all!

198
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,186
Hey, Arima, could you help me with this?

199
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,136
Oh, sure.

200
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,905
Oh, for this, you have to use the answers

201
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,993
for the discriminant and the coefficient.

202
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:01,343
So you do this...

203
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:02,662
Oh, I see!

204
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,080
Arima, show me too, would ya?

205
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,099
Why don't we form a group?

206
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,368
Good idea! Pull your desks around, guys!

207
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,511
See? If you throw it with
your hand it'll go off course...

208
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,514
...so try to use your knees, like this...

210
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,700
Hey! Arima's in the game!

211
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,635
What?! Let's watch!

212
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,107
He just got off a shot.

213
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,625
It was totally cool.

214
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:36,063
I hear he's almost as good as
the seniors in the Kendo Club.

215
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,332
Really? Our school's one of
the strongest in the prefecture, right?

216
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,082
Yeah.

217
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,368
He sure looks good in his uniform,
doesn't he?

218
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,518
He's so cool!

220
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:51,000
HE'S SO COOL!
ARIMA!

221
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,731
Then, as for the
usage of "tamae...", Arima.

223
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,170
Yes. I believe it's a future tense
helping verb denoting humility,
in the "u" and "e" forms.

225
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,057
What about "mashika?"

226
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,757
A hypothetical auxiliary

227
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:06,860
subjunctive verb.

228
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,828
Yes, that's good.

229
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:09,128
Oooooohhhhhhh...

230
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:11,197
Dammit

231
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:14,132
Until now, being the
center of attention...

233
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:19,473
...and being relied upon by
teachers were all MY roles. Shit!

234
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:22,507
Without him, I'd be the one
getting all the attention!

236
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,510
It's cold!

237
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,014
It's cold, being buried among
the ranks of the average citizens.

238
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,216
I want to be praised!

239
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,766
I want to be recognized!
I want attention!

240
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:37,250
Shit! Arima, you're a pain in the ass!

242
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,759
Just watch!
I'll be the one who's gonna

243
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,559
send you straight to hell!

244
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,775
I'm so sleepy...

245
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,313
I've been pulling non-stop all nighters lately,
studying to beat him down.

247
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,369
No, no!

248
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,736
If I fall asleep here,
I'll play right into his hands.

249
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,529
Gack! That was close!

250
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,229
I almost killed myseIf in a really lame way.

251
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,467
This is bad. No one saw that, did they?

252
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,717
My i-m-a-g-e...

253
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:30,926
Miyazawa?

254
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:32,244
Y...yes?

255
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,613
That was dangerous,
so you shouldn't do it.

256
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,000
That damn Arima!

258
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:43,590
God damn it, god damn it,
god damn it, GOD DAMN IT!

259
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,340
I will...I WILL beat him!

260
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:56,682
So, that concludes this
week's general meeting. Dismissed!

261
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:02,911
This school sure has a lot
of Academic Assembly meetings.

262
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:06,411
I didn't think it
would be this tough.
(They have one every week)

265
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:11,451
But it means the students are being
entrusted with governing themselves.

267
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,501
You're really mature, Miyazawa.

268
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:14,855
Shut the hell up!

269
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:15,989
Oh, Miyazawa?

270
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:16,689
Yes?

271
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,859
What kind of music do you listen to?

272
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,527
Music?

273
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,127
I guess I like Brahms.

274
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:26,500
That profound, magnificent
music appeals to the soul.
* I actually love HIDEKI (jpop). *

276
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,250
I especially love his 2nd Piano Concerto.

277
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:33,940
I want to hear the version conducted by Karl Bohm,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.
* I especially love "Boomerang." It's so awesome! *

279
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,690
I've got that CD at home.

280
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:37,911
If you want, I'll loan it to you sometime.

281
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,811
It's almost midterms, right?

282
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,914
So when they're over...

283
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,164
Really? Thanks.

284
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:44,200
Man, is this guy spoiled or what!

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,725
Miyazawa! Heading home?

286
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:54,227
Yeah. What about practice?

287
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,797
It's right before midterms,
so no practice for this week.

288
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:59,065
You take the Nanbu Subway Line, right?

289
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,901
Can I accompany you part of the way home?

290
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:02,451
Sure.
* HELL NO! *

291
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,926
Time to hit the books!

292
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,126
Sis, play with us once in a while!

293
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,997
You haven't played with us
at all since entering high school!

294
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:35,569
No way! He's so full of himseIf...
I'm gonna crush him no matter what!

296
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,772
Sis got stolen by Arima!

298
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,907
She used to play with us all the time!

299
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,000
Boring! Boring!

300
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:47,113
Besides, aren't YOU the one who's
carried away and all puffed up?

302
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,313
Geez! Why do you keep
making such snide remarks?!

303
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,620
I studied like I was possessed.

306
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,000
Somehow it felt like my goal of being
number one and getting all the attention...

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,495
...was slowly metamorphosing
into wanting to defeat Arima.
*But you'll die! *

310
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,595
If he loses,

311
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,230
I wonder what kind of face he'll make?

312
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:16,977
Wow, Miyazawa, you're amazing!
You're really amazing!

314
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,277
Congratulations!

315
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,579
I thought Arima was amazing,
but you're something too.

316
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,780
I didn't even notice until now.

317
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,115
You actually beat Arima.

318
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,165
I'm in awe.

319
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:25,785
Amazing!

320
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,470
I did it!

321
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:30,888
Amazing amazing amazing amazing...

322
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,228
It's been so long since I've
heard these sounds of admiration...

323
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,878
Ah, this feels so good!

324
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,249
I beat Arima!

325
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:45,805
Miyazawa Yukino's high school debut!

327
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,806
Farewell to the old me who was
forced to be something she wasn't.

328
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:50,243
And hello to the "new me,"

329
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:53,680
who will show her true
self in the future to come!

331
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,830
Oh, Miyazawa.

332
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:56,783
Ah, there you are Arima.

333
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,219
But you're not going to
have your way anymore.

334
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,955
From now on, surrounded by unfamiliar feelings... 

335
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:04,455
...scorched by the flames of disgrace...

336
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:07,860
You're the one who's gonna
experience the hell that I used to live in.

337
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,762
And when you do, I'll say something
out of sympathy and pity, like:

338
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:17,737
Try harder next time" and
make it into a real victory!

342
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,787
Now just show that face, twisted

343
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:21,073
in humiliation, in front of me!

344
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,942
You really are amazing, Miyazawa.

345
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,112
Huh? Wait a sec.

346
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,884
What's with this reaction?
I wasn't expecting this.

347
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:34,500
I thought if I could
just beat him, I'd win...

350
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,424
What is this? I beat him,
but I'm not that happy...

351
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:38,925
Or more like, something's wrong.

352
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:42,500
If I think about it, the only one bent
on grades and appearances was me.

354
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,465
Arima didn't give a damn
about that stuff from the start.

356
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:49,451
Even without ulterior motives for winning,
people had recognized him anyway.

358
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,572
So he's the real thing.

359
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,874
I'm ashamed that I'm so
different from the "real thing"...

360
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,610
Isn't what I've been doing...
...deceiving people by

361
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,710
pretending to be nice, called...

362
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,163
...hypocricy?

363
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,383
When was it, I wonder,

364
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,755
that I first started enjoying
being praised by others?

365
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:09,705
Good job.

366
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,359
You're such a responsible, good little girl.

367
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,809
Such a sweet sound.

368
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,927
I wanted to hear more of it.

369
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,764
If I could learn to do somersaults on the bars,

370
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:20,364
I wonder if I can surprise them some more?

371
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,302
If I could play the piano well...

372
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,537
If I was able to write kanji well...

373
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,539
If I got voted onto the Academic Committee...

374
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,939
If I got the highest grade on tests...

375
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:30,442
Come to think of it,

376
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,743
I'm really a sucker for an audience.

377
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,514
If I had worked on freely

378
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,082
nurturing my real seIf...

379
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,618
...I might have even become
a sensational comedian.

380
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:39,587
Damn!

381
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,337
I could've gotten onto

382
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,588
some super-popular TV show...

383
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,592
...and my name could've

384
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,242
been a household word!

386
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:51,531
I tried to make myseIf out to be more than
I really am, but all I got was exhaustion.

387
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,799
Trying to become some different
kind of creature was just stupid...

388
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,849
Stupid, stupid...I'm so STUPID!

389
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,410
I feel so depressed.

390
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,610
I really don't want to face Arima.

391
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,014
Then I just shouldn't come to
school until the very last moment...

392
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,984
...but I'm so used to being
the first one every morning.

393
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,353
And then I kill time by studying...
I'm hopeless.

394
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,488
Oh, I know. I'll go to the music room

395
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,488
and play piano until homeroom.

396
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:18,824
Ow....

397
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,459
Oh, sorry.

398
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,129
I...I'm...so...sorry!

399
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,530
Shit! Why does he always
see me when I'm being a moron?!

400
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,530

401
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,066
Run away! I'm just an underdog anyway!

402
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,669
No one's here yet?
She's already running away

403
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:35,891
Wait.

404
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:40,326
I want you to know that...I...Like you.

405
00:16:57,762 --> 00:16:59,662
Sudden reversal of fortunes!

406
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,334
It feels so good to have someone
tell you he's in love with you.

407
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,303
Sis, haven't you always been popular?

408
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,775
The point is that 
this time it was Arima.

411
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:14,848
Who cares about winning or losing any more?
I mean, he fell for me.

414
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,850
In the game of love, the person
who receives the love is the winner.

415
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,250
So, what'd you do?

416
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,553
Huh? I turned him down, of course.

417
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,188
Can't let my secret out.

418
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,890
He walked away with this
Lonesome look on his face.

419
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,092

420
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,627
Are you sure?

421
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:28,795
About what?

422
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:35,316
Did you actually hate him?
I was sure you had a complex about him.

426
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:38,303
Well, I guess I did have one.

428
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,474
Sis, isn't a complex another way to say...
..."a longing for something

430
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:45,478
that you yourseIf can never be?"

431
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:48,448
Huh?
I guess his intelligence and nice,

432
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:49,998
popular personality give rise to the image

433
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:50,750
I've always been trying to approach

434
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,552
Or rather,

435
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:58,000
precisely what
I thought of as the ideal...

437
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,358
OH, NO!
Now I see!

438
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,826
Come to think of it,

439
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,429
isn't he actually HOT?!

440
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:04,379
Told you!

441
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,615
I explained Sis' situation with

442
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:10,101
a funny song and this manga.

443
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:13,137
I never thought of him that way!

444
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,839
I was too hasty...

445
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,341
Well, I already turned him down,

446
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:21,963
so that's that.

447
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:24,616
Bedtime.

448
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:25,618
Say what?!

449
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,068
Is that how it is?!

450
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:28,354
Sis...

451
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,705
She's really still a kid.

452
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,503
Kano, where's the money?

453
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:44,603
On the desk!

454
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,306
The advance tickets?

455
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,106
I got 'em!

456
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,007
Got a comb?

457
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,407
Find one yourseIf!

458
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,442
You better take an umbrella.

459
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:52,645
It's supposed to

460
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,145
rain this afternoon.

461
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,582
You sure you're not coming?

462
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:58,084
It's a really cool movie.
Let's's have some fun!

463
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,334
Sorry, I'm beat

464
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:01,487
from all those tests.

465
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,289
Tsukino, the movie's gonna start! Hurry!

466
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,791
It's 'cause you overslept!

467
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,841
Heh, sorry.

468
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,242
You don't sound very sorry!

469
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:14,899
It's finally quieted down.

470
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,252
Mom and Dad are out shopping...

471
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:20,988
There's only one Sunday a week.

472
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,290
Lounging around the house
is definitely the way to go.

473
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,930
That day...

474
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,549
Why did I let my guard down just then?

475
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:36,119
Is that Tsukino?
I bet she forgot her umbrella after all.

476
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:37,906
Commmiiiiinnng!

477
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:39,775
I...here... 

478
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:45,298
You forgot this!

479
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,635
...made the mistake that
I'd absolutely never made until...

480
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:49,535
...then.

481
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:14,441
U...um...the Brahms...CD.....

482
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:17,196
I was in the neighborhood...

483
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,865
and thought I'd... drop it by...

484
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,099
Even then, Arima's

485
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,699
manners were flawless.

486
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,604
What terrifyingly strong
nerves and seIf-restraint.

487
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,504
He's a really admirable guy.

488
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,189
I bet I'm the first

489
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,376
woman in Arima's life

490
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,726
who has ever disturbed him this much.

491
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,783
I guess I'll be satisfied for today

492
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:38,533
by feeling pride in that.

493
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,534
What'll happen next!

494
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,603
The mistake of a lifetime!

495
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,206
Sis' true identity was discovered!

496
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,208
And Arima cleverly exploits that fact!

497
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,858
What will her fate be?!

498
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,444
Next time on KareKano:

499
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,396
A Secret for Two.
