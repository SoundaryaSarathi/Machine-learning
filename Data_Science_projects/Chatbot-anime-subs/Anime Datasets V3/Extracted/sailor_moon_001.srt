1
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,274
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

2
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:12,543
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

3
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:19,478
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

4
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:25,919
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

5
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:33,768
Guided by the light of the moon

6
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:39,900
We will meet again and again

7
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:47,348
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

8
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:53,947
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

9
00:01:54,322 --> 00:02:00,352
I believe in it, miracle romance

10
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:13,273
Crybaby Usagi's Magnificent Transformation

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,736
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

12
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:24,139
I'm just a little clumsy and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

13
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:27,436
Usagi! It's past eight o'clock!

14
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,451
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?!
Thanks a lot, Mom!

15
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,630
I tried many times. You answered
each time, remember?

16
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,097
I don't remember!

17
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,300
Oh, Usagi...

18
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,833
What? I'm in a hurry!
Oh, Usagi...

19
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,268
What? I'm in a hurry!

20
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:51,997
Don't you want your lunch?

21
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,595
Uh, yes...

22
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,901
I'm leaving!

23
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,281
Why does morning have to come?

24
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,771
I'm so sleepy.

25
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,886
Get the cat! Yeah!

26
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,454
Hey cat, bark!

27
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:12,184
Hey! Stop it!

28
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,261
I can't believe it.

29
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,863
Poor kitty. It's okay now.

30
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:21,354
Oh, did they put a band-aid on you?

31
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,934
You want me to take it off? Here.

32
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:27,468
But it did kind of suit you though.

33
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,439
Wha? A crescent shaped bald spot?

34
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:57,191
Oh! I don't have time for this!

35
00:03:58,436 --> 00:03:58,837
Juban Municipal Junior High School

36
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,606
Usagi Tsukino! You're late again!
Juban Municipal Junior High School

37
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,004
Juban Municipal Junior High School

38
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:07,608
It's so mean, how could they make
a fragile girl stand in the hall?

39
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm hungry.

40
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:21,121
I did skip breakfast,
so... time to eat!

41
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,957
What are you doing, Miss Tsukino?!

42
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,798
That's why you get failing grades!

43
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:29,494
What?! 30 percent?!

44
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,296
Yup!

45
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,305
Usagi, I can't believe you.

46
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:38,009
You're a girl and you were going
to eat your lunch early?

47
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,412
But I'm a growing girl.

48
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:44,314
You're my best friend, Naru.
You understand, don't you?

49
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,821
Usagi, how did you do on your test?

50
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,379
Umino...

51
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:56,486
Can't you tell by how depressed
she is? Of course it was bad.

52
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,492
Oh, did that hurt? I'm sorry.

53
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,167
You don't have to be so upset!

54
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:05,537
I didn't get a perfect this time
because I didn't really try.

55
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,505
A test is like a game.

56
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,802
How annoying!

57
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,703
Oh! Did you hear that Sailor V
appeared again?

58
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:17,716
Sailor V?

59
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:21,619
Yeah. She caught the robbers
from the jewelry heist.

60
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,221
Wow!

61
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,656
Isn't it great?

62
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,283
What is a Sailor V?

63
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,260
Don't be so impressed if you
don't know her!

64
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,425
Sailor V is the heroine in a school
uniform that's been causing an uproar.

65
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,527
Sailor V.

66
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:41,106
There's a rumor that she's actually

67
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,199
a special agent from the
police department.

68
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,979
Oh, there's stuff like that now.
Must be the end of the century.

69
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,647
But gems are beautiful,

70
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,984
I'd understand why they'd
want to steal them.

71
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:56,488
I know what you mean.
I want a diamond ring.

72
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,319
I want ruby earrings.

73
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,519
I wish.

74
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:05,530
Oh yeah, our store has been having
a jewelry sale since yesterday.

75
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,664
Want to come?

76
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,188
Jewelry sale?

77
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,002
They'll have rings and stuff
that even we can buy.

78
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:12,804
Really? I'll go!

79
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,472
Okay, then come over
on your way home.

80
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:17,964
I'll definitely go. I wish school
would end soon.

81
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:20,504
Umm... Usagi...

82
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:44,524
Have you still not found the
legendary silver crystal?

83
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,865
No, my lady.

84
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:54,302
Our great ruler wants a plentiful
amount of energy.

85
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,449
If you cannot obtain the silver crystal,

86
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,441
then let us first give our
ruler human energy.

87
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,018
Queen Beryl.

88
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:11,552
Will you leave that duty
to me, Jadeite?

89
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:18,926
My minion, the monster Morga,
is already gathering human energy.

90
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:23,165
I will leave it to you, Jadeite.

91
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,003
Yes, my lady.

92
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,521
Oh, how pretty!

93
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,150
It's so cheap!

94
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,727
Wow, there are a lot of people.

95
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,431
Thank you for always choosing us.

96
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,334
Welcome! Welcome! Please feel free to try them on.

97
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,336
Mom's awfully in to it.
Welcome! Welcome! Please feel free to try them on.

98
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:51,903
Mom's awfully in to it.
Welcome!

99
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,171
Maybe she's inspired.
Welcome!

100
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,103
Maybe she's inspired.

101
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:58,103
Come on in. They're all on sale!

102
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,179
Foolish humans.

103
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,656
Give all your energy to our great ruler.

104
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,188
It's gathering, the energy
of the foolish humans

105
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,986
who are taken by the
brilliance of the gems.

106
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:51,420
Queen Beryl will be very pleased.

107
00:08:56,534 --> 00:09:00,026
Morga, collect even more energy.

108
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:01,998
Yes, sir.

109
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,667
Mom.

110
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,545
Oh, welcome home Naru.

111
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,069
I brought a friend.

112
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,979
Hello.

113
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:14,285
Thank you for coming.

114
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:17,254
It's crowded, but please look around.

115
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,123
Thank you.

116
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:22,760
I know, since you are Naru's friend,
I'll give you a discount.

117
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,888
Really? I'm so lucky.

118
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:30,560
How about this diamond? It usually
goes for about 500,000 yen.

119
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,337
500,000 yen?

120
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,397
But, I'll lower it to 30,000 yen.

121
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,942
500,000 to 30,000!

122
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,102
Sold!

123
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,069
Wait! I'll buy it! It's mine!

124
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,153
Wow! Look at that!

125
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:53,024
500,000 to 30,000! I want it!

126
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:54,821
Why don't you ask your dad?

127
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,191
But I failed my English test.

128
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,630
Oh yeah...

129
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,428
And I've used up all of my
allowance for this month.

130
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,634
Be strong, Usagi.

131
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,345
I should have studied harder.

132
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:20,180
Oh, die!

133
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,822
Hey, that hurts, Dumpling Head.

134
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,289
What? Oh, I'm sorry...

135
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,089
30 percent!

136
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,494
Study harder, Dumpling Head.

137
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,531
It's none of your business!

138
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,799
What's with him?! I can't believe it.

139
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,041
What a weirdo.

140
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,454
Brand New Sailor V Game

141
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:05,389
Huh, Sailor V?
They made a game already?

142
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:21,579
It must be nice being Sailor V.

143
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,448
You don't have to worry about tests,

144
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,916
and I bet catching bad guys
feels pretty good.

145
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,047
But me on the other hand...

146
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:38,821
I don't want to take this home.

147
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,610
Usagi Tsukino, I've finally found you.

148
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,884
*Kenji Tsukino*
*Ikuko*
*Usagi*
*Shingo*

149
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,786
I'm home!
*Kenji Tsukino*
*Ikuko*
*Usagi*
*Shingo*

150
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,014
Oh, you're back. You're late.

151
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:25,592
Yeah, a bit.

152
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:30,120
I bumped into Umino.
He said you got your tests back.

153
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:31,631
What?

154
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,122
Umino said that he got a 95.

155
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:37,498
Oh, really? That's amazing!

156
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,898
Umino's got a big mouth.

157
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:43,801
And what did you get, Usagi?

158
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,615
Well umm. Umm, well...
Actually, that is...

159
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:49,843
Let me see.

160
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:55,014
Here.

161
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:01,184
Usagi!

162
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:02,417
Yes?

163
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,629
Getting such a bad score.
I'm not letting you in the house.

164
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:09,936
Mom!

165
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,335
I can't hear you.

166
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:12,372
Ouch!

167
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:13,073
Ouch!
What are you doing, dummy Usagi?
Did you get locked out again?

168
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:16,531
What are you doing, dummy Usagi?
Did you get locked out again?

169
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:20,007
I want a better sister.

170
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,778
You're my younger brother.

171
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,617
Sailor V kick.

172
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:32,350
Ouch!

173
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:36,255
Mom! Please let me in.

174
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:45,037
That's strange. I'm feeling a bit faint.

175
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,433
I feel weak.

176
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,314
What's happening to everyone
all of a sudden? Mom?

177
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:03,516
Mom?

178
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,017
I've gathered quite a bit of energy.

179
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,656
Mom...

180
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,810
She finally let me in.

181
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,373
I'm tired from crying so much.
Mom didn't have to get that mad.

182
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,253
I don't feel like doing homework.

183
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:34,421
Maybe I'll take a nap.

184
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,913
It's good that I can fall asleep
so easily at times like this.

185
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,616
Hey, it's the cat with the
crescent bald spot.

186
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,856
It's not a bald spot. How rude.

187
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:13,917
It talked. A cat... A cat talked.

188
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,625
My name is Luna. I've been
looking for you, Usagi.

189
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:27,565
Oh, I need to thank you first.
Thank you very much.

190
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,272
You really helped me out by
taking the band-aid off.

191
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,207
I can't talk and my sensory powers
are dulled when I'm like that.

192
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,150
I was having trouble because
of that band-aid prank.

193
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,914
But thanks to you, I finally found you.

194
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:43,957
Good night.

195
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,892
Usagi, this is not a dream.

196
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,792
C'mon, Usagi!

197
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,796
Fine then, I'll wake you up!

198
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,266
There!

199
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,077
Usagi, this is a present for you.

200
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,850
Really, I can have this?

201
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,117
Usagi, there are weird things
happening in Tokyo right now.

202
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:14,154
All right! Thank you.
Usagi, there are weird things
happening in Tokyo right now.

203
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,756
Usagi, listen to me!

204
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,589
There are strange things happening
in Tokyo right now.

205
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:23,886
An enemy the police can't fight.

206
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,156
Usagi, you're going to fight
these enemies.

207
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,931
You are a chosen warrior.

208
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:36,876
And your other mission is to find
our princess with the others.

209
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:39,344
That sounds sorta cool.

210
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,716
You still don't believe me, do you?

211
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,082
No, I believe you, I believe you.

212
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,848
Really? Then say this.

213
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,123
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

214
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,552
Okay.

215
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,660
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

216
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:42,705
No way! What is this? I've transformed.

217
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,904
What is this? What does
this mean? Tell me.

218
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:51,217
Help! Someone! Help me!

219
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,052
Help! It's my mom!

220
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:53,720
That's Naru's voice.
What does it mean?
Help! It's my mom!

221
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,289
That's Naru's voice.
What does it mean?

222
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,847
Now do you believe me?

223
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:01,356
I don't really get it, but Naru
seems to be in danger.

224
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:05,098
Usagi, you have become Sailor Moon.

225
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:07,089
Now go and save her quickly.

226
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,235
Help me!

227
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,908
I...

228
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:21,045
Stop it, Mom!

229
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,716
I'm not your mom!

230
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,117
Your mom is locked up
in the basement.

231
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:39,396
After I kill you, I'll send her to
the other world with you.

232
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,663
Get away from Naru!

233
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,466
Who are you?

234
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:59,014
Um, I'm the Sailor Warrior
of Love and Justice.

235
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,081
Sailor Moon!

236
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,024
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

237
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:15,159
Sailor Moon? I've never heard
of such a thing.

238
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:21,599
Awaken! My slaves that gave their
energy to my great ruler.

239
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,573
Hey, what are you people?

240
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,891
Oh no! I'm bleeding!

241
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,465
What are you doing, Sailor Moon?

242
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:48,866
You have to fight. You have
to destroy that monster.

243
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:57,771
Why? Why is this happening to me?

244
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,637
I'm going home.

245
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,273
This is the end.

246
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:18,423
Who's there?

247
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,059
I am Tuxedo Mask.

248
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:26,168
Crying isn't going to solve
anything, Sailor Moon.

249
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,067
But I...

250
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,478
Stop crying.

251
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:45,886
Take the tiara and yell,
"Moon Tiara Action" and throw it!

252
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:48,594
Why do I have to do that?

253
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:49,195
Just hurry up and do it!
Why do I have to do that?

254
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,059
Just hurry up and do it!

255
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:10,645
Moon Tiara Action!

256
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:22,621
No way!

257
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:36,132
Morga, you screwed up. You idiot!

258
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,553
Good job, Sailor Moon!

259
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,321
I'll remember this night.

260
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:00,199
You did well, Sailor Moon.

261
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,891
He's gorgeous.

262
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:09,869
Hey, I had a really wonderful
dream last night.

263
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,813
A warrior of justice named
Sailor Moon appeared

264
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,715
and destroyed this monster.

265
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:17,950
What? I had the same dream!

266
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,118
Me too!

267
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,753
How strange.

268
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:24,484
Hey, Usagi. Usagi. Listen!

269
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:31,490
Be quiet. I'm tired, so let me
sleep a little more.

270
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,528
Good night.

271
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,428
In my dream, you and I were together

272
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:51,340
Protected by the stars

273
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:06,524
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

274
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:13,662
And we casually talked to each other

275
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:22,440
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

276
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:29,478
I want to become prettier
right here and now

277
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:36,991
Something changes when
you fall in love

278
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:43,561
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

279
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:57,445
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
