1
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:05,283
It's now August,

2
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:07,190
and Arima has gone to the Interhigh.

3
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:18,925
Ah! It's a letter from Arima!

4
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,402
When most business can be done
over the phone these days,

5
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,277
letters are unusual.

6
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,247
What's it say, what's it say?

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,891
This is a souvenier from the
training camp in Nagano.

8
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,959
I'll be back on August 5th.

9
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:45,926
So concise...

10
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,161
But when I opened the envelope,

11
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,328
it smelled ever so faintly of Arima.

12
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,733
It gave me a painful reminder
of how much I missed him.

13
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,205
Oh, Arima? I saw him.

14
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:03,043
When I went to school for volleyball
practice I ran into the kendo team...

16
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,072
...which had just gotten back.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,980
I was surprised.

18
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:11,385
Arima had gotten so much taller
that he looked so different, but cool.

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,481
If he gets taller with those looks, he'd be a model.
*So good looks is all that matters?*

22
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,921
Hey, what's the matter, Yukinon?

23
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:22,866
Maybe I should join a club too...

24
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,232
What's the matter all of a sudden?

25
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,637
Although we'd love to have you
on the volleyball team.

26
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,062
Well, I'm not doing anything.

27
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,436
Arima does sports and he's getting taller,

28
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,069
and there's so much going on...

29
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:35,070
But nothing changes with
me just sitting here.

30
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,046
Whining about relationships, are you?

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,611
I can't take any more of this
when I'm not even getting paid.

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,32
I'm leavin', so I can't understand that shit.

34
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:52,028
All right already! I'll stop talking about it!

35
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,289
It's not like you're doing nothing.

36
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,030
You do all that studying.

37
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:59,227
Yeah but, that would go without saying.

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,831
And as for studying, I finished my homework
already, so I don't have much to do.

39
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:03,566
I have more free time now that

40
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,336
I no longer train to show myself off.

41
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,439
Why don't you join?

42
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,406
Yu-ki-non...

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,041
Let us copy your homework!!

44
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,285
1000 yen per subject.

45
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:17,310
No Fair!

46
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,519
How could you? Are you going to bring
money into our friendship?

47
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,117
One good deed deserves another.

48
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:22,615
Money doesn't rule everything in the world.

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,523
I've had a change of heart about that.

51
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:31,660
My brains will bring me lots of money.
At this rate, I can be a doctor
or lawyer or anything I like.

53
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,629
In any case, these brains are going
to earn me an income of twenty
or thirty million yen a year.

54
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,164
So I'm not going to sell myself short now.

55
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:39,469
Damn! This is what's annoying
about smart people.

56
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,808
You've really gotten over being
Miss Goody-two-shoes.

57
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,972
You used to loan your notes
to people all the time,

58
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,280
and had everyone totally fooled.

59
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:50,614
Hey, then how about the drama club?

60
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:52,714
Huh? Drama club?

62
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:58,860
There's someone who could write the stories.
There's someone who could make the clothes.

63
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:00,862
The pretty faces.

64
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:01,630
Me?

65
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,125
And an acting genius.

66
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:04,466
That's not very flattering.

67
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,800
See, you can do it!

68
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,228
What are you being so amused about?

69
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,107
Then what are YOU going to do?

70
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,537
Oh, I'm on the volleyball team,
so it has nothing to do with me.

71
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:14,468
No fair!

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,443
No, no, no way!
Our school doesn't even have a
drama club in the first place.

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,545
Did you get an idea?

76
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,956
Hey, don't make up stuff we don't need!

77
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:27,756
Tsubaki's just teasing us!

78
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:33,763
Bye!

79
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:35,359
See ya.

80
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,665
Bah-bye!

81
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,098
Later, see ya.

82
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:39,399
Bye-bye!

83
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:15,138
We may not be able to see each
other for a while.

84
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,435
Okay. Good luck at the Interhigh!

85
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,268
It's no use.

86
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,709
I told myself I'd be apart from
Arima for only a little while...

88
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:27,349
Why do I become hopeless
as soon as he's gone?

90
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,851
Three more days...

91
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,396
So depressing...

92
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:54,107
Two more days...

93
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,905
Yuki-chan, phone call from Isawa-san.

94
00:04:58,582 --> 00:04:59,412
The day before yesterday...

95
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,112
...you said you finished all your
homework, right?

96
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,176
I was hoping you could help...

97
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,384
...me with a couple things I'm stuck on.

98
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:05,447
Sure.

99
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:10,685
Thanks for coming over.

100
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,859
What's with your face?

101
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,765
D..Do I look weird?

102
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,326
You're emitting a strange aura.

103
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:23,696
I guess even someone with steel nerves
like you gets lonely without Arima.

106
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,876
It was like this during the
Athletics Festival too.

107
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,210
The moment Arima was gone
I became a wreck.

108
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:34,045
I'd been vaguely aware of it, but...

109
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,147
Without the vanity and pride,

110
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,580
I'm really a chicken.

111
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:40,954
I can't stand myself!

112
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:42,791
When Arima's doing what he has to do,

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,458
I can't stand that all I can do
is sit around moping!

115
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:48,122
Don't make such a ruckus in
someone else's house.

116
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,429
What's wrong with that?
Guys like that kind of girl.

117
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,799
But Arima has rather weird tastes...

118
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,373
What with Asapin and Tsubasa-chan...

119
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:59,137
*The world is money!*

120
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:04,337
I don't really know, but I don't think
he would like a passive girl like that.

122
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,200
I think it's all right.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,450
It's love because it knocks your
heart off balance.

124
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,721
While you're acting cool and having
things under control,

125
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,084
it's not true love yet.

126
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:20,521
That means you value yourself...

127
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,525
...more than the other person.

128
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,565
You met someone who could even
collapse the balance of your heart.

129
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:28,129
That's why your heart gets stolen.

130
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:30,498
You're sooo mature!

131
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,102
You're the first person I've ever
wanted to call big sister.

132
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,638
Big sister!

133
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,001
If you're going to make fun of me
I'll stop talking.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,447
Just kidding.

135
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,609
Mahorin, you must be in love now.

136
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,179
Are you going out with him?

137
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,087
I can't imagine the kind of person
you'd fall in love with.

138
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,147
What's he like?

139
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:46,888
A 28-year old dentist.

140
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,721
He's an adult,
so I'm no match for him at all.

142
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,926
He has composure.
He's kind and strong.

143
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,626
I love him, but I also admire him.

144
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:58,033
I want to become the kind...

145
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,563
...of person he can respect.

146
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:05,266
This is the first time I've seen that
tough punk Mahorin look so tender.

151
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,202
Love is such a mysterious thing.

152
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,711
The heart is formless and weightless.

153
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,707
It can't be measured in terms
of size or depth.

154
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,184
Although no one has seen
its true nature,

155
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,251
it definitely feels pain.

156
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,618
It only responds to a certain person.

157
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:28,795
Tomorrow...When tomorrow comes,
I can see him.

158
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,394
This will probably be the longest day.

159
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,772
Pero-Pero, let's go play.

160
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,404
The sisters are at practice.

161
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:19,705
Pero-Pero,

162
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:21,175
...are you trying to comfort me?

163
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,889
I want to see him. I want to be with him.

164
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,323
Every waking moment is painful
when we're apart.

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,890
Maybe I...

166
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:42,595
Maybe I actually love Arima...
...even more than I thought?

167
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:44,833
I was immature...

168
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,301
and so I just hadn't realized it,
but in reality...

170
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:51,406
In reality, I've always...

171
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,884
Yuki-chan,
can you go buy some soy sauce?

172
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:02,491
Sure. Pero-pero! You're my bodyguard.

173
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,000
You'd think you'd notice,
and not walk on by.

174
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:31,343
I'm home.

175
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,228
I'm home.

176
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:47,797
Before me?!

177
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,070
Not the tongue.

178
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,803
Arimaaa! Arimaaa!

179
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,679
Miyazawa?! A tackle?!

180
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,312
In any case...

181
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:09,225
Arima's gained an indefinable sexiness
since I saw him last...

182
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:13,353
You got back early.

183
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,958
Yeah. I was supposed to come home
on the bullet train...

184
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,255
...tomorrow with everyone else,

185
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,133
but it looked like they were going
to put me

186
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,333
in charge of things like organizing
the debriefing,

187
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,363
so I made up an excuse
and came home.

188
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,969
Wow. I didn't know you would
cheat like that.

189
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,878
Well, the way things were going.

190
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:30,541
I didn't know when I'd get to see you...

191
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,715
Are you on vacation for
the rest of the summer?

192
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:34,846
Can we hang out together?

193
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,044
Yeah. There's some practice,

194
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:39,251
but it won't take out my
whole day anymore.

195
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:42,750
What've you been doing?

196
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,520
You told me over the phone, but...

197
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:45,894
I did all my homework!

198
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,161
And I played with my friends,
and watched primetime movies,

199
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,190
and visited Grandpa.

200
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,089
That's nice.

201
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,430
But I was really lonely without you!

202
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,261
R..R..Really? Me too...

203
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,203
But Arima,

204
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,108
you've sure gotten taller
since I last saw you.

205
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,601
You're head's at a different
level, so I didn't notice you.

206
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,339
Yeah, it hurt every time
I moved my joints.

207
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,076
It was really tough having that happen
right before the competition.

208
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:07,279
How'd the competition go?

209
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,275
Oh, I won.

210
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:09,151
You WON?!

211
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:15,285
Win?! Win as in first place?!

212
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,955
You're the number one in kendo
in Japan?!?

214
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,124
Y..Yeah.

215
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:25,762
That's AWESOME!!

216
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:28,038
M..Miyazawa?!

217
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,564
Oh wow! That's so great!
I bet you were so cool!

218
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,171
I wish I could have seen it!
That's awesome!

219
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,635
Great job, Arima!

220
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,523
For a moment, it occured to
me that he was so beautiful.

221
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,361
But being with you is better
than anything else.

222
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,863
I felt an emotion I'd never felt before.

223
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:05,402
It's spreading throughout my body...
...and will have me under its control.

225
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:07,343
How could I have been so indifferent
when I was with him before?

226
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:09,939
He loves me so much...

227
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,838
I can't even breathe.

228
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,148
Is this possible?

229
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,983
I've fallen in love with...

230
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,615
...the same person a second time.

231
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,067
Miyazawa!

232
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,025
Yo!!

233
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,027
Have you had lunch?

234
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,696
No, just breakfast.

235
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,265
We still have some time before the movie,

236
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,001
so let's go grab a bite.

237
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,940
Freedom!

238
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,369
I feel so happy when
I realize I'm finally totally free!

239
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,315
What did it feel like to win the Interhigh?

240
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:51,210
Huh?

241
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,916
Oh, well, you know...

242
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:55,686
That's it? You can brag, you know.

243
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,783
The final match was against our
school's captain.

244
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:58,886
Wow!

245
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,490
Our kendo team must be really good.

246
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,998
He had lost the final match last year,

247
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,957
and I'd seen him working really hard

248
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,398
for the win this time.

249
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:09,428
This was only my first year, so I couldn't
help thinking that I wanted him to win.

250
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,508
Arima, you want me to win, don't you.

252
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,481
Abandon such pathetic thoughts.

253
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,317
I have always wanted to
go all out against you.

255
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,020
If you hold back even a little bit.

256
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,152
...I'll forcibly steal a kis...

257
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,255
I'll do my best!!

258
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,222
Don't interrupt me.

259
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,795
And so you beat down your senpai?

260
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,265
Well, if I had lost even if
I had fought seriously,

261
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,661
I was afraid he would take that as
an excuse and do it anyway, so...

262
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,366
He gets this weird look
in his eyes sometimes!

263
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,103
You're so popular with guys too...

264
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,740
I wonder if this training camp
was actually risque?

265
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,302
especially in the locker rooms.

266
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,302
That's it! Don't say anything else!

267
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,344
Don't even imagine it!

268
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,381
Arima's voice. His hair.
His expression.

269
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:01,789
The way he talks.

270
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,925
It's like being immersed
in pleasant music.

271
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,222
Uh-oh.

272
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,496
I shouldn't have worn a sleeveless dress.

273
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:14,800
I get paralyzed just by his gaze.

274
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:18,337
I can't imagine Arima was
immature like me.

275
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,704
He doesn't force his feelings
so it never dawned on me.

276
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,975
But there were hints of
that every so often.

277
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:26,111
Now that I think about it,

278
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,448
he must've been going along at my
pace because I'm such a baby.

279
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,281
And I express my feelings like a dog...

280
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:33,383
I have to tell him.

281
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,347
I love you even more than before.

282
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,917
My heart starts pounding
just by being with you.

283
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,989
Oh god that's embarassing.

284
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,958
No! I have a bad habit of suddenly
becoming shy about such things.

286
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,596
I have to express very important feelings.

287
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,627
I'm sure he'll be really happy.

288
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:51,373
I'm so glad I can make him happy.

289
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,706
But, if I said that what
would happen to us afterwards?

291
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,581
Want something to drink?

292
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:04,420
No thanks.

293
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,089
Oh, sorry.

294
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,686
N..Not at all!

295
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:27,976
Wow, that was great!

296
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:31,408
That final confrontation was awesome!

298
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,873
What should we do now?
Is there anywhere you want to go?

299
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,312
U..Um, no, not really...

300
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,329
You seem depressed today.

301
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,292
You periodically fall silent?

302
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,767
...are you not feeling well?

303
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,301
Oh, no!
That's not it...

304
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,509
Uhm... er... well...

305
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,769
Now, gather your courage
and tell him,

306
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:05,474
...Miyazawa Yukino! Say it, just say it!

307
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,375
Uh, not now... I'll tell you later!

308
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,619
This is bad. I'm sure he thinks
something's wrong.

309
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:14,422
It's just saying I love you.

310
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,324
Why am I so clumsy?

311
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:18,861
I can do everything else so well...

312
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,595
This is awkward.

313
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,501
But I will tell him.

314
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,475
I want to see his face light up.

315
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,312
Why are you avoiding me?

316
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:41,909
I'm not avoid

317
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,220
You're lying. You don't say anything,
or make eye contact.

318
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,380
Have I done something wrong?

319
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:46,522
No...

320
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:50,392
You were so happy yesterday. Why?

321
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,627
My feelings for Arima are
overflowing so much...

322
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,465
...I'm scared to even touch him.

323
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,297
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I...

324
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,666
forgive me

325
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,447
IDIOT! Why can't you ever
say what's important?

326
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,012
I am so useless

327
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,907
Wimp! Coward! Liar! Showoff!

328
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:16,317
I hate myself!!

329
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,411
I hurt him! I hurt Arima's feelings!

330
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,234
I know he's afraid of being?

331
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,935
...rejected more than anything else...

332
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,913
I can't just leave it like this.

333
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,112
I have to apologize.
I have to get him to understand.

334
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,167
I'm not letting you go!

335
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,970
I don't care if you avoid me or hate me.

336
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:11,634
How long do you think I waited
to have you notice me?!

337
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,499
I'm not waiting any longer!

338
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,139
I'm never going to let you go!

339
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:37,756
I'm sorry I scared you.

340
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,668
I wasn't avoiding you.

341
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,697
I didn't touch you because
I was embarassed.

342
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:45,373
I didn't meet your gaze because
I didn't know what to do.

343
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,034
When I saw you again yesterday
after so long, I realized that

344
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,705
I loved you even more than before.

345
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,239
I love you even more than before.

346
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,240
My heart starts pounding just
being with you.

347
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:06,090
I'm so happy...

348
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:11,063
I finally got it out.
I was able to tell Arima.

349
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,769
I'm so happy Arima understood me.

350
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:15,301
We've been going out a long time,

351
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,296
but it feels like it's the first time
we told each other of our love.

352
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,875
I get nervous when I'm with you too.

353
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:23,372
R..Really?

354
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:24,871
It never looks that way...

355
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,211
Even with a girl like me?

356
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:30,208
Of course.
The person you love is special.

357
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,518
I feel like such a baby...

358
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:36,859
You must have a tough time.

359
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:37,988
What?

360
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,223
Oh, nothing.

361
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,291
It's okay. I'm happy every day
as long as you're with me.

362
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,797
It was so comfortable being
next to Arima...

363
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,500
...that we just kept watching the moon
suspended in the sky.

364
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,350
PREVIEW

365
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:55,691
Arima-kun came back!

366
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,686
Sis gets really excited.

367
00:20:58,097 --> 00:20:59,394
But he was beginning to have?

368
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:00,696
...trouble coping with his reality.

369
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,228
And the time has finally come
to cross a certain line!

370
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:05,695
Next time on KareKano: Deepening

371
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,537
Well, I just hope it's not a
means of escape.
