1
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:06,052
Say, Nana Komatsu.

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,592
Do you remember
the first time we met?

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:12,132
I'm the type who doesn't believe
in fate one bit.

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,592
I think this was
all a coincidence.

5
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,832
When I was darkness at that time

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,662
With trembling lips

7
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:46,762
In a corner of a room I cry

8
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:51,842
The more I struggle

9
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:54,672
The more this wound deepens

10
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:57,842
The broken promise hurt me

11
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:02,572
Nobody can save me

12
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:05,752
God, I have only one request

13
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:09,382
Stop tearing apart my love

14
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,722
I need your love

15
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:15,962
I'm a broken rose

16
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,902
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

17
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:21,072
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

18
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:23,842
I need your love

19
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:27,142
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:30,082
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

21
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:34,032
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

22
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:37,012
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:40,242
I'm a broken rose

24
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,582
I wanna need your love

25
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,122
Hello! Welcome to Junko's room.

26
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,802
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

27
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:58,302
I thought it was Nana's room?

28
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:01,572
No, this is my room.
I'm the master here, you know.

29
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,572
You are?

30
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,142
You know what?

31
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:06,242
I've been really exhausted
as of late.

32
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,712
Even though you play
a small role?

33
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,842
Hey, you're no different.

34
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,852
I'm exhausted because of Nana.
Ah, the Nana also known as Hachi.

35
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:14,682
I see.

36
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,692
Why won't Nana get it
into her head?

37
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,122
It's been one headache after another
ever since she moved to Tokyo.

38
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,932
It's spring!
Spring has finally come!

39
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,962
After the long wait,
spring has arrived!

40
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:32,462
Nana says she's on her way
to Tokyo.

41
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,402
- Y-Yes?!
- Y-Yes?!

42
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,702
One ticket to Tokyo. One way.

43
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,812
Okay, then. Let's make a toast.

44
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,212
A toast to what?

45
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:47,372
Well...

46
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,142
To Shoji passing
the University exams!

47
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:50,712
No, that has nothing to do
with me.

48
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,692
Then, can we at least drink
to this unique moment?

49
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,192
Hey, I like that.

50
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,902
To two girls, the same age,

51
00:02:57,902 --> 00:03:00,562
arriving in Tokyo at the same time
on the same train.

52
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,492
That's quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

53
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,872
And to one more thing.

54
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:08,812
My name is Nana too, Nana.

55
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:21,282
Nana!

56
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,352
That's you, right, Nana?!
No way!

57
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,652
What a coincidence!

58
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:25,382
Who are you?

59
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,392
Am I such a forgettable person?

60
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,552
Sorry, sorry.

61
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,162
Are you all right, Nana-chan?

62
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:34,132
So you do remember.

63
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:44,162
Then starting tomorrow,
we're roommates, Nana-chan.

64
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,492
What in the world
were you thinking?!

65
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:06,592
Why not? Sharing is cool!
Like the foreigners do!

66
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,192
You're so easily fooled by others!

67
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:12,032
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to move in with a complete stranger.

68
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,502
What were you thinking?

69
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,942
Okay, I got it.
Let's live together.

70
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:23,272
You wouldn't wanna live with me.
You'll hate it.

71
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,912
I'm always wanting my own way,
and I whine.

72
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:27,682
You think I don't know that?

73
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,722
I'm used to it, or rather,
I've given up about that.

74
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,522
How dare you!

75
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:33,682
Just kidding. Let's do it, okay?

76
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,252
Shoji...

77
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:38,462
Thank you.

78
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,332
That makes me happy.

79
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:41,722
But I can't!

80
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:45,702
Those words were all
I needed to hear.

81
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:48,232
You've chosen me over Sachiko.

82
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,462
Who the heck is Sachiko?

83
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,602
You're just too kind.

84
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,012
If we live together,

85
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,812
I'm going to rely on you
too much all the time.

86
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,252
I don't want to be a burden
anymore than I already am.

87
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:06,092
Her effort in not wanting to be
a burden is splendid for Nana's standards,

88
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,752
or so I thought at the time.

89
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:11,202
But it was just a matter of Nana
now relying on someone else instead.

90
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,492
The other Nana.

91
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,732
Although that's also what
you'd expect of her.

92
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,872
Hey Nana, don't you think
these cups are super cute?

93
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,432
You'd never imagine
they're only a dollar each.

94
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,672
Strawberries?

95
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:24,832
No?

96
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,302
If you want it, go ahead and buy it.

97
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:27,442
Forget it then.

98
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:28,412
Why?!

99
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,082
Because. If you're not interested,
I don't want it either.

100
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,782
I wanna use the same things
you do.

101
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:36,312
I don't care what we use.
Let's just get the shopping done.

102
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,922
But you don't like this, do you?
The strawberries.

103
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,962
Ah, sure I love strawberries...

104
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:42,322
...to eat.

105
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:44,262
Then I'm getting these.

106
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,492
I feel for Shoji.

107
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:47,392
What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:50,592
Well, you're like...
You know, kinda like a dog.

109
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:51,292
I am?

110
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:54,472
You kinda stick around friendly-like
and you're real sincere,

111
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,672
but you need a lot of caring.

112
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,342
Like, not that I mind,

113
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:00,872
I was thinking about
getting a pet anyway.

114
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,482
Hey Hachi, want me
to buy you a toy?

115
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:07,182
Hachi? Don't you have
a cuter name for me?

116
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:12,852
So you guys are Nana and Hachi?
What a combination.

117
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,832
Well, actually my name
is Nana too,

118
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,392
but it's confusing to
have the same name, so Nana...

119
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,052
Was that the reason?
It's because you're like a pet dog.

120
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:24,662
- Beer. Want some?
- Yay!

121
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,202
No, not "yay!"
You got work, remember?

122
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,572
But I'm thirsty!
No, I'm hungry!

123
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,242
I should have bought something!

124
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,582
By the way, I ate the hamburger.

125
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,272
It was awesome good!
Thanks.

126
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,682
You ate it all by yourself. Not fair!

127
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,372
Well then, write "do not eat"
on the darn thing next time!

128
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,122
Found a cute bakery!

129
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,922
They all look really good!
I don't know which one to get!

130
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:51,032
You really do have a good nose,
don't you?

131
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,532
Being a dog.

132
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:56,292
Hey Nana. I've been looking
for this CD.

133
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:57,862
Would you mind if
we look in that shop?

134
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,402
I don't mind,
but do you have a CD player?

135
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:03,532
Well, if you wanna use mine,
that's fine by me.

136
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:04,772
Thank you!

137
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:09,582
Great, they still had a few left!

138
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,282
The new Trapnest album
went on sale today!

139
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,922
I just love them.

140
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,352
If you'd like,
you should listen to them, too.

141
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,822
They're super cool.

142
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:23,722
Hang on a minute while I go
and pay for this.

143
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:38,332
You like this?

144
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:39,842
I got it from a street vendor.

145
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,542
It's a Sid Vicious pad lock.

146
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,242
And who are you? Nancy?

147
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,782
So what are you going to do
putting a lock on me?

148
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:55,592
Hey Ren. If I were to die,
would you die with me?

149
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,422
Okay.

150
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:50,612
The other Nana also seems
to have quite a history.

151
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,842
You got that right.

152
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:56,252
You know, it's as if the more
she became closer to the other Nana,

153
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,722
the more the distance
between she and Shoji increased.

154
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,512
That's right.

155
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:05,132
I should've known
there was something going on,

156
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,392
you finding a job so quickly.

157
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,292
Didn't expect such a young boss.

158
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,762
Koichi Sato!
Another burger please.

159
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:13,862
You got it.

160
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,632
Hey, you know I don't care.

161
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,182
As long as you have a job.

162
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,302
Never mind the reasons
for sticking to it.

163
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:24,782
Just don't give Shoji
a hard time.

164
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,912
Like last night, too, he got drunk
and started saying stuff.

165
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:28,992
Saying stuff?!

166
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,742
"Last night, too?"
Is he always saying stuff about me?

167
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,752
Uh...

168
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,832
So actually,
Shoji really doesn't like me!

169
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:36,992
Because I'm good for nothing!

170
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,532
It's not like that.

171
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,102
Shoji is so in love with you,

172
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,732
he doesn't know what to do
with himself.

173
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:48,772
You're not going to find a man
like that just anywhere,

174
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,212
you know that?

175
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,342
You gotta take better care
of him, man.

176
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,042
Otherwise that's when
heaven'll get you back.

177
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,812
Work again?
What are you working so much for?

178
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,052
Your parents send you money,
don't they?

179
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,262
Not enough to live on.

180
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:09,222
When I start school,
I won't have time to work.

181
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,792
I've got to save up while I can.

182
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:12,932
That's what you say.

183
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:14,472
You're not spending money
on Sachiko, I hope!

184
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:16,462
Buying her Louis Vuitton bags
and Prada shoes.

185
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,262
But she really likes these brands.

186
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,532
I'm just kidding!

187
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,142
You're the one that keeps
bringing her up!

188
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,712
I know, but I came all the way
to Tokyo to be with you

189
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,732
and you spend all of
your time working.

190
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:30,512
I just wish you would make
some time for me.

191
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:33,112
You're the one
that's not being considerate.

192
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:37,142
Why should I always have
to adjust to your plans?

193
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,402
I've got to go to work now,
so I'm off.

194
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,832
I just remembered.
You sent me an email yesterday.

195
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:52,962
Huh?

196
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,702
Well, if it's not important,
never mind.

197
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,312
It's just that I fell asleep
without noticing it came.

198
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:01,512
Sorry.

199
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:06,852
Oh yeah, I did send one.

200
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:08,292
What did I write?

201
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:08,752
Shoji, I'm on my way home.
Call me when you get off work.
What did I write?

202
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,742
Shoji, I'm on my way home.
Call me when you get off work.

203
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,412
Come on, don't look so gloomy.

204
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,942
Right. Love will always have
its ups and downs.

205
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:48,522
Oh, by the way, that band
of the other Nana!

206
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:49,792
They've got
their band members now, don't they?

207
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:51,552
Y-Yeah, you're right.

208
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,402
That's the flower of the lotus, isn't it?

209
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:56,832
Why did you choose the lotus?

210
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,832
Actually, it's the ren.

211
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,672
Huh? Sui-ren?

212
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:02,742
Just plain ren.

213
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:03,902
You mean lotus.

214
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:04,632
I said no.

215
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,472
But that's totally a lotus.

216
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,072
Oh shut up!

217
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:11,412
But it definitely is a lotus.
Why are you being so stubborn?

218
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,482
Who's the stubborn one?!

219
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,782
Who could it be at
this time of night?

220
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:23,792
Good evening.

221
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,832
Nobu! What the heck
are you doing here?!

222
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,692
Oh wonderful!
The exact response I was expecting!

223
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,432
Good!

224
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,102
Get outta here. Go home!

225
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,802
Nana! Please!
Let me stay here just one night!

226
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:37,432
No way.

227
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:39,002
- In fact, I...
- I don't wanna hear it.

228
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,202
I ran away from home.

229
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,112
I told you, I don't wanna hear it!

230
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:42,802
Nana!

231
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:45,252
It's for him.
He needs to smarten up!

232
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:46,682
Now you listen to me, Nobu.

233
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,282
You are to follow your father's footsteps
and run that huge Japanese inn.

234
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:50,812
Get it through your head.

235
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:53,012
I didn't choose to be born
into that family.

236
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:55,962
Quit being a brat about it!

237
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,622
As long as I can play my guitar,
I'm happy.

238
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:01,622
And I wanna play for you.

239
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:04,232
Don't make me repeat myself.

240
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:11,472
Hello Yasu? Do something
about this stupid son, will ya?!

241
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:14,702
Oh sorry,
but he insisted that he'd go.

242
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:17,342
What do you mean, "but"?!
What are you gonna do about it?!

243
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,182
There's nothing
I can do about it, Nana.

244
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:20,542
Nobu's serious.

245
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:22,022
Why don't you find...

246
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,712
some new band members
and start over?

247
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,092
Oh by the way, did ya listen
to the tape?

248
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:28,222
Tape?

249
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,022
The new number Nobu wrote.

250
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,062
It's good.

251
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:37,002
If you sing it, in my opinion,
nobody's got a chance over you guys.

252
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:50,142
What's this?

253
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:53,082
Man, only one guest
in the house tonight?

254
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:54,752
Pretty shabby if you ask me.

255
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:58,052
Oh, well, I guess that's how it is
when just starting off.

256
00:13:58,322 --> 00:13:59,762
One's better than none.

257
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,532
Good evening. We're Blast.

258
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:05,952
Welcome to
our very first Tokyo performance.

259
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:07,822
Good evening...

260
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,702
I'll make this a night
you'll never forget.

261
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,792
Looking for a drummer and bassist!
Wanna join our band and go pro?
Those of you who like the Sex Pistols
Ask the store clerk for details

262
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,362
I just saw the poster out front.

263
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,382
Ow!

264
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,092
Nana!

265
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:46,722
I'm sorry, did I do something weird?

266
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,162
No, it's not that at all.

267
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,562
You just surprised us.
You're a lot better than we expected.

268
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,432
What do you think, Nana?
This kid's good.

269
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:53,972
Let's let him in, okay?

270
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,272
So, your name's, Shinichi.
Is that right?

271
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,032
Yes.

272
00:15:57,912 --> 00:15:59,672
Name a guitarist you respect.

273
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,132
Ren Honjo!

274
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:10,342
There's one thing you have
to promise me first.

275
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:13,492
If you can't, then you're gonna hafta
decline right this moment.

276
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,052
Shin, do better than Ren.

277
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:21,922
Yes! Of course,
that's what I intend to do.

278
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:25,972
Isn't that wonderful?

279
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:28,272
You found such a great bass player
in such a short time!

280
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:29,502
And he's cute!

281
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,612
So who do you have to thank?
Hey, who do you have to thank?

282
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,502
You want a prize that badly?

283
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:36,182
Let's see, then...

284
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,612
Don't litter!

285
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,052
Thank you, Hachiko.

286
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,552
I-I thought you didn't hit
on women!

287
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,672
It's not right!
I have a boyfriend!

288
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:58,172
What's she getting all uptight
about over a kiss?

289
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,502
It's not like she's a virgin.

290
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:09,142
Say, shouldn't you call Natsuko
and thank her?

291
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,742
I'll do it later.

292
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,892
Oh, I see. If you call now,
you'd be embarrassed

293
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,822
because you'll cry the moment
you hear mommy's voice.

294
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,392
Well, sure.

295
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:21,552
You get homesick too,
sometimes, don't you, Nana?

296
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:24,822
No, since I don't have a home.

297
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:29,802
There you go, trying to be cool again.

298
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:02,222
Yasu, Blast is the band you started.

299
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:06,542
Yeah. I was so worried
I couldn't sleep at night.

300
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,732
Besides, there are law firms
in Tokyo too.

301
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:29,492
The other Nana began to sing,
and she now has her band members.

302
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,392
I'll bet every day is new
and inspiring for Nana.

303
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:37,932
Yeah, but she's practically ignored Shoji.

304
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,532
And as if to fill that gap in Shoji's life...
in comes Sachiko.

305
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,502
That's right. The real Sachiko.

306
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,672
My name is Sachiko Kawamura.
It's nice to meet you.

307
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,542
Your first name?

308
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,442
Sachiko.

309
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:53,512
Do you...

310
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:55,552
Do you like Louis Vuitton and Prada?

311
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,312
Huh?

312
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:57,682
I get it.

313
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:00,352
Well, I was just as surprised.

314
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,562
You have the same employer,
go to the same university,

315
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,222
and enroll at the same faculty.

316
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,602
Guess you pretty well hafta
get along.

317
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,772
Yes, but Sachiko was accepted
on her first try,

318
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:10,702
so she's two years younger.

319
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:11,602
Sachiko?

320
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:15,002
I can't help it.
She asked me to call her that.

321
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:16,432
There was no reason to refuse.

322
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,602
She's clearly your type.
Petite and fair-skinned.

323
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:21,932
You can't help it.

324
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,452
But I'm telling you,
it's not like that!

325
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,712
I'm proud that
you're holding back.

326
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:27,682
She's back.

327
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,482
Here, Shoji. Is coffee okay?

328
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:32,922
Yeah. Thanks.

329
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,382
Mr. Kyosuke,
which would you prefer?

330
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:37,992
Just call me Kyosuke, Sa-chan.

331
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,362
That's gonna be trouble.

332
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,402
But even I find her cute.

333
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,462
This is definitely bad.

334
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,172
Oh! My shoe!

335
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,552
Shoji!

336
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,382
Huh?!

337
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,312
Sorry, Shoji. Go on ahead.
You'll miss the last train!

338
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:05,152
Hey!

339
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:27,412
You knew you would hafta run
for the last train.

340
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,352
So why did you hafta
wear those shoes?

341
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:40,552
I did it on purpose.

342
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:45,292
This seriously doesn't look good.

343
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:46,452
"I did it on purpose."

344
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:49,462
It's her secret weapon.
"I did it on purpose."

345
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,062
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,372
So, there you have it.

347
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:57,502
How did you enjoy
the first episode of "Junko's Room"?

348
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:58,972
First episode?

349
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,112
You mean there's gonna be
a second episode?

350
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,182
Well, that all depends
on whether or not

351
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,912
the Demon Lord wants it or not.

352
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:06,442
Bye-bye.

353
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:07,612
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

354
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:12,812
I reached into the sky

355
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:19,332
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

356
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:24,702
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

357
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:30,702
Like colorful balloons

358
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,812
I'm alone

359
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:36,542
My hand had no place to go

360
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:43,182
And gently you took it

361
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,352
Starless night

362
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:48,552
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

363
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:54,362
I want to feel your warmth

364
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,232
Tears are falling down

365
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:00,372
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

366
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:06,832
Of your hand holding mine
