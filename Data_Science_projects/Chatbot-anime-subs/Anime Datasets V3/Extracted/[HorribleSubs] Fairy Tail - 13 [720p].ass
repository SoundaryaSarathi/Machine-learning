Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.05,0:06:33.41,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Ms. Lucy, someone is coming! {In cases like this, it's less who the subject (in this case, Lucy) is and more who the speaker is. In this case, the spealer is an extra, so their should be as neutral a characterization as possible. If it were, say, an older gentleman like the Village Chief, then "Miss" would be approprioate. Both Ms. and Miss call attention to themselves, so either is all right in this case (I would use Ms. since it's a little more neutral), but the general rule is that such titles reflect the character of the speaker more than the subject.}{should I be PC and use Ms.?  I think Lucy is definitely a "Miss" to me}

I should have included it, though. Anyway, I used "Rock-Iron" to indicate the hardness in the manga. Also, Hardiron as one word looks too much like the name Hadrian (there were several popes named Hadrian), and I got very confused on how to pronounce it. If you want to use "hard" and "iron," I'd use two words, even if it is something in real life.}{note: I'm translating "gantetsu" here as "hardiron"... I haven't seen this translation before but I think it's a good one... the kanji compound is the class where the first is modfying the second, so it means a rocky kind of iron, i.e. iron that's really solid. Note, "hard-iron" with hyphen is an actual metallurgy term having to do with magetic properties so I'll just use the one word "hardiron" I didn't find this in your glossary, nor the name "Jera", so spellings are best guesses}
