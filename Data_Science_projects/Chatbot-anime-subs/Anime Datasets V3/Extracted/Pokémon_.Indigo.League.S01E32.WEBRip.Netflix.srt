00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,220
Won't you please let Ash
ride you tomorrow?

172
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,222
[grunts]

173
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,104
Remember, Ponyta.

174
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,819
[groans] Hey, it's not hot.

175
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,322
I did it. Yeah!

176
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,241
Oh! [yelling]

177
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,120
[Brock sighs]

178
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,664
-At least he's hanging in there.
-Pika.

179
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,584
[yelling]

180
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,380
[cheering]

181
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,300
[announcer] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to this year's Pokémon challenge,

182
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,843
sponsored by the Laramie clan.

183
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,222
Our course takes our challengers
over rugged terrain

184
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,807
to test their speed and ability.

185
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,726
Whoever clears all the obstacles
and crosses the finish line first

186
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,269
is our winner.

187
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,190
Will the Pokémon and trainers
please come to the starting line now?

188
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,444
-Good luck, guys!
-Huh?

189
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,197
Ready to race, Ponyta?

190
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,450
-Hey!
-They're going to burn up the track!

191
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,869
Ready...

192
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,334
Go!

193
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,714
[announcer] And they're off
on this exciting Pokémon challenge race.

194
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,383
When the dust settles,
we'll be able to see

195
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,468
who's in the early lead.

196
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,970
-Squirtle!
-Pika!

197
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,805
Now the contestants have left the stadium

198
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,349
and are on the first part
of the obstacle course.

199
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,310
-Yee-ha!
-Pika, pika! Pi.

200
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,773
[announcer] And Dario riding Dodrio
has pulled away from the pack.

201
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,610
If he keeps up this blistering pace,
he'll be unstoppable.

202
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,736
You can beat him, Ash.

203
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,118
[moos]

204
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,412
[announcer]
And something has happened to the Tauros.

205
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,622
It's acting like this is a rodeo.

206
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:10,378
Whoa! And now Nidorina is fighting mad
after getting bumped by Tauros.

207
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,047
They're ignoring their trainers
and starting to battle.

208
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,675
These Pokémon could use
some strict training.

209
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,385
They look like they're out of this race.

210
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,847
-I got a bull's-eye!
-Or close to it.

211
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,434
[announcer] The next obstacle
is a 45-degree uphill climb,

212
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,604
a test of endurance
for the Pokémon and their trainers,

213
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,398
and Dario still holds the lead.

214
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,191
[grunts] Come on, Ponyta!

215
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,738
Squirtle. Squirtle.

216
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,283
[announcer] Bringing up the rear
are Pikachu and Squirtle,

217
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,037
but slow and steady may not be enough
to win this race.

218
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,500
Whoa! Who is that
barreling down the steep slope?

219
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,002
-What?
-He's fast!

220
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,339
That's Electrode
using its perfectly round body

221
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,509
to gain speed
and take the lead on the downhill.

222
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,219
[both laughing]

223
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,097
[announcer]
Oh, and it's another accident!

224
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:08,811
Electrode has fallen into a hole,
and Dodrio once again takes over the lead.

225
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,190
Oh, no!
Electrode's voltage level is too high!

226
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,859
-Ah!
-Ash!

227
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,528
[announcer] What a shock!

228
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,323
Electrode's most powerful attack:
explosion.

229
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,659
It's destroyed everything around.

230
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,828
Electrode's living up
to its bomb ball nickname.

231
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,580
[both laughing]

232
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,290
Another one bites the dust.

233
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,085
-Pikachu.
-[Squirtle grunting]

234
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,005
-Pikachu!
-[screaming]

235
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,674
-[sighs]
-Oh, no!

236
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,050
[announcer] They're back up!

237
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:44,138
Ponyta and Lara's replacement, Ash,
are showing that they've really got guts.

238
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,099
All right.

239
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,268
[announcer] Now one of the most difficult
sections of the course.

240
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,561
The Pokémon have to jump

241
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,147
from one stone to the next
to cross the river.

242
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,691
Go! Go, Dodrio!

243
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
[growling]

244
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,077
Ah!

245
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,038
That's okay. We tried.

246
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,707
Ah! Too bad, folks.

247
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,752
Rock Pokémon can't deal with water,
so Onyx is out of here.

248
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,920
Pika!

249
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,297
[announcer]
And looks like surf's up for Pikachu.

250
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,468
Squirtle and Starmie are performing
like true-blue water Pokémon.

251
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,181
-I'll keep on going, Brock!
-Pikachu.

252
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,517
[announcer] Ponyta's a great jumper
and crossing beautifully,

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,978
with no fear of the water.
It could make a comeback!

254
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,938
Faster! Faster! Faster!

255
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,484
That's it. You can do it, Ash.

256
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,195
[announcer] Now to boost their energy,
each Pokémon can resume the race

257
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,449
only after eating an entire bowl of food.

258
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,117
The Pokémon decide which bowl to eat.

259
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,787
Ah! Oh, quit fighting!

260
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,497
You'll all get your fair share.

261
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,916
[announcer] It looks like each one
of Dodrio's three heads

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,627
wants to eat first,
and a fight's broken out!

263
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,921
The fastest runner
is losing valuable time here

264
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,301
as Starmie, Squirtle and Ponyta
appear on the scene.

265
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,511
Okay, Ponyta, time for some fast food.

266
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,221
[grumbles]

267
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,474
All right, Team Rocket,
time to go to work!

268
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,267
Ah!

269
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,061
[announcer]
We've got a major problem here, folks.

270
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,354
Black smoke is blowing over the course.

271
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,441
I hope our camera crew
can get our picture back soon

272
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,652
and show us if there's been
another accident out there.

273
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,904
Ponyta.

274
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,697
[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.

275
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,367
[James] Make it double.

276
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,785
It's Team Rocket.

277
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,703
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

278
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,830
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

279
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,832
To denounce the evils of truth and love

280
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,043
To extend our reach to the stars above.

281
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,753
-Jessie.
-James.

282
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,297
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

283
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,217
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,927
Meowth! That's right!

285
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,888
We don't have time
to play around with you three stooges!

286
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,765
How dare compare us to the...

287
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,434
I mean, come on up.
I'd like to have a word with you.

288
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,646
Yes, come on up
and bring your Ponyta with you.

289
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,356
Then I can mess you up again.

290
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,359
"Mess you up again?"
So it was Team Rocket!

291
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,319
It was you who broke Lara's arm.

292
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,782
-It was such a sad accident.
-We couldn't sleep after it happened.

293
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,283
Save your tears!

294
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,745
Pikachu, Squirtle, get ready to rumble!

295
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,746
Squirtle!

296
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,165
This race is over for you, losers.

297
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,209
Arbok, glare attack!

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,961
-Squirtle!
-Pika!

299
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,796
Let's go, Starmie!

300
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,133
Weezing, sludge attack now!

301
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,555
[grunts]

302
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,765
You okay, Starmie?

303
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,726
-I think we're winning.
-I think you're right.

304
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,312
Whoa! Settle down, Ponyta.

305
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,689
Hey, calm down!

306
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,399
Dario. Now's your chance.

307
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,943
Thanks, Jessie! Go, Dodrio.

308
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,989
Team Rocket's working for Dario.

309
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,659
Ash! Forget about them.

310
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,287
You have to win this race
for Lara Laramie.

311
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,623
Go catch up with Dario,
and we'll take care of Team Rocket.

312
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,168
-But... But I...
-Pika!

313
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,588
Stop Ponyta with your poison sting.

314
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,631
-Ar!
-Ah!

315
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,467
[neighs]

316
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,095
Arbok!

317
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,180
[grunts]

318
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,182
Oh, no! Don't use the gas.

319
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,601
[all screaming]

320
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,317
Things seemed to be going so well for us
this time.

321
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,736
Maybe we'll have better luck next time.

322
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,989
Now we're blasting off again!

323
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:37,622
[announcer] Yes. Now we've got our picture
back and Dodrio is still in the lead!

324
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,751
Now let's take a look at what happened to
the other Pokémon and I can't see any...

325
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,212
Wait. Who's that?

326
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,464
It's a giant burning flame!

327
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,716
Faster, Ponyta. We're way behind!

328
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,636
[announcer] It's Ponyta!
I don't know how it happened,

329
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,430
but it looks like this has become
a two Pokémon race

330
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,225
between Dodrio and Ponyta,

331
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,603
with nothing left but a flat-out run
to the finish line.

332
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,732
And Dodrio has entered the stadium,
still in the lead!

333
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,234
[cackles]

334
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,194
I'm going to win this one! [cackles]

335
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,906
[cheers and applause]

336
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,867
Huh? How'd he get so close?

337
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,162
[announcer]
Now Ponyta's closing in on Dodrio.

338
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,039
Okay, Ponyta, let's beat him.

339
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,375
[announcer]
Now, these two powerful Pokémon

340
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,252
are trading the lead.

341
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,337
Do it, Dodrio.

342
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,839
Ah! [moaning]

343
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,301
[announcer] Something's happened.
Ponyta is falling behind.

344
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,262
That was a cheap shot, Dario!

345
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,722
I do what I have to to win.

346
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,226
[announcer]
Dodrio is closing in on the finish line!

347
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,730
[groaning and gasping]

348
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,324
[screaming]

349
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,286
-Ponyta just--
-Evolved into Rapidash.

350
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,204
[announcer]
Fans, this is incredible!

351
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,956
Ponyta has evolved into Rapidash,

352
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,251
the fastest sprinter
in the world of Pokémon.

353
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,211
I can't believe it.

354
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,754
[announcer]
Here comes Rapidash,

355
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,716
who has a top speed
of over 100 mile an hour!

356
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,883
And Rapidash has caught up!

357
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,845
They're neck and neck
heading for the finish line.

358
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,180
Come on, Dodrio!

359
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,807
Rapidash!

360
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,976
[announcer]
It's down to the wire!

361
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,483
[cheers and applause]

362
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,819
[announcer] An incredible upset!

363
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:37,366
Rapidash makes an amazing comeback
to win this Pokémon challenge!

364
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,578
-Way to go, Rapidash!
-You cheater!

365
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,246
You interfered with me!

366
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,498
-You're the one who attacked me.
-I'll show you.

367
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,500
Go get them!

368
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,922
Huh? Oh!

369
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,344
[announcer] Congratulations, Ponyta...
I mean, Rapidash!

370
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,889
You are this year's
Pokémon challenge champion.

371
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,476
Let's give a big hand for its trainer,
Lara Laramie,

372
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,895
and for the winning rider, Ash Ketchum!

373
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,606
-[barks]
-Yeah!

374
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,857
Squirtle.

375
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,320
-Hey, congratulations, Lara. [chuckles]
-Thank you, Ash.

376
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,032
You proved yourself
to be a fantastic Pokémon trainer.

377
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,034
Isn't that right, Rapidash?

378
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,745
[giggles] Aw, shucks, Rapidash!

379
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:27,249
[all laugh]

380
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,420
If you're looking to capture Pokémon,

381
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,673
the Safari Zone just ahead
should be perfect.

382
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,634
The Safari Zone? That's the place for me.

383
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,679
Thanks again, Ash. You did a great job.

384
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,098
I'm sure you'll be a Pokémon master.

385
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,558
Thanks, Lara, I'm much obliged.

You're the reason I didn't win
the Pokémon challenge.

391
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,826
Team Rocket's the worst.

392
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,120
We'll just have to plan better next year.

393
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,831
And maybe you can get yourself
some nicer riding clothes.

394
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,541
