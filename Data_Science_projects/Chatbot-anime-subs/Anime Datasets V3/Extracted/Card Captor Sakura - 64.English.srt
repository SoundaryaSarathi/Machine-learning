1
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,738
Ah! It’s pudding!!!!!

2
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:27,596
Since no one’s home,
Sakura’s left me

3
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:35,068
lots and LOTS of goodies to eat!
ALL MINE!!!

4
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:43,036
Mmmm…! So cold, so good.
This is the life!

5
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:50,647
I guess now Sakura should be enjoying
in the snow as white as this pudding.

6
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,357
Wow!

7
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:09,179
[Sakura and the
Snow Blowing Ski Class]

8
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,078
Let’s go! Next.

9
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:26,789
Good luck, Sakura-chan!

10
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,164
Tomoyo-chan!

11
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,338
That was great, Sakura-chan!

12
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,368
It’s not that great.
I just can move without falling.

13
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,738
But, you’re really good
Tomoyo-chan!

14
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:49,482
You’re good at both ice-skating
and skiing!

15
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:53,155
My mother’s had me in lessons
ever since I was little.

16
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:58,219
This is your first time, isn’t it?

17
00:01:58,696 --> 00:01:59,287
Yes.

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,296
And you’re doing so
well after only an hour…

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,563
That is soo great!

20
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:07,469
Isn’t that Eriol-kun?

21
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:08,566
Amazing!!

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,015
Wow! You’re amazing, Eriol-kun!

23
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,787
Thank you very much!

24
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:31,056
You really can do everything,
can’t you?

25
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,057
You can even ski.

26
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:34,858
It’s not that hard.

27
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:37,559
You’re doing well, too, Sakura.

28
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,132
About skiing…

29
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,500
In ancient times,
they used to ski in sandals.

30
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:44,671
Sandals?

31
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:46,969
But, it must have been

32
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:49,343
very difficult to glide in sandals.

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,908
Even so, they managed it.

34
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,082
Right, Hiiragizawa-kun?

35
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:59,522
Yes. And they were a meter long too.

36
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,125
Wow! They had special
skiing sandals back then?

37
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,292
That’s not quite right.

38
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,732
They would load their baggage
on the extra length.

39
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,892
And if there was no snow…

40
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,470
They would be in big trouble…

41
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,200
So, they would do most of their
transporting while running very fast.

42
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:22,741
And they would have contests to see
who could run fastest in their sandals.

43
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:25,508
And so in the winter,

44
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,579
The sport of skiing was developed.

45
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:29,078
Isn’t that right?

46
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:29,952
That’s right.

47
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,693
Hoee!!

48
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,892
With Hiiragizawa-kun in on it,
 I can’t be sure whether they’re
telling the truth or not…

49
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:43,222
At least the two of them
are enjoying themselves.

50
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,291
Of course, monkeys are best…

51
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:52,771
Shao Lan-kun!

52
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,344
Watch out!

53
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:06,919
Get out of the way!!!

54
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,933
He’s going to hit the tree!

55
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:19,065
Shao Lan-kun!

56
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,214
Are you alright?

57
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:40,448
Hiiragizawa…

58
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,625
You still have some things to learn,
don’t you…?

59
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,159
But I’m sure you’ll manage.

60
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:56,031
Skiing… and everything else.

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
You’ve said that before.

62
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,900
What do you mean?

63
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:06,910
Shao Lan-kun! Hoe!

64
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:09,242
Are you ok?

65
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,112
I’m fine.

66
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:12,686
What about you?

67
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,621
I… I’m ok.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,224
I’m glad!

69
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:38,447
Skiing is fun, isn’t it?

70
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,115
Yes, you’ve improved a lot since
this morning, Sakura-chan.

71
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,553
You’re doing really well
for your first time, too, Naoko-chan!

72
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:49,318
Yamazaki-kun was helping me.

73
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,591
Does everyone know?
About skiing…

74
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,190
Give it a rest.

75
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:05,336
Is it really ok for you to spend
your free-time helping me?

76
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:10,613
It’s alright.
I like doing this.

77
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,038
Thank you.

78
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:17,921
Hey, Tomoyo-chan.

79
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,457
Shouldn’t we go help Rika-chan?

80
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,858
I think the two of them are
alright on their own.

81
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:28,663
I just remembered…

82
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,490
About snowy mountains…

83
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,196
Aren’t they spooky?

84
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:40,005
Do you know a ghost story
about these mountains?

85
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,677
No, I don’t.

86
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:48,148
Does anyone else have a story?
About a spooky ski resort?

87
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,489
About ski resorts…

88
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,449
Not lies… ghost stories.

89
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,656
Hiiragizawa-kun, do you know any?

90
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,087
Ghost stories?

91
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,160
I’ve heard there are
lots of ghosts in England.

92
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,895
Can you tell us a story?

93
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,161
Let me think…

94
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,931
Please don’t…

95
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,441
I think I remember one.

96
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,208
Alright!

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,189
Deep in the oldest mountains,
or so I’ve heard it told,

98
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:37,891
When the sky is darkened
with storm clouds,

99
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,800
A cold wind blows down
from the highest peaks.

100
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:47,403
Then, the snow rises up to blind you…

101
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,573
and Yuki-onna appears.

102
00:07:55,552 --> 00:08:00,387
Yuki-onna is the wandering spirit
who comforts the souls of those
who freeze to death.

103
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,555
Isn’t that a Japanese story?

104
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,128
Yes, it is.

105
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,457
Why not tell one from England?

106
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:14,402
I thought this one would be better.

107
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,605
Hoe…!

108
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:20,371
Bu… but we don’t have to worry about
that here, do we?

109
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:24,513
One can never be sure.

110
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:31,681
It’s getting late.
Shouldn’t we turn in?

111
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,858
You’re right. It is late.

112
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,389
Well then, time to hit the sack.

113
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:39,892
Quite true.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,592
Thank you, Hiiragizawa-kun.

115
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:46,660
It was nothing.

116
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,638
Please tell some more later!

117
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,330
Ok. I will.

118
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,343
Yuki-onna…

119
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,378
It would be wonderful to meet her.

120
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,544
I don’t want to.

121
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,312
She must be very beautiful.

122
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:06,612
I still don’t want to.

123
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,723
The story wasn’t really
very scary, though…

124
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,954
It was scary enough.

125
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:17,830
Do you not like scary stories,
Sakura-san?

126
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,428
You should have said something, then…

127
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,706
But Naoko-chan likes them so much…

128
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,943
Aren’t you afraid of anything,
Eriol-kun?

129
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,446
I am.

130
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,085
What?

131
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:42,950
It’s a secret.

132
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:06,480
Sakura-chan…

133
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:14,920
I can’t sleep…

134
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:21,130
Yuki-onna…

135
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,129
It’s very cold.

136
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:44,181
Shao Lan-kun!

137
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:46,923
Shao Lan-kun!

138
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,651
Shao Lan-kun!

139
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,357
Sakura…

140
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:55,525
What is it?

141
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,136
What?

142
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,770
I heard you call my name…

143
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,883
Oh, yeah… 
Thank you for what you did today.

144
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:29,062
I was scared, so you pointed out
that it was time to sleep.

145
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,397
It was nothing.

146
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:37,473
You always say that.
But it’s not true.

147
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,239
Is that you really mean this?

148
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,676
What makes you say that?

149
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:44,443
I know you.

150
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,707
You’re a really nice guy.

151
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:51,916
What’s that supposed to mean?

152
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,020
It’s snowing!

153
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,429
Let’s go outside for a bit!

154
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:07,626
Ok.

155
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,409
Wow! Pretty!

156
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,877
Ooh. Cold.

157
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,283
That’s cute.

158
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:28,986
Look, Shao Lan-kun!

159
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,391
Isn’t it cute?

160
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,057
Oh, yeah. You made a stuffed bear,
too, didn’t you?

161
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:41,900
Have you given it away yet?

162
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,699
No… Not yet.

163
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,935
Yukito-san will be glad to get it.

164
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:57,477
No.

165
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:00,718
It’s not for him.

166
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:05,819
I was only attracted by his magic.

167
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,695
It’s someone else that I care for…

168
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,825
Who?

169
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,606
The person I really care about is…

170
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:29,746
I love…

171
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:30,417
I’m sorry!

172
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:34,181
I shouldn’t force you to tell.

173
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,285
I’m sorry.

174
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:44,361
We should go inside. We’ll catch a cold
if we stay out too long.

175
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:45,825
Ok.

176
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:58,813
Wow!

177
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,577
You’re doing good!

178
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,179
Ok. That was good.
You’ve really improved.

179
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,616
Next! Li!

180
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,696
Alright. You’ve improved, as well, Li.

181
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,398
Ok. From now on is free time.

182
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,366
Do what you want until noon.

183
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,773
Ok!

184
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,373
Kinomoto and Li,

185
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,208
you should be ready for
a higher-level slope.

186
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,339
Ok!

187
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,877
Alright, take care!

188
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:42,717
What do you think, Shao Lan-kun?
Shall we go further up?

189
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:45,559
No.

190
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,531
What was that about?

191
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:57,101
Li-kun is doing well.
He has improved much for one day.

192
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:01,804
He’s good at sports, isn’t he?

193
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:13,553
I think there’s more
to it than that.

194
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:20,457
Oh, snow!

195
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:23,695
It’s really coming down, isn’t it?

196
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:28,263
Yes.
Would it be better to stop for a rest?

197
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,433
I’d like to keep going.

198
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:33,565
I thought I’d try the next-level hill.

199
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,007
Will you come with me,
Tomoyo-chan?

200
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:38,481
I’ll wait at the bottom…

201
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:41,709
And film your triumphant finish!

202
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:46,319
Sakura-chan defeats
the Snow-covered Mountain!

203
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:50,650
How about you, Eriol-kun?

204
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,687
Is it ok for me to go with you?

205
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:53,959
Of course!

206
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,037
It’s really coming down now…

207
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,905
That’s true…

208
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:14,427
When the sky is darkened

209
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:18,401
with storm clouds,

210
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:22,106
a cold wind blows down
from the highest peaks.

211
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:27,744
Then, the snow rises up to blind you…

212
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,744
and Yuki-onna apears.

213
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,741
It seems a blizzard is on the way.

214
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:45,905
We should find shelter,
once we get off the lift.

215
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:49,111
It’ll be dangerous to ski…
We won’t be able to see much.

216
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,861
Hurry! Everyone,
get inside the restaurant! Hurry!

217
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:09,765
It reminds me of Hiiragizawa-kun’s
story, yesterday.

218
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:11,503
It does, doesn’t it?

219
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,809
Has anyone seen Sakura-chan
or Hiiragizawa-kun?

220
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:19,447
They don’t seem to have come in, yet.

221
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:20,948
Is something wrong?

222
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,751
They must still be up there!

223
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:25,553
What?!

224
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,933
No one’s there, and the door is locked.

225
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:45,370
Are you alright?

226
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,637
Yeah.

227
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,808
It’s gotten so dark… 
and the snow’s too thick.

228
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,483
It’s almost blinding…

229
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,377
Yuki-onna…

230
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,549
HOE!!!!! No!!! Stay away from me!!!

231
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,890
I’m sorry.

232
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:09,596
I meant to say that it looks
like the weather in my story…

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,189
Oh…

234
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,828
I’m sorry. I didn’t think
my story would frighten you so much.

235
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,874
Perhaps I shouldn’t have told it.

236
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:25,008
It’s ok. I always over-react…

237
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:25,942
Don’t worry.

238
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:38,286
What?

239
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:45,960
An avalanche?

240
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:47,300
Hurry! We have to run!

241
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:48,729
But…

242
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:56,007
At this rate…

243
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,939
Everyone below will be
buried in the snow.

244
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,312
I have to do something.

245
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,815
But, Eriol-kun is watching me.

246
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,649
I could use Sleep…

247
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:10,517
No! He could be hurt while I was busy.

248
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:14,330
And, if I run away…

249
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:19,861
he’ll worry about me…

250
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:24,264
I’ll have to use that card!

251
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:26,666
Sakura-san!

252
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,104
Wait for just a minute, Eriol-kun!

253
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,783
O Card created by Clow,

254
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:46,284
discard thine old form and be reborn.

255
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:50,264
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

256
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:52,860
TIME!

257
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,411
It takes a lot of
my strength to stop time…

258
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,417
I have to hurry!

259
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,451
Fi… ire… ry

260
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,835
I wonder if they’re ok?

261
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,539
I’ll go look for them.

262
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:10,475
Everyone else, wait here.

263
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:13,772
Sakura-chan!

264
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,589
Hiiragizawa-kun is with her, too!

265
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:24,687
Are you ok?

266
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:25,553
Yeaaaah…

267
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,658
What happened??

268
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,164
Sakura-chan!

269
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,666
She seems to have tired herself out.
We should let her rest.

270
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:35,661
Yeah.

271
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,307
What I’m afraid of is

272
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,445
causing you pain…

273
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,247
But it seems I can’t help that, can I?
