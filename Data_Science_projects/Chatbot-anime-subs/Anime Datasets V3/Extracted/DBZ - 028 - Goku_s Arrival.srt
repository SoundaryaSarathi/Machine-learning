00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,067
Die!!

2
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,296
P- Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

3
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:14,561
Get out of here... Gohan...

4
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:29,648
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!
W- why did you... save me?

5
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:34,745
I- I told you to get out
of here... Hurry, or else...

6
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:42,594
D- don't die! Father will be here
soon to beat him for us!

7
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:45,997
Please, don't die!

8
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:50,035
Miserable fool! My killing order might have
gotten switched around, but oh well.

9
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,435
Either way, it will all
turn out the same.

10
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,616
<i>One Ki is rapidly growing smaller.</i>

11
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>l</i>- <i>is somebody dying!?</i>

12
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,307
K- Kami-<i>sama</i>...

13
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:35,980
I- it looks like my life is about at its end...
G- Goku didn't make it in time...

14
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:43,910
H- however, at the very end, Piccolo
surpassed even me, Kami... I'm so pleased...

15
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,762
Kami-<i>sama</i>!

16
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:54,099
W- what a pitiful tale...

17
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,771
Imagine, Piccolo Daimao,
of all people, protecting some kid...

18
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,602
Nothing could be worse...

19
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:05,299
U- Uncle!

20
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:13,676
Gohan... you're the only one
who ever spoke decent to me...

21
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:53,658
T- this last year that I
spent with you wasn't bad...

22
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:55,751
Uncle!

23
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:00,329
Don't you die, G- Goha-

24
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,603
Uncle!!

25
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:09,274
Mister Popo, I leave
the rest to you...

26
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,707
Kami-<i>sama</i>!

27
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,704
Kami-<i>sama</i>!!

28
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,918
G- Gohan...

29
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,297
Interesting!
You want to fight?

30
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,231
<i>Masenko!!</i>

31
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,726
T- that's an incredible <i>Ki</i>!

32
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:45,977
700... 1200...

33
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,569
2400...

34
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,383
Battle power 2800!?

35
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:55,920
Sure enough, these guys can alter
their battle powers intensely!

36
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,911
2800, huh?

37
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,272
Gohan!

38
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:19,277
For a kid, you can do
some amazing things, huh?

39
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,802
My arm tingles a little.

40
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,884
His battle power just plummeted.

41
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:30,622
It looks like he used up
all of his power just now.

42
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,718
T- they're too strong...
T- they're just too strong...

43
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,965
--Let go of me!
--See here, Chichi Calm down!

44
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,635
--Let me go, I say!
--Come now, Chichi-<i>san</i>...

45
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,636
Let me go!

46
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,640
--H- hold on, now, that's dangerous...
--Come on, calm down, okay? It's not safe.

47
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,339
T- that's dangerous like that! Stop that!

48
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:59,584
Aren't you spirited?

49
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,919
--Uranai Baba!
--Sis!

50
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,185
Goku just passed by Karin Tower.

51
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,519
But will he be in time?

52
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,632
I know! Even without a TV,

53
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:17,268
we can always watch what's happening
using Baba's crystal ball!

54
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:22,570
Don't be ridiculous! You want to use
my sacred crystal ball to do that!?

55
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:28,712
--What are you doing!?
--Never mind, just come on inside!

56
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:39,222
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to avenge you.

57
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,623
Gohan! Run!
Get out of there!

58
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:49,600
Pipsqueak, I'm sending you
to the Next World for sure this time.

59
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,735
I don't have the strength
to run away anymore.

60
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,570
D- damn it all!

61
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:10,588
I can't wait to see the look
on Kakarrot's face...

62
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,648
...when he sees his own son
smashed to a pulp!

63
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,608
Kinto Un?

64
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,942
What is that?

65
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,968
Father!

66
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,139
G- Goku!

67
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,980
So you've finally shown up, huh?

68
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:09,974
G- Goku! We've been
waiting for you!

69
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:11,771
Father!

70
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:18,583
What have you come
all this way for, Kakarrot?

71
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,919
Don't tell me you're here
to tell us some nonsensical joke,

72
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,683
such as you've come
to defeat us, or something.

73
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,563
Piccolo...

74
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:43,838
Piccolo-<i>san</i> died to protect me.

75
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:55,242
Tenshinhan...

76
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,693
Yamucha...

77
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:10,301
Shocked over your dead
idiot friends, are you?

78
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:14,237
Come to think of it, there was another,
puny little guy, that went to pieces.

79
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,540
He had more power than you'd
expect for such a runt.

80
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:34,992
Naturally, he was no
match for Nappa-<i>sama</i>.

81
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:41,556
<i>ls that so? Even Chaozu?</i>
<i>And Kami-sama, too... Damn...</i>

82
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:50,007
There's no need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining your friends soon.

83
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:52,610
After going through all the trouble
to come back to life,

84
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,942
you just had to stroll on by, huh?

85
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,557
His battle power is rising
higher and higher.

86
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,391
W- what? You want to die already?

87
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,230
Here's something
by way of greeting!

88
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,272
<i>He's fast!</i>

89
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,476
Gohan, over here.

90
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,316
Kuririn...

91
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,652
G- Goku...

92
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:40,992
Sorry I'm late.
Way to hang on, you two.

93
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,995
Each of you eat half of this.

94
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,332
I- isn't that a senzu bean?
K- Karin-<i>sama</i> still has them, huh?

95
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,668
Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

96
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,637
T- then, you eat it.

97
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:59,277
That's all right.
I ate one before I came.

98
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:02,113
N- no, you save it in case you need it.

99
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:07,285
Even if we recover,
we won't be much help to you.

100
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:09,854
Don't worry needlessly.

101
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,623
If you don't eat it,
I'm throwing it away.

102
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:13,885
Here.

103
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,961
Thanks.

104
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,929
Gohan, you too.

105
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:31,642
Kuririn, you've gotten a lot
stronger, huh? I can tell by your <i>Ki</i>.

106
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:34,245
I thought I had, but to no avail.

107
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:37,315
I'm no use against them.
They're too strong.

108
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:41,652
I- I just stood by
and let everyone else die...

109
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:46,657
Gohan, I hardly recognized you,
too. You sure trained hard.

110
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:52,997
Mm-hmm. Piccolo-<i>san</i> trained me,
but I wasn't able to do anything.

111
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:57,601
With Piccolo-<i>san</i> dead, we'll never
be able to use the Dragon Balls again.

112
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,092
No one is coming back to life.

113
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,617
Let's avenge them- the three of us!

114
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:18,289
With you joining us, Goku, we might
be able to deal with one of them!

115
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:22,626
Hey, Goku, you trained under some
incredible guy named Kaio, right?

116
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:23,961
Yeah.

117
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:27,064
But I'm going to fight them by myself.

118
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:31,635
You guys stay back and watch, so you
don't get caught in the middle of it.

119
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:33,637
B- by yourself!?

120
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:36,907
No matter how strong you are,
Goku, that's crazy!

121
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:40,978
Their strength is far greater
than we can even imagine!

122
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,970
H- he's right, Father!

123
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,934
G- Goku...

124
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,603
Father!

125
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,938
Let Goku handle this!

126
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,530
B- but...

127
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:15,279
I've never seen Goku
show that much anger.

128
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,181
W- we've got no place
getting in his way.

129
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:47,342
Remember, you're going to be
paying me a viewing fee for this.

130
00:14:58,589 --> 00:14:59,590
Goku!

131
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,592
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

132
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,253
Where's Gohan!?

133
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:05,930
Gohan!

134
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,602
G- Gohan is alive!
T- thank goodness...

135
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,940
Chichi! Goku and Gohan
are fightin'! Keep it together!

136
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,707
Son-<i>kun</i>, hang in there!
Beat those Saiyans!

137
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,949
P- Piccolo!

138
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,052
Even Piccolo has been done in!

139
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:33,290
Which means we can no longer
use the Dragon Balls!

140
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,556
T- then, nobody is
coming back to life?

141
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:57,248
What's with that look
on your face? I don't like it.

142
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,917
Is this how badly you want me
to effortlessly kill you?

143
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,546
You're going to pay for this!

144
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,610
Father, you're incredible!

145
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,708
Battle power 7000...
8000... impossible!

146
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,970
What is Kakarrot's battle power!?

147
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,906
Higher than 8000!

148
00:16:55,906 --> 00:17:00,578
Higher than 8000!? There has to be
some mistake! It's a malfunction!

149
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:04,915
Don't worry, I still won't be using
the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique on you.

150
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>Kaio-ken</i>?

151
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,919
Shut up!

152
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,083
There's no way you can
stand up to Nappa-<i>sama</i>!

153
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,423
<i>What?</i>

154
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:29,266
H- how did he do that just now?

155
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,841
W- when did you get behind me?

156
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,284
Why, you!

157
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:43,621
For as big as you were talking,
you ain't all that great.

158
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:46,624
W- what did you say!?

159
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:49,960
I- I'm not all that great, am I!?

160
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,396
That's right. I could tell
from your attack just now.

161
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,903
Why don't you tell me...

162
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:03,464
...exactly what it is
that you can tell!?

163
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:23,083
Strange... His battle power is completely
different from when he fought Raditz.

164
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,598
Over here!

165
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:41,240
D- did you see your father's moves?

166
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,847
But he's amazing.

167
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,723
<i>What's going on?</i>

168
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:57,285
<i>How did Kakarrot get this much power</i>
<i>in such a short amount of time?</i>

169
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:10,732
Why, you!

170
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,990
That punch just now
