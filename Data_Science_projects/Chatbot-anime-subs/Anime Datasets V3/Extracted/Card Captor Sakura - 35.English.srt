1
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:42,877
A Clow Card…

2
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,765
I know…

3
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,933
I know…

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,946
…that person…

5
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:18,312
[Sakura’s Wonderful Xmas]

6
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:22,812
That person was…

7
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,385
Who?

8
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,221
Miss Mizuki!

9
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:36,625
I’m sorry!

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,527
If you sleep in the classroom,
you’ll catch a cold.

11
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,907
All right, let’s stop there for today.

12
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,014
Was that Miss Mizuki?

13
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,197
Are you feeling sick?

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,128
No, I’m fine.

15
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,569
Since the Quiz Competition,

16
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:16,371
you’ve been a little distant.

17
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:18,237
I’m really OK.

18
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:20,503
I just keep having this weird dream.

19
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,767
A dream?

20
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,511
A dream with a full moon,
a long-haired person,

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,676
and Clow Cards.

22
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,146
Other than that,
I really feel fine!

23
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,343
Please don’t push yourself, OK?

24
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:36,691
What’s the matter?

25
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,227
Hey, look at this!
Look at that!

26
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,701
That’s right,
it’ll be Christmas soon.

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,070
Have you decided what
you’re going to give everyone?

28
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:57,039
No, not yet.
How about you, Tomoyo?

29
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,541
I’ve already
decided on your present!

30
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:04,214
Thank you!

31
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,587
What should I do?

32
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,424
Christmas Day is also
Yukito’s birthday.

33
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:23,897
Alright, next!

34
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,439
What do I do for Christmas presents?

35
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,676
For Yamazaki?

36
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,883
I was thinking of giving him
something handmade, but…

37
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,552
…Yamazaki does that himself.

38
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes.

39
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,427
He’s better than me at sewing,
cooking and just about everything.

40
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,130
Hi!

41
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,705
If it’s your present,

42
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,013
I’m sure he’ll be happy.

43
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,040
I’m still not very confident,
though…

44
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,149
Yamazaki.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,952
Right.

46
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,617
Christmas present,

47
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:20,820
huh?

48
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:23,265
Oh, nothing…

49
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,836
What do I do?

50
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,334
About presents?

51
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,812
I’ve got Dad and
my brother figured out.

52
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,373
And I’ve decided on yours, too.

53
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,273
Umm…

54
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:42,913
But…

55
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,352
It’s Tsukishiro’s, right?

56
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:47,288
Yeah…

57
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,926
That’s great! Just like Shao Lan!

58
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,266
How about asking advice
from someone new?

59
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:02,926
Eh?

60
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,250
W… what do you want?

61
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,223
Mei Lin, you know…

62
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,528
You’re going to kidnap me,
and hold me for ransom!

63
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:30,228
You’re going to take
Shao Lan’s Clow Cards!

64
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:36,932
No!

65
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:41,005
It’s just… I wanted to ask your
advice about something…

66
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:44,012
Advice?

67
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:54,620
Christmas present?

68
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,416
You give one to Li every year…

69
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,328
I was wondering if you had any ideas…

70
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,063
Whether it’s handmade or bought,

71
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,335
there are all kinds, but…

72
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:09,795
All kinds, but?

73
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,633
Anything would be fine, wouldn’t it?

74
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,234
But!

75
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:18,503
It doesn’t matter so much
what the present is,

76
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,838
but the feelings that go with it, right?

77
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,312
Whether it’s something
you worked hard at making…

78
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,214
…or something you chose,
either way is fine, right?

79
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:28,653
Mei Lin!

80
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,989
And if he hates you,

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,827
anything’ll suck!

82
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:36,427
Does he hate you?

83
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,700
I don’t think so…

84
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:41,967
Then you’ll be OK!

85
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:44,135
Thanks!

86
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,072
Later!

87
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,639
Talking with her turned out well,
didn’t it.

88
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:53,671
Yep!

89
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,280
It really did work out.

90
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,094
Sakura…

91
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:50,930
…the bath is free!

92
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:52,096
OK!

93
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:05,675
Sakura, your bath…

94
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:06,977
Hang on a minute…

95
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,423
You just dialed it a minute ago.

96
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,291
You should just get it over with.

97
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:15,292
Here, just hit Redial!

98
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,467
Kero, you little…!

99
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:26,939
Just tryin’ to help…

100
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:30,302
Yes, this is Tsukishiro…

101
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,575
Um… um… I…

102
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:36,409
Sakura?

103
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:39,419
Yes!

104
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:44,990
Um, about Sunday,
the day after tomorrow…

105
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,894
Right. These amusement
park tickets from Chiharu…

106
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,958
That girl in my class.

107
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,195
We met her at the Quiz Competition…

108
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,134
Yes, I got them!

109
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,503
Um… Yukito, how’s your injury?

110
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,101
She got all hot and

111
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,205
bothered over a simple phone call
to a guy?

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,114
I really don’t get this “love” thing…

113
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,412
Is that all right?

114
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,150
Yes… yes… OK, this Sunday…

115
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:15,955
I did it!

116
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,485
I’m meeting Yukito at the
amusement park this Sunday!

117
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,889
I feel sad…

118
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,080
So, what should we ride?

119
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,899
Sakura looks so happy.

120
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:06,171
The clothes
I gave her look nice, too.

121
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,370
I’m a little worried
about Sakura, though.

122
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,506
You look more like
you’re spying on her.

123
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,575
But really, we can’t miss

124
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:18,485
Sakura’s Christmas date.

125
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,219
I have a duty to follow her, right?

126
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:44,907
That was fun.

127
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:45,970
It was!

128
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:46,746
What’s next?

129
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:50,349
Um… um…

130
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:51,914
Would you quit hanging off me?

131
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,549
Stop being so cold!

132
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,451
Hi!

133
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,061
Li. Mei Lin.

134
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:11,263
You guys came, too?

135
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,269
Back in Hong Kong,

136
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:16,473
we would go to the amusement park
every Christmas.

137
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:17,708
The two of you?

138
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,510
Well, with all
of Shao Lan’s sisters.

139
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:23,309
Eh?

140
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:27,583
Is that him?

141
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:29,515
The one you’re giving the present to.

142
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,181
Yeah…

143
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,564
So did you decide?

144
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,002
Yeah, all because I got your advice.

145
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,252
I’m kinda hungry.

146
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,991
I’m hungry, too.

147
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:07,885
Me, too.

148
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,558
So, shall we get something
to eat over there?

149
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,829
Sure.

150
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:12,532
Yes.

151
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,973
What do you want?

152
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:20,773
Eh?

153
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,275
Brother…

154
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,141
You can really find
a part-time job everywhere.

155
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,277
Of course.

156
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:39,625
Great!

157
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,331
The more you eat,

158
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,164
the healthier it represents.

159
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:48,734
Yes.

160
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,095
That’s true.

161
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,412
This brat.

162
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,912
Li and Sakura…

163
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,652
I want to eat too.

164
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,053
Right, we should have our meal.

165
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,190
This aura…

166
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,868
Pretty, isn’t it?

167
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:25,464
What kind of special effect is that?

168
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:27,702
It’s not a special effect.

169
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:29,642
That’s just a normal power line.

170
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,648
These aren’t ordinary flames…

171
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:38,282
A Clow Card?

172
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:40,549
Wait! It’s dangerous!

173
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:47,383
Time!

174
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,024
A card!

175
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,729
If you use Sleep,
you can put everyone out!

176
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:56,927
Hurry!

177
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,439
Key which hides the power of dark.

178
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,074
…reveal thy true form to me.

179
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,185
By the covenant, I,
Sakura, command thee.

180
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,215
Release!

181
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,334
Sleep!

182
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:02,628
Li!

183
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,405
Time takes up a
lot of my magic energy.

184
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,238
I just need to rest a bit.

185
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,437
But…

186
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,902
You’ve got to do
something about that fire.

187
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,783
Wind, be the chain that binds the flames!

188
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:25,025
Windy!

189
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:42,499
Sakura, Windy can’t
stand up to this one!

190
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,569
Kero, why’re you here?

191
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,480
Don’t worry about that now!

192
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:48,877
Windy is one of the

193
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,649
prime Elemental Cards Clow made.

194
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,553
But Windy isn’t aggressive
enough to win!

195
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,119
What Elemental Cards
do you have?

196
00:15:57,993 --> 00:15:59,255
Windy and Watery…

197
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,363
So this has to be a fire card.

198
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:04,260
The Fiery Card!

199
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,734
Now you show your true form!

200
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:12,830
Fiery is an attack card.

201
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,036
That’s why you can’t
hit it with Windy.

202
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,842
The enemy of fire is…

203
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:19,980
Water!

204
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,143
You can’t hit it with just Watery!

205
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:25,416
Watery doesn’t have
as much power as Fiery…

206
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,311
So if they fight, you can’t win!

207
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,058
So what do I do?

208
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,759
Windy and Watery.
Use both cards at once!

209
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:37,564
Eh?

210
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,501
Using two Elemental Cards
together is impossible!

211
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,161
But if it keeps going like this,

212
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,370
Fiery is gonna burn down the whole park!

213
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:47,005
This is our best chance!

214
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,414
No! I won’t let you!

215
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,413
Everyone… the whole park…

216
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:05,254
And I’m going to capture all the cards!

217
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:10,856
Please, do your best
with me one more time!

218
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,875
Wind and water, work together
to contain the flames!

219
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:24,410
Windy!
Watery!

220
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,953
Two Elemental Cards working together…

221
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:46,761
Now!

222
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:55,635
Return to thy true form…
Clow Card!

223
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,654
You did it!

224
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,658
Fiery…

225
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,522
Good job, Sakura!

226
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,892
Kero?

227
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,761
Don’t worry ‘bout it.
Didn’t I tell you?

228
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:23,066
My symbol is the Sun.

229
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:28,900
To get the power to return to my true
form… you need to have the Fiery card

230
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:30,842
Can you return to your true form?

231
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:31,712
Not yet!

232
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:35,544
However…

233
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,149
A bit of my power is coming back.

234
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,888
As you capture the cards,
I grow stronger.

235
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:46,990
Right!
I’ll try hard from now on!

236
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:50,323
See that, loser? Sakura got another Card.

237
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,461
And it’s an Elemental Card,
to boot.

238
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:55,503
Even if your power is coming back,
you’re still a stuffed animal.

239
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,165
What was that, brat?
Wanna say that again?

240
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,372
As many times as you want!

241
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:01,173
Would the two of you cut it out?

242
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,568
Stuffed animal, stuffed animal,
stuffed animal…

243
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:26,825
It’s the best place,
but the hardest place to film.

244
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,830
Someone will see you!

245
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:33,206
Don’t worry, we’re pretty high up.

246
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:38,870
You guys caught a card while
I was sleeping?

247
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:40,880
That’s not fair.

248
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:53,092
I guess I got tired somewhere
along the way… Sorry.

249
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,026
But I’m glad the fire went out.

250
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:55,996
Yeah…

251
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:01,730
Um… Here…

252
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:06,433
For Christmas, and for your birthday…

253
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:09,432
For me?

254
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,113
Thanks. Can I open it?

255
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,052
It’s handmade, isn’t it?

256
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:22,646
Yes!

257
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:24,720
Thank you.

258
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:33,991
That’s not snow, is it? It’s glowing.

259
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,968
It’s Christmas, right?

260
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:42,534
My power’s coming back,
so here’s a special treat for ya!

261
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:05,388
Sakura?

262
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:11,591
I’d like to come back again next year.

263
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:17,699
OK.
