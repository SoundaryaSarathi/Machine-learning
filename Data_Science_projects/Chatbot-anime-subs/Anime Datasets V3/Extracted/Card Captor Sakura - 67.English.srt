1
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:39,715
It’s ok now.

2
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,446
I’m back to my old self.

3
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,355
I know.

4
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,800
I understand.

5
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:14,080
It’s because of Shao Lan-kun
that I cheered up.

6
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:20,752
[Sakura, Shao Lan
and the Tsukimine Shrine]

7
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:23,016
Good morning!

8
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:25,627
Good morning.

9
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:27,195
You’re up early today.

10
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,497
I just woke up.

11
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:32,632
Would you like me to get the newspaper?

12
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:35,029
Thanks.

13
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,109
I’m glad you’ve cheered up again.

14
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,471
You seemed a little sad recently.

15
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,378
Did I seem strange?

16
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,513
No… but I could tell.

17
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:50,412
I’m your father after all.

18
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:54,622
I’m really ok now.

19
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:57,387
Ok, let’s have breakfast then.

20
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:00,723
It’s pancakes today!

21
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,696
OK! Has brother woken up yet?

22
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,271
He has the day off today

23
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,804
and he’s been really tired lately…

24
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:14,569
so he won’t mind sleeping in.

25
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:15,603
I see.

26
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:20,215
Ever since he gave
all of his magic to Yukito,

27
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:24,012
brother has been very tired all the time.

28
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:27,015
Will orange juice be ok?

29
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:28,889
Yes!

30
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,367
It’s still a little cold

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,104
but going to school early
in the morning feels nice.

32
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,674
Yukito-san isn’t here…

33
00:02:56,954 --> 00:03:00,321
This must be the first time
I haven’t seen him…

34
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,359
It would be very nice to see him…

35
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,864
but not as heart-pounding as before…

36
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,169
just nice.

37
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:17,100
I’ll have to thank Shao Lan-kun
for helping me.

38
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,766
I wonder what I could for for him?

39
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,241
There’s going to be a festival?

40
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,677
I should ask him to go with me

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,382
But he gets cold quickly…

42
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,351
That’s it!

43
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:45,799
Shao Lan-kun!

44
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,172
Good morning…

45
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:52,336
Want to go to the festival?

46
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:54,707
A festival!

47
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:58,545
There’ll be one this Sunday.
At Tsukimine Shrine.

48
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:59,813
Would you like to go together?

49
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,415
Oh, or are you busy?

50
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,250
I… I’m not doing anything.

51
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,549
Really?

52
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:13,954
Yay! So, 6 o’clock Sunday then! Promise?

53
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:20,063
I’ll go get some water ok?

54
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:28,277
I’m glad.
Her usual smile is back.

55
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,144
Because of you, it seems.

56
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,108
I… I didn’t do anything…

57
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,314
Ah! Eriol-kun, good morning!

58
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,887
Good morning, Sakura-san!

59
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,553
You’re here early.

60
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,447
I had something to take care of.

61
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:45,154
You seem very cheerful today, Sakura.

62
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:47,496
That’s not true.

63
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,229
I’m the same as always!

64
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:58,439
That cat always sits on the window sill.

65
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,403
I’ve never seen her move from that spot.

66
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,505
I’d imagine that she is still here today…

67
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,849
This is what I thought when I pass there…

68
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:09,343
and it’s really sleeping there.

69
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,813
Wednesday, 23rd.

70
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,561
Thursay, 24th.

71
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,663
Friday, 25th.

72
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:36,402
Saturday, 26 th.

73
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,512
That’s it for today.

74
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:49,525
Sakura-chan, homeroom is over.

75
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,330
What’s going on?

76
00:05:57,134 --> 00:06:00,126
You haven’t been this bad since you
started changing the cards.

77
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,495
It’s nothing really.

78
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,469
Is it something you can’t tell me?

79
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,235
Shao Lan-kun…

80
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,816
Sakura-chan, today you promised we’d
go shopping right?

81
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,386
Let’s go. Bye!

82
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,289
Everything’s ok.

83
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:30,533
I’ll see you tomorrow in front of
the Shrine at 6, ok?

84
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,376
You saved me Tomoyo-chan.

85
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:43,279
No problem.

86
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,408
Is it almost finished?

87
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,377
I should be able to finish it today.

88
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,682
What Yukito-san said was true.

89
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,546
But, I was really

90
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,860
sad afterwards.

91
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:01,959
Shao Lan-kun helped me feel better

92
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,961
so I wanted to do something for him

93
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,128
I’ll do my best.

94
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:08,866
I’m sure it will be fine then.

95
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,167
Tomoyo-chan, thanks.

96
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,367
You’ve helped me a lot as well.

97
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:16,504
I really appreciate it.

98
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,941
If anything bad ever happens,
you come to me.

99
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,318
If there’s anything I can do,
I’ll help you.

100
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:29,585
As long as you’re smiling,
I have nothing to worry about.

101
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:34,997
I’m happy as long as you are.

102
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:45,771
Finally!

103
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,204
Finally finished huh?

104
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,654
Looks like I’ll make it.

105
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:03,490
Thanks for your help, Kero-chan.
Coming!

106
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,363
Someone… help me!

107
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,035
Shao Lan-kun?

108
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,204
Weren’t we going to meet
at the Shrine?

109
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,246
That’s true…

110
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,544
but… yesterday… you…

111
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,646
You were worried about me…

112
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:34,618
Thank you.

113
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,226
Wait a minute ok?
I’m almost ready.

114
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,962
Hey Kero-chan! Do you want to come too?

115
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:53,374
I’m too sleepy.

116
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,470
Okay, I’ll bring you back
a souvenir then.

117
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:02,311
Octopus-yaki, noodle-yaki,
and rice crackers with sauce.

118
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:03,846
OK!

119
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:09,788
I’m so glad you’ve cheered up, Sakura.

120
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:37,016
Uhm… are you ok now? You were so tired.

121
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:40,614
Yeah I’m ok. I finished it.

122
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:42,851
Finished?

123
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,059
Here.

124
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:52,200
It was my first try
so it isn’t very good…

125
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,298
For me?

126
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:03,444
You made it yourself?

127
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,218
Yeah. I guess you don’t want it…

128
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:12,518
Wait!

129
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:24,060
She was sleepy because
she was up late making this…

130
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:28,835
Th… thank you.

131
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,270
I’m the one who should thank you.

132
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,574
You were the one

133
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:38,606
who helped me feel better that time.

134
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:42,847
Let’s go?

135
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,649
Ok! We’re meeting
Tomoyo-chan at the shrine.

136
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,089
Brother and Yukito-san
will join us later.

137
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:53,856
It’s ok already.

138
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,462
He really seems like a part
of my family now.

139
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,137
Touya are you ok?

140
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,028
It’s just the usual. Don’t worry.

141
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:08,238
However, I’m glad Sakura invited me.

142
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,440
I know she didn’t feel
for me exactly the same

143
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,044
was as for her father,
but because of the way she felt,

144
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:23,821
she couldn’t find the person
she was meant to love.

145
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:26,927
I know it hurts her…

146
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,463
but it was for the best.

147
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,460
She was smiling…

148
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,797
but I’m sure she wasn’t
really happy to see me.

149
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:45,645
I’m sure she’s forgiven you.

150
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,450
She’s cheerful again.

151
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:50,749
That’s why she has invited you.

152
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:02,829
Tomoyo-chan!

153
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:04,966
Sakura-chan!

154
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:09,604
I’m so glad I get to take videos again

155
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:12,473
That scarf looks very nice on you!

156
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:15,675
I don’t see her.

157
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:17,137
Maybe she isn’t here yet.

158
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:21,207
It’s Brother and Yukito-san! Over here!

159
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:31,926
Good evening, Yukito-san.

160
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,222
Good evening, Sakura-chan.

161
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:36,921
Let’s go Yukito-san!

162
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:51,041
It’s very good that
she’s gotten over it so soon.

163
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,206
Yeah…

164
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:59,153
You still haven’t told her have you?
About how you feel.

165
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,782
If I told her, it would just confuse her.

166
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,992
She loved him for so long,

167
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:09,124
but he loved someone else…

168
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:14,069
She wouldn’t know how to react either.

169
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:18,866
She knows

170
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:19,870
what it’s like to be turned down.

171
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,372
If I told her how I felt,

172
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:26,813
she’d be too afraid of hurting me
to really think it over.

173
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:30,075
So… I won’t tell her yet

174
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:31,851
Li-kun.

175
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,521
Tomoyo-chan! Shao Lan-kun!

176
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:37,623
Coming!

177
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,976
Why did I have to
buy one for that brat too?

178
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,640
Why does he bother you so much?

179
00:13:58,782 --> 00:13:59,908
I can’t afford to ignore him.

180
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:01,442
Why?

181
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:06,416
He’s too involved with
something important to me.

182
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:08,922
Oh brother!

183
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,755
What do you want?!

184
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:13,253
Don’t surprise me like that!

185
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,894
I’m thirsty, could you get some juice?

186
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,527
For Yukito-san and Tomoyo-chan
and Shao Lan-kun and me!

187
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:22,328
You want me to pay again?

188
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,134
We’ve walked pretty far,

189
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,272
so we’ll wait over there.

190
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,108
– So why do I… 
– Thank you!

191
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,376
Hey wait a minute…

192
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,978
He’ll need help, so I’ll go with him.

193
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,243
Should I help you too?

194
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,711
We’ll be ok. Wait by the lake.

195
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:40,789
OK.

196
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,424
Hmph. Why did I have to buy
one for that brat too?

197
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:51,492
What is it?

198
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,366
You didn’t sense her coming just then.

199
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,799
You used to be able to tell
if anyone was nearby…

200
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,980
until you gave me all your strength.

201
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,283
And you’ve been so tired…

202
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:09,844
Yuki,

203
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,877
while eating lunch,

204
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:16,390
when you had finished yours
and were still hungry,

205
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:17,985
what did I do?

206
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:19,788
You have me all of yours.

207
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,388
It’s the same thing.

208
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:26,093
– Don’t worry about it anymore ok?
– Right.

209
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,040
This is the moon pool.

210
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,905
There aren’t any fish are there?

211
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,937
There’s a lake with fish that way.

212
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,439
They use this lake

213
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:44,275
to tell fortunes with the moon

214
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,383
so there aren’t
any living things in here.

215
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,057
You know a lot!

216
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:49,986
Mizuki-sensei told me!

217
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:51,888
Do you know how to tell fortunes well?

218
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:54,994
Yeah, she told me that too.

219
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,029
First, walk to the edge of the dock.

220
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,236
Clasp your hands.

221
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,735
Then look at the moon
reflected in the water.

222
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:16,247
Huh?

223
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:20,287
I’ve been quiet recently.

224
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:26,594
Clow-san’s aura.

225
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:36,695
Watch out!

226
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:40,001
Sakura-chan!

227
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,670
Oh key that hides
the power of the stars.

228
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,308
Reveal thy true form to me.

229
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,980
By our contract,
Sakura commands you.

230
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,015
Release!

231
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:02,959
Wood!

232
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:22,843
What happened?

233
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:24,277
A blackout

234
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,719
Aren’t the power lines
for the Shrine near the lake?

235
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,190
That’s where Sakura and her friends are!

236
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:36,427
Let me try to beat it.

237
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,597
God of lightnig, come forth!

238
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,801
It didn’t work.

239
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,472
But it did affect it.

240
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,140
It isn’t strong enough.

241
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:53,907
But… somehow…

242
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:56,611
that’s it!

243
00:17:57,187 --> 00:17:59,985
Since you’re here to help,
I’m sure we can do it.

244
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:01,080
Alright!

245
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,289
Let’s do it!

246
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,130
God of wind, come forth!

247
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:21,301
Now!

248
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:31,386
Card created by Clow.

249
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:34,713
Listen to my words and be reborn!

250
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,750
I, Sakura command you.

251
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,251
Thunder!

252
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,440
I’m relieved.

253
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:56,443
I couldn’t have done
it without your help,

254
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:57,572
thank you.

255
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:02,443
Tomoyo-chan? Tomoyo-chan!

256
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,783
Yes! I’m alright!

257
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:05,980
Sakura!

258
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:12,227
Sakura.

259
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:13,162
Are you ok?

260
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,656
We’re ok.

261
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,268
The lights are all gone.

262
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:25,332
I guess the festival
is over for tonight.

263
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:27,602
But it just started… Oh!

264
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:29,777
Wait just a minute ok?

265
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:32,839
Hey Sakura!

266
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,691
Card created by Clow.

267
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,894
Listen to my words and be reborn!

268
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:55,364
I, Sakura command you.

269
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:58,805
Glow!

270
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,284
What’s this?

271
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:20,096
Pretty!

272
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,225
They’re not fireflies are they?

273
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:29,931
It’s beautiful isn’t it?

274
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:32,401
Sakura probably.

275
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:34,103
Sakura isn’t it?

276
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:36,673
The Glow card.

277
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:46,618
Li-kun?

278
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,149
You’re a really kind person.

279
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:54,959
I know you’ve never hurt Sakura.

280
00:20:55,532 --> 00:21:01,368
And nothing would keep her
upset for very long either.

281
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:06,800
If you tell her how you feel,
I’m sure she’ll feel the same way

282
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:10,442
and tell you so in her own way.
