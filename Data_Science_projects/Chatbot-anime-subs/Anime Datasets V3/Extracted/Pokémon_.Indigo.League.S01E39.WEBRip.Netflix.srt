This place gives me the creeps.

00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,005
It's the middle of the day
and there's nobody around.

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,715
-What's the deal?
-[Ash] Yeah.

00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,009
[laughing]

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,221
Get back inside this house right now.
What if there are Pokémon trainers out?

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,723
Huh?

22
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,434
Why would she be afraid
of Pokémon trainers?

23
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,936
-Pika!
-Hey, you!

24
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,772

00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,491
They're little kids.

30
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,169
I'm sorry, but you guys
were throwing those rocks at us.

00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,128
Chu!

32
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,839
-You guys are Pokémon trainers right?
-Huh?

33
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,008
Yeah, my name's Ash.

34
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,094
I want to become
the world's greatest Pokémon master.

35
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,390
I'm Brock, and I want to become
the world's best Pokémon breeder.

36
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,018
And I'm going to be
the world's best everything.

37
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,061
My name's Misty.

Hey kid, cut it out, will you?

41
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,526
We don't care who you are.

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,863
If you work with Pokémon,
you better get out of our town now.

43
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,198
[both] Mm-hm.

44
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,617
Why? What's wrong with Pokémon?

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,243
[man] Stop it, boys!

46
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,787
I apologize.

47
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,706
These children don't mean to cause you
any trouble.

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,418
Come to my restaurant,
and I'll explain everything.

49
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,380
Well, okay.

50
00:02:54,383 --> 00:03:00,013
In Dark City, there are two Pokémon gyms:
The Yas Gym and the Kaz Gym.

51
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,474
The two gyms are in the middle
of a gang war,

52
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,435
and they'll hire
any wandering Pokémon trainers

53
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,397
as soldiers to battle for them.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,648
-I get it.
-Chu.

55
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,401
So that's why there's nobody
out on the streets here.

56
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,153
Hey, Pikachu, pour some ketchup for me,
will you?

57
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,321
Wh... Whoa! Whoa!

58
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,782
-Pika. Pi, pika.
-But I don't see.

59
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,118
What's the point
of fighting each other like this?

60
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,077
-Pika!
-Huh?

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,915
They claim that whatever gym wins
will become an official Pokémon gym.

62
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,333
-[Ash groans]
-[gasps]

63
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,043
-That makes sense.
-Chu.

64
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,296
Becoming an official Pokémon gym's
a big honor.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,923
[distant crashing]

66
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,133

00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,092
[all] Huh?

68
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,137
-What is that?
-The Yas and Kaz Gyms are fighting again.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,013
If you don't want
to get dragged into this,

70
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,099
you'd better go upstairs and hide.

71
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,810
Get ready!
Today, the Kaz Gym Is going to crush you!

72
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,479
Guess again!
The Yas Gym will wipe you out!

73
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,482
Go, Electabuzz! Thunderbolt, now!

We can't let them win. Attack, Scyther.

77
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,117
Scyther!

78
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,956
Scyther!

79
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,292
-[all] Ah!
-[man] Let's get out of here!

80
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,918
Is it always like this?

81
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,295
[all] Yeah.

82
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,673
Now I can understand
why everybody around here

83
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,091
hates Pokémon trainers.

84
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,511
That's not even a Pokémon battle.
It's more like a street fight.

85
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,764
Hmm, those bullies.

86
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,932
They don't even understand
what it really means

87
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,184
to be a Pokémon trainer.

88
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,351
[man whimpering]

89
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,855
Hey, cook.

90
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,524
Give me the lunch special for 30 people.

91
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,735
[Jessie] We've got to be at Kaz Gym
in less than an hour.

92
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,821
[James] Throw in an order of onion rings
while you're at it.

93
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,365
I'd like to, but you see,

94
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,786
the Kaz Gym hasn't paid its bill
in over in two years.

95
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,246
There's something familiar about them.

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,416
[Jessie] What? Are you telling us
we can't put this on our tab?

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,961
[James] Do you realize
we're Kaz Gym bodyguards?

98
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,797
Give us the food or else...

99
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,175
I'd like to but I can't.
I don't want any trouble.

100
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,178
You won't give us lunch,
but you don't want trouble, huh?

101
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,931
You're talking to the wrong customers
if you don't want any trouble.

102
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,643
Please leave me alone.
I don't want any trouble.

103
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,685
Trouble?

104
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,645
Trouble.

105
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,564
-[James] I can't resist, Jessie.
-[Jessie] Neither can I.

106
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,359
-Prepare for trouble.
-Make it double.

107
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,319
To protect the world from devastation...

108
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,822
To unite all peoples within our nation...

109
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,781

110
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,282
[Jessie]
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

111
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,785
[James]
To extend our reach to the stars above.

112
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,037
-[Jessie] Jessie...
-[James]James...

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,331
Go get them, Arbok!

114
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,541
Weezing, attack!

115
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,753
-Arbok!
-Weezing!

-Meowth!
-Ah!

117
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,093
It's Team Rocket. I knew it.

118
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,469
Stop them, Pikachu!

119
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,470
Pika!

120
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,055
Starmie attack!

121
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,306
Go, Vulpix!

122
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,474
[both] Vulpix?

123
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,269
[howling]

124
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,233
-Rare.
-Medium.

125
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,568
Well-done.

126
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,695
-Meowth!
-[both] Ah!

127
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,742
-Nice to see you leave!
-Don't come back any time!

129
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,704
Are you all right?

130
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,123
Thank you for saving my restaurant.

131
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,875
Aw, it was fun to beat Team Rocket.

132
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,335
You didn't do anything.

133
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,337
It was Brock's Vulpix that did the work.

134
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,132
[Ash]
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right about that.

135
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,635
That was great.
I saw everything that happened.

136
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,595
[all] Huh?

137
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,598
Excuse me, is there some way
we can help you, miss?

138
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,684
Those were some
of the strongest bodyguards from Kaz Gym.

139
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,061
How did you overpower them so easily?

140
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:39,149
You must be a very gifted,
very famous Pokémon trainer.

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,317
[moans]

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,944
Please, please.
You must tell me your names.

143
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,030
Gee, that's very nice.

144
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,157
If we get mixed up in this gang war,

145
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,701
it could ruin our reputations
as Pokémon trainers.

146
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,162
-Just make up a name, quick.
-Uh...

147
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,124
-I'm, uh, ketchup.
-Pikachu.

148
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,751
-Ketchup?
-Uh, no.

149
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,128
My name is really Tom Ayto.

150
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,129
[Misty groans]

151
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,009
Well, my name...
My name is Ann Chovie.

152
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,471
-Huh, huh, huh?
-Uh...

153
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh, and my name Is Caesar Salad.

154
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,601
Oh, Tom, Ann, Caesar,

155
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,687
Would you consider joining our cause
at the Yas Gym?

156
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,482
Unlike those animals from the Kaz Gym,

157
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,818
we at Yas are truly worthy
of becoming a Pokémon gym.

158
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,781
Uh, well, you better ask Ann Chovie.

159
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,910
Well, we can't do it.
Isn't that right, Caesar Salad?

160
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,162
We'll do anything we can to help.

161
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,330
[groaning]

162
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,289
Pika!

163
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,543
Brock just can't say no to a pretty girl.

164
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,346
[grunting]

165
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,682
-Wow.
-Please, come right in.

166
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,731
Yas leader.
Let me introduce you to a great trainer.

167
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,567
This is Pokémon trainer Tom Ayto.

168
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,778
He's brought his two disciples to help us.

169
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,904
He brought us?

170
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,863
[chuckles]

171
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,157
Pikachu.

172
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,744
I saw them defeat the bodyguards
from Kaz Gym like they were nothing.

173
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,621
They're really strong trainers.

174
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,416
I'll decide just how strong they are.

175
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,917
Scyther, go!

176
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,587
Scyther!

177
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,672
Pika!

178
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,135
Scy!

179
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,846
Scyther!

180
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,432
Scyther!

181
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,434
Scyther, what is it?

182
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,393
-Whoa!
-Scyther!

183
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,395
Whoa, hey!

184
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,939
-Scyther!
-Stop!

185
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,274
Scyther, return.

186
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,693
Scyther!

187
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,323
That's the first time my scyther
has been frightened so badly.

188
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,950
You are a powerful trainer.

189
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,119
-Well--
-You must work for me.

190
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
-I need your strength.
-Pi.

191
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,373
-First, I have one thing to ask you:
-Pi.

192
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,042
Why is it so important
that this should become

193
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,626
an official Pokémon gym?

194
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,628
That answer should be obvious.

195
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,923
What faster way is there
to make money in today's world

196
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,093
than by becoming
an official Pokémon gym?

197
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,012
Well, if that's your reason,

198
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,431
-I won't become your bodyguard.
-What?

199
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:21,227
Pokémon are not just tools for fighting
or a way of making money.

200
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,149
And I know because I plan on becoming
a Pokémon master.

201
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,403
I won't help you.

202
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,864
[thinking]
<i>That was dramatic.</i>

203
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,616
Whoa!

204
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,910
That was pathetic!

205
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,953
If you won't join us,

206
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,164
we'll make sure
you don't help anybody else.

207
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,665
Yas Gym, attack!

208
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,670
[grunting]

209
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,422
Ah!

210
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,059
-Wow, that was a close one.
-That Yas Gym plays rough.

211
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,770
I think the Kaz Gym plays
just the same way.

212
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,482
They think Pokémon battling's
like plain old fighting.

213
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,860
Imagine if they became
an official Pokémon gym.

214
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,446
Kaz and Yas keep getting stronger Pokémon

215
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,240
and they wreck our town
with their fighting.

216
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,744
If this keeps up, people will think
all Pokémon trainers are dangerous.

217
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,206
-Yeah, that Scyther is really scary.
-Pikachu.

218
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,459
I wonder how we get out so easily.

219
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,669
I don't know.

220
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,880
Scyther!

221
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,175
Scy!

222
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,136
Oh, ketchup.

223
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,141
[Pokédex] <i>Scyther and Electabuzz</i>
<i>are both rare Pokémon.</i>

224
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,603
<i>They are able to distinguish colors</i>
<i>and become enraged by the color red.</i>

225
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,480
Like the ketchup.

226
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,358
Scyther is the Yas Gym's
strongest Pokémon,

227
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,570
and Electabuzz is the Kaz Gym's
strongest Pokémon.

228
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,779
Huh?

229
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,033
If we work together,
we might just be able to beat them.

230
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,035
Listen up!

231
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,039
The Pokémon league inspector
will be coming through town any minute.

232
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:09,752
We have to run those Kaz Gym losers
out of town before he gets here.

233
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,715
[leader]
Pokémon league inspector is on his way.

234
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,843
We have to completely crush
those Yas Gym trainers

235
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,970
and show him we're the best.

236
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,431
This town's only big enough for one gym.

237
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,144
Ka. Pika. Ka.

238
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:31,608
[grunting]

239
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:41,784
All right, weather looks fine
and everything is all set and ready to go.

240
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,882
I'm only going to say this once
to youse guys.

241
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,760
Kaz Gym's going to be
the official gym of Dark City.

242
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,846
Save yourself some trouble
and just clear out now.

243
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,766
I'm afraid you have things all mixed up.

244
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,019
You're the ones
who'd better clear out and fast.

245
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,356
Leave now or we'll crush you
like the slimy insects you are.

246
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,817
Ooh! Now you're going to be sorry
you ever heard the name of Kaz Gym!

247
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,780
Today's the day
we finally destroy you once and for all!

248
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,740
[grunting]

249
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,284
I've heard enough!

250
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,954
Electabuzz, go!

251
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,665
Get them, Scyther.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,919
[warbling]

253
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,838
Scyther, scy!

254
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,799
[all grunting]

255
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,842
Monchan!

256
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,386
Hitmonlee!

257
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,097
[grunting]

258
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,058
Electabuzz,
send them flying with a thunder punch!

259
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,812
[warbling]

260
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,731
[grunting]

261
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,735
Don't give in, Scyther!
Power up with sword dance, and cut attack!

262
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:03,574
Scyther! [growling]

263
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,494
Scyther!

264
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,497
[moaning]

265
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,126
-When do we get our turn?
-It's over already.

266
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,460
Meowth!

267
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,387
Go, Electabuzz!
Just burn that Scyther to a crisp.

268
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,349
Don't give in, Scyther.
Slice that Electabuzz to ribbons.

269
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:34,147
[grunting]

270
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,565
It's time. Do it.

271
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,568
[all] Heave-ho!

272
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,282
Huh?

273
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,284
[grunting]

274
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,038
Ah!

275
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,206
Hey, what's going on?

276
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,374
[al] Huh?

277
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,002
[all groan]

278
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,839
Scyther!

279
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,634
-Ah! My best gym suit!
-Scyther!

280
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,972
[warbling]

281
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:08,931
Huh?

282
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
Huh?

283
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,978
-Scyther!
-Huh?

284
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,980
What are you doing, Electabuzz?

285
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,191
Hurry up and crush that Scyther!

286
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,485
-What's wrong with you, Scyther?
-Scyther!

287
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,111
-Cut attack, now!
-Scyther!

288
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,114
[warbling]

289
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,158
[both] Ah!

290
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,451
Scyther!

291
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,578
[warbling]

292
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,038
-Scyther!
-Wait! Stop!

293
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,540
You're making a mistake.
I'm your trainer, Scyther!

294
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,125
[screaming]

295
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,086
What are you doing? No!

296
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,171
It's me, Electabuzz, your trainer!

297
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,130
[screaming]

298
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,217
You don't have the right
to call yourself Pokémon trainers

299
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,802
after what you've made them do.

300
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,262
But please, you've got to save me!

301
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,722
[screaming]

302
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,474
-Scyther!
-Ahh!

303
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,644
[both screaming]

304
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,978
Scyther!

305
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,480
Scyther!

306
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,315
Think they've had enough?

307
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,817
[Misty]
I think they've learned their lesson.

308
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,736
All right, Bulbasaur, I choose you!

309
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,198
Bulbasaur!

310
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,243
Bulbasaur!

311
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,744
Scyther!

312
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,789
-Huh?
-Scy?

313
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,916
-Huh?
-Ther?

314
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,167
Scyther!

315
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,654
Scyther!

316
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,201
[grunting]

317
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,619
Scy...

318

[grunting]

319
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,374
-Scyther!
-Electabuzz!

320
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,544
Well, I hope you two
have learned your lesson.

321
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,587
Bulbasaur.

322
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,132
Shall we join together then?

323
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,010
At least until we've destroyed
those meddling kids.

324
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,969
-Chu!
-Huh?

325
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,012
[both] Come on!

326
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,431
Attack those kids on the roof now!

327
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,391
[all screaming]

328
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,768
They're going to have
to learn the hard way.

329
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,521
-Pikachu.
-Pikachu!

330
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,773
Pikachu, thunder attack!

331
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,276
Pi... ka-pika!

332
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,820
Chu!

333
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,244
[screaming]

334
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,170
-[Ash] Now then.
-[both] Huh?

335
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,881
Why can't we all just get along
like friends?

336
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,132
[both] Like friends?

337
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,594
-Now we'll teach you.
-I suggest you run.

338
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,720
[all gasp]

339
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,555
-Hold it right there.
-[all] Huh?

340
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,099
-What?
-And who are you?

341
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,937
I'm the inspector
from the official Pokémon League.

342
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,314
[both screaming]

343
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,275
Poké Ball, go.

344
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,236
[screaming]

345
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,739
Chansey, Chansey!

346
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,698
[men groan]

347
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,117
Chansey? That must mean...

348
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:20,331
That's right.
My true identity is Nurse Joy.

349
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,208
Uh...

350
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,253
I could never allow people
who use Pokémon for nothing

351
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,798
but street fighting
to open an official Pokémon gym.

352
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,052
-Please, Nurse Joy.
-Won't you give us another chance?

353
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,930
Only if you're willing to start over
from the beginning.

354
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,265
Of course we are.

355
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,892
Just tell us what we should do, Nurse Joy.

356
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,271
There's someone here who can do that
better than I can.

357
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,106
Who? Me?

358
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,568
[both] Oh, please.
Please teach us how to act.

359
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,654
Uh, well, you see,

360
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,576
Pokémon are really our friends,
so we've got to be kind to them.

361
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,829
But what about Pokémon battles?

362
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,123
Of course, you fight them
as hard as you can,

363
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,750
with all your strength, trying to win.

364
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,461
With all your strength?
Isn't that the same as fighting?

365
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,547
No, no. Not at all.

366
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,217
Sure you try to win,
but you don't try to beat each other.

367
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,176
[both] Huh?

368
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,847
[chuckles]
What is Ash trying to say anyway?

369
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,974
Heh, I don't think he knows himself.

370
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,936
Now, first, you'll have to fix
everything you broke in this town.

371
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,355
[both] At once, Tom Ayto!

372
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,149
Huh?

373
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,862
Oh, I should've picked a better name.

374
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,168
[grunting]

375
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,211
It looks like they've all had
a change of heart

376
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,839
and decided
to become true Pokémon trainers.

377
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,798
[all] Thanks!

378
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,383
You did it, Ash.

379
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,470
No, I didn't do it all by myself.

380
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,263
We all did it together.

381
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,516
We were wrong about Pokémon trainers
being bad guys.

382
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,645
Now we all want to become
Pokémon trainers.

383
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,604
[both] Right.

384
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,566
-We think Pokémon are the coolest.
-Just like you.

385
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,027
Oh, I'm not. It was nothing.

386
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,821
[all]
Can we have your autograph, Pikachu?

387
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,781
[groans]

388
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,241
Pi? Pika?

389
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,537
Oh, well, Pikachu really is the star.

390
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,458
-Goodbye now!
-We'll miss you!

391
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,210
Thanks for helping us!

392
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,714

394
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,551
