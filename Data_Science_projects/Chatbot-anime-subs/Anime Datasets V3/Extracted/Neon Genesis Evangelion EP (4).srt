1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,400
<i>Is he going to skip school again?</i>

23
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,920
Shinji, wake up! How long are you
going to keep skipping school?

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,420
It's been five days now. Unit 01 has
already been completely repaired.

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,290
You're the pilot. Are you going
to just leave it like that?!

26
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,760
Shinji?!

27
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,670
He's run away. That's not
too surprising.

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,990
Episode 04:
Rain, Escape and Afterwards

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,190
Shinji?

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,020
Well...

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,230
We're Shinji's classmates, Aida
and Suzuhara, Ma'am.

32
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,140
Aida and Suzuhara?

33
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes, Ma'am!

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm Suzuhara.

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,070
I'm Suzuhara.

36
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,670
Aren't you the boys who got
in Unit 01's entry plug?

37
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,310
Yes, Ma'am!

38
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,180
We're sorry for causing
so much trouble.

39
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,700
We're sorry for causing
so much trouble.

40
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,380
The reason we came here today is that
Ikari's been absent ever since then.

41
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,820
So, we came to see if he was okay.

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,520
Shinji? He's at the NERV training
facility right now.

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,220
Oh, I see.

44
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,930
These are the printouts that were
building up on Shinji's desk.

45
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,500
Oh, sorry for your trouble. Thank you.

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,730
Well, we'll be leaving now.

47
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,070
Please say "hi" to Shinji for us.

48
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,730
Yeah, I will. Bye.

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,450
This is an unexpected development.

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,470
She was a real babe, wasn't she?

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,570
Shinji, you idiot!

52
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,460
Jerk!

53
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>The next station is Naga'o Toge,<i>
<i>Naga'o Toge.<i>

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,770
<i>The exit will switch to the right side.<i>

55
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:07,360
<i>Thank you for using the<i>
<i>Tokyo 3 Loop Line.<i>

56
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,990
<i>This train will be going out<i>
<i>of service at this station.<i>

57
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,170
<i>Please, make sure you take all of your<i>
<i>belongings as you exit the train.<i>

58
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,650
I've got to go back.

59
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,050
Hey there! We're offering
you a great bargain!

60
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,260
Hot young babes serving
heavenly refreshment!

61
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,990
Special services to heal your tired
body, services to fill you with energy!

62
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,960
You really couldn't detect it, Doctor?!

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,630
Yes. An object only ten millimeters
in diameter

64
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,200
crashed into Antarctica at close
to the speed of light.

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,540
The technology we had was unable to
predict or prevent such a thing.

66
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,670
It's like hell out there! Just what
is the purpose of science?!

67
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,310
The atmospheric flux caused by the
change in the Earth's axis

68
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,280
has decreased by 3%.

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,450
So, it's getting a little better?

70
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,890
No, there's still a tidal wave
approaching at 230 meters a second!

71
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,490
Doctor! We must evacuate!

72
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,230
It's my duty to remain here.

73
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,190
Doctor, choosing death is easy,

74
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,460
but you have an obligation to
watch this living hell!

75
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,570
Idiot.

76
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,760
He's only fourteen years old.

77
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,490
It seems so cruel, making him bear
the burden of mankind's destiny.

78
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,760
We have no choice. We have to use
fourteen year olds to pilot the Evas.

79
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,640
I know.

80
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:31,810
So, has he called or made contact?

81
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,070
So, has he called or made contact?

82
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,240
Nothing?

83
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,180
Nothing. I don't think he's going
to come back again.

84
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,490
What are you going to do?

85
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,120
Nothing really.

86
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,450
If he's not going to come back,
that's okay too.

87
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,960
Why?

88
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,330
Because of what happened
after that last battle.

89
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,330
Why did you ignore my order?

90
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,970
I'm sorry.

91
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,170
I'm the one who's in charge of
your operations, right?

92
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,910
Yes.

93
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,670
You're supposed to obey my orders,
you know! Do you understand?

94
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,010
You're supposed to obey my orders,
you know! Do you understand?

95
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,940
Yes.

96
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,510
I'm warning you, never do it again.

97
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,950
I'm warning you, never do it again.

98
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,680
Yes.

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,450
Do you really understand
what I'm saying?!

100
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,180
Do you really understand
what I'm saying?!

101
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,250
Yes.

102
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,680
You're not going to get out of this by
just saying yes to everything I say.

103
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,950
You're not going to get out of this by
just saying yes to everything I say.

104
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,550
I know that. That's enough, isn't it?
We won the battle anyway.

105
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,430
Listen, it may seem easy to go along
with whatever anyone else wants,

106
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,130
but if you get into the Eva with
that attitude, it'll kill you!

107
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,590
I don't care.

108
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,110
It'd be nice if I could say you've
got the right attitude,

109
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,470
but if you expect to get any praise out
of me, you're wrong, Shinji Ikari.

110
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,680
That's not the point. In any case, I'm
the only one who can pilot it, aren't I?

111
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll do it.

112
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,650
I see.

113
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,490
If piloting an Eva means nothing
but pain to him,

114
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,050
he shouldn't get into it again.

115
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,900
Otherwise, I'm sure he'll be killed.

116
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,000
Otherwise, I'm sure he'll be killed.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,290
But we need pilots.

118
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,110
Captain!

119
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,980
Aida, go on ahead!

120
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,940
But I can't go and leave you behind!

121
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,050
You fool!

122
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,450
You fool!

123
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,510
No!

124
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,860
There!

125
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,800
The new kid?

126
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,070
Ikari!

127
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,230
Toji was sorry about that.

128
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,960
He said that his kid sister scolded him

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,420
and said that, "it was the robot
who saved our lives!"

130
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,800
That's pretty embarrassing, being
chewed out by a second grader.

131
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,000
Right?

132
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,540
I like it at night because those
noisy cicadas don't chirp.

133
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,580
Although I remember that it was
pretty quiet when I was a kid,

134
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,780
there've been more of them each year.

135
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,220
The ecosystem is returning
to its former state.

136
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,810
That's what Misato said.

137
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,720
I see, Misato said so.

138
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,630
I really envy you.

139
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,690
Living with such a beautiful woman
and piloting the Evangelion.

140
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,030
Oh God, I wish I could get behind
the controls just once!

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,270
You shouldn't. I think your mother
would be worried.

142
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,200
Oh, don't worry about that.
I don't have one.

143
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm the same as you.

144
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,490
You'll have something to eat,
won't you?

145
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,950
Yeah.

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,690
Do you usually do this sort of thing?

147
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,320
Well, sure.

148
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,890
Is this some kind of training for
guerilla warfare or something?

149
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,090
How could I fight with toys like those?
It's just for fun.

150
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,800
You're Shinji Ikari, aren't you?

151
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,100
Yes.

152
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,300
We're from NERV Security Intelligence.

153
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,600
We're from NERV Security Intelligence.

154
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,260
Under Article 8 of the Security Act,
we're taking you to NERV HQ.

155
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,140
All right?

156
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,370
All right?

157
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,600
Yes.

158
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,770
And all you did was stand there?

159
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,680
That's easy for you to say!

160
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,920
But it's like I said, they were NERV
Security Intelligence, professionals.

161
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,290
So what?! Don't you have
any balls at all?!

162
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,390
Sissy!

163
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,090
Sissy!

164
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,730
Pervert!

165
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,590
Only an idiot fights when he
knows he can't win.

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,460
Only an idiot fights when he
knows he can't win.

167
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,590
Balls have nothing to do with it.

168
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,640
Long time, no see.

169
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,580
Yes.

170
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,140
Do you feel any better after wandering
around for two days?

171
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,910
Do you feel any better after wandering
around for two days?

172
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,380
I don't know.

173
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,320
The Eva is on standby.
Will you pilot it?

174
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,920
Or won't you?

175
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,590
You're not going to scold
me for running away?

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,290
Of course not. I'm not related
to you, am I?

177
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,800
If I say that I won't pilot Unit 01,
what will you do with it?

178
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,060
I suppose that Rei will do it.

179
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,980
Won't you pilot it?

180
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,580
It seems unrealistic for you to
force everything on her.

181
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,420
Don't worry. I'll pilot it.

182
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,020
But you don't want to do it?

183
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,010
Of course not. To begin with, it's not
something that comes to me naturally.

184
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,660
But Ayanami, Miss Misato
and Miss Ritsuko...

185
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,400
Cut that out!

186
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
This has nothing to do with any of us!

187
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,430
If you don't like it, get out of here!

188
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,370
Just forget all about Eva and us and
go back to where you came from!

189
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,340
We don't need someone with
that attitude piloting.

190
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,460
The Third Child is leaving
Tokyo 3 tomorrow.

191
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,430
Then, we'll reconfigure Unit 01's
system for Rei.

192
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,690
But...

193
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:01,930
Regardless of the results of Unit 00's
re-activation experiments,

194
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,860
Regardless of the results of Unit 00's
re-activation experiments,

195
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,890
we'll move on to experimenting
with Unit 01.

196
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,810
According to the Marduk
Organization's report,

197
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,640
the Fourth Child hasn't been found yet.

198
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,810
That means we can't get
any pilot recruits?

199
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,610
Excuse me, where is Miss Misato?
I'd like to say good-bye.

200
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,820
You're no longer NERV personnel.

201
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,190
Therefore, we can't give you
any information.

202
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,070
Ikari!

203
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,570
You left this stuff behind!

204
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,540
You left this stuff behind!

205
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,580
Could you excuse me for a moment?

206
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,590
Thank you.

207
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,300
Hey, Toji. Come on, say something!

208
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,670
Ikari, I'm sorry I hit you twice.
Please, hit me back!

209
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,170
I can't do that.

210
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,910
Please! Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.

211
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,280
See? He's a pretty embarrassing
guy, isn't he?

212
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,270
But if it'll put an end to this dispute,
why don't you go ahead and hit him?

213
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,180
But...

214
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,850
Hurry up! You don't have
much time, do you?

215
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,720
Hurry up! You don't have
much time, do you?

216
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
Okay, but only once.

217
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,380
Okay! Come on!

218
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,030
Hold it!

219
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,370
Stop. Don't hold back.

220
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,830
Right.

221
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,970
Ouch...

222
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,150
How did you know I'd come here?

223
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,450
It was just a hunch. We've seen dozens
of classmates off before.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,630
If you're leaving, we'll have to leave
this city sometime soon,

225
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,540
but we can't blame you for that.
We saw how you suffered in the Eva.

226
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,300
And if anyone tries to blame you,

227
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,810
I'm gonna give them a head butt!

228
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,180
Hey, don't look so gloomy.

229
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,520
Take care.

230
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:39,690
Take care.

231
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,690
Good luck!

232
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,020
Good luck!

233
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,150
Well...

234
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,660
Your time is up.

235
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,620
I'm the one who deserves to be hit!
I'm mean, cowardly, dishonest, weak,

236
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,960
sneaky and a sissy.

237
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,360
Don't give us any more trouble.

238
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,450
He's gone.

239
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,670
Do you really think this
is for the best?

240
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,320
The Hedgehog's Dilemma.

241
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,460
The closer we become, the more
deeply we hurt each other.

242
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,950
Now I understand.

243
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,760
That boy...

244
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,720
He can't let others know how
he feels in any other way.

245
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,940
<i>The Express Linear Train, bound for</i>
<i>Atsugi is arriving on Track 2.</i>

Hang in there.

253
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,180
Hey, look!

254
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,040
Hey, it's that babe!

<i>TO BE CONTINUED...</i>

265
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Ayanami Rei lives with
minimal contact with others.

266
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Shinji is at a loss to see this girl
who's closer to his father than he.

267
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Before the wound in
his heart heals up...

268
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,200
...the light from an Angel
burns the chest of Eva Unit 01.

269
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,400

Rei, Beyond Her Heart
