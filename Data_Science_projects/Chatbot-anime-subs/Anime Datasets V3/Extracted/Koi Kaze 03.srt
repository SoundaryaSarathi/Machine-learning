1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,700
Gentle breeze

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,900
I can't sleep...

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Why do I...

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
...keep thinking about her?

20
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Now that I think about it...

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,100
When I was really little,

22
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,400
there were nights when I couldn't get to sleep.

23
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
At times like that...

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,300
Mom would soothe me by patting my head.

25
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,000
That's weird...

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,200
I swear it was somewhere in here...

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Ow!

28
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,400
Yeah...

29
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,500
When I was a little kid, without him...

30
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
There's nothing we can do.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
You're the one who forgot it.

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,100
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll ask the bus company. All right?

33
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
What a troublesome child you are.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Just like my mom did for me that day,

35
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,700
if I could give something to her,

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
maybe this feeling would go away.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Suddenly I thought...

38
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Maybe I'm the child.

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,700
Or is her innocence the child?

40
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,000
Or...

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
What do you want?!

42
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,400
How cute!

43
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Is this yours, brother?

44
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,700
Don't just come into my room like that!

45
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,800
How unexpected!

46
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,000
You treasure such a cute teddy bear?

47
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,700
It's not that I'm treasuring it.

48
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
Yes you are!

49
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,900
You washed it and cleaned it, right?

50
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,500
No, that wasn't... what I...

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
But, that way of drying isn't nice!

52
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Right?

53
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,400
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

54
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,900
But...

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,300
My mom made it for me when I was a kid.

56
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Isn't it a given for you to have it?

57
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,200
I'll give it to you.

58
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
Wait a second!

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,500
Here!

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,200
This one's mine.

61
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,100
My mother made it for me too.

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm giving it to you.

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I'll keep this one,

64
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
so take care of that one, brother.

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,100
I don't want this.

66
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,400
No! Take care of it!

67
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,900
Don't bully it!

68
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,000
She is definitely a child...

69
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,300
...so I think.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,500
I'd like to think but...

71
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,100
You came during third period?

72
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
When I woke up, the morning show was over.

73
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,900
I thought I should have just come in the afternoon, at first.

74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
You should've just taken the day off.

75
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
But you know...

76
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,000
I actually benefited from coming late!

77
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,600
I saw this really cute guy on the train!

78
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,700
What kind?

79
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,300
He was tall, and fair skinned

80
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,700
with really nice hair and really long eye lashes.

81
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,600
He was probably a high school student!

82
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,300
He was wearing a school uniform!

83
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,600
At such an hour?

84
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah! That's the point!

85
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
The point?

86
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
I was so late,  but he was on the same train car

87
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
on the same train at the same time!

88
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,200
Don't you think it's fate?

89
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,100
Yeah, sort of!

90
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,600
Isn't it? Isn't it? I feel a romance coming on!

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Romance...?

92
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Loser buys drinks!

93
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Fine, because I'm going to win.

94
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,200
Nanoka?

95
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,700
Was it?

96
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah. Thanks!

97
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,300
You're a life saver.

98
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,600
Are you okay?

99
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
You don't look so well.

100
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm fine.

101
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Huh?

102
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,700
Koshiro, you're taking tomorrow off too?

103
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,300
Yeah, it's a compensatory day off from last week.

104
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,500
Isn't Wakanai-san's arranged marriage meeting tomorrow?

105
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
It was?

106
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Yeah, it was!

107
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Shoot, I completely forgot about it.

108
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I'll come after lunch.

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,400
It's okay.

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
You can take the day off.

111
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
I'll go in your place.

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
That's not okay!

113
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Isn't he extremely shy in front of strangers?

114
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,800
So that he won't get nervous, we have to start from that meeting room,

115
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
then go to a nearby cafe, then go to a European restaurant...

116
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I can't leave such an important job

117
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,500
to someone who's been in a daze all the time.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,100
See, there you go lost in thought again.

119
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,900
Anyway, go get some rest tomorrow!

120
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah...

121
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,200
That cute guy you were talking about earlier,

122
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
what school does he go to?

123
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,500
I wish I could've found that out...

124
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I've never seen his uniform before.

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
Maybe it's the all-boys school that was established last year.

126
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
But if he was on the same train as you today

127
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
there's a chance you could see him again, right?

128
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I want to see what he looks like too!

129
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,300
What? What's wrong?

130
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,300
What should I do?

131
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
It's that blonde guy?

132
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Oh my god! Can I believe in fate?

133
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
He's the guy from this morning?!

134
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,100
Do you think he's good-looking?

135
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
What should I do?

136
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,200
Wait a minute!

137
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
I want to take a better look at him!

138
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Nanoka...

139
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
Did you see that?

140
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
It was Tamaki, right? He was kissing Tamaki, right?

141
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah...

142
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
That girl! She said she wasn't interested!

143
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll make her spill it all out tomorrow!

144
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,850
I'm home.

145
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,950
You...

146
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,550
Welcome home.

147
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,950
You're early.

148
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,350
What's wrong?

149
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,850
What's that medicine for?

150
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,150
Oh, it's nothing.

151
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,950
Just a pain reliever.

152
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,950
I'm going to go lie down in my room.

153
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,350
Hey, is Nanoka all right?

154
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,050
She was probably up late yesterday or something.

155
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,450
Nanoka...

156
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,350
It looks like the beginning of the rainy season.

157
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,250
The weather in the Kantou region isn't very clear.

158
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,150
There won't be any rain from tonight to tomorrow morning, but

159
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,850
it will most likely rain tomorrow afternoon.

160
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,850
Please don't forget to bring your umbrella when you go out.

161
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,350
Next, tomorrow's weather for each area on Tokyo.

162
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,150
It will be cloudy followed by rain in Tokyo city.

163
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,150
Probability of precipitation in the morning is 60%

164
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,750
In the afternoon it will be 70%...

165
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,450
Aren't you hungry?

166
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Where are you going at this hour?

167
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,750
A walk.

168
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,150
What are you saying? You're not feeling well, right?

169
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,350
I just have really bad menstrual cramps.

170
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,150
First time in three months?

171
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,050
Is that alright?

172
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,550
The doctor told me it's common for girls my age.

173
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,450
I'm sorry for making you worry even though I'm not really sick.

174
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,950
It's alright.

175
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,950
Do you want to go to the convenience store on the way back?

176
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,950
Are you all right? Don't force yourself!

177
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,050
Brother, you're over-exaggerating.

178
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,450
I'm fine.

179
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,750
Today,

180
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,250
I saw my friend kissing a guy.

181
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,650
I wonder if I'm going to kiss someone someday?

182
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,950
I'm going to have you explain everything about yesterday!

183
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,950
I have nothing to explain.

184
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,650
Where did you meet him?

185
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,250
In junior high. We went to the same cram school.

186
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,550
Cram school?

187
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,750
That's something that is unrelated to me!

188
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,550
Ouch!

189
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,950
I said something weird last night...

190
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,750
Brother's probably used to kissing.

191
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,150
He's an adult.

192
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,650
When will I become an adult?

193
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,650
Isn't there any good love rolling around?

194
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,450
What?

195
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,850
Is that strange?

196
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,550
Not really.

197
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,650
See?

198
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,150
Crap!

199
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,550
Shit...

200
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,650
It'll probably stop soon.

201
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,350
When you're in love, even boring things make your heart jump!

202
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,650
That's what makes it really fun!

203
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,850
Yeah!

204
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,550
Oh no... it's gotten worse.

205
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,150
Brother...

206
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,050
Brother!

207
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,650
I'm home.

208
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,850
Did you come to pick me up?

209
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,650
No way.

210
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,150
I was on my way to the store because I ran out of tobacco.

211
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,950
It's true! I only brought one umbrella too!

212
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,650
Yeah.

213
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,650
I know.

214
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,350
Are you all right?

215
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,550
Your stomach ache?

216
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,950
What are you smiling about?

217
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,050
Nothing.

218
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,050
What do you mean?

219
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,450
Weirdo.

220
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,450
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

221
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,480
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

222
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,380
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

223
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,850
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

224
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,940
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

225
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,340
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

226
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,920
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

227
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,170
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

228
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,610
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

229
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:30,410
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

230
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,820
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

231
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,190
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

232
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

233
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,810
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

234
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

235
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,270
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

236
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,450
The marriage meeting schedule completely skipped my mind.

237
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,450
I bullied the bear by giving it a noogie with my knuckles.

238
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,650
I stared at her underwear in the laundry.

239
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,350
I can't help it!

240
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,150
It's only natural if you're a man!

241
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,450
Innocent. Suspended sentence.
