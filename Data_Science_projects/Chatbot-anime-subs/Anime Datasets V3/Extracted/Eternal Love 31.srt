<i>[Episode 31]</i>

3
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,224
<i>I've finally gotten rid of
that father and son.</i>

4
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:20,425
<i>I'll find a place to sleep on
the north bank tonight.</i>

5
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:22,862
<i>I'll deliver the wine to
Fourth Brother's manor tomorrow.</i>

6
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:47,224
- A-Li has gone to sleep?
- He's sleeping.

7
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,025
He always falls asleep come nightfall.

8
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,145
All these years, you've taken on
the role of his father and his mother.

9
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,025
It truly is not an easy task.

10
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:01,064
I have yet to thank you
for saving my life.

11
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,865
I wasn't expecting you to thank me.

12
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,224
Why?

13
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:14,544
Although I saved you 300 years ago,
I did not wake you up.

14
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:17,905
At the time, you were completely
disheartened and had no will to live.

15
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:22,185
Since you did not want to live,
why are you thanking me now?

16
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:27,585
But it seems you have found
something to live for now.

17
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,865
Come, try my peach blossom wine.

18
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:53,944
Tell me. What have you come for today?

19
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,425
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

20
00:03:57,985 --> 00:04:03,305
When I accepted the engagement between
you two 300 years at the grand hall

21
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,784
you did not seem interested.

22
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,224
Yet, you are now.

23
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,504
I have three questions.

24
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,465
What are they? Tell me.

25
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:18,144
Let's see if I can help you
clear things up.

26
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:21,144
Why is Bai Qian so averse
to bright lights?

27
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,144
Were her eyes injured before?

28
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,305
It is an ailment she was born with.

29
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:35,545
Is it true that in her battle
with Qing Cang 300 years ago

30
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,064
she was injured and
was unconscious for many years?

31
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,904
Of course it is true.
The whole world knows it.

32
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,425
What's the matter?

33
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,185
You don't believe it?

34
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,904
Look at how old I am. I'm an old phoenix.
Why would I lie to a junior?

35
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,504
It's true, it's true.

36
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:02,865
<i>It doesn't seem as if Zhe Yan is lying.</i>

37
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,665
<i>Could it be...</i>

38
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,144
<i>No, it can't be.</i>

39
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:09,584
<i>Even if everything else is a coincidence,
that scar is real.</i>

40
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,345
<i>Nobody is able to remove
the scars left by crimson hellfire.</i>

41
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,985
And what is the third question?

42
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,264
Has she once forgotten something?

43
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:21,785
How did you know?

44
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:23,824
She truly has?

45
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,785
That's an exaggeration. It's not amnesia.

46
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,985
It's just that in the few years
she was asleep

47
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,665
there were many events that happened
that she is unaware of.

48
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:38,264
Why would you think
she had lost her memory?

49
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,704
I am overthinking things.

50
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,665
<i>Does this fellow know something?</i>

51
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:49,464
<i>Could he be the one
Bai Qian wanted to forget?</i>

52
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:53,464
By the way, Ye Hua,
I also have a question for you.

53
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,064
Please ask.

54
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:58,144
From the first time I saw you

55
00:05:58,144 --> 00:06:01,384
you have always been dressed
in black from head to toe.

56
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,625
Even to this day.

57
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:06,625
I just find it most strange.

58
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:11,785
Why would such a young man as you
like to wear such a dark, gloomy color?

59
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:18,944
This color indeed is not too pleasing,
but it is very practical.

60
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:22,985
Should I be sliced by a sword one day
and my clothes become soaked with blood

61
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,584
nobody would be able to tell.

62
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,904
One would merely think
I'd fallen into a lake.

63
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,305
If nobody can tell

64
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:34,545
then my adversary will not
feel satisfaction from wounding me

65
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:38,264
and my loved ones will not worry either.

66
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,944
You are similar to Mo Yuan.

67
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:50,144
Sometimes, even I speculate
whether you are actually Mo Yuan.

68
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:54,345
No, I am not Mo Yuan.

69
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,064
Here.

70
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,225
My lord, you're awake?

71
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,264
What time is it?

72
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:39,024
You've only slept for an hour.

73
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,584
Do all the men of Ghost Realm
hold their liquor as well as you do?

74
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,144
I don't know about other people.

75
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:59,144
But my tolerance has grown
over these last 70,000 years.

76
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,384
My lord, don't look so heartbroken.

77
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:08,384
Since fate has brought us together,
then we should act like lovers.

78
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,425
Your eyes see me.

79
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:17,345
Your heart should see me too.

80
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:32,543
<i>These woods aren't as nice as Zhe Yan's</i>

81
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,556
<i>but it's good for shielding me
from the elements.</i>

82
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,705
<i>I'll sleep under these shrubs tonight.</i>

83
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:14,544
A-Yin, where have you been
all these years?

84
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:24,065
So it is Ghost Lord Li Jing.

85
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:28,304
A-Yin, don't speak to me like that.

86
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,544
I have long ago
broken all ties with you.

87
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,825
I don't deserve to be called A-Yin.

88
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,865
Please call me by my proper name.

89
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,264
A-Yin.

90
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:48,625
You've been avoiding me for 70,000 years.

91
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,705
Are you going to keep hiding from me?

92
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:55,504
I have been searching for you
all these years.

93
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:59,585
I was wrong. It was all my fault, A-Yin.

94
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:11,345
I searched the entire Kunlun Mountain
and all corners of the Celestial Realm.

95
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,551
I know you blame me.

96
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,225
You said Grand Ziming Palace was
your sworn enemy. Do you know I--

97
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,024
I'm sorry to have troubled you,
Ghost Lord.

98
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:25,024
The things I said back then were
only in the heat of the moment.

99
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,105
The Celestial Tribe and Ghost Tribe
get along well now.

100
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,705
I did not live so long
without learning anything.

101
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,932
I do understand some principles.

102
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,904
Naturally, I will not
make trouble out of nothing

103
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,465
and come to your
Grand Ziming Palace to cause trouble.

104
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:40,424
What do you mean by that?

105
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:43,105
You won't even bother
to blame me anymore?

106
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:45,384
There is no love,
so naturally there is no blame.

107
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:49,424
From now on, we should
both mind our own business.

108
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,904
No, A-Yin.

109
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,184
You must not say that
without listening to me first.

110
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,225
I betrayed you back then.

111
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,544
Just because you were
part of the Celestial Tribe, I...

112
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:07,424
All these years,
they've told me you already...

113
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,985
I didn't believe it.

114
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:13,024
A-Yin.

115
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,304
I was thinking of you all these years.

116
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,825
I've also been searching for you
all these years.

117
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,945
I don't believe that I do not exist
even a little bit in your heart.

118
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:26,527
Who says I am part of
the Celestial Tribe?

119
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:29,625
Open your eyes and take a clear look.

120
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,625
I am Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

121
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,024
You are Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

122
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:41,504
Then... Back then, you...

123
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,144
Back then, only for the purpose of
studying at Kunlun Mountain

124
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:46,985
did I hide my identity as part of
the Nine-tailed Fox Clan.

125
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,985
Since you have mentioned the past to me

126
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:53,985
let's talk about it.

127
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:57,784
Back then, you abandoned me
and chose Xuan Nu.

128
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,424
She was carried by four qilin beasts
and officially wed

129
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:01,705
with nine days of celebration.

130
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,264
Is that not the truth?

131
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,705
Don't mention her.

132
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,264
Did you not feel sad back then?

133
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,544
Why didn't you tell me
you were of the Fox Clan?

134
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,144
Generally speaking, I was sad
for a period of time.

135
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,144
Now I can't even remember it.

136
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,985
Since Ghost Lord adores Xuan Nu

137
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:26,865
then you must adore
her character and temperament

138
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:30,264
and not her face that is similar to mine.

139
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:37,105
I no longer hold any resentment for you.
There is nothing worth mentioning.

140
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:41,985
A-Yin.

141
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:47,585
I know you blame me.

142
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:53,304
You blame me for not giving the soul jade
to you back in Grand Ziming Palace.

143
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,345
But I regret it, A-Yin.

144
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,225
I later went to
Kunlun Mountain seeking you

145
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,048
but they said you had already...

146
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:03,264
You had already left with Mo Yuan's body.

147
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,784
High Immortal!

148
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,745
You don't look much different.

149
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,105
You still look like a child.

150
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,664
Ghost Lord.

151
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:29,105
What happened 70,000 years ago
was a big mess.

152
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,745
There is no need for you to
keep thinking about it every day.

153
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:36,024
You have a beautiful lady here.
Do not keep thinking of the past.

154
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,585
Farewell.

155
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,384
A-Yin! A-Yin!

156
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:45,705
A-Yin!

157
00:13:58,544 --> 00:13:59,745
A-Yin.

158
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:05,345
If you leave like this,
how am I to find you?

159
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:08,945
How am I to find you again?

160
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,225
My lord!

161
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:16,225
My lord.

162
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,664
Was that female immortal
once your lover as well?

163
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:25,424
Go away.

164
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:30,184
My lord, I heard
your conversation very clearly.

165
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:34,825
She is merely a lover from the past.
If it's over, it's over.

166
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:38,825
You like female immortals.
Well, I am a female immortal.

167
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,345
Female immortal?

168
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:50,019
Don't tell me you want to follow me
back to Grand Ziming Palace.

169
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:52,625
Are you aware of this?

170
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,705
The lives of immortals who live in the
Ghost Realm for too long are shortened.

171
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,585
Did you also know this?

172
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:04,745
The children born from immortals
in the Grand Ziming Palace...

173
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,985
are either sick or dead.

174
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:17,985
My lord.

175
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,105
My lord!

176
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,024
My lord.

177
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,144
My lord!

178
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,224
Do you truly want to enter
the Celestial Palace?

179
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:09,664
It is my life's wish.
Please grant me my wish, my lord.

180
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:15,184
If you insist, I will have Tian Shu
lead you into the palace.

181
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:18,065
When you have come to your senses,
you can leave on your own.

182
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,065
Thank you, Your Highness!

183
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,705
Father, walk faster!

184
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:48,705
Father, is this where Mother lived
for hundreds of thousands of years?

185
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,024
That's right.

186
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:55,184
I can't believe Mother is
so many years older than you, Father.

187
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,144
Father must be quite regretful

188
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:59,825
that you did not get to be with Mother
when you were a child.

189
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:03,825
Your Highness!

190
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,644
Your Highness.

191
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,825
Aunt is not in the Fox Den.

192
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,105
I know she is not back yet.

193
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:15,265
Then does Your Highness know
where Aunt has gone?

194
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:18,384
She fled from the North Sea.

195
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,625
Fled?

196
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,664
Did Aunt displease someone?

197
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:23,664
That shouldn't be.

198
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,984
She's survived hundreds of millennia
to become a high goddess.

199
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:29,944
There isn't anybody
she should be afraid of in this world.

200
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,744
What did she flee for?

201
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,184
There are some matters I must attend to.
I'll be leaving A-Li here for now.

202
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:38,065
Imperial great-grandson?

203
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,025
You mustn't.

204
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,704
How can I look after
the imperial great-grandson by myself?

205
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:46,664
I'm really easy to look after.
Just give me a cup of tea and two books.

206
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:49,825
Just bring me whatever
my mother usually likes to read.

207
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:52,144
Your Highness, don't jest.

208
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,464
I came to the Fox Den
when I was around your age.

209
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:55,984
I've never left Qing Qiu.

210
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,865
How would I know what your mother likes?

211
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:04,224
High Goddess Bai Qian is my mother.
I'll read what she likes to read.

212
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:14,865
<i>When I burned Su Su's belongings...</i>

213
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,305
<i>the fire would burn
in the green color that she likes.</i>

214
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,105
<i>If it...</i>

215
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:39,904
<i>Green? It's green!</i>

216
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,744
How come you still haven't given up?

217
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:02,785
Why is the lamp...

218
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:06,265
I thought you had no more
of Su Su's possessions?

219
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:11,184
It wasn't easy to bring the flame back!
Why did you put it out?

220
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:15,744
- I no longer need it.
- No longer need it?

221
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:20,105
I have already found her.

222
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:24,144
What do you mean by that?

223
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,305
Could it be that the mortal didn't die
when she jumped off Zhuxian Terrace?

224
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:31,825
Impossible. Unless it wasn't her
who jumped off.

225
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,144
Neither.

226
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:37,265
You're an enigma! Tell me quickly!
You're truly killing me with suspense!

227
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,545
It turns out the reason

228
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,384
the Soul-gathering Lamp
was lit for 300 years

229
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,664
but did not create a wisp of a shadow...

230
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,865
is because Su Su's soul
was not destroyed.

231
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:54,984
She merely forgot about me.

232
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:58,865
Her soul was not destroyed?

233
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,731
How is it possible for a mortal
to survive a jump off Zhuxian Terrace?

234
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,625
Unless she is an immortal.

235
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,384
Are you saying she is an immortal?

236
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,865
That's right.

237
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:13,184
Where is she from?
Has she never been to Celestial Palace?

238
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:21,105
She is Qing Qiu's queen,
High Goddess Bai Qian.

239
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:25,224
What did you say?

240
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,904
Do not tell this to anyone yet.

241
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,031
There are still two things
I have yet to figure out.

242
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:36,585
Why did she not have any celestial aura
and was left in the Far East?

243
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:40,424
Why has she now forgotten about me?

244
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:45,865
Wait, I need some time.
I need to think about this.

245
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,184
Where are you going?

246
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,865
I'm going to see Dong Hua Dijun.

247
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:56,865
He knows best what happened 300 years ago
when Qing Cang broke out of the Bell.

248
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,105
I'm going to Taichen Palace.

249
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:00,368
Please help me put away
the Soul-gathering Lamp.

250
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,424
Su Su is Bai Qian.
Bai Qian is Su Su.

251
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,904
Then didn't you go through
that torment for nothing back then?

252
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:11,305
If it was her, you could have
just married her

253
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,704
with the whole world congratulating you.

254
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:34,144
Is Your Highness here to see Dijun?

255
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:37,184
Yes. Is Dijun already in
the mortal realm to experience trials?

256
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,785
Yes, he's already left.

257
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,224
You have always been by Dijun's side.

258
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:46,505
Do you know what happened 300 years ago
when Qing Cang broke out of the Bell?

259
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:50,384
Hasn't the matter been resolved?

260
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,825
Aunt Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
sealed away Qing Cang.

261
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:55,305
She was injured and
was asleep for many years.

262
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,065
Is there nothing else?

263
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:02,105
I am not sure about anything else.

264
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,464
All right, I understand.

265
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,664
Yun Sheng.

266
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,865
Aunt, you haven't come by in many years.

267
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:23,744
You've come at the wrong time.
Bi Fang has run away from home.

268
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,664
Fourth Uncle left yesterday
in search of him.

269
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:29,904
If you do not mind, allow me
to provide you my hospitality.

270
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:35,065
What a hobby he has.
He's always chasing after a bird.

271
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,105
I'm already used to it.

272
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,305
Aunt, let's hurry inside.

273
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,105
Wait.

274
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:47,984
You seem to be acting strangely.

275
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:52,865
Could it be that Second Brother is here?

276
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,825
Aunt, that's a really good guess.

277
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:01,984
Second Uncle came early in the morning.
He's been in a foul mood.

278
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:06,184
Didn't you see I was sitting outside?
I don't dare go inside.

279
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,744
I should get going.

280
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:10,904
Fifth Sister, come in.

281
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:14,984
Second Brother.

282
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,105
Let's go.

283
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:51,345
Oh, yes! Aunt, you just arrived.
You must not have had breakfast yet.

284
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:54,305
I... I'll go prepare breakfast for you.

285
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,464
Where is Xiao Jiu?

286
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:06,424
A few days ago, she was still
cooking in my Fox Den.

287
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,105
She has already done
many shameful things for Dong Hua's sake.

288
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:12,904
When she returned to
my manor 300 years ago

289
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:16,585
I had to hang her up and spank her twice
for her to become well-behaved.

290
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:19,825
If she is at your residence,
then keep a good eye on her.

291
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:25,144
Rest assured, Second Brother. I'll surely
keep her confined in Qing Qiu's Fox Den.

292
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:27,224
She won't be outside being a disgrace.

293
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:32,944
- The life debt to Dong Hua Dijun...
- Don't worry, Second Brother.

294
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:36,785
Qing Qiu will take on the debt
that Xiao Jiu owes to Dong Hua Dijun.

295
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:38,585
As her aunt, I'll repay it in her stead.

296
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,265
I absolutely won't allow Xiao Jiu

297
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:44,704
to form any new ideas for
that notion she's finally rid of.

298
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:48,105
This Dong Hua Dijun is an immortal
that sprung out of a crack in a rock.

299
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:50,664
One must not love him
or hold him in their heart.

300
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:51,944
He's not one to feel affection.

301
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:53,984
Good.

302
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,384
Why did you suddenly came
to the Far North?

303
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:05,545
The Water King's son
happened to turn one month old.

304
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,345
He sent an invitation to Qing Qiu.

305
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:10,664
Mother and Father are traveling.

306
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,984
I had nothing much to do,
so I came for a visit.

307
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,464
The Eastern Sea is in the east.

308
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:19,265
If you were returning to Qing Qiu,
you should be traveling in the east.

309
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:22,904
Oh, I forgot to mention...

310
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,704
Fourth Brother had me bring
two jars of wine from Zhe Yan's.

311
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:28,825
I came to deliver them along the way.

312
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,065
What trouble.

313
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,464
I'm going to take them to
the kitchen now.

314
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,585
Aunt, do you not need breakfast anymore?

315
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,424
I'm leaving.

316
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:04,785
These contain the peach blossom wine
Fourth Brother wanted.

317
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:10,424
By the way, Aunt, I heard just now that
you attended the Eastern Sea banquet.

318
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,224
I did.

319
00:26:12,224 --> 00:26:16,105
It's said the Crown Prince
was there as well. Did you see him?

320
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,144
I did.

321
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,872
Back when the Crown Prince came to
the Far North to pacify the rebellion

322
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,848
I had the good fortune to deliver
a map of the Far North to His Highness.

323
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:28,184
I will never in my life forget
the Crown Prince's grace.

324
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:33,345
You were merely
a young child 300 years ago.

325
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,944
How could you remember so clearly?

326
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:39,585
To be honest, I love hearing others
speak of the Crown Prince.

327
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:43,744
Aunt, did you know that in
all the battles of the past 30,000 years

328
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:47,265
wherever the Crown Prince made
a stand, he mowed down all resistance?

329
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:49,984
Should you marry
the Crown Prince in the future

330
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,305
you must not forget to bring me with you.

331
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:55,664
I'm leaving now.

332
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,625
Take care to attend to the one inside.

333
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:04,265
Your Highness! Your Highness, slow down!

334
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:05,625
Your Highness!

335
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,065
Mother!

336
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:12,184
Mother, you lied.

337
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:15,904
You said yesterday that you were going to
return to the Celestial Palace with us.

338
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:17,984
I deserve to be punished.

339
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,105
You ordered me to defend Qing Qiu.

340
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,625
But I really could not stop
the Crown Prince from coming.

341
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,664
Please punish me as you will.

342
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,585
Lord Ye Hua is here too?

343
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:31,785
Father said you do not want
to return with us.

344
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,384
He's afraid you cannot adapt
to living in the Celestial Palace.

345
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,585
That isn't a problem.

346
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:39,144
Father and I will just
move here to live with you.

347
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:43,944
As long as Mother is present,
I can live anywhere.

348
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:47,305
You’re going to move here
to live with me?

349
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:49,224
Your father is coming as well?

350
00:27:49,224 --> 00:27:53,065
Aunt, do not fret.
There is precedent.

351
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,144
Precedent?

352
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:57,025
It's said when Heavenly Lord
was still a crown prince

353
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:00,049
the former Heavenly Lord arranged for
his cousin to be his crown princess.

354
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,261
Heavenly Lord was displeased.

355
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,940
The former Heavenly Lord issued a decree

356
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,144
to have him confined in
his aunt's residence.

357
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:07,865
Who knew that after a month,
affection would grow.

358
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:10,904
They returned to the Celestial Palace
and it became a wonderful story.

359
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:13,785
Wonderful story?

360
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:18,944
Yes. It is in Lord Ye Hua's right
to stay here in Qing Qiu.

361
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:20,944
Nobody could rebuke him for it.

362
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:29,625
I actually think he came
to give me a hard time.

363
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,585
Did you anger Lord Ye Hua
at the Eastern Sea?

364
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:37,184
I broke up his relationship with
the princess of the Eastern Sea.

365
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,744
Then...

366
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:45,744
Lord Ye Hua is not present at
the moment. You can hide for a while.

367
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,505
He isn't here?

368
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:49,984
He left after leaving
the young prince with me.

369
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:53,464
Mother, I am a little hungry.

370
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:57,105
Did you save any food here?

371
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,424
No.

372
00:28:58,424 --> 00:28:59,904
Where's Xiao Jiu?

373
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,625
With her here,
isn't there someone to cook?

374
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:06,265
After you left, she left as well to go
to the mortal realm to repay a debt.

375
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:08,025
She's left to repay a debt again?

376
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:11,184
Could it be Dong Hua Dijun?

377
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,944
Forget it.

378
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:17,464
Let's take A-Li to
the Mushroom Market for food.

379
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,625
Come.

380
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:35,505
Honored Lady! Honored Lady!

381
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,865
Your Ladyship, His Majesty is coming.

382
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:59,625
Your Majesty, this is Honored Lady Chen
who nearly died after falling into water.

383
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,585
She is almost fully recovered by now.

384
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,265
- Honored Lady Chen?
- Yes.

385
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:05,424
Your Majesty has not
called upon her much.

386
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,305
She is quite pitiful to have
suffered through an illness.

387
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:16,184
- It'll be her tonight.
- Yes.

388
00:30:36,224 --> 00:30:37,625
Make preparations, Your Ladyship.

389
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,625
You'll be attending to
His Majesty tonight.

390
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,105
Attending to His Majesty?

391
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,704
Congratulations, Your Ladyship.

392
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:57,704
Did... Did he just say I will be
attending to His Majesty tonight?

393
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,265
Yes, Your Ladyship.

394
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,785
His Majesty will finally lie with you.

395
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,105
<i>When I was an immortal, repaying
his kindness was always on my mind</i>

396
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:19,704
<i>but I did not know how
I was going to do so.</i>

397
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:24,384
<i>Now I have to lie with him right after
I've come to the mortal realm.</i>

398
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,384
<i>I'm truly startled.</i>

399
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:33,025
<i>I was trembling with fear that night,
waiting for the eunuch to pick me up.</i>

400
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:36,585
<i>I'd never imagined the day would come...</i>

401
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:57,184
Greetings to Virtuous Consort
and Worthy Consort.

402
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,384
I heard that after you
started recovering from an illness

403
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:04,825
a plumed cockscomb flower
appeared on your forehead.

404
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,384
I've invited
Spiritual Master of Jade Purity

405
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,825
to make a judgment on this flower.

406
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:26,865
Master, you say this flower
on my forehead is a demonic flower?

407
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:30,505
That's right. It is clearly
a demonic flower!

408
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:38,704
Guards, confine
Honored Lady Chen in her room.

409
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:44,704
She is not to step foot out
of Handan Quarters without my permission.

410
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,825
It is a demonic flower?

411
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,184
Then let the matter rest.

412
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:13,105
Is Your Majesty not going to issue
an order to send her out of the palace?

413
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:17,585
I do not believe what
some Spiritual Master says.

414
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:20,585
I only find it troublesome.

415
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,184
I just won't call upon her from now on.

416
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:23,984
Step out.

417
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:25,345
Yes.

418
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,944
She's been let off lightly.

419
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:48,585
That lying, deceitful Spiritual Master.

420
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:51,984
He says the flower on my forehead
as an immortal is a demonic flower?

421
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:53,984
How ludicrous.

422
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,704
I've already been locked in
for seven days.

423
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,184
Don't tell me I won't be able to
see Dijun in my entire lifetime.

424
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:12,545
Why don't I enter Dijun's dream and
ask him what his wish is in this life?

425
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,144
This way, I'll get an idea
of how to repay him.

426
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:43,304
<i>Dijun, I am sorry for this.</i>

427
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:07,144
<i>I came this time because I wholeheartedly
want to repay your kindness.</i>

428
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:11,744
<i>I hope you will tell me
what it is you truly want.</i>

429
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,704
<i>I will spare no effort
to fulfill your wish.</i>

430
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,224
<i>Do you have any wishes in this lifetime?</i>

431
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:52,025
Who is speaking?

432
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,344
<i>I am an immortal of the Nine Heavens.</i>

433
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:56,545
<i>I was passing by and
saw you were in a dream.</i>

434
00:35:56,545 --> 00:36:00,025
<i>I'd like to ask why you are
wearing such an expression.</i>

435
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,184
<i>Is there a wish you cannot fulfill</i>

436
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:03,824
<i>or an infatuation you cannot attain?</i>

437
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,224
A wish?

438
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:10,105
I do not want riches,
honor, or the world.

439
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:12,664
I merely seek to have the heart of one.

440
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,304
Can you give that to me, Immortal?

441
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,224
It is such a simple wish.

442
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,585
Could it be that even an immortal
cannot grant it?

443
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:38,625
<i>Is... what you said true?</i>

444
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:42,704
<i>You truly want a sincere heart,
wholeheartedly devoted to you?</i>

445
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:48,505
I am a ruler.
Naturally, I will not lie.

446
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:53,224
<i>All right, I give you my promise.</i>

447
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:43,985
<i>Isn't Dijun...
an immortal made out of rock?</i>

448
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,385
<i>Why would he have worldly desires?</i>

449
00:37:56,905 --> 00:38:00,105
<i>She has already done
many shameful things for Dong Hua's sake.</i>

450
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:01,945
<i>When she returned to
my manor 300 years ago</i>

451
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:04,867
<i>I had to hang her up and spank her twice
for her to become well-behaved.</i>

452
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,625
<i>If she is at your residence,
then keep a good eye on her.</i>

453
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,304
<i>A day in heaven is
a day in the mortal realm.</i>

454
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:14,864
<i>Xiao Jiu will be back
in two months at most.</i>

455
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:16,864
<i>Second Brother probably will not notice.</i>

456
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,465
<i>Xiao Jiu, Xiao Jiu... Hurry back soon.</i>

457
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,304
<i>Otherwise, even I won't be able
to save you this time.</i>

458
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:25,505
Aunt.

459
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,184
Aunt, you're back.
How come Princess Feng Jiu isn't here?

460
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,905
It used to be the Little Princess
who picked fruits for Aunt.

461
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:33,344
She'll be back soon.

462
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:42,224
Aunt!

463
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,744
My mother is so young and beautiful.

464
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:50,505
Why do you have to make her sound so old?

465
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,985
When did you pick up a young child, Aunt?

466
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,385
Just yesterday.

467
00:38:55,385 --> 00:38:58,264
So it is Aunt's young prince.

468
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:01,344
There are many fun and tasty things
in the Mushroom Market.

469
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:05,105
Would Your Highness like any?

470
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,385
Mother, I want this one.

471
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:13,824
Take it.

472
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:34,744
Aunt.

473
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:37,545
There's been an excellent harvest.
Why do you still look so miserable?

474
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,585
It's because it's a big harvest
that I'm unhappy.

475
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,864
I'll have to sell at low prices now.

476
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:45,545
There was a small harvest last year.
You all earned a lot.

477
00:39:45,545 --> 00:39:47,545
The fruit looks pretty good.

478
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:54,144
You learned to pick fruit from
Xiao Jiu herself. You pick.

479
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:58,304
Then let's have half a basket from here.

480
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:11,264
Lord Ye Hua, you’re back.

481
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,824
Good timing. We're eating loquats for
lunch today. Would you like to join us?

482
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:19,864
A-Li is growing right now.
This is all you're feeding him?

483
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,545
Do you like to eat these?

484
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:22,864
Yes.

485
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,184
Where can we find meat and produce?

486
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:29,784
- Do you still want the loquats?
- Yes!

487
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:40,784
Look.

488
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,224
- He's so handsome!
- Yes.

489
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:47,465
Look, the young child calls
our queen Mother.

490
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,824
Yes, and he calls the man Father.

491
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,264
Aunt! Aunt, you're back!

492
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:57,025
These two fish are
a present for you, Aunt.

493
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:59,025
Take them home and stew them
to nourish your body.

494
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,425
Thank you.

495
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,405
She's been looking after
a child by herself.

496
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:04,329
She should indeed have some nourishment.

497
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:13,465
Go cook.

498
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:20,425
Aunt, you clearly know...
you clearly know I can't cook.

499
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:23,824
There's a first time for everything.

500
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:25,784
You could even survive
a trial of lightning bolts.

501
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:26,824
I believe in you.

502
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,945
Mother, I'm hungry.

503
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:32,945
Aunt, please spare me.

504
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:35,585
I am a tree spirit.
I am deathly afraid of fire.

505
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:40,585
I know, but I'm not telling you
to burn yourself like firewood.

506
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,184
A-Li is hungry now.

507
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:43,465
I...

508
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,545
I truly do not understand you.

509
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:02,985
Qing Qiu is clearly a land of immortals

510
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:05,224
but you manage it like the mortal realm.

511
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:08,905
Men till the fields and women knit.
There's no trace of magic anywhere.

512
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:15,184
If everything is done with magic,
then life would not be interesting.

513
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,465
They would be bored as well.

514
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:22,144
I'm thinking of creating
a battlefield for them sometime

515
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:24,625
so they can have some fun
fighting each other

516
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,144
so they don't get too bored.

517
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:29,264
That actually sounds quite interesting.

518
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:32,945
When the time comes, I'll lend you a few
Celestial generals to liven things up.
