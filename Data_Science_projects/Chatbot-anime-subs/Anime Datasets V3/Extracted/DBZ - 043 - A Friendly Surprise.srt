00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:33,083
Brr...

2
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:51,276
H- hurry it up! Are you trying
to freeze me to death!?

3
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:53,612
You can't ask us to do that.

4
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:58,950
He's right. If we melt it too fast,
this whole cave could collapse.

5
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,284
I get it! I get it already,
so just hurry it up!

6
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:10,562
Ah, man! I'm sure this cold
is no good for my skin!

7
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:16,568
If my beauty is ruined because of this,
it would be a serious loss for the universe,

8
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,059
wouldn't it, Zarkuro-<i>san</i>?

9
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:23,230
Huh? Where could he have gone?

10
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,571
Bulma-<i>san</i>, just a little more.

11
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:47,265
We did it! The sixth one!

12
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,266
One more to go!

13
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,602
Hooray! Hooray!

14
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:52,604
Hooray! Hooray!

15
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:53,764
What?

16
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:06,217
What is this!? I thought you were
going to keep this from happening!

17
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:09,448
If you're going to complain,
tell us later! Let's just hurry!

18
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,603
Kuririn, do something, quick!

19
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,935
Wah! Oh no!

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,878
Left! Left! Go left!

21
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,106
All right!

22
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,569
Ho, ho, not bad.

23
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,730
But they're finished now.

24
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,408
I guess we can relax now.

25
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,411
This is no time to relax!

26
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:59,264
Vegeta-<i>sama</i>, as powerful as you are,
you sure must have had a hard time of it.

27
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:03,268
As busted up as this
high-quality rubber protector is,

28
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:06,204
I'm surprised you came
back to us safely.

29
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:11,376
It would take quite a lot
for it to end up like this.

30
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,038
What in the world happened
to you on that planet Earth?

31
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,559
Is Freeza-<i>sama</i> around?

32
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,228
N- no, he has departed.

33
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,231
He's already gotten
tired of this planet, huh?

34
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,900
Um... Kewie-<i>sama</i>...

35
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,902
...said that he had something
to speak to you about,

36
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,239
and that you were to come to the training
room when your treatment was finished.

37
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:48,246
Ha! You tell him that I said " I've got
nothing to discuss with the likes of you."

38
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,577
B- but...

39
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,922
Vegeta-<i>sama</i>... um...
you've forgotten your Scouter.

40
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,414
I don't need that thing.
You can have it.

41
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,373
It's no good... I ain't able
to control my power at all...

42
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,718
Damn...

43
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,733
I've had it.

44
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:53,568
I ain't even able to perform the <i>Kaio-ken</i>
like this, let alone a <i>Genki Dama</i>.

45
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,058
Hurry up and do something!

46
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,428
Gohan, up there!

47
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:26,261
Right, understood!

48
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,512
An outlet?

49
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:09,180
Lucky! There's an outlet!

50
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,580
I see an outlet!

51
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,742
You're right!

52
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,770
That was close.

53
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,567
Okay, one more to go.

54
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,125
Right.

55
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:12,243
Say, Bulma-<i>san</i>, don't you think
this is a little bit strange?

56
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,578
What?

57
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:17,412
N- nothing, really.
Never mind.

58
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,928
It's almost time, huh?

59
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,418
Yeah.

60
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,103
It's just ahead.
We're nearly there.

61
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,064
Isn't this where we were before?

62
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,753
What's the matter?

63
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,253
We'll leave you behind.

64
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,935
It looks like the Dragon
Ball is in that lake.

65
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:07,115
There doesn't seem to be any doubt.

66
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,566
It has to be inside that stone figure.

67
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,240
Judging by all the other
events we've had up to now,

68
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,909
it doesn't look like this
is going to be easy, either.

69
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:30,248
It would be a relief if Lychee-<i>san</i>
or Zarkuro-<i>san</i> were here, huh?

70
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,916
What are you worrying about?

71
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,586
This one out here is going to be a simple
affair compared to the others, isn't it?

72
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,922
I don't see you
going out to get it.

73
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,257
One more to go.

74
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:42,927
One more, and then Kami-<i>sama</i>
and Piccolo can both come back to life.

75
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:43,928
Right.

76
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:44,929
But Bulma-<i>san</i>...

77
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:47,598
And once that happens,
the Dragon Balls will be restored,

78
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:48,933
and we can return to Earth,

79
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,926
and bring Yamucha, Tenshinhan
and everyone back to life, can't we?

80
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:59,941
Then we can all go back to our regular lives,
and Earth will be at peace, won't it?

81
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,941
Am I right?

82
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:10,953
Then I can put some makeup on, and go back
to being the usual beauty that I am, can't I?

83
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:17,024
Don't you boys forget that you're
on a mission to save Earth.

84
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,723
A- all right.

85
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:30,905
<i>One more to go, huh? One more, and then</i>
<i>Piccolo-san will come back to life!</i>

86
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,267
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

87
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:59,930
Help me! I can't move!

88
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,543
W- what's wrong, Gohan!?

89
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:10,548
Geez, this is no time to be
playing around, Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

90
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:14,552
I can't move! It's like I'm being
held by an incredible power!

91
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,042
Gohan!

92
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:47,251
There he is. Over there.

93
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:48,741
W- where?

94
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:54,752
What was Goku-<i>sa</i> doin'
in a place like this?

95
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:01,921
D- don't tell me he was
training in his condition...

96
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:06,765
He's so reckless...

97
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,051
<i>l'll head for Earth</i>
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

98
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,220
<i>l'm going to smash them</i>
<i>to pieces for sure this time.</i>

99
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,383
<i>No, before that,</i>
<i>l'll go to Planet Namek...</i>

100
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,395
Yo, Vegeta. I heard you had
yourself a rough time of it.

101
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,569
They said that both
Raditz and Nappa died.

102
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:43,574
To whom do the supposedly invincible
Saiyans owe the pleasure of this grief?

103
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:48,245
Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time
to entertain your inconsequential chitchat.

104
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,247
Now, just listen.

105
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:56,253
Freeza-<i>sama</i> is cross with you for the actions
you guys took without his permission.

106
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:59,416
He can't complain
about it if he's not here.

107
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,526
Now,

108
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,530
remove that filthy hand of yours.

109
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,869
Still, Freeza-<i>sama</i> is a magnanimous
gentleman. I hear he's going to forgive you.

110
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,872
That's because you've
discovered something wonderful.

111
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,539
What?

112
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:20,544
He was thrilled when he found out he might
be able to gain eternal youth and life.

113
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:25,216
What did you say!? Then, the place
that Freeza-<i>sama</i> departed for is-?

114
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,218
Planet Namek.

115
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,888
<i>Damn it! He listened in on our</i>
<i>conversation over the Scouters, huh?</i>

116
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,226
<i>l</i>- <i>l have to beat him to it somehow,</i>
<i>or l'll be that bastard's toady forever!</i>

117
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:39,897
I understand that you wanted those
Dragon Ball things to gain eternal life too,

118
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,899
but you'll have to give that up now.

119
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:48,239
Once Freeza-<i>sama</i> has his wish granted,
he's planning to exterminate the Namekians.

120
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,241
That bastard!

121
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,072
Hey! Vegeta!

122
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,402
Vegeta-<i>sama</i>!

123
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,518
Give me that!

124
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:03,419
It turns out I need it after all!

125
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,083
Vegeta!

126
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,363
I won't let you do this!
Those belong to me!

127
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:33,040
W- what are you doing? If you try anything
perverted, you're going to answer for it!

128
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:39,223
We're through playing around now.

129
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,558
Playing around?

130
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:42,560
Yeah.

131
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,892
That's right.

132
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:10,187
Sure enough, you guys...

133
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,417
...aren't Namekians!

134
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,193
That's right!

135
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:19,196
You're just now realizing it?

136
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,925
What!?

137
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,202
You don't mean-!

138
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:34,261
I- it can't be...

139
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,888
Are you sure you shouldn't
be rescuing him?

140
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:55,559
Those are man-eating nautili.
He'll be eaten if you leave him there.

141
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,061
Gohan!

142
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,790
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

143
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:21,251
<i>What's this? This world isn't</i>
<i>Planet Namek? Then, just what</i> is <i>it?</i>

144
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:26,924
<i>And who is this</i> "<i>Freeza</i>"
<i>that even Vegeta is afraid of?</i>

145
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:33,591
<i>The situation grows more tense.</i>
<i>What fates will everyone meet?</i>
