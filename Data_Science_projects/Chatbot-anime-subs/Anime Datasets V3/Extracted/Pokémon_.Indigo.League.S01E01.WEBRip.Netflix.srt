None of your business.

If you showed up on time,
you would have seen that

from Professor Oak.

in the Pokémon business, isn't it?

Thank you for coming out
to see history in the making!

Now I, Gary Oak, am off to learn
the ways of the Pokémon trainer!

84
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,415
I'll show you.

85
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,502
So you decided to show up after all.

86
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,547
Oh, Professor Oak.
Where's my Pokémon?

87
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,007
-Your Pokémon?
-Yes, I'm ready.

88
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,970
You look like you're ready for bed,
not for Pokémon training.

89
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,639
I hope you don't think you're going
to train in your pajamas.

90
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,892
Oh, no, Professor.
I got messed up this morning,

91
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:55,689
and I was a little late,
but believe me, I'm ready for a Pokémon.

92
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,279
I thought about it a lot
and it took me a long time

93
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,157
but I finally decided to choose Squirtle.
Oh!

94
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,785
Already taken by someone who was on time.

95
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,663
Oh, I wish I hadn't overslept.

96
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,668
But now I will choose as my Pokémon
Bulbasaur! What?

97
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,671
That one was also taken by a kid
who wasn't late.

98
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,132
Oh. Well, that's no problem

99
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,760
because my Pokémon will be Charmander!

100
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
-Ah!
-The early bird gets the worm

101
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,100
or in this case, the Pokémon.

102
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,061
Does that mean all the Pokémon are gone?

103
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,898
-Well, there is still one left--
-[gasps] Professor, I'll take it!

105
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,280
I think I should warn you.
There is a problem with this last one.

106
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,949
-I have to have a Pokémon.
-Well, in that case.

107

-[Professor] Its name is Pikachu.

-Oh, it's so cute. It's the best of all.
-You'll see.

110
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,720
-Oh, hi, Pikachu.
-Pika.

111
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,224
It's also known
as electric mouse.

112
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,228
It's usually shy but can sometimes
have an electrifying personality.

113
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,440
-I see what you mean.
-Shocking, isn't it?

114
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,152
Now, take these,
your Pokédex and Poké Balls.

115
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,906
-Thank you.
-You're welcome!

-Mom.
-Oh, Ash, I'm so proud of you.

119
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,045
You're finally going to fulfill your dream
and start your Pokémon training.

120
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,298
But I'm going to miss you so much.

121
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,883
[sobs] Oh, my little boy.

123
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,889
I packed your sneakers and jeans,
nice clean shirts and underwear,

124
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,767
and your favorite snacks and some hot
chocolate in case you want something hot

125
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,521
but be careful not to burn yourself and
a pair of rubber gloves to do your laundry

126
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,982
and a new clothesline to hang it
out to dry--

127
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,527
Mom, you're embarrassing me
in front of all these people.

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,362
Don't you know I'm a big kid now?

129
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,614
Pokémon trainers can take care
of themselves.

130
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,908
I understand. Hmm?

131
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,577
-That's your Pokémon?
-Pikachu.

132
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,913
[Ash] Yeah, that's my Pokémon!
-Pi.

133
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:22,377
Ugh. With Pikachu at my side,
I'll get all the Pokémon in the world!

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,424
I thought all Pokémon stayed inside
their Poké Ball. Why doesn't this one?

00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:32,095

Oh, you're playing catch.
You're friends already.

Uh, sure.

will come in handy!

-Why?
-Rubber blocks electricity.

Hooray!

151
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,434
Don't forget to change your underwear
every single day.

-Okay.
-Pikachu.

[sighs]

155
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,747
Pikachu, are you going to be like this
the whole way?

156
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,706
Pi.

157
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,710
- Is it because you don't like me?
- Pika, pika.

158
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,170
Well, I like you a lot.

159
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,090
And since you're the Pokémon
I'm training,

160
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,841
don't you think
you could be a little nicer

161
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,594
and just open your mouth
and tell me what's wrong?

162
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,847
[squeaks]
That's not exactly what I meant.

163
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,101
- Is your name all you can say?
- Pika.

164
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,979
Well, then, you're just like all Pokémon
and you should act like one

165
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,566
and get inside the Poké Ball
just like it says in the Pokédex.

166
