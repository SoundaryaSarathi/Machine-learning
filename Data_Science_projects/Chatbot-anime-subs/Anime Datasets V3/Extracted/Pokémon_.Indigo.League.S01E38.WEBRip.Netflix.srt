00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,386
Pika. Pika, pika.

167
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,225
Well I never thought
I'd live to see this day,

168
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,185
even with nine lives.

169
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,896
Team Rocket and Team Twerp
working together.

170
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,023
Pika. Pika, pika.

171
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,484
-Pika, pika.
-[James] Okay, hoist away!

172
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,115
Steady. Keep it up. Keep it up.

173
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
We've got it now.

174
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,706
[creaking]

175
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,332
Just a bit further.

176
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,919
-Ah!
-Whoa!

177
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,548
-[all groan]
-The cables were too weak to lift Snorlax.

178
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,091
I knew this wouldn't work.

179
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,969
Yeah, we should have known
Team Rocket would mess things up.

180
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,680
-What did you say?
-Well, it's the truth.

181
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,391
Nothing makes me angrier
than being told the truth.

182
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,647
[Meowth groans]

183
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,026
It looks like we're going to have
to wake up Snorlax after all.

184
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,279
[alarm rings]

185
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,865
-Pika. Pika.
-An alarm clock doesn't work.

186
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,535
Let's see it sleep through this. Ha!

187
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,874
-That's sure to do it.
-Nothing could sleep through that.

188
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,417
[snoring]

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,793
[both sob]

190
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,380
-It's not waking up.
-But why not?

191
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,010
Ah! I've got it.
In the story of Sleeping Beauty,

192
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,596
the beautiful princess,
with whom I identify,

193
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,890
was awakened by the kiss
of a noble prince.

194
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,183
[James] Jessie, that's it.

195
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,478
Snorlax might just wake
with a kiss from a noble Pokémon.

196
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,272
Hey, that might just work.

197
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,067
All right, everyone.
Pick your noblest Pokémon,

198
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,985
-and we'll try it.
-Okay!

199
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,574
It's supposed to be
a noble Pokémon, right?

200
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:26,162
-Yeah, whatever that means.
-What about Misty's Horsea?

201
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah, that's right.
It's like a prince's horse.

202
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,460
What? You want Horsea to kiss that?

203
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,880
-It has to. Horsea's our best bet.
-No fair.

204
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,841
Horsea, Horsea. I think this is--

205
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,888
Psyduck? Psy!

206
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,057
-[both] Ah!
-Oh, no!

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,270
-Duck!
-Ah! You dimwit duck!

208
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,649
-There's nothing noble about you!
-Psy, psy, psy.

209
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,944
Psy? Psy?

210
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,866
Brock, which Pokémon
do you think they'll try?

211
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,536
The same ones they always do.

212
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:11,332
-Snorlax will have nightmares.
-Those lips would give me nightmares too.

213
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,169
-Our noble Pokémon...
-[both] Ta-da!

214
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,298
Meowth is the only one with a kiss
powerful enough to wake Snorlax.

215
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,343
[James]
Give it a big wet one, fella.

216
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,972
Why do I have to be the one to kiss
that big lummox?

217
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,767
[chuckles] So we can bring that Snorlax
back to the boss.

218
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,353
Hey, you don't look half bad, Meowth.

219
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,315
-[Meowth] Keep your eyes to yourself.
-Pikachu.

220
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,942
Pucker up.

221
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,280
-Give it a smack attack right on the lips.
-Disgusting. I quit. No way!

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,492
The hygiene! Mwah!

223
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,997
-[groans]
-Lax.

224
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,666
-Is it?
-That kiss may've done it!

225
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,127
[snoring]

226
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,463
It looks like it's been poisoned.

227
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,882
How'd you look
if you got kissed by Meowth?

228
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,425
I'd look for a new mouth.

229
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,013
Hey! Wake up, you big lump!
Hiyah!

230
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,475
[screaming]

231
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,144
-[groans]
-[Ash] Huh?

232
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,772
[grunting]

233
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,860
-What'd you find, Ash?
-It says, "Do not disturb."

234
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,654
It's like those signs
you hang on hotel doors.

235
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,656
-Turn it over, Ash.
-Huh?

236
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,036
"In case of emergency,
please use a Poké flute to wake."

237
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,955
-[Misty] A Poké flute?
-That's right. Now I remember.

238
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,334
I heard once that you play a Poké flute
to wake up a Snorlax.

239
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,627
A Poké flute?

240
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,174
<i>The Poké flute is used</i>
<i>to wake sleeping Pokémon.</i>

241
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,552
<i>Snorlax will only awaken to this flute.</i>

242
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,638
-Huh?
-Oh!

243
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,599
It looks just like the one
that old hippie had.

244
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,645
-Come on. Let's go find him.
-Pika!

245
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,857
-Poké flute?
-Hippie? Huh?

246
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:05,488
[Poké flute playing]

247
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,074
-[both] The music man!
-[grunting]

248
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,160
-Oh, no. We've let them get ahead of us.
-Let's hurry.

249
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,205
Wait for me!

250
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,169
-Hmm?
-[all yelling]

251
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,379
Pika!

252
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,924
-What's the rush, dudes?
-Ah, thank goodness you're still here.

253
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,302
Please, sir.
We have a favor to ask of you.

254
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,805
-Ask away.
-Just come with us.

255
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,724
-Hey, hey. Chill out, my friend.
-[all] Wait, wait, wait!

256
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,147
-Hi, again. Please come with us.
-We really need your help.

257
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,483
Hey, let go of him right now.
We got here first.

258
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,486
-The first are the worst.
-[all grunting]

259
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,613
If you don't stop,
you'll both get half of me.

260
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,159
Enough of this. Arbok, go!

261
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,292
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

262
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,544
[screeching]

263
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,671
Pidgeotto, gust attack now!

264

[screeching]

265
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,263
[all grunting and screaming]

266
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:17,518
[all] Team Rocket's gusting off again!

267
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,480
Great. Now's our chance.

268
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:26,444
[snores]

269
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,530
Please play your Poké flute
to wake this Snorlax.

270
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,409
Hey, you've gotten a lot bigger
since I saw you last, Snorlax.

271
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,828
Your girth is blowing my mind.

272
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,080
You mean you know this Snorlax?

273
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,833
I don't just know it.
This Snorlax is mine.

274
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,668
This little dude loves to snooze.

275
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:48,132
I can't even take it for a walk.
I just come to wake it up once a month.

276
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,759
Huh?

277
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,220
I'm running a little late this month,
though.

278
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,515
Your Snorlax is stopping the water
from flowing into town.

279
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,268
-We've got to move it out of the way.
-No problem. I can do it.

280
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,566
[Poké flute playing]

281
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,323
Snorlax.

-Pikachu.
-Lax, lax, lax.

285
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,795
-Snorlax.
-[Brock] I guess that did it.

286
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:32,969
[footsteps pounding]

287
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,638
[Hippie] Later, Snorlax.

288
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,849
[Misty]
Look, the water still isn't coming out.

289
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,102
[Brock] Ah, look at that.

290
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,145
[Misty] Oh, not more thorns.

291
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,274
That means we'll have to clear out
all of these thorns

292
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,485
before the river can start flowing
into town again.

293
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,820
What a job.

294
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,613
-[bushes rustling]
-[all] Huh?

295
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:58,578
[munching loudly]

296
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:03,124
Chow down, Snorlax.
Looks like you got a case of the munchies.

297
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,545
-Look, it's eating the thorns.
-Thorns are Snorlax's favorite snack item.

298
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:13,134
<i>Snorlax's hunger isn't satisfied</i>
<i>until it consumes 900 pounds of food.</i>

299
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>Then it goes back to sleep.</i>

300
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,012
Back to sleep?

301
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,111
Look, guys.
The river's back to normal again.

302
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,404
Pika!

303
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,960
Thank goodness.
The river's flowing just like before.

304
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,337
How can we thank you?

305
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,757
-It wasn't just us.
-The Snorlax helped out too.

306
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,219
This calls for a celebration.
We'll hold a special banquet.

307
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,055
-[Misty and Ash] All right!
-Okay!

308

-[all laughing]
-Pika. Pika!

309
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,939
[groans]
I'm getting tired of always being beaten.

310
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,026
I'm as tired as Snorlax.

311
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,113
Hey there. What happened to Snorlax?

312
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:21,243
<i>Mi amigo, </i>Snorlax ate all those thorns,
and it's copping some Z's.

313
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,329
It went back to sleep?

314
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,290
Mm-hm.
It'll be a while before it wakes up.

315
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,002
-About how long?
-Well, let's see.

316
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,963
This one wakes up about once a moon.
