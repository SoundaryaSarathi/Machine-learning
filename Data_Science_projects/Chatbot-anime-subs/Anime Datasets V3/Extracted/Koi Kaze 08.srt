1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,100
Dew frost

17
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,200
The conference members are basically selected after we do a strict examination.

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,700
There really aren't any suspicious people, so to say...

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
or any people with problems.

20
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,400
If there are any conflicts between two members,

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
we'll take responsibility...

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,200
It was a job I just chose to do,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,200
because employment opportunities were limited for a third-class university graduate.

24
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
Or so I thought.

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,400
Or I was trying to make myself think.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,200
In truth, I wanted to experience people's happiness,

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,000
I wanted to experience people's sadness.

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,500
I wanted to place myself somewhere where people encounter and separate.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:56,000
If I kept doing that, I thought I'd be able to do the same someday...

30
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,300
From now on, I want you to help me with the house chores more often than before, okay?

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,300
I feel kind of bad doing this to you since there's such a large age difference.

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,700
What's wrong? You don't seem too happy.

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
You're finally going to be a big brother...

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh, isn't it almost time?

35
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600
One more month.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
You're a big brother now, aren't you, Ko-chan?

37
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,300
Yes! We did it, Koshiro!

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,700
Congratulations, it's a girl.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,700
It was a kind of a happy, yet scary, feeling.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,200
But that was the only time I had that feeling.

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm home.

42
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,800
What is it?

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
What do you want?!

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
Hey, wait...

45
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,700
My, my, what's going on?

46
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,500
Come on, what's the matter?

47
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Ugh... Not again.

48
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,700
Now, now, don't cry, don't cry.

49
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,400
It's not my fault!

50
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,400
Here.

51
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
Which is it?!

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,000
You aren't bullying her while we're out, are you?

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,100
Nanoka seems to be afraid of you!

54
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,600
Who cares!

55
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,500
You're so helpless.

56
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
It wasn't me!

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
That's not it.

58
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
Will you come to the other room?

59
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,900
It's not that we're quarreling with each other,

60
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,900
or we got into a big fight or anything.

61
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,200
It's just...

62
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,300
We thought we should live separately before that happens.

63
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900
That's right.

64
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,700
We're sorry that we have to make you go through the sadness.

65
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,600
We're really sorry about that.

66
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Even though we'll be living apart,

67
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,500
it doesn't mean I'll stop being your mother,

68
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,100
or that she's no longer your sister.

69
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
We're still family.

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah.

71
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:56,000
I thought divorces weren't such peaceful things in my mind as a child, but...

72
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,600
I could tell that mom and dad were trying to separate peacefully for me.

73
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,400
Well, we should get going.

74
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,300
Koshiro, keep an eye on the house for me.

75
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

76
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Bye now.

77
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Don't look so sulky forever.

78
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Be more honest with yourself, okay?

79
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah.

80
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,200
You can come any time.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
Good work.

82
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
What, you've been going home early lately.

83
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,100
What?

84
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
He must want to see Nanoka-san as soon as possible.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm so envious!

86
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,700
No way. He's not you.

87
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I love you, brother.

88
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,000
Why is it that I even headed there?

89
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,700
Without even understanding it myself,

90
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,100
I was walking in the town that she grew up in without me knowing.

91
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,500
My!

92
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
So you finally came to my house.

93
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
How did you know?

94
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Of course I'd know!

95
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
It's you, Koshiro!

96
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,300
I thought you would've forgotten my face.

97
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,300
Did you forget my face?

98
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,700
See? Even if we haven't seen each other for years, that's how it is between a  parent and child.

99
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
And?

100
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,500
What's the matter?

101
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
Did something happen?

102
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
Why?

103
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,200
You just suddenly came. There must be some reason, isn't there?

104
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,100
No reason. I just felt like it.

105
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
Really?

106
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
From when she was a child...

107
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
Oh.

108
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
She just loves bears.

109
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,100
She really is your younger sister, that kid.

110
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,000
You exchanged dolls, I heard.

111
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Nanoka was talking about it so happily when she came back during summer vacation.

112
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,700
Why did you send her over to our house?

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,700
When you took her with you when you got divorced,

114
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
why would you suddenly bring her back to dad?

115
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Because she got into a high school near your house.

116
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,100
Are you serious?

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,700
I'd feel bad if she had to commute two hours each way every day.

118
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,800
What? What's the matter?

119
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,900
It's nothing.

120
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,400
What? did you come all the way over just to sulk?

121
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,500
What are you doing?

122
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
Here, come with me.

123
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,800
What is it?

124
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,700
How many years has it been since I last cut your hair?

125
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,900
I forgot.

126
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,600
You wouldn't let me cut much after you became a big brother.

127
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
What were you getting all worked up about?

128
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Big brother.

129
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
What?

130
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
She isn't bothering you?

131
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,600
Saying, big brother, big brother, big brother...

132
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
How do you know?

133
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Well, you see...

134
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,500
I wonder what my brother is like?

135
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,200
I want to meet him soon.

136
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,400
I wonder if he'll help me with studying.

137
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,400
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.

138
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,800
He will help you, I'm sure, with your studies.

139
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,900
Yeah!

140
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:01,800
She probably really wanted to live with you guys... or just you.

141
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh...

142
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,400
So take good care of her, okay?

143
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,900
Zenzou-san is no good when you really need him.

144
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,100
Okay...

145
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,900
What? You better have a more firm character.

146
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,600
You're a big brother, aren't you?

147
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,600
Hey.

148
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,700
What would you do if I made her unhappy?

149
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
What?

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,800
If I somehow made her unhappy,

151
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,300
what would you do?

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,200
If such a thing happened,

153
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,600
I wouldn't let you off with nothing.

154
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,400
Of course.

155
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Odd child.

156
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You still don't seem to be very honest with yourself.

157
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,100
Really?

158
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,900
It means you haven't grown up at all.

159
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
You'd better be stronger.

160
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
It's the most difficult phase

161
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
at that age.

162
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,900
Why don't you stay a little longer, since its been a while?

163
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,200
How can I?

164
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
I have work tomorrow too.

165
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
You have to eat properly.

166
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Okay.

167
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Oh yes. Nanoka's flavoring is usually a little too strong,

168
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
so tell her to be careful.

169
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Yeah, I got it.

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,000
And don't give her too much allowance.

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
I wouldn't give her any even if she begged.

172
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,100
And tell her not to stay up too late.

173
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,700
I got it already. I'll be late for my train.

174
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,600
But...

175
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,500
I know.

176
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,200
I understand.

177
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
Thank you, Koshiro.

178
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,100
Okay, bye.

179
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Get along well as siblings, okay?

180
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,900
Yeah.

181
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm back.

182
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Welcome home, brother.

183
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,100
I'm... home.

184
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Want some?

185
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay.

186
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
You're not going to cry?

187
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Eh?

188
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,500
No, nothing.

189
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
Hey, brother?

190
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
Where did you go today?

191
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,700
Somewhere.

192
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,400
What?

193
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,500
Just for a walk.

194
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
To where?

195
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Somewhere.

196
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,900
You should've taken me too.

197
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
I'm fine with being big brother.

198
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Siblings that get along well is fine.

199
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,500
If that's the role that I was given,

200
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
I'll do what I must.

201
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
So...

202
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Don't you have to get up early tomorrow?

203
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

204
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,500
But you too, brother.

205
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,100
I'll take a smoke and then go to sleep.

206
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,200
So go to sleep.

207
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Okay.

208
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,400
I'll do it.

209
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,300
Good night then.

210
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,200
Yeah.

211
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,300
So don't say that you love me.

212
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,410
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

213
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

214
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,340
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

215
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,810
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

216
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,900
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

217
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,300
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

218
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,880
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

219
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,130
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

220
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,570
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

221
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,370
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

222
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,780
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

223
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,150
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

224
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,650
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

225
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,770
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

226
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,560
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

227
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,230
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

228
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,020
I'm Nanoka's father Zenzou, who isn't any good when I'm needed most.

229
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,260
Unable to stand that inconsiderate part of Makei-san, I resorted to this.

230
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,340
Excrete red ball punishment!
