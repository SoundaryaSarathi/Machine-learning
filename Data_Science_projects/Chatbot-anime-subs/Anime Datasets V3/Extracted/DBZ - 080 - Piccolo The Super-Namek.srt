00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,060
"The Tide Suddenly Turned!! Piccolo,
the Warrior Who Came Late"

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,690
What's wrong?

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,030
Vegeta, aren't you coming to help him?

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,740
Looks as though your legs are trembling,
and you can't move.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,780
Well, you just wait there patiently
a little while longer.

6
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm about to smother the breath
of life from this one.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,150
After which it will be your turn.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,430
l- I don't care if the kid dies, I'm just wondering what
I'm supposed to do. Freeza's power is beyond imagination!

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,670
Pic... colo... - San...

10
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,630
Gohan's Ki is disappearing quickly.
H- He's dying! Dammit!

11
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,170
I can't wait until I've completely recovered
from my injuries!

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Gohan's Ki has all but disappeared!

13
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,510
You're the only one that ever freely
associated with me.

14
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,150
Before I realized what had happened,
you found your way into my heart,

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,930
and made yourself a place there large
enough that I was unable to drive you out.

16
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,430
Stay alive, Gohan!

17
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,980
Is there nothing I can do? If I
don't act, I'll be next!

18
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,430
Gohan, just hang on. I'll be right there.

19
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Now the big finish!

20
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,310
H- How can he be... !?

21
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,090
He was supposed to have been at least
critically wounded!

22
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,700
W- Why!?

23
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,440
Kienzan!

24
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,620
Kuririn...

25
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,950
Kuririn's Ki has been restored!
What's going on?

26
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,880
If you don't like it, come on over here!

27
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,210
Come and paddle my bum!

28
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,820
Why you...
How dare you make a fool of me!

29
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,120
Th- There's no way I can stand against
him. I'll just have to keep running away.

30
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,870
Somehow, I've got to keep him a little
bit further away from Gohan.

31
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,410
Oh no!

32
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,630
All right...

33
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,130
You will not die easily. I'll take you
apart with my own hands.

34
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,560
Damn.

35
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,430
Fool.

36
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,310
Now, come on out!

37
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,010
That was close!

38
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,110
I don't know how it is you recovered,

39
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,140
but you dared to clip the tail of
Freeza-sama, didn't you?

40
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,350
I'm going to knock you into so many
pieces, you'll never recover again!

41
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,810
Now I've done it!

42
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,130
Damn!

43
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,180
No matter how you struggle, you will
not escape my grasp.

44
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,300
Looks like you're about out of breath.
I'll tear you to bits with my bare hands!

45
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,170
Come on out!

46
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,400
Die!

47
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,260
Taiyo-ken!

48
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,510
M- My eyes!

49
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,230
Thank goodness! You're not dead!

50
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,370
I'll heal you right now!

51
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,640
R- Rotten Earthling! Calling me out here
for such a vain struggle...

52
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,320
Vegeta, now! Attack him!

53
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,100
S- So that's what's going on!

54
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,040
What are you doing, Vegeta!?

55
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,050
Great! Gohan's been healed!

56
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,490
Why did you guys keep silent about
the Namekian kid having that ability!?

57
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,990
We didn't keep silent! We didn't
know about it either! If we had known,
we would have him heal Goku already!

58
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,210
It doesn't hurt at all any more!

59
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,640
You surprised me, Dende! Thanks.

60
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,010
Not at all. Good luck!

61
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,350
Shoot! Why you... !

62
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,820
W- What's this!?

63
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:43,140
True to the Saiyan blood that he carries, now that he's recovered,
his battle power has increased greatly!

64
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,020
Gohan...

65
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,790
All right! Slight though it may be,

66
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,000
fate has somewhat turned to our favor. With the three of
us fighting now, something may turn out.

67
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,800
Impossible! That runt has been revived! And he
should have been on the brink of death!

68
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,440
Now! Shoot him!

69
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,170
You guys just don't know
when you're beaten.

70
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,500
How many times have I told you that neither
Earthlings or Saiyans are a match for me?

71
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,380
Dammit.

72
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,710
Have we had it?

73
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,350
I'm not giving up! How can I
possibly give up!?

74
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,720
Whether we've had it or not, there's
nothing we can do but try!

75
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,050
Gohan!

76
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,060
You fool! Stop!

77
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,450
Piccolo-san!

78
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,640
Thank goodness! We've been waiting
for you, Piccolo-san!

80
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,070
So that's Freeza, is it?

81
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,700
Yes!

82
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,890
Indeed. He really is an incredible beast.

83
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,930
Well, if it isn't the guy we slaughtered
back on Earth.

84
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,240
So, I need not wonder what you wished
for with the Dragonballs.

85
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,780
I see you brought this good-for-nothing
scum back to life with them.

86
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,910
That "scum" line was uncalled-for. And I
want you to remember something.

87
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,010
I want you to remember that after I put
Freeza away, your turn comes next.

88
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,490
After you put Freeza away, you're
coming for me?

89
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,330
I didn't think you Namekians were capable
of telling jokes.

90
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,110
It's no use! No matter how much Piccolo may have
gained from training at Kaio-sama's place,

91
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,140
Freeza's on a completely different dimension
from the rest of us!

92
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,110
There's still a surviving Namekian, is there?

93
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,180
But there's something different about
you from the other Namekians.

94
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,560
There seems to be something special about you.
And even so, you are still utterly no match for me.

95
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,080
Who is it? Who has arrived? I don't know.
I can't tell whose Ki that is.

96
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,680
Piccolo? No, can't be. It couldn't be. The
Ki's too great to be Piccolo's.

97
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,550
Gohan's Ki has recovered as well. I don't
get anything that's going on!

98
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,040
Now, to clean up the dregs of the universe.

99
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,910
I'll do this by myself. You guys stay out of it.

100
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,220
That person they call Piccolo, he looks
just like Nail-san!

101
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,130
Take shelter somewhere, Dende! You'll
get caught in our crossfire.

102
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,300
Do it quickly!

103
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,100
How does he know my name?

104
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,950
Piccolo-san!

105
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,400
It's senseless! Not even Piccolo has a
chance of winning against that guy!

106
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,530
He may have a glib tongue, but so long as he
doesn't realize his opponent's battle power,

107
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,070
I wouldn't count on him.

108
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,670
Everyone has stopped moving. Now
what's going on!?

109
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,710
Who is it that just showed up with the
enormous Ki?

110
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:14,670
Piccolo finally arrives at the scene of battle.
His challenge to Freeza may be thought of as reckless.

111
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,680
Does Piccolo indeed have a chance of winning?
And what about Goku?

112
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:33,680
