1
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,340
Kitty, come on, come here.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,580
It's time. Let's go back to the lab.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,590
Ashikabi? Ku's big brother?

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,760
Yes. If you're a good girl,
you will meet him for sure.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,630
Really? For sure?

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,460
Yes. For sure.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,030
Kusano!

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,370
You guys!

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,380
No!

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,450
No, Kusano!

11
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,720
Help me...

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,580
Now my life is blooming then falling

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
I grab destiny tight

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,990
There's no more hesitation anymore

15
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,590
Tying our bond

16
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,590
To the sky waiting for the dawn

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,430
Holding you, my love, tightly

18
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,600
I present an unbreakable prayer

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
We all are still in the darkness

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Right now I just

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Want to touch you deep in your heart

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,620
And give you all of my overflowing passion

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,120
I spread out my wings

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,290
Toward the future of our dreams

25
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,630
On them are engraved

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,630
The feeling you gave me that day

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,130
The words of our oath

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,300
Will make a miracle happen

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,300
My pounding heart, take off now!

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,340
My wish can fly high, high up

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,880
Feather 3:
"The Green Girl"

32
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,260
I don't feel like I slept
well because of that dream.

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,500
Ku-chan?

34
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,170
Ah, good morning.

35
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,510
Mu-Musubi-chan, that outfit...

36
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,570
This is easy to move in.

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,940
Well... It's true that's
what they're designed for...

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,760
lai Sword technique?

39
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,660
That's amazing!

40
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,240
Ah, good morning.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,540
"Sparkle, Sparkle, Sparkle..."

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:33,680
"Sparkle, Sparkle, Sparkle..."
Landlady-sama!

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
Landlady-sama!

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Ah! Musubi-chan!

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,470
Would you please spar with me?

46
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,880
I won't be easy on you.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,550
That's what I want!

48
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,960
A sparring?! Wait!

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,010
Here I come!

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,560
Wait!

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,730
Heh, look at 'em go.

52
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,240
Uzume-san, please stop them!

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,910
It's fine, it's fine. Miya's used to it.

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,910
Your sides are open.

55
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,580
Ouch!

56
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,580
Your sides are open because you
put too much strength into your shoulders.

57
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,250
Be more relaxed and let
your strength flow naturally.

58
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,920
Yes, Ma'am!

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,590
See, they seem to be having fun.

60
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,930
By the way, those gym clothes...
Is that what you're into?

61
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,300
No! My younger sister
misunderstood and brought them...

62
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,940
She's so full of energy...

63
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,110
Someday, we must fight each
other anyway, no matter what we want.

64
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,610
Must fight?

65
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,950
Because we are... Sekireis.

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,280
Miya, I'm starving!

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,680
Oops! I start work today!

68
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,690
"Safety First"

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,300
Okay. Time for lunch!

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,420
This is tough...

71
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,640
Sahashi-san, here's your lunch.

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,140
The landlady's hand-made lunch...

73
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,640
Wow! This is great, Landlady!

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,440
Thank you very much.

75
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,320
Yo!

76
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,250
H-Hello...

77
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,990
Would you... like one?

78
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,260
Yeah? Thanks, man.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This taste...

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,340
What is it?

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Nothing...
Are you a college student, youngster?

82
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
No, I'm trying to be. And you?

83
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,080
Me? A college student,
but in my sixth year...

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,010
Well, I don't go to school at all though.

85
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,680
Oh! That fried chicken looks delicious.

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
If you want to, please go ahead.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,980
Thanks, man...

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Seo, you bastard!

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,690
Ah, Hikari-chan.

90
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,030
Don't give me that!
You're sponging food off of people again!

91
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,370
How embarrassing!

92
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,030
I'm so sorry. This guy is really...

93
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,370
Oh, no, it's nothing...

94
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,500
Huh?

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,600
The lightning women!

96
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,390
My lunch...
My lunch the landlady made for me...

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,720
Sorry...

98
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,220
You were the one shaking
him down for it in the first place!

99
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,730
Um... We bought some
bread, so let's eat together.

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,060
I'm sorry. Our master
doesn't have any bad intentions.

101
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Your master?

102
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,030
Man, what a small world!

103
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,070
To think we'd see another
Ashikabi in a place like this.

104
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,070
Idiot! Where are you touching?!

105
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm their Ashikabi, Kaoru Seo.

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
You're so annoying!

107
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,750
The abnormally growing plants are to be
exterminated today by the capital and MBI.

108
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,420
What is all this about?

109
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm sorry. That idiot e-mailed the
Ashikabis before I was aware of it.

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,000
E-mailed?

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,270
"There is a Sekirei in the arboretum.
First one there wins."

112
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,600
"It could be you who
makes the Green Girl emerge."

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,440
Are you even listening?

114
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,110
Hello?

115
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,440
What about all the effort I spent

116
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,110
watching her day and night so
nobody could get close to her?

117
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,120
Because of that, I may fall from
the number one status this month.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,450
I get it, I get it.

119
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,950
I'll accompany you at work,
or whatever you want.

120
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,460
So please, protect that girl.

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,630
I'll do my best.

122
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,800
And tell Minaka: Someday, the fire
that burned lzanami will burn him out, too.

123
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,800
That guy can't understand
such literary expressions.

124
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,330
Then just tell him straight...
that I'll kill him someday.

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,150
Another Ashikabi...

126
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,650
So, since you are here,
that means you also got the message, right?

127
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,490
Eh?

128
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,820
Don't pretend you
don't know. The Green Girl.

129
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,050
The Green Girl?

130
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,670
Oh, more MBI...

131
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,170
Hey, we're done for today.
You guys can leave now.

132
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,510
Already? What happened?

133
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,170
It's those guys.

134
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,840
There's an evacuation order for a two
kilometer radius around the arboretum.

135
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,710
An evacuation order?

136
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,820
I see...

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,760
Hey, how about we go see the Green Girl?

138
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Oh dear. Dinner's not ready, yet.

139
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,540
Um... Is Minato-san?

140
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,550
Sahashi-san? Now that you
mention it, he hasn't come back yet.

141
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,220
Musubi-san? Is anything wrong?

142
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,550
Ah... Minato-san forgot this.

143
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,890
His cell phone?

144
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,560
I feel uneasy... I've never felt like this.

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I will bring this to Minato-san.

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,900
Musubi-san.

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,230
Yes?

148
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,570
I'll put a spell on you.

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,900
May gods and goddesses protect you.

150
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,930
Thank you!

151
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,080
Hey youngster! Let's go!

152
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,590
Y-Yes!

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:57,010
Dear Mom...
I've gotten in with bad company...

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,760
"Here / Convenience store /
Bank / Restaurant"

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:02,830
"Here / Convenience store /
Bank / Restaurant"
Ah... It should be around here.

156
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,930
Ah... It should be around here.

157
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,770
Eh?

158
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:06,930
"Today's work has finished.
- Construction Inc."
Eh?

159
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,400
"Today's work has finished.
- Construction Inc."

160
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,270
Minato-san.

161
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,620
It's like a jungle here.

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,980
We got in, but I have no
idea where we should go.

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,160
Ku-chan?

164
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,570
You are over there?

165
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,970
Ku-chan!

166
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,310
What's that, youngster?
Do you have a crush on me?

167
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,450
I'm sorry!

168
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,720
She was wearing a
white dress, wasn't she?

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,650
Did you also see her, Seo-san?

170
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,120
- Could you see it?
- Nope.

171
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Is she the one inside here?

172
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,660
I don't know.

173
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,650
But I must go.

174
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,330
She was crying all alone. So I must go.

175
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,970
I just came to see what would
happen here, but I've changed my mind.

176
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,970
I'll see you and the Green Girl through.

177
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,010
How flashy...

178
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,350
Who the hell did this? Invading
from the front gate openly like this.

179
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,020
Oh dear, long time no see, Homura-san.

180
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,690
The ringleader herself.

181
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,360
Number 43, Yomi!

182
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
You call me the "ringleader"?
That's not nice.

183
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,030
I just came to receive her, since
the first one wins... The Green Girl.

184
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,040
I can't hand over number 108 to somebody
who says things like "the first one wins."

185
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,040
How nauseating! You're just a
rogue Sekirei acting like a guardian.

186
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
Akitsu!

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Your opponent is this girl.

188
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,390
Now, excuse me!

189
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,550
Wait!

190
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,890
Your opponent is me.

191
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,730
That's my master's wish.

192
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,290
If I don't complete the task,
I'll get thrown away... again...

193
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,400
The Sekirei symbol on her forehead...

194
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,270
Are you... a discarded number?

195
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,080
Ah, it's Kagari-san!

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,750
Oh, I made a mistake.
Kagari-san doesn't wear a mask.

197
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,550
I'm sorry!

198
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,090
Wh-What?

199
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,560
Take care of your cold.

200
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,100
Do you have a cold?

201
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
No!

202
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,040
If I catch a cold,
it'll be after fighting against you.

203
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,110
How much do you know about Sekireis?

204
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,780
Um...

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,110
Since you are an Ashikabi, you
know how to make Sekireis yours...

206
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,120
How to let them to emerge, don't you?

207
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Eh... emerge?

208
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,760
In short, it's the mucosal contact.

209
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,560
Usually, a Sekirei reacts to the DNA
of someone with Ashikabi aptitude,

210
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,130
and makes the contact from her side.

211
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,130
So, under normal conditions, a
Sekirei finds her own Ashikabi by herself.

212
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,970
The trouble is that Ashikabi
can force a Sekirei to emerge.

213
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,780
Even if the Sekirei doesn't want to.

214
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,810
If she doesn't want to?

215
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,510
So there are some creepy guys
who force Sekireis to emerge,

216
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,220
to increase the number they possess.

217
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,490
Ah, um... Seo-san, did you?

218
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,160
Do you think they'd
let anybody force them?

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,650
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,860
If you are the human who
was called by the Green Girl,

221
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,170
and are supposed to be her Ashikabi...

222
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,200
You gotta teach those dumbasses a lesson:

223
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,200
That there's no such thing as
"the first one wins" in destiny.

224
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,760
Big brother?

225
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,190
So this is where you've been hiding?

226
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,360
Now, come on. Your master is waiting.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,870
Hey, why are we running?

228
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,540
I got a sudden feeling that I must run!

229
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,980
What are we doing?

230
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,710
Geez, hurry up!

231
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,220
No!

232
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,380
I came all the way out
here personally to get you!

233
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,590
Stubborn children like
you must be punished.

234
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,850
Ku-chan!

235
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,570
What the heck?
You pervert! Get away from me!

236
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,910
I won't!

237
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,240
Hey! Where are you touching?!

238
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,910
Enough!

239
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,610
Yo, weakling, stay still!

240
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,600
Huh?

241
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,740
Why me, too?

242
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,090
You two!

243
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,260
Hikari and Hibiki, the girls with a
good-for-nothing sponger of an Ashikabi!

244
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
Shut up, nasty woman!

245
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,930
He's much better than your
good-looking, smart and rich Ashikabi!

246
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,270
Hikari, that's not even sour grapes...

247
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,940
I have no idea what is what...

248
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,000
Big brother...

249
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,950
We finally meet.

250
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,820
Ku's... big brother.

251
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,290
Ku-chan!

252
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,290
You, perverted guy over there!

253
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,290
Get away from her.

254
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,030
She's the Sekirei my
master's had his eyes on!

255
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,860
Hikari!

256
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,140
Musubi-chan!

257
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
Minato-san!

258
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,310
Oh, she's the youngster's Sekirei, huh?

259
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,250
Let go!

260
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,450
It's dangerous to swing
around a blade like this!

261
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,660
Let's break it.
Bam!

262
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,720
Ah! My precious death scythe!

263
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Why are you?

264
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,670
Here. You forgot this.

265
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,330
Did you come all the way
here to bring this to me?

266
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,740
Unforgivable... Absolutely unforgivable!

267
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,800
Musubi-chan!

268
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,020
Nice expression!

269
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,640
Here's payback!

270
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,890
You're so easy!

271
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,870
Ohhh! What nice tits!

272
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,370
Those are too good for that youngster
who is preparing for a entrance exam.

273
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,990
Seo...

274
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Well, aren't you a fine sight!

275
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,210
This pathetic pervert is your Ashikabi?

276
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,950
Impossible!
Such a dumb and dull looking man!

277
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,380
Someone like you would never
understand what's good about Minato-san!

278
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,620
For such a pathetic pervert Ashikabi,
a pathetic looking Sekirei fits well!

279
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,070
What should we do? Back them up?

280
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:58,740
No, that Sekirei has already
chosen her Ashikabi. This is their battle.

281
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,080
Oh, how embarrassing, how embarrassing!

282
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,010
You look so embarrassing.

283
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,420
Now, I'll take that last
piece of cloth off you, too!

284
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,750
Musubi-chan, run!

285
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Musubi-chan!

286
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,570
Don't worry, Minato-san,

287
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,440
Musubi will not lose!

288
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Here I go!

289
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,270
You don't know when to give up.

290
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,450
Be more relaxed and let
your strength flow naturally.

291
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,570
Let my strength...

292
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,650
...flow naturally!

293
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,270
My fists of the pact,
shatter my Ashikabi's perils!

294
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:16,180
Impossible... I-I lost... Mikogami-sama...

295
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,490
Musubi-chan! Are you all right?

296
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,160
Yes, I am! And...

297
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,430
I guarded my modesty, too!

298
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,160
Your... modesty?

299
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,300
Um... Is that girl?

300
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,290
Um...

301
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,840
Yomi's presence has disappeared.

302
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,070
Dammit, she's useless!

303
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,520
That's enough, Akitsu. We'll head back.

304
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,080
Wait! Why is a
discarded number outside?!

305
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,200
Seems like Mikogami
failed to seize number 108.

306
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,030
That was a boring show.

307
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,210
We're home!

308
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,870
Welcome back.

309
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,210
Oh dear, Musubi-san!
What is that outfit?

310
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,880
Huh? Who's that girl?

311
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,550
Ah... she's my relative, and I
unexpectedly have to take care of her.

312
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,220
Take care of her.

313
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,550
Ku-chan?

314
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm hungry...

315
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,190
Oh my! I'll prepare dinner quickly.

316
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,570
That tree... I met with you there.

317
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,670
It was so strange...
We fell from such a height,

318
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,910
but we didn't get injured badly at all.
It was as if the tree caught us.

319
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,580
I heard a voice... saying "help me."

320
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,250
So Ku asked this tree.

321
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,590
I see...
Then you and this tree saved my life, huh?

322
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,090
Let me say formally:

323
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,820
Thank you, Ku-chan.

324
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:25,180
Um... Be Ku's big brother...
Please become Ku's Ashikabi-san...

325
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

326
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is the textbook of love

327
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, don't get upset so

328
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without false starts, it's show time!

329
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,280
Get the funky beat!

330
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,820
First ones win?

331
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090
No such thing in this case! No, no!

332
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,000
That's perfect for me

333
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,660
A sudden scramble!

334
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,100
But I'm a woman, I can't lose. No, no!

335
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
My feelings grow

336
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,970
No, and then a big bang!

337
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,610
Don't seduce him

338
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,770
Get away from him

339
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,110
My heart is pounding hard, so hard!

340
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,110
Secret, going off by myself

341
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,680
Big success, just two of us

342
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,520
Sweet and dazzling night

343
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,620
To tell you the truth, I want him to

344
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,130
Hold only me, just me

345
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,130
I want to monopolize him so badly

346
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,130
I wonder if I could stick a flag on him?

347
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,140
I knew it, he's so wimpy, what should I do?

348
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,140
He's just too gentle

349
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,150
I love that about him

350
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,380
So we are devoted to him

351
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,370
Dear Sweet Heart!

352
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,390
Finally!
I, Matsu, in order to capture his heart...

353
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,800
Hara, hara, hara.

354
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
Deploy the attractive womanly weapons!

355
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,000
Hara, hara, hara...

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Ah... Those meaningless reactions...

357
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,740
Para, para, paow...

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,640
