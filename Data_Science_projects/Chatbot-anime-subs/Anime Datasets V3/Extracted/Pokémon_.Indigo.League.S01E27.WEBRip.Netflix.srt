-[Brock] You'll see.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,111
[Misty] Sure are a lot of Pokémon
beauty parlors.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,077
-Hm.
-Is there any place special

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,662
you want to visit, Brock?

20
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,582
-Hm.
-Wait a minute. I just remembered

21
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,042
that Scissor Street
is also called Breeder's Lane.

22
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,587
-Where is it?
-So that's why we're here.

23
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,965
Brock's always got to see
the latest breeder gear.

Some of the best breeders
have shops here.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,528
There are lots of terrific makeup places
and fashion salons, too, just for Pokémon.

29
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,532
Hey! Oh, look. This must be
the newest fashion.

30
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,077
-How cute!
-You think that's cute, huh?

31
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,954
Come on. We've got to go in.

32
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,625
-Whoa! I don't want to go in there.
-Hm.

33
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,836
[James] You won't believe how beautiful
a Pokémon can be.

34
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,212
Step in and see for yourself.

35
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,550
Let us dazzle you with the latest fashions
by the expert artists of Salon Rocket.

-Did he just say Salon Rocket?
-Why does that name sound so familiar?

37
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,018

a Pokémon or a Christmas tree?

And hairstyling.

a pretty-mon. Ta-da!

another Pokémon fashion masterpiece.

Your Pokémon have gone from frumpy
to flashy, thanks to Salon Rocket.

00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,344

-[both] Please come back again soon.
-200.

50
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,688
You two are spending way too much
on advertising.

51
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:13,110
TV commercials are a big waste of money.
Remember, we're in this to make a profit.

52
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,986
We know what we're doing.

53
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,906
The more we spend to hype this place,
the more customers we'll get.

54
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,575
Customers who will spend thousands
for a fashionable Pokémon.

-Huh?

-It's there!
-[both] Huh?

58
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,755
[panting] I found it!

59
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,049
I've been looking all over for this place.

60
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,801
This is the store you've been looking for?

-[woman] Hi. Can I help you?

64
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,858
Just relax. Release all your tensions.

00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,998
Ah! Don't you look precious.

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,460
Thank you for bringing Chansey
to my salon.

70
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,588
-See you soon, Suzie.
-Chansey.

71
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,300
-May I help the next customer?
-Pika.

72
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,135
We're just kind of sort
of browsing around.

73
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:25,098
-Uh, no, uh.
-Look! Isn't that Vulpix the cutest thing?

74
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,225
-Oh, don't you want to hug it?
-[Ash] Ah!

75
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,977
-Pikachu.
-What is it?

<i>Its six tails are extremely beautiful.</i>

00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,443
<i>As it evolves, it grows even more tails.</i>

78
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,236
I love its hair.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,406
I wish I had hair like Vulpix
that looked so shiny and soft.

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,117
-Don't touch it!
-You're just about the cutest

81
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,496
-little Pokémon I've ever seen--
-Ah!

82
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,584

00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,797
-Very cute. [groans]

86
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,011
Please pardon Vulpix.

87
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,680
It doesn't like to be picked up
or hugged by strangers.

88
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,934
-Wish I'd known that sooner.
-Uh, Suzie?

89
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,102
Yes.

90
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,939
Uh, my name's Brock.
Nice to meet you, Suzie.

91
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,068
Uh, I want to breed like you. I mean,
I want to be a breeder like you.

92
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,195
It's very nice to meet you, Brock.

93
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
I'm flattered
you want to make me your model.

94
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes, I want to model you. I mean,
I'm flattered that you're flattered.

95
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,494
I mean, your Vulpix is nice.

96
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,496
-Uh.
-Huh?

97
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,289
What I'm really trying to say is,

98
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,458
Suzie, I'm begging you to accept me
as your pupil.

99
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,377
-[all gasp]
-Pika.

100
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,462
You got to be kidding, Brock.

101
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,298
Mind your own business, Ash.
I know what I'm doing.

102
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,716
Please say yes, Suzie. [groans]

103
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,512
I don't have pupils, Brock.
Breeding takes up all my time.

104
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,015
What makes her
such a great breeder anyway?

105
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,017
How dare you!

106
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,188
The sensational Suzie of Scissor Street
has been awarded the trophy for excellence

107
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,400
at the World Pokémon Breeder's Contest
for three consecutive years.

108
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,652
Wait. There's more.

109
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,197
Lights. In addition to that,
the readers of <i>Pokémon Friends </i>magazine

110
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,409
named her the most popular breeder
four years running.

111
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,038
And her hugely popular website
records over 10,000 hits per day.

112
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,875
Now, that's what I call a great breeder.

113
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,544
You better believe it.

114
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,838
Okay, Brock, we heard you clear and loud.

115
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,050
I wonder if this Vulpix has ever won
any awards in competition?

116
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,844
That's a fabulous question, Misty.

117
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,139
Vulpix is the hottest supermodel
of the Pokémon world.

118
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,350
Notice the gorgeous, flowing tails
that have made Vulpix a champ.

119
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,603
-Plus there's--
-We get the idea, Brock!

120
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:39,649
-Vulpix is terrific too.
-[yawns]

121
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,904
So all three of you are traveling
on a Pokémon journey together.

122
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,741
Pikachu! Pi!

123
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,535
[Suzie]
Your Pikachu has a beautiful shiny coat.

124
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,039
Are you the one who prepares
all of Pikachu's food, Brock?

125
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,292
-Yes! I do.
-And it's Brock's own recipe too.

126
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,919
My career as a breeder also began

127
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,255
when I first became interested
in Pokémon nutrition.

128
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,716
[mutters]
[all gasp]

129
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,635
Pi!

130
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,262
Mm. Mm.

131
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,555
Whoa.

132
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,310
-Vulpix.
-[Brock] Ah!

133
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,938
I can't believe Vulpix is eating
the food I made.

134
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,814
Brock, this is really impressive.

135
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,484
Vulpix never eats food
that I haven't made myself.

136
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,903
Looks like Vulpix is a fan
of Brock's cooking.

137
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,741
[trembling] Uh, thank you, Vulpix.

138
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,828
-[grunts] I'm not worthy.
-[Suzie gasps]

139
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:34,871
[Misty] Suzie.

140
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,459
We saw some super-fancy-looking Pokémon
when we were walking down the street.

141
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,294
Is that really the latest trend?

142
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,798
By any chance, did you pass
a very large salon on the way?

143
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,384
Mm-hm, you mean
that really tacky-looking place.

144
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,510
Ever since it opened,

145
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,597
some trainers are trying to make
their Pokémon as flashy as possible.

146
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,349
So that salon started the trend.

147
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,142
A good breeder is always trying

148
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,479
to bring out a Pokémon's
inner strength and personality.

149
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,316
But this new fad is about standing out,
not what's inside.

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,901
I don't like it either.

151
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,487
It's pretty stupid
to waste your time showing off.

152
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,949
But sometimes even Pokémon
like to get dressed up

153
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,076
and show off a little
just like the rest of us.

154
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,996
Right, Pikachu? I see it now.

155
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,291
Pika, pika?

156
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,752
I think Pikachu's perfect the way it is.

157
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,005
We don't need any goofy fashions.

158
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,257
It's what's going on inside
that really counts.

159
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,094
I never said the inside wasn't important,
but the outside counts too.

160
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
The inside is what matters.

161
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,098
-Outside too.
-Inside!

162
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,975
-Outside too.
-Inside matters the most.

163
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,143
The outside matters too.

164
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,060
-Inside.
-Outside too.

165
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,605
-Shouldn't you stop them?
-That's like trying to stop the tide.

166
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,149
If you think fashion's so great,

167
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,317
how about taking your Psyduck
to that salon?

168
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,069
Hey, what a great idea.

169
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,196
Let's go, Psyduck.

170
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,660
Psy-ay-ay.

171
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,664
[laughs]
Now we'll see who gets the last quack.

172
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,169
Ha! Anyway Psyduck and I are so cute,
we'll look good whatever fashion we wear.

173
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,795
I'm sure Psyduck will.

174
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,630
What do you know about fashion?

175
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:13,053
-Right, Psyduck?
-Psy-ay-ay. Duck?

176
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,139
This may be more of a challenge
than I thought it would be.

177
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,432
Better get going.

178
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,060
Ha! You'll be jealous
when we get back from the salon

179
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,979
and Psyduck turns out to be even cuter
than Pikachu.

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,191
-Come on, Psyduck.
-Psy.

181
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,985
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck.

182
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,739
I wonder if it's what's on the outside

183
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,200
or what's inside
that really counts in the end.

184
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,454
Ever since that new salon opened,
I've been wondering about my methods.

185
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,082
-Don't say things like that.
-[gasps]

186
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,293
Suzie. You've got to keep following
the path you believe in.

187
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,671
We have to stick up
for what's inside together.

188
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,382
-Right, Pikachu?
-Pikachu.

189
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,095
That's very kind. But how can we?

190
00:09:55,178 --> 00:10:00,058
If they want to put style over substance,
we'll give customers substance with style.

191
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,977
Uh, there are still a few seats left
in the back of the room

192
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,814
for our lecture on Pokémon care.

193
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,775
Each Pokémon needs your special care
and attention.

194
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,528
Whenever a Pokémon's been injured
in a battle,

195
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,238
it should be given a therapeutic massage.

196
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,740
Pika.

197
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,411
Hey! Wait! Where did everybody go?

198
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,206
-Say, weren't you over at Suzie's?
-Yeah, I saw you there.

199
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,416
Suzie's lecture just started.

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,418
It's a series about Pokémon care.

201
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,170
Today she's talking about massage.

202
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,631
A lecture on Pokémon massage?

203
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,800
This volunteer and his Pikachu

204
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,096
will now demonstrate the techniques
we learned in today's lecture. Mm-hm.

205
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,556
As you may already know,

206
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,809
a Pikachu's electric sacks
are located in its cheeks

207
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,062
and they become very tense
after a difficult battle.

208
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,522
Pika, Pikachu.

209
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,734
Ash, would you please massage Pikachu's
cheeks just like I showed you earlier?

210
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,486
Uh, sure.

211
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,822
Pikachu.

212
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,908
-Ah, let's see.
-Ha!

213
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,785
-Maybe...
-[Pikachu giggles]

214
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:05,206
-[chuckles] How's that feel, Pikachu?
-Pika.

215
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,749
-[woman] That's amazing.
-Wow.

216
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,795
Good communication between Pokémon
and their trainers is essential.

217
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,465
These techniques build trust
and bring out a Pokémon's personality.

218
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,718
I think Suzie will agree with me

219
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,430
that any technique is only as good
as the trainer or breeder who uses it.

220
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,391
-[woman] I never thought of that.
-[all sigh]

221
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,894
-[James] The perfect touch.
-[Jessie] One last rose.

222
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:30,106
Voila. This Squirtle shell
has become the perfect advertisement

223
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,275
for our latest line of Pokémon fashions.

224
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,695
Oh, yet another masterpiece
from Salon Rocket.

225
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,115
Roses are the flowers of love and romance.
[sighs]

226
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,241
We also paint daffodils.

227
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,826
Squirtle.

228
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,038
Meowth,
send in the next customer, <i>tout de suite.</i>

229
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,749
Can't you see I'm counting money here?

230
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,752
Hmm? Only one customer?

231
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,963
One or one million, it doesn't matter

232
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,382
as long as we have customers
who appreciate true beauty.

233
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,469
We only want to offer our services
to the most refined customers.

234
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,429
We're not going to make
any money that way.

235
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,640
Hello there, everybody.

236
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,517
-[all gasp]
-Huh?

237
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,228
-Welcome, young lady.
-Hmm.

238
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,272
-[both] Oh.
-[Misty] Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,567
-[James] Step in. Don't be shy.
-No, not me. Psyduck.

240
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,445
[Jessie] Don't be so hard on yourself.
You're just as lovely as any Psyduck.

241
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,447
[Misty] Hey. Hold on a second.

242
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,574
-Psy.
-[James] It's another masterpiece.

243
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,078
You like it?

244
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,998
Oh, I love it!
You've really captured the real me.

245
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,627
You're totally amazing artists.
I look so cute.

246
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm thrilled.

247
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,547
There's nothing that pleases us more
than a satisfied customer.

248
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,801
Oh, why don't we try out
even more new styles?

249
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,303
[both] Time for a makeover!

250
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,973
-A dab of rouge.
-[James] A bit of blush.

251
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,349
-[Jessie] A smidgen of lipstick.
-[James] A modicum of mascara.

252
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,394
-[Jessie] A pinch of powder.
-[growls] Forget about that makeover.

253
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,813
She hangs around with that Pikachu.

254
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,065
We got to grill the kid
to figure out how to steal it.

255
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,776
Hey, wait. You're Meowth.

256
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,989
We were trying to find out
until you blew our cover!

257
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,158
First you get the opponent to relax,
then you pump them for info!

258
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,161
So stop pumping me and get that Pikachu!

259
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,123
[both yelling]

260
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,792
I'll never tell you phonies anything! Ah!

261
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,003
So you figured out the truth.

262
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,213
Well, you'd better tell us
where Pikachu is

263
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,882
if you don't want your face
painted just like Frankenstein.

264
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,468
Heh. Do I want a face like Frankenstein's?
No, I don't.

265
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,095
-Hey, Psyduck!
-Psyduck?

266
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,097
-Where'd Psyduck go?
-I don't see it.

267
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,684
-It's gone!
-Psyduck.

268
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,811
Psy, psy, psy.

269
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,273
Psy, psy. Psyduck. Psy, psy, psy.

270
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,151
Psy, psy, psy. Psyduck!

271
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,111
[all] Huh?

272
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,155
-Pika?
-Psyduck! Psyduck!

273
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,073
Psy, psy, psy.
Psy-ay-ay-ay!

274
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,325
Pika! Pika! Pika!

275
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,703
What's the matter?
Has something bad happened to Misty?

276
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,330
Pika! Pika!

277
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,291
[Ash grunts] Pikachu!

278
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,752
[Ash grunts]

279
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,920
-Misty!
-Pika!

280
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,465
-[all] Huh?
-[both] It's Team Rocket again!

281
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,924
What took you guys so long?

282
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,843
[both] What happened to her face?

283
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,136
[grunting]

284
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,805
-Dumb boys.
-[grunting]

285
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,684
-Let Misty go right now!
-Sorry, you'll have to wait your turn.

286
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,854
We won't be finished with her makeover
until she looks like this.

287
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,273
We're conducting
some important beauty research.

288
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,941
Beauty research?

289
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,028
Can't you understand
it's the beauty inside that counts?

290
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,446
Every Pokémon is beautiful.

291
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,698
We just have to help
the Pokémon discover it.

292
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,283
What's she talking about?

293
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,410
What does she know
about breeding Pokémon?

294
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,704
Who cares about the inside?
Outside counts.

295
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,665
What do you two numbskulls know
about Pokémon breeding?

296
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,710
This whole Salon Rocket idea's
supposed to be a scam remember?

297
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,421
-[gasps]
-It was a brilliant plan.

298
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,508
Part one, think up some stupid
Pokémon fashions

299
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,884
and take piles of money from the trainers.

300
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,761
Money? What?

301
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,556
And part two, whenever a trainer brings
in a rare Pokémon,

302
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,810
first get the trainer distracted,
then steal the Pokémon on the spot.

303
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,520
-What?
-[laughs]

304
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,023
And our greatest masterpiece of all
will be that Pikachu of yours.

305
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,901
How about a trade?
This twerpy girl for your Pikachu?

306
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,236
[gasps]

307
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,238
If you're trying to steal Pikachu,
we're going to battle.

308
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,990
-Count me in too. Tag team.
-Pika!

309
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:13,204
[laughs] Salon Rocket is ready
with our own fashion-battle platform!

310
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,581
-Here goes.
-[all yell]

311
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,502
[Jessie]
And now Salon Rocket presents

312
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,296
a fashion extravaganza
and Pokémon battlethon.

313
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,757
[Jessie] To protect the world
from boring fashion

314
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,300
[James] To dress all people
with flash and passion

315
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,094
[Jessie]
To give all Pokémon pretty faces.

316
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,138
[James] To extend our art to outer spaces.

317
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,056
-Jessie.
-James.

318
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,850
Salon Rocket.

319
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,018
When it comes to chic,
we know what's right.

320
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,647
Surrender your taste or prepare to fight.

321
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,607
Oh, we're supposed to battle on that?

322
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,069
-Dazzle them, Ekans.
-Knock them dead, Koffing.

323
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,822
-Ekans.
-Koffing.

324
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
We don't need costumes.

325
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,742
Pikachu's super-energized
from that massage.

326
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,287
-Go!
-Pika!

327
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,165
Geodude, go! Ugh.

328
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,503
-Geodude.
-Geodude, give them the seismic toss.

329
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,381
-[both grunting]
-Ekans.

330
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,135
Ekans!

331
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,429
-[grunts]
-Thunder shock, now!

332
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,350
-Pikachu!
-Koffing!

333
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,768
Pika!

334
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,981
Koffing, cutie.
Sludge makeover!

335
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,650
-Koffing! Koff!
-Pi!

336
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,527
-Ah, Pikachu!
-Geodude!

337
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,280
Now the finale. Go!

338
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,200
Koffing!

339
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,660
Oh, no! It's a fashion disaster.

340
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,623
Get up, you guys! We've still got a battle
to finish. Let's go!

341
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,666
Koffing!

342
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,210
[screaming]

343
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,715
-Now what?
-Vulpix and I will take care of them.

344
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,427
We'll give your Vulpix a makeover
when we get rid of its tails.

345
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,596
Time to give you a lesson in breeding.

346
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,724
If all you worry about
is your Pokémon's outer beauty,

347
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,061
-its inner strength will be lost.
-Vul.

348
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,689
A Pokémon is like a fashion model.
All that counts is a pretty face.

349
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,942
-Like mine!
-Ekans!

350
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,528
Vulpix! Wrap them up with fire spin!

351
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,322
[grunting]
[all yelling]

352
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:17,411
[all screaming]

353
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,829
[both] Save the gowns!

354
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,832
Hey! Don't fire spin me!
Help, help, help!

355
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,590
[all] We're blasting off again!

356
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,263
Now, that's an attack.

357
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,225
[Pokédex]
<i>Vulpix's greatest attack, fire spin.</i>

358
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,061
<i>Using powerful flames</i>
<i>to block its opponent from moving,</i>

359
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,938
<i>it then inflicts great damage.</i>

360
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,189
Did you see that?

361
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:49,402
A cute exterior hides inner strength,
that's the Pokémon's true personality.

362
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:55,366
[crowd murmuring]

363
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,744
-[Misty] Psyduck!
-Psy?

364
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,707
Just when I really needed you,
you ducked out on me.

365
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,128
Get up here quick and untie me.
Untie me now! [coughs]

366
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,796
Psy-ay-ay!

367
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,136
Nice work, Vulpix.

368
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,472
Thanks to all of you,
I believe in what I'm doing again.

369
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,891
You helped me regain confidence
in my beliefs.

370
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,687
Heh. It's not hard when the person
you're helping's as great as you are.

371
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,355
-And, Brock?
-Uh, yes?

372
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,149
I was very impressed

373
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,193
by the way you handled your Pokémon
in a crisis like that.

374
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,237
Suzie.

375
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,906
I have a lot more to learn
about breeding Pokémon.

376
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,911
Even if I do have a championship,
I'm still a student, not a teacher.

377
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,664
Looks like you and I
both have journeys ahead of us.

378
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,375
You leaving, Suzie?
What about your Pokémon salon?

379
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,211
There are things I can only learn
if I leave here.

380
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,589
I want you to continue
your journey too, Brock.

381
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:56,135
-From now on, we're rivals.
-Uh, sure.

382
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,098
-Vulpix.
-Ah!

383
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,893
I'd be grateful if you took care
of Vulpix for me.

384
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,270
-Huh?
-You're the first person other than me

385
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,689
that Vulpix has been friendly with.

386
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,566
Right now I believe
you could do a better job

387
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,361
-of raising Vulpix than I could.
-Vulpix.

388
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,574
-Mm, thanks. I don't know what to say.
-[Ash gasps]

389
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,076
Pika.

390
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,539
You don't have to worry, Vulpix.
I promise I'll take good care of you.

391
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,634
All right! I got Vulpix!

392
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,136
[chuckles]

393
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,847
Hm. [laughs]

394
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,601
Hey, what are you laughing for?
This makeup is very fashionable.

395
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,854
[narrator]<i> And so Brock must continue</i>

They're all just jealous because they're
not attractive enough to wear our designs.
