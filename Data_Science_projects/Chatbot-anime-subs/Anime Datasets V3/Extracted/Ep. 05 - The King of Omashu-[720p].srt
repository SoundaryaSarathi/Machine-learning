1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,794
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,902
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:10,193
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:15,391
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:19,468
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:23,780
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,938
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,100
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,938
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,143
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:38,875
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:42,497
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,904
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!

15
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:06,111
I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.

16
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:09,910
Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.

17
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:12,204
They have buildings here that don't melt!

18
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:16,968
Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!

19
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:21,159
Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,518
You need a disguise.

21
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,237
So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?

22
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:34,242
Ohh, so itchy! How do you live in this stuff?

23
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,365
Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.

24
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,474
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.

25
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:47,014
Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.

26
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:06,558
You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.

27
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:12,180
Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?

28
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,737
Noo! My cabbages!

29
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,708
Just keep smiling...

30
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,217
State your business!

31
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,271
My business is my business, young man, and none of yours!

32
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:39,851
I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!

33
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:43,376
Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.

34
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:50,131
Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.

35
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:55,004
Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,577
You seem like a responsible young lady.

37
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:01,389
See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!

38
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,225
We will.

39
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:08,312
Wait a minute!

40
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,950
You're a strong young boy.

41
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,077
Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag.

42
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:17,671
Good idea!

43
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:52,376
This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

44
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:58,117
Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.

45
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,336
Great, so they get their mail on time.

46
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,092
They do get their mail on time,...

47
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:06,964
...but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes...

48
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,776
Look around you, what do you see?

49
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:14,221
Umm... the mail system?

50
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,268
Instead of seeing what they want you to see,...

51
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,438
...you gotta open your brain to the possibilities.

52
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,803
A package sending system?

53
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,969
The world's greatest super slide!

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,123
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

55
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:44,239
One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here,...

57
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:51,224
...I'm starting to have second thoughts!

58
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,463
I'm on it!

59
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,998
Men, you'll be going off to combat soon.

60
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:27,077
It's important that you be prepared for anything.

61
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,182
Aang, do something! Use your airbending!

62
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:43,030
Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!

63
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:19,441
Sorry!

64
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:40,012
My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!

65
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,687
Two cabbages please.

66
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,439
Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism,...

67
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,614
...traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.

68
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,840
Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!

69
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:14,380
Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?

70
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,233
Throw them... a feast!

71
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,658
Huh?

72
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:44,519
The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts,...

73
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,069
...so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.

74
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,850
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

75
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,392
How about you? I bet you like meat.

76
00:07:55,603 --> 00:08:00,398
Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?

77
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,391
So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?

78
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:08,010
I'm from... Kangaroo Island.

79
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:15,559
Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!

80
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,762
What? It was pretty funny.

81
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:31,764
Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to the hay.

82
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:43,742
There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar!

83
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,394
Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?

84
00:08:54,421 --> 00:09:01,624
Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.

85
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:06,731
Everything checks out, no firebenders here. So, good work everybody.

86
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:10,712
Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears.

87
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:12,696
We'll see you next time!

88
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:18,471
You can't keep us here. Let us leave.

89
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,867
Lettuce leaf?

90
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:26,780
We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.

91
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:31,099
Tomorrow the Avatar will face three deadly challenges.

92
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,699
But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber.

93
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,514
My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?

94
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,783
The newly refurbished chamber.

95
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,989
Wait, which one are we talking about?

96
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,001
The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is.

97
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,986
Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them.

98
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:57,324
Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!

99
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,423
This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.

100
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,599
He did say it was newly refurbished.

101
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,009
Nice or not, we're prisoners.

102
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,381
I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.

103
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:18,490
We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here.

104
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,552
The air vents!

105
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:25,179
If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king.

106
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,949
We can't, but Momo can.

107
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:34,822
Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!

108
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,090
Go on, boy, get Appa!

109
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,693
Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?

110
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:52,937
Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out.

111
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:57,519
Well, no point in arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang.

112
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,836
Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.

113
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:12,032
Sokka! Katara! Where are my friends?

114
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,683
The King will free them if you complete your challenges.

115
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,481
And if I fail?

116
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:20,213
He didn't say. Your staff please?

117
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:32,639
First, Avatar, what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion.

118
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,157
I'm waiting.

119
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:38,479
I... guess it's fine.

120
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,691
Excellent! You passed the first test.

121
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:42,438
Really?

122
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:49,614
Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real challenges are much more... challenging.

123
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:55,986
I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!

124
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:59,102
Ohh, I thought you might refuse...

125
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,504
...so I will give your friends some special souvenirs.

126
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:10,214
Those delightful rings are made of pure genemite, also known as creeping crystal.

127
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:13,337
It's crystal that grows remarkably fast.

128
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:17,197
By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it.

129
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:23,504
Terrible fate, really. I can stop it, but only if you cooperate.

130
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:26,220
Ah! It's already creeping!

131
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,624
I'll do as you want.

132
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:45,305
It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry.

133
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:52,883
Ooo, there it is. Would you mind fetching it for me?

134
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:15,285
Ooo, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of that before.

135
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:48,761
That's right. Keep diving head in, I'm sure it'll work eventually.

136
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:06,804
There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!

137
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:14,933
Uh, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

138
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,545
Okay, found him!

139
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:20,312
Bring him to me! Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy!

140
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:22,653
Come here, Flopsy!

141
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:32,541
Flopsy, wait! Flopsy!

142
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,900
Flopsy!

143
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:51,267
Wait a minute?

144
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,834
Flopsy?

145
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,782
Flopsy!

146
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:15,191
Awww, that's a good boy! Yes, who has a soft belly?

147
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,758
Guys, are you okay?

148
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,412
Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great.

149
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,324
Awww, yes.

150
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:32,524
Come on. I'm ready for the next challenge.

151
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:45,211
Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent.

152
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:54,670
Point and choose.

153
00:15:54,671 --> 00:16:00,477
So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?

154
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:03,268
Choose wisely.

155
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:07,400
I... choose...

156
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,140
...you!

157
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:12,447
Wrong choice!

158
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,771
You thought I was a frail old man,...

159
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:44,017
...but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.

160
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:46,380
Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?

161
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:52,994
There are no... take-back-sees' in my kingdom. You might need this!

162
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:02,165
Typical airbender tactic, avoid and evade.

163
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:06,730
I'd hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.

164
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:14,438
Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later, you'll have to strike back.

165
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:32,943
Oh, you'll have to be a little more creative than that!

166
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,896
Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here!

167
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:51,797
Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?

168
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,454
How are you going to get me from way over there?

169
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:32,139
Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart.

170
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,726
Huh?

171
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:48,505
You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.

172
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:52,484
That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.

173
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:56,269
Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?

174
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,037
Oh come on!

175
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:07,178
Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What... is my name?

176
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:12,404
From the looks of your friends, I'd say you only have a few minutes.

177
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,192
How am I supposed to know his name?

178
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,311
Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle.

179
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:17,897
I got it!

180
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:18,375
Yeh?

181
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:24,517
He's an earthbender, right? Rocky! You know, because of all the rocks?

182
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,888
We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.

183
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:31,138
Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall.

184
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,708
I saved his pet and I had a duel.

185
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,082
And what did you learn?

186
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,759
Well, everything was different than I expected.

187
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,717
And...?

188
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:43,773
Well, they weren't straightforward.

189
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:52,351
To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name!

190
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:56,047
I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges.

191
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:02,608
As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.

192
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:08,168
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

193
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:16,250
Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.

194
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:17,892
Uh, over here!

195
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,458
Little help?

196
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:27,247
Genemite is made of rock candy. Delicious!

197
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:30,870
So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?

198
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:34,641
Who you calling old? Okay. I'm old.

199
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:38,626
Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?

200
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:44,929
First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people, hehe, but I do have a reason.

201
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,628
Aang, you have a difficult task ahead.

202
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,894
The world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone.

203
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:56,726
It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

204
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,409
You have much to learn.

205
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,720
You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do,...

206
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:07,455
...I hope you will think like a mad genius!

207
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:13,014
And it looks like you're in good hands.

208
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:17,724
You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation.

209
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,640
And you'll need Momo too.

210
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:27,611
Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!

211
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,724
My cabbages!
