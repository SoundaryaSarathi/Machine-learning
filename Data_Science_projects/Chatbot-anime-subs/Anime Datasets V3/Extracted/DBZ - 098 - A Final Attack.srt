00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,130
''I Will Be the One Who Wins...
Risking Survival, A Final Attack''

2
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,120
What's wrong!? Are you so afraid you'll wear
yourself out you can't put out your full power!?

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,470
Don't get...

4
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,080
Don't get so...

5
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,080
...carried away!!

6
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,610
You underestimated me, didn't you? Let
me tell you that this is still not my full power!

7
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,270
That was only about 70 percent.

8
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,110
And, starting now...

9
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,110
...your long-awaited 100 percent!

10
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,260
I'll settle this with my full power in
one minute-no, thirty seconds!

11
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,880
It's no good! I can't find
Bulma-san's Ki at all!

12
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,490
And you know, something is beginning to happen
to this planet! Something beyond hope!

13
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,500
Besides which, Freeza's Ki seems to again
be getting greater! What can it mean?

14
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,180
W- whatever happens, you just
watch me live through this!

15
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,460
Somebody, hurry and come
save me! Please!

16
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,150
Incredible! His Ki is billowing
up and filling him out!

17
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,690
So this is finally the realization of his
100 percent power, is it?

18
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,460
What are you doing, Goku!?

19
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,800
Goku, can you hear me!? Hey!

20
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Now! Now is your chance! Now, while Freeza
concentrates his power, is your chance to attack!

21
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,480
Hey, Goku! Do you not hear my voice!?

22
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,120
That can't be possible!
Goku, now is your only--

23
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,490
I do hear you, Kaio-sama.

24
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,500
There's no doubt, I probably ain't
going to get a second chance at this.

25
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,440
That chance to see with my own
eyes the strongest scumbag in the
universe at his full power, that is.

26
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,440
W- what did you say!?

27
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,110
Goku, are you even aware
of what you are saying?

28
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,450
...seventy-eight....seventy-nine...

29
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,460
...eighty...

30
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,460
...eighty-one...

31
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,930
Hey! What the hell is the matter with you!?

32
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,810
I...I want to fight Freeza.

33
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,470
...eighty-four...eighty-five...

34
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,150
And...win!

35
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,260
Such foolishness! This isn't a game, Goku!

36
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:16,440
I am going to avenge Kuririn! He has died twice!
He cannot return to life, even with the Dragonballs!

37
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,100
Kuririn was a good guy!

38
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,780
A really good guy.

39
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,780
My very best friend!

40
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,480
And he blew him to bits...

41
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,480
But there's no reason to wait for
him to reach full power!

42
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,890
Besides, what about Gohan and the others?

43
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,930
It's all right. Gohan and the
others will be saved.

44
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,080
Where are you? Where are you, Bulma-san!?

45
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,750
N- no way! I don't want
to die in a place like this!

46
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,760
Gohan-kun!

47
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,400
What have you all been up to!?
I was nearly worried out of my mind!

48
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,410
What exactly is up with this planet!? Leaving me
behind by myself in such a dangerous place!

49
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,750
What is going on with Kuririn and Son-kun!?

50
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,750
I'll explain what's happening later.
Right now, we have to hurry!

51
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,420
Hurry? To where? I know, the spaceship Son-kun
came in, right!? We can go home now, right!?

52
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,760
-Yeah.
-Hooray!

53
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Where's Gohan-chan!? What's
happenin' to Gohan-chan!?

54
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,490
There's only two reasons this high-performance
monitor would stop sending images.

55
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,230
The first case is the spaceship
has been vaporized.

56
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,400
The second case...

57
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,070
is that something irregular is affecting
Planet Namek's axis, causing
fluctuations in its magnetic field,

58
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,740
thus causing electromagnetic waves
to become unstable.

59
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,740
What kind of conditions are those?

60
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:13,430
Uh, you might call it a portent of the
destruction of Planet Namek. In any case,
Goku and Gohan-kun...and even Bulma...

61
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,510
...ninety-three percent...ninety-four
percent...almost there!

62
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,130
Freeza, the reason I'm waiting for
you to reach your full power like this,

63
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
is because I want to demolish you
when you're at your best!

64
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,810
That's so I won't have any
regrets as a warrior.

65
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,810
As for you, you must have come
to want to try out your full power, right?

66
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,810
Otherwise, you would have blasted
the planet again and finished it off.

67
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,200
K- Kaio-sama?

68
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,170
That guy is no longer Son Goku. He is
now a warrior of fury, a Super Saiyan.

69
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,160
Sorry to keep you waiting. This is
the full power you wanted.

70
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,460
There ain't time. Let's settle this quickly!

71
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,430
Contemptible fool!

72
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,100
W- what!?

73
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,480
I- Impossible! That I should lose
sight of them-what speed!

74
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,130
Too slow!

75
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,420
He vanished!

76
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,100
Behind you!

77
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,430
How about that? That was just me
warming up for my final attack!

78
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,440
I'd hope so...

79
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,440
At such a level, I was just about
to become disappointed.

80
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,440
The time limit is up shortly.

81
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,390
Can Goku settle his fight with
Freeza at his full power?

82
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:34,390
