1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,402
He vanished?

2
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:14,072
This is Kami's doing, I'll bet.

3
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:17,530
This is something he would be capable of.

4
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,479
I wonder what he
intends to do with him.

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:28,079
Nevertheless, if it is Kami-<i>sama</i>,
then we can relax.

6
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:35,627
In any case, we need to hurry
and gather the other six balls,

7
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,762
and bring Goku back to life.

8
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:40,699
Good grief!
At a critical time like this,

9
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:44,102
I wonder where Yamucha
and the others have gone off to!

10
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:46,771
You were the one who chased him away,
weren't you?

11
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:52,711
But then again, how did Son-<i>kun</i>'s
brother know where he was so easily?

12
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,544
It's that strange device
he has attached to his face.

13
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,680
It seems to be able to tell an
opponent's strength and location.

14
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,390
Kuririn?

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,392
Right.

16
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:08,859
Here.

17
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:16,856
That thing, huh? Kuririn,
remove it, would you?

18
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:22,196
S- sure. H- he's not about to come
back to life or anything, right?

19
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:53,165
So this here does that...

20
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,343
This is an incredible mechanism!

21
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:01,379
It's a little bit damaged,
but I think I can do something with it.

22
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,382
You sure are incredible, Bulma-<i>san</i>.

23
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:07,719
Once I take this back, study it,
and make some alterations,

24
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,387
we just might be able to find out

25
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:12,057
where Yamucha and Tenshinhan
and the others are.

26
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:15,727
Whatever we do, let's go back to
the Kame House for the time being.

27
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,730
Right. There's nothing more
we can do here, huh?

28
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,068
Okay then, right after that,
I'll go looking for the Dragon Balls.

29
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,730
Piccolo, what do you plan to-

30
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,430
Just like a lizard's tail!

31
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,966
You guys search for the Dragon Balls.

32
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,902
Kami doesn't have the kind of power
it takes to restore life.

33
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:04,042
However, I'm going to be taking
charge of Son Goku's son there.

34
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,377
What?

35
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:08,380
You're kidding, right!?
What do you plan to do with him!?

36
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,715
I know what it is!

37
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,717
You're planning to eat him, huh!?

38
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,719
Eat him!?

39
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,721
W- what are you going to do?

40
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:20,492
This Gohan kid should give us
some powerful fighting potential,

41
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,060
depending on the training he gets.

42
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,564
For us to confront the two Saiyans
who are to arrive here in another year,

43
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:28,589
we're going to need his power.

44
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:34,406
To that end, I'm going
to have to train him.

45
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:37,075
Y- you can't seriously be saying that...

46
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:40,135
I'm not sure if that's going
to be agreeable, you know?

47
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:44,749
We'll first have to take it up with Goku,
as well as his mother, Chichi...

48
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:48,086
We don't have the time
to spare for that!

49
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:51,423
Keep up that bickering,
and I'll take him away,

50
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,913
even if it means killing you to do so!

51
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:10,041
After a year has passed, I'll be coming
to your house, together with this kid.

52
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,277
When Son Goku comes back to life,

53
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,973
tell him he can wait
in expectation until then.

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,056
I don't know...
I don't know about this...

55
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,822
He's going to die! Even if he's lucky,
he's still going to become a delinquent!

56
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,789
Goku and Chichi-<i>san</i>
are going to be upset.

57
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,930
<i>And so, about that same time,</i>
<i>in the Other World...</i>

58
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,410
Okay, okay, all of you spirits,

59
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,745
please remain orderly in line!

60
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,349
Okay, you there! Do not form two lines!

61
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,317
Be sure to maintain
one orderly line, please!

62
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,170
...and that is why I have brought
him here as flesh and blood,

63
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,706
to ask that he be allowed to train.

64
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:21,339
If you please, Great King Yama-<i>sama</i>,
allow him to call on Kaio-<i>sama</i>.

65
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:29,387
Son Goku, huh? Indeed,
his achievements have been outstanding.

66
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,155
So you're asking that someone

67
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,057
who could go to heaven be allowed
to put himself at risk of danger,

68
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:37,061
travel the Serpentine Road,
and meet with Kaio-<i>sama</i>, then?

69
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:37,993
Yes.

70
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:43,401
Say, does everyone
come here when they die?

71
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,402
That's right.

72
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:45,737
Even aliens?

73
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,172
Mm-hmm. All who die have
judgment passed upon them here,

74
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:52,076
to determine whether they
are to go to heaven or hell.

75
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:55,443
Hey! Just a little bit before me,
did a guy named Raditz wash up here?

76
00:05:56,347 --> 00:06:00,018
N- now look here! You need
to say " did he come through?"

77
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:04,422
He was here, all right.
He was your brother, huh?

78
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:07,358
He's now hell-bound, of course.

79
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,027
Didn't he raise a commotion?

80
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:14,761
He did, he did! He did raise a commotion,
but I put him down!

81
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,000
You sure are strong, huh? You took
care of somebody that awesome?

82
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,709
Maybe I should get
Pops here to train me!

83
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,744
Shh! Your voice is too loud!

84
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:29,047
You shouldn't be addressing
Yama-<i>sama</i> in that tone!

85
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,715
But...

86
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:34,344
Keep quiet! Kaio-<i>sama</i> is even stronger.

87
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:38,682
I heard that, Kami of Earth!

88
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:43,394
When you die, maybe I ought
to send you to hell.

89
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:46,731
P- please forgive me! Surely, I never
thought that would reach your ears!

90
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,133
I should have expected as much of
someone who has " the devil's own ears."

91
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,691
Just kidding!

92
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,740
You've got no sense of humor, huh?

93
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:04,311
Nope.

94
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:09,120
Very well. If you wish
to go that badly,

95
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,023
you may go to where Kaio-<i>sama</i> is.

96
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:14,025
T- thank you very much.

97
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:18,696
I'll call a guide over for you.
Leave through there and wait for him.

98
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,032
Okay!

99
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:27,335
However... I can't be responsible for you
if you fall from the Serpentine Road.

100
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:35,046
All right then, good luck. This whole
year will be a challenge, after all.

101
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:38,282
Right! I ain't sure what's going on,

102
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:41,274
but anyhow, I'll go see
this Kaio-<i>sama</i> guy.

103
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:46,448
Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

104
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:57,335
<i>Then again, our Earth has drawn the</i>
<i>attention of some rather egregious folks.</i>

105
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:01,772
<i>We might indeed be in for</i>
<i>some real trouble this time.</i>

106
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:05,343
<i>Even if we were to petition</i>
<i>Shen Long to dispose of them,</i>

107
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,879
<i>he probably wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to win out</i>

108
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,681
<i>against the incredible</i>
<i>power of the Saiyans.</i>

109
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:13,718
<i>Even if Son Goku does</i>
<i>get trained by Kaio-sama,</i>

110
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:16,020
<i>just how much will he improve?</i>

111
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,360
<i>Our one and only salvation is Goku's son.</i>
<i>How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?</i>

112
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,363
<i>And in this limited time, how will</i>-

113
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,031
Shut up!!

114
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:29,727
You're disturbing me!
Would you go home already!?

115
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:32,829
Hey, what's taking so long?

116
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:38,403
E- excuse me!
Please excuse me!

117
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,816
Thank you for your patience.

118
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:49,387
I will now guide you to where
the Head of the Serpent is.

119
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:55,727
The Serpentine Road is very long!
Are you in healthy shape?

120
00:08:55,727 --> 00:09:01,065
Nope. I'm dead, so I ain't in
very healthy shape at all, am I?

121
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:04,402
Say, what kind of person is Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

122
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:08,039
Ah yes, Kaio-<i>sama</i> is the gentleman

123
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,008
that stands above all the
Kami-<i>sama</i> throughout the universe.

124
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,208
I'm sure he must be strong, then!

125
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:42,940
We can't very well not say
anything about this to Chichi.

126
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,775
Kuririn, go on over there and
explain the situation to her for us.

127
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,406
M- me!?

128
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:55,116
She appears to be an education-minded-mama,
so you're going to get killed for sure.

129
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,565
Hello? Hello?

130
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:12,703
Aloha! Turtle-<i>chan</i> is
currently not at home.

131
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:17,265
If there's something I can do for you,
please wait until the sound of the beep-

132
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,912
Well, I never!
Where have they gone off to!?

133
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,279
And here I've come all this way
to see my grandson...

134
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,889
Knowin' Goku-<i>sa</i> and those others,

135
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,518
they're teachin' Gohan how to do
somethin' dangerous, I'm sure of it!

136
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,264
Well, that's okay, ain't it?
Children should be a li'l bit naughty.

137
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,266
Nothin' doin'!

138
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,936
If they're up to that
and his mind goes numb on him,

139
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,939
--then what are we goin' to do!?
--Don't be silly!

140
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,541
No, if he goes learnin'
the martial arts,

141
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,276
before long, he'll get kicked
in the chin or somethin',

142
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,879
and he'll get himself
thrown into the ocean!

143
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,218
And then, and then, a man-eater
will catch his scent, or perhaps,

144
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,948
he'll drift ashore to
some uninhabited island!

145
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,592
He'll get hungry, and as he's
tryin' to grab some bananas,

146
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:08,893
he'll get bitten by a snake,

147
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:11,762
and the poison will circulate
to his brain, and then... and then...

148
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:15,095
after his mind has gone numb,
what will we do!?

149
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,613
Okay, we're here.

150
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,594
This is the Serpentine Road, then?

151
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,619
Yes.

152
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,991
What do I do from here?

153
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,939
Earnestly press on as you travel
along this serpent, if you please.

154
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:58,033
It leads to where Kaio-<i>sama</i> is.
Yes indeed.

155
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,545
It sure looks long.

156
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:06,550
Yes. According to legend,
it's approximately one million kilos long.

157
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,222
A million kilos!? Has anyone
ever reached the end?

158
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,891
As I recall, in the last billion years,

159
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:17,228
Great King Yama has been
the only one, yes indeed.

160
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,897
That older guy, huh?

161
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,200
Well, even so, as long as there's
someone who has reached the end,

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,237
I might be able to manage something too.

163
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:29,240
Please be absolutely careful
not to fall off into the clouds.

164
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,076
After all, beneath the
clouds is where hell is,

165
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,577
and you will never return again.

166
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:34,771
Oh, really?

167
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,920
Rats, I should have brought
a <i>bento</i> lunch or something.

168
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,691
That's all right, sir.
You are already dead,

169
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:49,260
so I doubt there's any chance of
you starving to death. Yes indeed.

170
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,929
Oh, yeah!

171
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,531
Okay, then...

172
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:56,864
Oh, that's right! I have
a favor I'd like to ask!

173
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,538
Do you know Uranai Baba?

174
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:03,874
Yes. She comes by once in a while.

175
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:07,211
Thank goodness! The next
time she comes, right?

176
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,581
Ask her to tell Old Timer Turtle Hermit

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,551
not to bring me back to life
for one year for me.

178
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:20,980
Understood. Let's see, one year...
the Turtle Hermit-<i>sama</i>, right?

179
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,057
Okay, guess I'll go now.

180
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,233
So in short, all I have to do
is not fall off the snake, right?

181
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,569
Yes, be sure not to.

182
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,264
<i>Bukujutsu!!</i>

183
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,072
That's cheating...

184
00:13:57,194 --> 00:14:01,290
Wake up already, son of Son Goku!

185
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,775
We need to talk.
Come up out of the water!

186
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:24,282
Who are you? Father?

187
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,888
Father! Where are you!?
Save me! Father! Father!

188
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:40,237
Father! I'm scared! I'm scared!

189
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,137
Sheesh, you dirty brat!

190
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,432
Don't give me any trouble!

191
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,681
Stop your bawling! If you don't get quiet,
I'm going to snap your neck!

192
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,124
Ready? Listen close
to what I have to say.

193
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,355
First, your father has died.

194
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:15,539
You remember a little bit of that, right?
In order to defeat that man,

195
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,336
he sacrificed himself.

196
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,345
R- run away, Gohan!
Run away!

197
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,889
Father...

198
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,349
Whoa, now, don't you cry!
I really will snap your neck!

199
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,235
You've heard about the Dragon Balls
from your father, right?

200
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:48,906
Goku's friends should be gathering
them to bring him back to life.

201
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,243
However, that's not
what the problem is.

202
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,179
We managed to deal with
the guy who kidnapped you,

203
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,480
but in a year from now,

204
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,850
it seems that some even more terrible
friends of his will be coming.

205
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,853
Once they do, then even with
having Son Goku returned to life,

206
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:06,190
there's absolutely no chance of us
winning with just him and myself.

207
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,028
We need your power too. Train yourself
to learn the tactics of fighting,

208
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,863
and defend the Earth!

209
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:17,868
Me? You can't mean it!
I can't fight at all!

210
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:21,305
Apparently, you still haven't
realized it yourself.

211
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:24,208
The power that you have locked
within you is something else.

212
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,944
That's why we're going to draw out
that power through training,

213
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,213
until you can use it effectively.

214
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:32,148
It can't be... I don't
have any power like that.

215
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:34,741
You want to see some proof?

216
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,222
W- what are you doing!?

217
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:41,559
Ow! That hurts! That hurts!
Stop it! That hurts!

218
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,893
That hurts! Stop it! It hurts!
It hurts! It hurts!

219
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,827
Here you go!

220
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,402
Come on! Show me that power
you have locked away!

221
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,924
W- what the-?

222
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:32,270
<i>W</i>- <i>what a surprise!</i>
<i>This is more than I imagined!</i>

223
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,884
<i>l've got mixed feelings about this.</i>

224
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,920
<i>Here I am about to raise someone</i>

225
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,787
<i>who could turn out to be my</i>
<i>most fearsome opponent in the future.</i>

226
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:50,227
That's... what I did?

227
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:53,526
That's right. Looks like you've
more or less realized it now.

228
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,469
When your emotions become
considerably raised,

229
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,838
the natural power that you have
locked up inside you is exhibited.

230
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:04,934
However, it only lasts for an instant.
We can't beat them like that!

231
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:07,911
I'm going to drill into you
the way to fight,

232
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,181
and turn you into the greatest
warrior ever. You got that?

233
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:15,586
But I don't want to learn
to be a martial artist.

234
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,054
I want to be a great scholar.

235
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:23,594
So become one. Just do it after
we've defeated the two Saiyans

236
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,195
who will be coming in a year.

237
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:28,632
They're planning to exterminate
every person on Earth.

238
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,868
If they do that, your future's
not going to be worth crap, is it?

239
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:32,870
But I'm scared...

240
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,567
Stop your griping! You want
to get killed right now!?

241
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:40,644
We don't have time!
We're going to begin right now!

242
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,305
Take off your tunic immediately!

243
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:50,282
Once Father comes back to life,
I want to be taught by Father.

244
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:55,893
That's too bad.
He certainly is strong,

245
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,895
but he's not at all
cut out to be a teacher.

246
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:01,131
He doesn't have any of the
firmness it takes to handle others.

247
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:04,100
You can easily tell that just by
looking at how spoiled <i>you</i> are!

248
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,497
Huh?

249
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:17,707
Uh oh, I've used up too much strength,
and now I can't fly any more.

250
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:23,053
<i>His own son's grief aside,</i>

251
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:30,858
<i>Goku presses on in earnest along the long</i>
<i>road in search of Kaio-sama's guidance.</i>
