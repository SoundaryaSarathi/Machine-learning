Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.96,0:03:27.57,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,It is Emilia who lacks the\Npower to protect that domain.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.80,0:03:43.32,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,Allow me to correct one idea you have.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.32,0:03:45.53,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,Say the Witch's Cult does make a move.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.53,0:03:47.61,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,That what you say comes to pass.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.54,0:04:03.00,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,If you are a member of the Witch's Cult,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.00,0:04:04.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,it would make sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.17,0:04:04.75,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,That's bull—
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.75,0:04:07.66,Default,Rem,0000,0000,0000,,Crusch-sama, please do not make jokes.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.60,0:04:23.40,Default,Rem,0000,0000,0000,,Never.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.00,0:04:30.55,Default,Crusch,0000,0000,0000,,Regardless, I cannot lend\Nassistance to Emilia—
