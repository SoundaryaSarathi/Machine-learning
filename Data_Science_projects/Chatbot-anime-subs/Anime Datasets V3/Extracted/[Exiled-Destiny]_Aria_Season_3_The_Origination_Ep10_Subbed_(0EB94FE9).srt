1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,270
The moon is beautiful, isn't it?

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,940
Yes. It really soothes the heart.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,140
Fidget-fidget-fidget-fidget...

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,540
What's the matter, Aika?

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,940
Is something bothering you?

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,340
Eh?
Is something bothering you?

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,170
Anything at all?

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,410
Huh? Al?!
Anything at all?

9
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,840
Huh? Al?!

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,970
I-I'm not thinking of Al! He wasn't even
on my mind! I-It's absolutely nothing!

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,950
She's really a young maiden in love.

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,720
"Dear Ai, the summer heat has finally passed,"

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,450
"and little by little, Neo-Venezia
is being dyed in the colors of autumn."

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,220
"Today is Alice's first day working as a Prima!"

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,970
"So, Aika suggested we go see how she's
doing before we begin our usual practice..."

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,590
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,700
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,990
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,820
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:42,300
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,700
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,170
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:00,480
As the days begin to swirl in brilliant colors
Azayaka ni mawaridashita hibi

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:10,730
Always and forever, they're filled with love
Itsumo itsudemo ai ga michiteita

25
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,600
Surely, it's a spiral
Kitto supiraare

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:24,510
The days passed by, each one filled with warmth
Atataka na mainichi o kasanetara

27
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:33,550
And before I knew it, off in the distance...
Itsunomanika tooku ni

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,750
...there you were
Kiteita no ne

29
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,390
The Excitement on That Moon-Gazing Night...

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,800
Wow, this is so beautiful!

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,630
Our Undine is adorable, too!

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,800
T-T-Thank you very much.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,340
Hey, hey. Isn't that the Bridge of Sighs?

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,070
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was in the guidebook.

35
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,510
Up ahead is the Bridge of Sighs.

36
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,050
Ah, I knew it!

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,210
Because it's so beautiful
it makes you want to sigh!

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,020
No, its name actually comes from Manhome,
back when prisoners had to cross this bridge...

39
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,460
...after receiving their sentence at Doge's Palace,
and they would let out a deep sigh when they saw...

40
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,090
It's the sea!
...after receiving their sentence at Doge's Palace,
and they would let out a deep sigh when they saw...

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,490
It's the sea!

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,860
It's so pretty!

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,630
I'm glad we came here.

44
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,060
Definitely!

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Geez, could she be any more stiff?

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Alice...

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,570
It looks like she has a
clothes hanger for shoulders.

48
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,850
I had such a good time.

49
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,620
Me, too. We'll definitely come again!

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,610
Thank you very much!

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,790
At any rate, it seems like she
was able to satisfy her customers.

52
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,760
Thank goodness.

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry, President Aria!

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,570
President Aria, please hold it in!

55
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,040
Alice will notice we're here!

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,410
I really already noticed you.
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,150
Umm! We just happened to be passing by...

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,420
Right! We just happened to see you while
you were working and decided to watch...

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,080
You two... watched me... while I was working...

60
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,700
But, you know... You seem to
have managed it okay!

61
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,300
Yeah! It was very thoughtful of you to back up,
so that gentleman could see those cats.

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,930
Athena would have done the same...

63
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,040
You've been watching me for that long?

64
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,910
Spying on me is really not allowed!

65
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,880
Right...
Right...

66
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,210
But...

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,310
...other than that, everything else was bad.

68
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,760
Please tell me honestly what you thought!

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,190
Well, my thought was that
you looked like a toy robot.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
A robot?

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Your shoulders were so tense...

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,470
This is how you looked.

73
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:06,930
That's a zombie.
This is how you looked.

74
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,770
That's a zombie.

75
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,740
Wha-?!

76
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,260
Aika...

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,950
You know there's no time
to be depressed, right?

78
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,180
You're a Prima now.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,440
I...

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
I know!

81
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,860
Why don't we have a
moon-gazing party tonight?

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,130
Moon-gazing?

83
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah!

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,570
It's fall now, and the weather's nice today.

85
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,130
I'm sure the moon will look really beautiful!

86
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,940
Moon-gazing...

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,460
This... is the first time
I've ever been moon-gazing.

88
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,370
It's not a tradition we have here on Aqua.

89
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,360
Why are we having dumplings
at our moon-gazing party?

90
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,970
They're supposed to be
symbolic of Manhome's moon.

91
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,540
Well, in that case...

92
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,410
I'll have some, too.

93
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,180
Ah! Eating two at once is no fair!

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,890
Wha-?!

95
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,660
Then, I'll have four at once!

96
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,400
You can't beat me!

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't be so sure!

98
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,390
N-No more dumplings allowed!

99
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,620
You're really a glutton!

100
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,970
Pudgy-wudgy tummy...

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,220
President Maa, President Aria's pudgy-wudgy
tummy isn't a moon-gazing dumpling!

102
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,230
This is the brown rice tea that
the postman recommended.

103
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,290
It's delicious.

104
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,170
The season when warm drinks
taste great is finally here, isn't it?

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,270
Come to think of it, Al is late, isn't he?

106
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,610
Since when was Al supposed to join us?

107
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,550
Wasn't the moon-gazing party
just for the three of us?

108
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,460
A-An event about the moon and stars
wouldn't be complete without Al, right?

109
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,220
Maybe he could teach us a thing or two.

110
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,820
Oh? Is that so?

111
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,060
W-What's with that face?!

112
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,900
Since you weren't there that night
when we all saw the meteor shower,

113
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,300
I invited Al so you could catch up!

114
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,830
Oh?

115
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,870
I'll go get him.

116
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,410
I bet he's late because of work again.

117
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,770
He might be lost somewhere, too.

118
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,840
See you later!
See you later!

119
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,940
Aika is really cute.

120
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,980
Akari...

121
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,700
Thank you very much for inviting me today.

122
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,870
Gazing up at the moon like this...

123
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,840
...is somehow calming.

124
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,540
Tomorrow, if I can be like the moon
and keep this sense of tranquility,

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,940
I think I'll be able to do much better.

126
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,820
Alice, would you like some more tea?

127
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,020
Yes, please.

128
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,030
Huh? Where's President Maa?

129
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,620
President Maa!

130
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,470
There he is!

131
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,870
Al!

132
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,780
Aika!

133
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,080
You're late.

134
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,490
I'm sorry! I had to stay late and work.

135
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,090
Honestly. No overworking allowed!

136
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,820
Yeah, sorry about that.

137
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,610
Well, if there's one good
thing about me being late...

138
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,410
...it's that now, we have the
still of the night all to ourselves.

139
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,630
Aika, that's dangerous!

140
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,860
It's fine, it's fine!

141
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,230
Are you all right, Aika?!

142
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,610
I-I think so...

143
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:18,810
Here, grab my hand.
I-I think so...

144
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,540
Here, grab my hand.

145
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,940
I'm sorry about this.

146
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,070
Huh?

147
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,960
I-I'm sorry...

148
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,420
W-Why are you apologizing?

149
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,170
It's my fault for weighing so much, after all...

150
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,530
It's a good thing the city's wells have
dried up and are no longer in use, but...

151
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,780
...I think we're still in trouble.

152
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,110
What should we do?

153
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,670
A long time ago, before
the city had a water system...

154
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,670
...I heard they used to collect rainwater in the wells
in each plaza, and used that for drinking water.

155
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,970
It must have been lively when housewives gathered
to fetch water in the morning, and again at night.

156
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,480
I bet there were a lot of
"wellside gossip meetings"!

157
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,390
Ow, ow, ow...

158
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,690
It's no use.

159
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,730
Looks that way...

160
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,560
President Maa!

161
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,030
Yay! We're saved!

162
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,090
Hey, President Maa! Go get Junior!

163
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,670
President Maa?

164
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,880
President Maa, are you listening?

165
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,710
Go-get-Jun-ior-and-bring-her-back...

166
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,650
And why did you jump down?

167
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,990
Listen, President Maa!

168
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,690
Go get Junior, on the double!

169
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,000
Go!

170
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,560
What?!
What?!

171
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
Why'd you come back?!

172
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
Now look, President Maa!

173
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,230
It's no use. She's still a kitten, after all.

174
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,000
It's okay! President Maa is a fine Aqua Cat
that can understand human language!

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,670
I have no doubt... she'll get...
Junior... to come... for us...

176
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,850
At any rate, you're the only one who can help us!

177
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,780
Please, go!

178
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,180
Yes!

179
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,380
You can do it!

180
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,690
Yes, that's the spirit! Keep it up!

181
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,280
Please do your best!

182
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,890
Keep going, keep going!

183
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,390
Just a little more!
Keep going, keep going!

184
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,360
Just a little more!

185
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,760
Please do your best!

186
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,850
Almost there!

187
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,820
She did it!
She did it!

188
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,530
Do you really think we can count on her?

189
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,400
Probably not...

190
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,010
Ah, the moon...

191
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,920
What a strange moon-gazing
this turned out to be...

192
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,800
I wonder why the moon revolves around Aqua?

193
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,470
It's because of the forces
of attraction and repulsion.

194
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,550
As I've explained before,
the force of attraction...

195
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,510
...and the centrifugal force created by the moon's
rotation around Aqua, maintain a perfect balance.

196
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:31,560
Unable to get closer or move farther away,
the moon just goes around and around.

197
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,620
Sounds like a certain someone...

198
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,810
The outer moon is used as a space station, among
other things, by several different fields of study.

199
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,780
They mine minerals and perform chemical
experiments which can only be done in a vacuum.

200
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,490
Oh, did you know? Back on Manhome, it's said their
moon's craters resemble many different shapes.

201
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,760
For example, some say it looks like a crab
with huge claws, or an old woman knitting,

202
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,360
or a lion, or a woman's profile,
or rabbits pounding rice cakes...

203
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,130
Ah, speaking of rabbits, that reminds me!

204
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,070
I hear the "Rabbit-Pounded Rice Cakes"
sold at the space station are really tasty!

205
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,740
I've been wanting to try them,
so I mail-ordered some the other day.

206
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,110
They also come with a haiku collection book
about the moon, so I'm really looking forward to it!

207
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,240
Not allowed!!

208
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,010
Ehh?! What is?

209
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,010
All of that! It's not allowed!

210
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,110
S-Sorry.

211
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,050
Honestly!

212
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,610
At any rate, it's quite dark in this well, isn't it?

213
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,890
Al...

214
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,860
...by any chance, are you scared?

215
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,090
That can't be, right?

216
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:19,030
Gnomes are always working in the dark
and can see really well at night, so...

217
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,360
Well...

218
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,740
Since there's no sunlight, the lighting
infrastructure underground is quite advanced...

219
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,250
Al, you're so cute!

220
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,710
It's all right! Big Sis is here with you!

221
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,690
There are two moons now.

222
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,670
The inner moon is approximately
1.8 times bigger than the outer moon,

223
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,500
and it flies around in a
geostationary orbit over Aqua.

224
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,480
The inner moon completes its orbit
around Aqua in under eight hours...

225
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,290
...and revolves in a very close orbit,
only 5,900 kilometers above Aqua's sky.

226
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:25,290
That distance is just 1165th of the distance
between Manhome and its moon.

227
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,970
It's really close, isn't it?

228
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,470
Yes.

229
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,610
The small moon that got too close...

230
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,450
...will be drawn in by
Aqua's influence, and in time...

231
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,120
...it will surely break into pieces...

232
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,310
Why are you crying?

233
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,590
It's too close...

234
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,260
It may seem like it's just the
moon that's affected by Aqua...

235
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,100
...but the thing closest
to Aqua is that very moon.

236
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,350
So Aqua is under the
influence of the moon, as well.

237
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,990
Al...

238
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,690
It's ruined!!

239
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,320
A-Aika!
It's ruined!!

240
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,620
A-Aika!

241
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,650
What's ruined?

242
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,820
Aika, are you all right?

243
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,740
Ahhhhh!!

244
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,110
I'm so glad we found you, Aika.

245
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,780
I can't believe you fell
down into a well like that.

246
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,280
Well, excuse me!

247
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,380
Is that how you talk to your rescuers?

248
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,760
Sorry.

249
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm grateful to President Maa.

250
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,590
As you should be.

251
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,700
By the way, when did you two get there?

252
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,830
Right at the "It's ruined!" part.

253
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,490
So, what was ruined?

254
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,240
It's because of centrifugal force!

255
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,440
If you're afraid of getting close and
just flail around, it makes you hungry!

256
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Huh?

257
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,080
That really makes no sense.

258
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,390
Al...

259
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes.

260
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,490
It's the force of attraction.

261
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,210
No sappy lines allowed.

262
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,610
Okay.

263
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,680
Let's eat.

264
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,410
It's delicious!

265
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,880
By the way, what was sappy?

266
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,890
A-AI made a sappy old man joke!

267
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh?

268
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,330
What?

269
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,630
So, what was ruined?

270
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,900
Y-You're asking even though you already know...

271
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,500
"Ai, it was an impromptu moon-gazing party..."
Y-You're asking even though you already know...

272
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,600
"Ai, it was an impromptu moon-gazing party..."

273
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,730
"...but it brought out everyone's familiar smiles,
and ended up being a fun autumn evening."

274
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,910
"Akari, if the moon has the force of attraction,
maybe it has other wonderful powers, too?"

275
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,710
"I'd love to join you all next autumn!"

276
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,350
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

277
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:46,990
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

278
00:22:49,800 --> 00:23:00,940
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

279
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:09,820
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

280
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:23,300
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

281
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:32,260
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

282
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:45,620
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

283
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,090
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

284
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:57,220
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

285
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,600
And my day begins
Hajimaru
