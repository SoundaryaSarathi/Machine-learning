Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.45,0:06:41.98,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Can I ask why this one can't be removed?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.98,0:06:43.70,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,That's simple, I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.70,0:06:48.89,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,Too many curses have been placed on you, \Nmaking it too complex to remove.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.22,0:06:55.95,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,When there's only one, removing it \Nis as simple as untying a knot.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.95,0:07:00.52,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,But the curses on you are a complex \Nweb of many threads,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.52,0:07:02.10,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,too tangled to undo.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.54,0:07:05.24,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I get the idea that it's high in difficulty.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.24,0:07:07.03,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,But why half a day?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.03,0:07:11.35,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,After half a day, mabeasts replenish \Nmana by activating their spells.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.11,0:07:16.83,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,The curse those mabeasts used drains \Na target's mana, I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.61,0:07:21.17,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,In other words, they made you mabeast food.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.40,0:07:25.10,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,So they attack people because they're hungry?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.10,0:07:28.67,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,That's a wild animal for you. \NSo simple-minded!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.67,0:07:32.84,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,I guess we should be thankful they haven't \Ngotten hungry before now...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.23,0:07:40.74,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,I'm telling you how much time \Nyou have left, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.23,0:07:43.12,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Well, sure, I'm scared.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.12,0:07:47.05,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,But I doubt you came here just \Nto tell me I'm going to die.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.05,0:07:48.90,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,I don't think you're that mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.42,0:07:52.54,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,What do you know about me, I suppose?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.25,0:07:59.38,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,You make no sense!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.23,0:08:03.95,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,But it's a fact that the chance for you \Nto be saved is much lower now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.95,0:08:07.96,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Tell me... Just how low it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.32,0:08:11.53,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,We're talking about eating \Nby means of a spell.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.53,0:08:13.60,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,If the one that's eating dies,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.60,0:08:15.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,logic says the meal would \Nbe canceled, I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.24,0:08:18.24,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,So that's it...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.24,0:08:21.67,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,I just have to kill the things that cursed me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.79,0:08:26.36,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,But there are too many of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.93,0:08:31.44,Default,Beatrice,0000,0000,0000,,That's why Bubby hasn't told \Nthat silly girl about the curse.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.44,0:08:35.48,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, if Emilia knew, she'd definitely try \Nto do more than she's capable of...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.48,0:08:37.98,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Which makes me really happy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.98,0:08:39.85,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,but also really scared.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.85,0:08:41.85,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Man, the difficulty level \Nis seriously demonic!
