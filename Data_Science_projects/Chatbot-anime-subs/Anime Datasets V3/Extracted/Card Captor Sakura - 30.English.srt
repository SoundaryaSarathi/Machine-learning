1
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,140
We can’t catch up!

2
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,645
It’s definitely “Dash”!

3
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:23,475
When it’s about speed nobody can win it!

4
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:25,518
Then, can we really catch it?

5
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:28,422
Don’t worry!
It’s only good at short-range.

6
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:31,922
We’ve come to a clearing!

7
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:33,751
Windy!

8
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:36,956
Got it!

9
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,696
Oh no, if it keeps trying to get away,
it’ll get hurt!

10
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:49,836
What a pity!

11
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:57,680
[Sakura and the Injured Card]

12
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,192
I think it came this way.

13
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:09,062
Sakura, do you feel its aura?

14
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,835
I feel it coming from there,
but it’s really weak.

15
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,230
It was struggling really
hard against Windy earlier.

16
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:20,163
It’s just over this wall, huh?

17
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:21,802
Here’s your chance to catch it.

18
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,952
I must look like a thief.

19
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,320
Someone’s coming!

20
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:41,919
Over here, was it?

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,723
Yes, there was
a weird looking girl

22
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:46,760
coming out of the park.

23
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:48,064
A girl?

24
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,404
Right, and she had
a weird outfit on, too!

25
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:51,998
Weird?

26
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:53,772
I think it’s cute.

27
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:54,540
Shuu!

28
00:01:58,847 --> 00:01:59,905
We’ll have to give up for now.

29
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:03,713
Dash is probably hurt,
so it can’t be too far from here.

30
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:04,744
Right.

31
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,461
Rei, what did you say?

32
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:21,126
Something came over the wall.
I think it was that cat.

33
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:27,141
Don’t be scared. Come here.

34
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:31,537
What’s wrong?

35
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,750
Are you hurt? Hang on a sec!

36
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:45,686
There you go.

37
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:54,594
What kind of animal are you?
I’ve never seen anything like you.

38
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:57,764
How cute!

39
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,848
The aura of that Clow Card…

40
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,873
That looks great!

41
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,287
But why baseball?

42
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,961
It’s your way in.

43
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,397
How’s your leg?

44
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:36,504
Excuse me! Could I get my ball?

45
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:40,241
Did you lose this ball?

46
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,110
Don’t you know

47
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,109
You’re not supposed to
play baseball in the park?

48
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:49,180
That’s right,
I’m in a baseball uniform.

49
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,387
Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.

50
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:54,855
Here’s your ball.

51
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,061
Be careful from now on.

52
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,830
I will. Thank you very much.

53
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,138
The plan failed, didn’t it.

54
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,674
That’s the way it is.
I’ll come back after school.

55
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:15,539
Thanks for waiting!

56
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:16,545
Here.

57
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,574
Thanks.

58
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,220
Actually, I thought of a new plan.

59
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:22,384
What kind?

60
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:25,191
This time… Over there…

61
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,568
She’s the one from this morning.

62
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:35,630
Ready!

63
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,468
Start!

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,105
Go for it!

65
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:08,900
Hello there.

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,066
You’re the baseball
girl from this morning.

67
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:14,866
You’re in the cheerleading club?

68
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:15,742
Yep!

69
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:17,941
Tachibana…

70
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,344
…your turn again in the 100 meters.

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,409
Okay!

72
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:26,977
Doesn’t look too good.

73
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:38,994
Ready!

74
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:40,292
Start!

75
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:47,735
So fast!

76
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,017
That’s great, Tachibana!

77
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:58,843
A personal best!

78
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,216
Really?

79
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,116
13.2.

80
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:03,612
That’s great, Rei!

81
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,925
Beat it by a full second! Wow!

82
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:08,853
Sakura…

83
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,693
So this Rei girl was
aided by the Card, huh?

84
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,938
Dash’s power is running fast, after all.

85
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,566
This just makes it harder to seal it.

86
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,499
Oh!

87
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:28,678
We meet again.

88
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,279
I’m home!

89
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:34,652
Welcome home.

90
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:37,751
You know, today I ran a great race!

91
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,253
Really? That’s great!

92
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:42,221
Your friends?

93
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,932
Oh, from Tomoeda Elementary, um…

94
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,924
4th grade class 2, Kinomoto Sakura.

95
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,535
Elementary School Track
and Field Tournament?

96
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:55,636
Yeah, I haven’t been running well lately,
so I didn’t have much confidence…

97
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,436
…but I turned things around today!

98
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:58,970
So you entered?

99
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,176
If I run like I did today,

100
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,412
I might have a chance!

101
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,739
You were really fast!

102
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,846
Thanks. It’s all thanks to Pee Wee.

103
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,014
Pee Wee?

104
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,751
It jumped in here last night.

105
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:14,694
It looks a lot like that stuffed animal,
if it were alive.

106
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,121
It was hurt yesterday,
so I put it in a cage.

107
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,424
Hurt?

108
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:21,363
It feels like my fast running today

109
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:24,236
was because of Pee Wee.

110
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:25,603
It’s the Card’s influence.

111
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,300
Weird, isn’t it?

112
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,244
That’s not it at all!

113
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:32,803
It’s your good luck charm, right?

114
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,973
Yeah. Sakura,

115
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,907
is yours like a good luck charm, too?

116
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:40,751
Um, a good luck charm

117
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,053
or a mascot, or…

118
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:44,923
Oh yeah! Do you guys
want to meet Pee Wee?

119
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:45,982
Eh!

120
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,019
Here’s our chance!

121
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:54,328
That’s right! I need to buy
some stuff for dinner!

122
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,134
Please let us see it next time!

123
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:57,465
O… okay…

124
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:58,835
Thanks for having us over.

125
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,674
Good luck at the Track
and Field Tournament, OK?

126
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:04,372
Come again.

127
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,371
Sure.

128
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,785
We were so close.

129
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,848
I can’t seal the Card
in front of Rei, anyway.

130
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:20,955
Maybe so,

131
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:24,354
but we can’t leave the card
with that girl either.

132
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,522
Yes.

133
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,463
I guess we have
to try to sneak in again.

134
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:31,163
But…

135
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,604
What’s wrong?

136
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:41,040
Don’t be scared.
Everything’s all right.

137
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,212
Don’t be scared.

138
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,390
13 seconds flat?!

139
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:05,071
I did it! I did it!

140
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,802
Another school record, right?

141
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:08,765
Yep!

142
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:10,906
Fast, isn’t she?

143
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,779
They say she should win the 100 meters

144
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,182
at the next Track and Field Tournament.

145
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:19,211
Wow. She’s a 6th grader, right?

146
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:20,779
What’s her name?

147
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,180
Tachibana Rei.

148
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,251
She’s faster than the boys, isn’t she?

149
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,722
Speaking of the Track
and Field Tournament…

150
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,361
…they say she’s looking very good.

151
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh,

152
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:36,194
Sakura.

153
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:38,333
W… what?

154
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,103
We’re going to the tournament next week.

155
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:41,940
Eh?

156
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,772
The cheerleading club is going to

157
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:46,043
The Track and Field Tournament to root.

158
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:47,639
Really…

159
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:50,746
Let’s go root for Tachibana!

160
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:51,446
Okay!

161
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:54,079
Rooting? “Rooting” you see,

162
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,080
comes from the ancient Roman
classics… In war, the sea would
overwhelm many boats.

163
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,721
When people cried for help,
an angel would lend a hand.

164
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:06,029
As more and more ships heard about this,
they’d cry out more.

165
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,793
Their cries for help became known
as today’s “rooting.”

166
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:09,594
Another lie.

167
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:12,402
It’s true. I hear that…

168
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:24,117
Working hard, I see.
Let’s call it a day.

169
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:25,043
Okay.

170
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:31,089
Sakura!

171
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,919
You’re in the cheerleading club, right?

172
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,797
You’re coming to the tournament
next week?

173
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:39,256
Root for me!

174
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,598
Okay.

175
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,233
Tachibana!

176
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:43,568
I’ll be right there!

177
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:46,536
Pee Wee’s gotten a lot better,

178
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,130
so come on over
to see him sometime.

179
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:49,466
O… okay…

180
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:50,736
Later!

181
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:05,022
I guess I can’t do it.

182
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:06,591
What’re you talking about?!

183
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,693
Let’s wait until after the Track
and Field Tournament to seal it.

184
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:14,262
Our best chance is
while it’s still weak!

185
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:15,932
I know that,

186
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:20,372
but Rei was saying that she’s
running well because of Pee Wee, right?

187
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,033
So let’s wait until after
the tournament to seal it…

188
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,575
If you wait until next week,
the injury will heal

189
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,474
and it’ll be harder than ever to catch!

190
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:31,408
Don’t worry, I’ll give it my all!

191
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,115
But, Sakura…

192
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:35,386
Let’s go home.

193
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:41,292
I understand how you feel, Sakura.

194
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,590
But if not for the magic,
none of this would have happened.

195
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:48,566
I know.

196
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:06,481
The Track and Field Tournament
is this Sunday, right?

197
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:07,553
Yes.

198
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,022
I need to make lunch, right?

199
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,514
I can do it myself.

200
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,555
I have some important things to
take care of at the University…

201
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,890
…so I’ll make your
lunch when I make mine.

202
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,526
You competing?

203
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,834
No, I’m going there to root
with the cheerleading club.

204
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:25,666
Who’s competing from Tomoeda?

205
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:28,506
A girl from the 6th grade.

206
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,167
Wow, that’s something.

207
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,414
Actually, last year, Touya qualified

208
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,284
to go to the Interhigh in the 100 meters.

209
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:40,244
You were in that?

210
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:41,415
Nope.

211
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:43,987
But he was good enough to.

212
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,793
He won the school

213
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:50,459
and the regional tournaments…
but he didn’t go to the Interhigh.

214
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:51,524
Why not?

215
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,023
Didn’t want to miss work.

216
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,035
Really sounds like Touya, doesn’t it?

217
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,369
Too bad, I would’ve rooted for you.

218
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,865
If you’re rooting for that girl,

219
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:03,966
I’m sure she’ll do her best.

220
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,278
That would be nice…

221
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,715
Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray! To-mo-e-da!

222
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,687
Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray! To-mo-e-da!

223
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:23,661
Tachibana’s about to run!

224
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:24,926
You’re right!

225
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:49,617
Wow…

226
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:51,857
She’s really fast.

227
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,361
Thanks for helping me, Shao Lan.

228
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:01,160
Shao Lan?

229
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:07,171
What’s wrong?

230
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:09,006
Nothing.

231
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:16,445
If you keep this up,

232
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,078
you’ll do fine in the tournament
day after tomorrow.

233
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:19,042
I’ll do my best!

234
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:20,019
All right,

235
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:21,877
everyone, one more time from the top!

236
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:23,455
Okay!

237
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:25,755
Day after tomorrow…

238
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,591
Looks like you healed up just fine.

239
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,155
That’s great!

240
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,399
You know, I set another
school record today.

241
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:41,274
Ever since you came here,

242
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,676
everything’s been going well.

243
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:50,510
Hey, Sakura…
you really should seal Dash

244
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,418
Before the tournament.

245
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,417
You can’t let
that girl think she’s fast

246
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,622
because of Dash’s power, can you?

247
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,624
Li-kun?

248
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:10,403
Over there… is Rei’s house!

249
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,233
Root for me, Pee Wee.

250
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,109
He must’ve found Dash!

251
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,310
I’m positive. It’s this house.

252
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,095
Oh, Pee Wee.

253
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:45,994
How funny!

254
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,468
That’s…

255
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:03,045
Don’t!

256
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:04,491
Dash!

257
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:05,483
Pee Wee!

258
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,188
Hold it!

259
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:08,050
Li-kun!

260
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,835
Li-kun, wait!

261
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:28,141
Lightning, come forth. Attack!

262
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:41,491
Sakura, seal it!

263
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,123
But if I seal it, Rei will…

264
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:45,589
Don’t you get it?

265
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,829
If she wins because of magic,

266
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,600
it won’t be due to her own ability!

267
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:50,765
Is that what you want?!

268
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,629
Can you really
congratulate her for that?!

269
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:57,970
Sakura!

270
00:16:58,378 --> 00:16:59,037
Hurry up and seal it!

271
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:01,303
Rei…

272
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:02,507
What’s wrong?

273
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:04,245
Sakura!

274
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,382
Release!

275
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:22,259
Return to thy true form,
Clow Card!

276
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:42,116
You knew this card
was at that house?

277
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,089
Then why?

278
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,628
Pee Wee! Pee Wee!

279
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,096
Pee Wee, where are you?

280
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:02,640
You did the right thing.

281
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,513
So, see you tomorrow.

282
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,122
Bye bye!

283
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:52,658
She did it!
Tachibana made it to the finals!

284
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,824
That’s great!

285
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:04,231
She’ll be fine,

286
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,096
she practiced so hard.

287
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,435
Next up are the finals
for the girls’ 100 meters.

288
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,309
Be careful at the start.

289
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,277
Right.

290
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,579
Pee Wee…

291
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,614
Rei, go for it!

292
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,413
Ready!

293
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,271
She did it! She did it!

294
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:28,846
Li-kun!

295
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:33,017
Did you just use the Dash card?

296
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,656
Do you think that
6th grader got first place

297
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,257
with the power of the Card?

298
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:39,222
Huh? But…

299
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,100
You can’t use the Card’s
power in that way.

300
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,963
So I didn’t do anything.

301
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,870
Just a little encouragement.

302
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,308
It wasn’t magic,

303
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,146
Rei did it on her own.

304
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,410
The winner of the girls’ 100 meters…

305
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,515
…from Tomoeda Elementary School,
Rei Tachibana!

306
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,351
Go, Go, Ta-chi-ba-na!

307
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:17,162
Go, Go, Ta-chi-ba-na!

308
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:19,266
Sakura!

309
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:25,277
Rei, congratulations!
