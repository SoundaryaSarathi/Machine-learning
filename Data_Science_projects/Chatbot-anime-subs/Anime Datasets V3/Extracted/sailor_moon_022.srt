1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,303
My first kiss under the moonlight
with my adored Tuxedo Mask!

2
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:12,041
And yet, and yet...

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,277
How dare Nephrite show up and
ruin the nice romantic mood?!

4
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:19,475
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

6
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

7
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

8
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

9
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,293
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

10
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

11
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:35,807
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

13
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

14
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,495
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

15
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,239
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

16
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,408
and fight against bad guys.

17
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:06,572
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:12,378
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

19
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:15,821
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

20
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,517
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

21
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:21,016
But anyway, I just have
to do my best!

22
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:32,169
Romance Under the Moon!
Usagi's First Kiss

23
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:40,737
Oh, I'm so late!
Wow, a check point?

24
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:46,479
Is there something going on today?

25
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:49,288
Oh, Naru, good morning!

26
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:50,656
Good morning.

27
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,954
What's wrong? You look kind of down.

28
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:54,893
Yeah...

29
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:59,298
Naru.

30
00:02:59,298 --> 00:02:59,565
Yes, Sir?
Naru.

31
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:00,466
Yes, Sir?

32
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:00,800
Yes, Sir?
You're the cutest girl at
Juban Junior High.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,869
You're the cutest girl at
Juban Junior High.

34
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:07,930
Reveal yourself! Show me
who you really are!

35
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,706
I don't understand. What in the world
does Mr. Sanjoin think of me?

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,381
Naru, wake up! We're
going to be late!

37
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,716
Hurry, Naru!

38
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,060
Made it!

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,426
Hey, Miss Usagi, did you know?

40
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:35,701
The first princess of the Diamond
Kingdom is visiting Japan!

41
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,403
Diamond Kingdom?

42
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:40,539
It's the country that produces
the most gems in the world.

43
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,876
I heard they're holding a dinner
party tonight at the embassy.

44
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,412
So, that's why they were doing
all those inspections.

45
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:49,281
Princess Diamond will be inheriting
the legendary secret treasure

46
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:52,151
that has been passed down
through the Royal Family.

47
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,154
And that secret treasure is apparently
going to be introduced

48
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:56,989
to the world for the first time
at the dinner party!

49
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,288
Secret treasure... I wonder how
amazing it could be?

50
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:04,495
It's no use! I can't imagine it!

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,366
I'll go look at it and let you know.

52
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,601
What?

53
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:11,237
My family runs a jewelry shop,
remember?

54
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:15,697
So, I got a hold of a special invitation
to the dinner party.

55
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:20,138
Wow! Naru, you're so lucky!
I wish I could go, too!

56
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,886
"The final mystery of the century
will be revealed tonight!"

57
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:27,286
The Final Mystery of the Century will be
Princess Diamond Hates the Media!
"The final mystery of the century
will be revealed tonight!"

58
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:30,723
The Final Mystery of the Century will be
Princess Diamond Hates the Media!
"Princess Diamond visits with the
legendary secret treasure"

59
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:32,892
The Final Mystery of the Century will be
Princess Diamond Hates the Media!
"Of the Diamond Kingdom's
Royal Family!"

60
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,793
A legendary secret treasure...

61
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:42,334
The legendary secret treasure
of the Diamond Kingdom...

62
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:45,497
It could be the legendary
Silver Crystal.

63
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:48,207
I shall look into it.

64
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,107
Leave that to me!

65
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:54,146
Nephrite, don't interfere!

66
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,682
Searching for the legendary
Silver Crystal is my job!

67
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:59,418
The Earth is under my jurisdiction.

68
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:00,942
What?!

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,920
I will look into it!
Please leave this to me!

70
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:08,027
Nephrite, if the Diamond Kingdom's
legendary secret treasure

71
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:11,019
turns out to be the Silver Crystal,
it will be a pleasant surprise.

72
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,868
With the power of the Silver Crystal,
we shall revive our great ruler

73
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:19,998
and our Dark Kingdom will
dominate the world!

74
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,608
But my lady...

75
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,374
Nephrite, what is your plan?

76
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,542
I have my way of taking care
of business. Just watch.

77
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,322
Nephrite has failed every time!
Why did you assign him to this?!

78
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:40,258
He is in a tough situation,
and he is very desperate now.

79
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,437
Zoisite, the impatient always lose.

80
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,412
But, Master Kunzite...

81
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:04,280
Nephrite can be ousted
any time we please.

82
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:08,350
We shall take this opportunity to
see just how skilled he is.

83
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,391
What? A princess?

84
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:18,464
Yes. I'm thinking that the princess
of the Diamond Kingdom

85
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:22,628
just might be the princess
we've been looking for.

86
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:24,170
No way!

87
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,129
Not necessarily. We can't completely
ignore Luna's intuition.

88
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,309
I think there is a need to
check into this.

89
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:31,343
How?

90
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:34,613
Princess Diamond is surrounded
by lots of bodyguards.

91
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:38,811
And we can't get into the hall that
the dinner party's being held at.

92
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,685
We know all that!

93
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:45,880
Our mission is to use our brains to
find a way around that, remember?!

94
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:50,585
Rei, you don't have to pin me
with such a scary look!

95
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,029
Don't cry to gloss things over!

96
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,706
Anyway, let's go to an area close
to the dinner party tonight.

97
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:04,343
And we'll wait for a chance to check
whether Princess Diamond

98
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:07,972
really is the princess we've
been looking for.

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,747
Okay.

100
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:15,314
Usagi, I need you to have a more
passionate sense of duty!

101
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:17,957
I'm home!

102
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,024
Welcome back!

103
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,061
Oh, Dad, what's up? Why are
you all dressed up?

104
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:25,531
I'm going to the Diamond
Kingdom embassy.

105
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:31,804
What?! The dinner party?! No fair!
I wanna get in, too!

106
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:35,341
Dad's going there as a magazine
reporter. It's work.

107
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:37,935
Later. I'll tell you everything
when I get back.

108
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,103
I'm going to get inside, no
matter what! Oh, I know!

109
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:45,012
What are you going to do?

110
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,852
Oh, you can't!

111
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:54,155
Moon Power! Turn me into
a pretty princess!

112
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:10,403
Look at my dress! It's wonderful!

113
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,879
Honestly! You can't use
the transforming pen

114
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,006
like it's some kind of toy!

115
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,311
You're wrong!

116
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,552
I have a mission!

117
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:23,522
I did this so I can find out
if Princess Diamond

118
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:26,225
is the princess we've
been looking for.

119
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,692
Really?

120
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,397
This is useless.

121
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,436
The Silver Crystal...

122
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:45,877
Look for the Silver Crystal!

123
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:51,041
What is the Silver Crystal?

124
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:58,786
It's the same dream again.

125
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,262
Diamond Kingdom Embassy

126
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,428
So, this is the place for
the dinner party.

127
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:12,504
Oh, Usagi!

128
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:13,172
Usagi!
Oh, Usagi!

129
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:13,572
Usagi!

130
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:15,335
Excuse me, your invitation?

131
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:19,278
I am the princess of the
Ivanovich Kingdom!

132
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:21,747
What? Ivanovich Kingdom?

133
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:23,715
Talk about close.

134
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:29,054
Wow! A masquerade!

135
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:31,784
It's wonderful! It's like something
from a foreign movie!

136
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:47,934
That is Naru Osaka.

137
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,873
This is perfect.

138
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,006
Excuse me, Miss, would you
please dance with me?

139
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,882
What?

140
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:58,349
It's me.

141
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:01,853
Mr. Sanjoin!

142
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,622
Did you come here by yourself?

143
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:04,356
Yes...
Did you come here by yourself?

144
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:04,890
Yes...

145
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,458
I came here in place of my mom.

146
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,222
I never expected to see you here.

147
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,324
You have made my day!

148
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,123
Mr. Sanjoin.

149
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:29,808
Oh, lucky Naru. She's already
found a partner.

150
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:34,119
She looks just like Usagi.

151
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,790
I wonder if Usagi will be as beautiful
when she grows up?

152
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,358
Oh, it's Dad!

153
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,088
He's taking pictures without
even realizing who I am.

154
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:44,963
Excuse me!

155
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:45,931
Oh, no!
Excuse me!

156
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:46,420
Oh, no!

157
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,972
If the Diamond Kingdom's secret
treasure is the Silver Crystal,

158
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,810
and if I can get a hold of it, I will
surely find out who I am.

159
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,013
Let's see... Let's see...

160
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:08,012
That girl...

161
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,123
In a distant past...

162
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:25,034
I feel like I've seen her before.

163
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,619
Mr. Sanjoin is so wonderful.

164
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,019
I don't care what happens
to me anymore.

165
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:46,758
You are like a star shining
in the heavens!

166
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,452
Please look at me.

167
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:51,862
Yes...

168
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,938
Naru Osaka, you are now
under my control!

169
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,685
Yes.

170
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:48,721
I transformed into a princess,
but it's no fun if I'm alone.

171
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,056
Would you care to dance?

172
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:50,657
Oh, Tuxedo Mask!
Would you care to dance?

173
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,249
Oh, Tuxedo Mask!

174
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,033
No way! It can't be! How could
this be? It's like a dream!

175
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:09,469
What is this? It's strange...

176
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:15,309
I feel like I've danced with him
before, a long time ago.

177
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,557
Who are you?

178
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:28,425
I'm Naru! I'm a friend of
Princess Diamond!

179
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:30,456
What did you say?

180
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:36,769
Everyone is just interested in
the secret treasure.

181
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,067
I only wish I was more beautiful...

182
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:42,671
I know I'm just a throw-in with
the secret treasure.

183
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:47,847
Princess, someone calling
herself your friend...

184
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:51,044
I'm Naru! May I come in?

185
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,078
Oh, please!

186
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,994
You seem like a fun person.
May I help you?

187
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,360
All I want is the legendary
secret treasure!

188
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,838
What's going on?

189
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,815
Move! Out of my way!

190
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,874
The legendary secret treasure is mine!

191
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:26,686
Princess Diamond!

192
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,421
Something is wrong!

193
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,150
Has she lost her mind?

194
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,497
Usagi, it's terrible! Terrible!

195
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,233
Princess Diamond has gone to the
balcony with the secret treasure!

196
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,700
What?!

197
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,632
Oh, Nephrite!

198
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,211
Oh, Princess Diamond,
please wake up!

199
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:53,146
Let go!

200
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:54,213
I'm falling!
Let go!

201
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:54,804
I'm falling!

202
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,345
Usagi!

203
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,081
Tuxedo Mask?

204
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:09,588
Both of you can fall and die together!

205
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,864
It seems like something is going on.

206
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:25,378
Tuxedo Mask, you're always in my way!

207
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:28,381
Just think you're lucky to die
with a beautiful princess!

208
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,508
Fire Soul!

209
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:38,246
My Tuxedo Mask will
live on forever!

210
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,154
It's all over!

211
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,478
Shoot!

212
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:03,011
Stop, Nephrite!

213
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,775
Who are you?!

214
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,713
I would like to know
who I am as well.

215
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:13,686
To do that, I must solve the mystery
of the legendary Silver Crystal!

216
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,262
Are you our enemy or our ally?

217
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:22,196
If we are looking for the same thing,
I could be your enemy.

218
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:27,570
Tuxedo Mask!

219
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,575
Usagi, hurry!

220
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,133
Oh, right!

221
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:35,339
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

222
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,487
What could have happened?

223
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:17,923
This is an unexpected incident!
This is a huge scoop!

224
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:26,327
Come back to life, my other self!

225
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,407
Clear the way!

226
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:37,865
Any who disobey shall be sacrificed
to the great ruler!

227
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,337
What is this?!

228
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:52,658
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

229
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,560
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!

230
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,460
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

231
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,868
I'll never forgive you for possessing
the innocent Princess Diamond!

232
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,074
The legendary secret treasure,
the Silver Crystal, is mine!

233
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:09,598
The Silver Crystal?

234
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,416
Begone, Evil Spirit

235
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:24,982
Begone, Evil Spirit

236
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,768
Oh, Nephrite!

237
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:45,177
Suffer and die!

238
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,913
I can't move!

239
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,048
We'll die at this rate!

240
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:51,384
I'll see if I can do something about it!

241
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,784
Bubble

242
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,447
Spray!

243
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,265
How shameless of you to mislead
Princess Diamond!

244
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,357
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

245
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,911
Moon Tiara Action!

246
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,897
We did it!

247
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,534
Princess, are you all right?

248
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,803
What have I been doing?

249
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:52,934
By any chance, could you
be our princess?

250
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,840
My glasses... I cannot see anything
without my glasses.

251
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:01,447
Excuse me, Princess Diamond, you're
our princess, aren't you?

252
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,956
The cat! The cat spoke!

253
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:10,296
I guess she's not our princess.

254
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,763
Yeah!

255
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:14,567
What have we been doing?

256
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,091
I have no idea.

257
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:20,037
Oh! My precious film!

258
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

259
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,046
And now, Princess Diamond will reveal

260
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:30,379
the world's final legendary
secret treasure.

261
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:45,291
What have I been doing?

262
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:49,335
A 2,000 karat diamond.

263
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,270
It is a statue of the Diamond
Kingdom's first princess.

264
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,167
What a waste of time.

265
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:06,681
Looks like we're back to square one
with our search for the princess.

266
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,153
Oh? Where's Usagi?

267
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:14,125
I'm so exhausted!
Time for some juice.

268
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:19,465
Oh, this is so delicious.

269
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:21,296
Oh, excuse me.

270
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:38,050
In a distant past,

271
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,712
I feel as though something
similar happened before.

272
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:48,792
I feel like my memories may return.

273
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:52,460
This gentle warmth...

274
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,534
This has happened in the
past somewhere.

275
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:58,332
It feels so familiar.

276
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:13,574
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

277
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:20,485
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

278
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:35,703
Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

279
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:42,841
Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

280
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:51,652
Anata dake ki ni naru
shunkan ga atta no

281
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:58,587
Motto kirei ni ima sugu naritai

282
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:06,126
Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne

283
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:12,705
Me o tojite tashikamete

284
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:26,589
Dakishimeta tokimeki sono mama
