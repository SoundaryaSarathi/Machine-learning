00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,010
<i>Say...

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,350
<i>What color is your world right now?

3
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,340
Hey. I'm listening,
so play seriously.

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,300
It's not like it's for listening.

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,180
Then, what are you doing?

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,520
It's a part-time job where I transpose
new music to sheet by ear.

7
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,390
I'm just checking
if the sound is correct.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Even so, you can just play normally.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,610
I've quit piano.

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,820
But you're playing.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,900
So hot!

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,870
Why is it so hot
when it's only April?!

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,040
Ah... I am coming back to life.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,700
This is not a room to rest
for club activities.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,750
Are you in a bad mood?

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,250
Did I just get in the way 
of a middle-aged married couple?

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,920
We are not married!

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,470
Your tones are matching as expected.

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,510
Shut up!
We're just childhood friends!

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,140
Stop it! Do you intend to injure 
the soccer club's ace?!

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,420
That's what I'm going to do!

22
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,930
I'll really give it to you!

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm really sorry! Really!

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,810
<i>Tsubaki and Watari are always shining...

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,860
<i>so I think that world is colorful.

27
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,070
<i>But...

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,990
<i>my world is...

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,660
<i>like this keyboard,
that's monotone.

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,830
That girl said that she liked you
for a while, Watari.

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,830

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,250
And she asked me to introduce you to her.

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,260
But is she really cute?

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,010
I told you she's cute.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,140
So it's been decided that 
you two meet this Saturday.

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,140
That's why you should also come, Kosei.

37
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,230
Huh? Why should I?

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,810
Because you're free.

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Hey...

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,440
Aren't we always together since 
the middle school entrance ceremony?

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,150
Okay?

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,410
What's up, Keiko?

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,370
Really?!

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,790
Got it. I'll be right there. See you!

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,750
Sorry. Keiko asked me to come. Bye!

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
How flamboyant.

47
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,340
But he's a good guy.

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,640
So you're okay with Saturday, right?

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
If you're not coming,
I'll look like a fool alone.

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,020
That's why you could 
just be Friend A. Please!

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,900
Even if you request...

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,110
Please!

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,570
I got it.

54
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,660
You know, I got first 
in the fortune telling today.

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,830
And my lucky food is octopus dumplings,
that's why we're having that.

56
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,380
It's Ms. Hiroko.

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,460
Lucky you. 
You'll have delicious food today.

58
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll see you tomorrow then.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm home.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,320
Welcome home.

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,240
We're making burger steaks.

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,240
You don't have to do this, Ms. Hiroko.
You're busy with recitals.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,450
It's alright.

64
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,790
You should eat something nutritious
from time to time.

65
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,880
That's what your father asked me.

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,440
But you don't have to worry about that.

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,130
He left you because he got 
transferred for work.

68
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,340
Your father must be worried about you.

69
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,680
You released a new album.

70
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,890
I'll give that to you.

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,390
Thank you.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,770
I'll go get changed.

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,190
Kosei.

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,860
Have you greeted your mother at home?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,170
I'm home.

76
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,345
They're late.

77
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,934
Coming five minutes early
have already passed.

78
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,370
They're like the Bremen Town Musicians.

79
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,440
It was such a strong wind.

80
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,910
What the hell are you doing, 
you sneaky photographing devil?!

81
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,740

82
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,222
- You just photographed me, right?!
- Wait! Wait!

83
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,089
Molester! Pervert!

84
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,620
Give me your smartphone! 
I'm going to break it!

85
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,210
No! You got it wrong!

86
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,640
Gimme!

87
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,880
Kosei?

88
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,510
Kao?

89
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,670
Tsubaki!

90
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:12,869

91
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,220
She's my classmate, Kaori Miyazono.

92
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,180
Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,190
And he's Ryota Watari.

94
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,730
Let's get along!

95
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,310
Let's get along.

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,990
And here is just Friend A.

97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,360
Nice to meet you.

98
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,580
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,540
Let's get going then.

100
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,580
Where are we going?

101
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,750
Music hall.

102
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,840
Kao will be entering
a violin competition.

103
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,260
I'm a violinist.

104
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,180
Really? That's so cool!
Then, we have to cheer for you.

105
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,850
Tsubaki, I'll pass.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,810
Why?

107
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,320
Let's go.

108
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,880
Wow!

109
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,020
I can't hear...

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,150
I can't hear...

111
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm scared!

112
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,240
Kosei!

113
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,660
This way.

114
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,280
Hey, could he be Kosei Arima?

115
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,250
Yes. 
He might be that Arima.

116
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,800
The genius Arima?

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,460
He's the one who was called 
the human metronome.

118
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,180
Yo! Mr. Popular!

119
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,190
You purposely didn't tell me, didn't you?

120
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,570
'Cause if I told you,
you might not come.

121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,860
That's why...

122
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,280
I did my best not to tell you.

123
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,370
But hey, this is violin.

124
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,790
Right? Violin!

125
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,900
Hey, why are they playing the same piece?

126
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,990
Because it's the set piece 
of the preliminaries.

127
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,320
I give up.
I want to sleep.

128
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,030
Even though you were sleeping the whole time?

129
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,080
Kao is next.

130
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,740
Oh! Finally!

131
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,930
Kao! Good luck!

132
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,850
Kao!

133
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,790
May it be reached.

134
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,230
It's somewhat cool, isn't it?

135
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,660
It's totally different
from the other contestants.

136
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,710
The tempo and loudness are haphazard.

137
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,260
To think she's disregarding 
the directions of the written music.

138
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,920
What the hell is this?

139
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,760
It's a disrespect to the composer!

140
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,680
This preposterous performance

141
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,760
is out of the question in a competition.

142
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,100
But it's interesting.

143
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,560
<i>Why...

144
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,940
<i>I wonder why you can play
such playful music.

145
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,650
Kosei.

146
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
Kosei.

147
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,160
Kosei.

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,790
Why can't you notice me
no matter how I many times I call you?

149
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,750
Sorry.

150
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,710
Here. It's thanks for 
accompanying me last Saturday.

151
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,010
Thanks.

152
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,590
You were just spacing out.

153
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,560
Have you been thinking about a girl you like?

154
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,850
Why ask that suddenly?

155
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,310
Could it be Kaori?

156
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,150
I get you, I get you. 
She sure is cute!

157
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,360
No way!

158
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,280
Besides, she likes you.

159
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,360
That doesn't matter.

160
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,950
It's only natural that the girl you're 
crushing on is in love with someone else.

161
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,750
Since you're in love with her, 
she sparkles in your eyes.

162
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,920
That's why people fall irrationally in love.

163
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,840
I think I kind of get why 
you're such a chick-magnet, Watari.

164
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,680
You just realized it now?

165
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,980
But it's impossible for me.

166
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,070
Whether or not it's impossible...

167
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,990
the girl will let you know.

168
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,740
You really give good advice, Watari.

169
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,870
I know, right?

170
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,630
Hello? Maki?

171
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,880
Club practice today?
No, none.

172
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,970
Us going to karaoke?!
Sounds good!

173
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,270
Friend A!

174
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,190
It's a coincidence.

175
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,110
Are you on your way home?

176
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,780
Ah, right.

177
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,330
How is my violin playing?

178
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,800
It was reckless to play like that
in a competition.

179
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,760
But...

180
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,340
How should I say it...

181
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,350
It was really great.

182
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,690
So it was no problem!

183
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,450
Anyway, where is Watari?
Aren't you with him?

184
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,860
Ah, Watari has club practice.

185
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,700
What?

186
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,330
To think I wanted to surprise him,
so I waited for him.

187
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,040
But if I return to school, 
I'll be able see him at his club.

188
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,790
But since the matches are near,
seems he's busy.

189
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,550
You think I'll be in the way if I go there?

190
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,970
That's not what I mean.

191
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,380
Well, I might be in the way.

192
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,840
I got it.

193
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,550
Then, I've decided.

194
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,430
I'm appointing you
to be his substitute.

195
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,860
I've always wanted to eat here!

196
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,690
So yummy!

197
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,990
Aren't you going to eat?

198
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,110
Then, I'll eat it!

199
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,070
Hey, hey!

200
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,870
Okay.

201
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,000
So cute!

202
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,480
Hello!

203
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,720
Hello!

204
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,760
Do you like piano?

205
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,720
I see!

206
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,690
That guy over there 
is really good at the piano!

207
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,440
Why don't you play?

208
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,250
Don't tell me you're going 
to ignore the children's wishes.

209
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,630
Wow!

210
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,670
I'm sorry.

211
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,770
Wait!
Friend A!

212
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,820
Why did you...

212
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
Huh?

213
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,110
Quick! Hurry!

214
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,080
Hey, wait!
Where are we going?

215
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,160
Hurry!

216
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,470
We made it in time.

217
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,260
Beautiful!

218
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,270
I love watching the sunset here.

219
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,440
I see.

220
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,980
You don't play the piano anymore?

221
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,620
So you actually know about me.

222
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,540
Winner of the Moriwaki 
Student's Piano Competition.

223
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,790
Winner of the Urie International 
Competition for two consecutive years.

224
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,880
The youngest winner 
at the Saiki Competition.

225
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,800
Your playing style 
was accurate and disciplined.

226
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,800
A human metronome.

227
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,390
You were a prodigy who performed Mozart
with an orchestra at the age of eight.

228
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,680
You've done your homework.

229
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,520
There isn't a musician in our generation
who hasn't heard of you.

230
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,610
Since you're who we look up to.

231
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,400
Why did you quit playing?

232
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,330
I can't hear the sound of the piano.

233
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,710
But you were just playing awhile ago.

234
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,500
I can hear at first.

235
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,420
But I can't hear it suddenly.

236
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,300
The more I concentrate...

237
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,010
the more I get consumed by the performance...

238
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,730
and then I can't hear 
the sound of the piano.

239
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,070
<i>That's right.
This is my punishment.

240
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,240
That's why I can't play.

241
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,540
You should just play
even if you can't.

242
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,250
What's that?

243
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,670
If your hands don't move,
play with your feet.

244
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
If your fingers aren't enough,
use your nose.

245
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,840
Mozart?

246
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,050
I've decided.

247
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,970
You'll be my accompanist.

248
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,020
Huh?

249
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,850
From the preliminaries from before, 
I passed because I was the audience's favorite.

250
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,520
I can participate 
in the second preliminaries.

251
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,900
Did you hear what I said?

252
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,690
I told you that I can't hear.

253
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,190
Oh, shut up.

254
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,990
I've already decided.

255
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,120
Friend A, I appoint you 
to be my accompanist.

256
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,550
Kosei as an accompanist?

257
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,210
Yeah.

258
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,340
I want him to.
What do you think?

259
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,680
I think it's a good idea!

260
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,220
But I wonder if he'll really do it.

261
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,560
I'll help you!

262
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,970
I'm really excited!

263
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,020
Hey...

264
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,990
This has been playing endlessly
since awhile ago.

265
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,500
What is this?

266
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,500
Rondo...

267
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,170
Capriccioso.

268
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,180
Please turn to page 24
of your textbooks.

269
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,430
About the past perfect tense from before...

270
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,330
Geez.

271
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,960
We'll definitely make Kosei play.

272
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,380
But don't you think we're a bit pushy?

273
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,720
It's about right to do that to Kosei.

274
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:22,310
The truth is, I'm fine with Kosei
not playing the piano.

275
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,100
But if he quits,
I want him to understand.

276
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,270
Because the Kosei right now 
seems to be doing things half-baked.

277
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,280
It pains me to see him like that.

278
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,740
Seems like you like Arima.

279
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,330
It's a bit different from liking him.

280
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,000
For me,
Kosei is like...

281
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,420
a good-for-nothing little brother.

282
00:25:52,710 --> 00:26:01,470
You know, Kosei suddenly stopped playing
when his mother, who's a pianist, died.

283
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,640
He stopped playing since then.

284
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,560
I just want...

285
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,190
Kosei's time to move again 
from when it stopped during that time.

286
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,270
<i>Next stop is Tatsuhara University Hospital.
Tatsuhara University Hospital.

287
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,890
<i>We'll make a stop at the next stop.

288
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,110
<i>Passengers who will leave 
at the next bus stop,

289
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,230
<i>please stand up  
only when the door is open.

290
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,000
You're late again.
Properly play it.

291
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,010
No! You should play accordingly 
like what the music sheet says!

292
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,800
Play everything like what it says!

293
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,200
I can't play, after all.

294
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,080
Kosei.

296
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,290
Then, who will play Kaori's accompaniment?

297
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,410
Look for someone else.

298
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,830
There you are.

299
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,240
So you were hiding here.

300
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,250
Why are you here?

301
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,220
Of course, I came to fetch
my accompaniment.

302
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,800
I told you that I can't play!

303
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,430
It's not that you can't play,
you just don't play.

304
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,310
You're just running away from an excuse 
of not hearing the piano's sound.

305
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm scared.

306
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm here.

307
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,590
I'm here, you know.

308
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:25,010
I know everything, that you can't hear 
the piano's sound and that you can't play since then.

309
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,220
But I want it to be you.

310
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,850
We might not be able to play
a proper performance.

311
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,150
But if there are people 
who are able to hear it...

312
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,110
I want to perform my very best.

313
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm sure it will touch their hearts.

314
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,780
I want to deliver my music.

315
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,660
I can definitely do it with you.

316
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,620
That's what I thought.

317
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,040
That's why, I beg you.

318
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,090
Please be my accompaniment.

319
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,680
Please support me for a bit.

320
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,600
Please support me...

321
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,190
who is about to lose heart.

322
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,250
I won't be responsible 
for what happens, okay?

323
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,850
Hurry it up.

324
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
You're taking too long.

325
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,900
We'll be late, so hurry!

326
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,860
We've borrowed these bikes.

327
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,820
Let's go!

328
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,740
Thank you.

329
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Come on. 
You should hurry too, Kosei.

330
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,740
Alright.

331
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,120
We'll make sure that you'll make it there!

332
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,990
Yeah!

333
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,870
Kosei, don't fall.

334
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,870
So fast!

335
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,250
But will you be okay? 
How about practice? Did you match?

336
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,630
It's alright.
We'll make do somehow.

337
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,500
- Don't underestimate us athletes! 
<i>- It's just like what Watari said. 

338
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,080

339
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,220
We'll even make time for you to match!

340
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,200
- Thank you.
<i>- Whether it's impossible or not...

341
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>only this girl will let me know.

342
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000

343
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,620
By the way, you were awesome the other time.

344
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,600
Really?
That makes me glad.

345
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,350
I'm looking forward to you 
playing today too, so break a leg.

346
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,440
Of course, I will!

347
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,320
Ms. Hiroko.

348
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,280
Ms. Hiroko.

349
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,190
Where is Kosei?

350
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,450
He's backstage.

351
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,580
So Kosei will play.

352
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,830
So hot.

353
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,090
- Ow!
- That hurt!

354
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,890
You hard head!

355
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,220
What is it all of a sudden?

356
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,940
H-hey! Give that back!
There's no time.

357
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,150
Raise your head and look at me.

358
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,160
It's all because you're always looking down

359
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,120
that you end up locked up 
with the staff notation.

360
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,580
It's alright.

361
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,590
You can surely do it.

362
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,760
Mozart is saying this from above...

363
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,340
"Go on a journey."

364
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,060
The two of us should just throw away the shame 
of the journey, and just be fully shameful.

365
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,690
#14.
Ms. Kaori Miyazono.

366
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,980
Please prepare.

367
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,690
Okay.

368
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,910
Let's go.

369
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,420
You're...

370
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,540
so care-free.

371
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,130
I'm not.

372
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,720
The music is care-free.

373
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,500
Hey.

374
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,810
Isn't he Kosei Arima?

375
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,070
I thought so. 
Why is he playing?

376
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,480
<i>Okay.
I played on time.

377
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,400
Kosei is playing piano again.

378
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,630
She's surprisingly playing calmly right now.

379
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,870
Now she's showing her true self.

380
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,500
<i>It's alright. 
I can hear the sound too.

381
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,500
<i>I can go on.

382
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,550
As expected of Arima.

383
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Even though the tempo changed, 
he accurately catches up.

384
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,580
What's wrong, Arima?

385
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,140
I have no words.

386
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,850
It seems off.

387
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,500
No way. Why?

388
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,790
That's because he'll get in the way 
of her performance.

389
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,880
So that it won't fully affect 
the review of the judges.

390
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,170
But is it alright that
there's no accompaniment?

391
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,180
As long as she keeps on playing...

392
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,510
the judging will continue.

393
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,450
Yes. 
This is unheard of.

394
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,670
Why did you stop?

395
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,800
Again.

396
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,450
Since they started from the beginning again,
it's okay, right?

397
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,120
No.

398
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,000
Her participation in the competition 
has already ended awhile ago.

399
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:53,680
<i>The two of us should just throw away the shame 
of the journey, and just be fully shameful.

400
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,270
<i>The music is care-free.

401
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,560
<i>Calm down. Remember the piece that I was 
irritated to hear during lunch break.

402
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,810
<i>Remember the music sheet 
that was scattered everywhere.

403
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,940
<i>Even if I can't hear the sound,

404
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,570
<i>play everything that I have inside of me now.

405
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,870
<i>Hey, hey, Friend A.

406
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,370
<i>Don't take the leading role here.

407
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,620
Wow.

408
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,000
Both of them are recklessly playing.

409
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,040
It seems like a fist fight.

410
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,720
But that is what attracts the listeners.

411
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,130
Kaori! 
You're awesome!

412
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,290
You did it, Kosei!

413
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,690
Thank you...

414
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,400
Kosei Arima.

415
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,570
That's the first time...

416
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,240
you called me by my name.

417
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,380
The people here...

418
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,840
will not forget about us.

419
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,970
I'm sure of it.

420
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,390
I won't forget.

421
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,770
I won't forget even if I die.

422
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,170
Tsubaki, keep it up!

423
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
Nice!

424
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,710
Come on, let's go! Fight!

425
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,340
Seems like you're more energetic recently.

426
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,760
I guess so. Since I don't want 
to lose to Kosei and Kaori.

427
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,180
I see. Their performance 
was really great it seems.

428
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,890
It was great.

429
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,180
It was really great!

430
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,350
That's why he's also pumped up, huh?

431
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,660
So did Arima started playing piano again?

432
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,620
Not really. 
Looks like he doesn't play.

433
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,330
Skip, skip, step.

434
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,580
Skip, step. Skip, step. 
Skip, skip, step.

435
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,760
Here I go!

436
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,220
Skip, skip, step.

437
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,850
Skip, step!

438
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,470
Yo!

439
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,940
Want some canele?

440
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,560
It's good.

441
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,650
Were you...

442
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,400
waiting for Watari?

443
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,660
No.
I waited for you.

444
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,580
Let's take a walk.

445
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,630
Regarding the competition 
that I lost at...

446
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,050
I'm really sorry about that.

447
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,470
Ta-da!

448
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,680
I was invited to a gala concert
by the organizers.

449
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,640
I can play again.

450
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,180
The truth is that only winners can be there.

451
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,140
But I'm popular!

452
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,310
Isn't it great?

453
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,650
That's amazing.
I'll go and watch.

454
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,280
Huh?!

455
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,700
That's not what I want to hear.

456
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,030
It should be, "I'll go and play," right?

457
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,760
I can't do that.

458
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,160
Yes, you can.

459
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,660
No.

460
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,450
I want to play with you again.

461
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,670
I might fail again.

462
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,630
Are you seriously saying that?

463
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,480
But I'm someone who gave up 
playing the piano.

464
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,730
Do you really think you can forget?

465
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,980
The sensation when you're playing.

466
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,070
The grand applause of the audience.

467
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,700
The moment where your music was delivered.

468
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,710
Do you really think you can forget?

469
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,840
Everyone is scared to go up on stage.

470
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,130
One might fail or be fully denied.

471
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,270
But I will still bear it
and go up on stage.

472
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,360
We perform when we're inspired by something.

473
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,280
That's how the most beautiful lie is born.

474
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,120
We are those type of people.

475
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,290
We are still 17, you know.

476
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,580
Let's boldly jump in!

477
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,760
Like this!

478
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,950
Hey!

479
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,540
I wanted to try this
at least once!

480
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,830
It's awesome!

481
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,170
Hey!

482
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,350
<i>That's right.

483
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,220
<i>There's no way I can forget it.

484
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,860
Feels good, doesn't it?

485
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,490
That was scary!

486
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,040
Thank you.

487
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,960
It's too big, after all.

488
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,640
Um... here's soup.

489
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,140
Hey, where is the piano?

490
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,060
What?

491
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,310
Wait!

492
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,030
You mustn't!

493
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,050
I told you not to.

494
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,480
I'm sorry.

495
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,450
A healthy performance comes from
a healthy environment!

496
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,700
We should clean up first!

497
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,200
Ventilation!

498
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,420
I've decided what to perform 
at the gala concert.

499
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,880
Kreisler's "Love Sorrow."

500
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,260
Isn't there a better piece than that?

501
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,930
Something that is more flashy 
to perform in a gala concert.

502
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,140
I've already decided.

503
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,470
This is it.

504
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,690
Okay.

505
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,110
So hot.

506
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,360
You know how to play the piano.

507
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,440
I used to play it.

508
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,960
Kao.
Kosei.

509
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,050
Tsubaki!

510
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,030
One more time.

511
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,260
They're working hard again today.

512
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,720
Hey, hey. 
Let's take a peek a bit.

513
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:27,880
Forget it.

514
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,010
Just go. I'll just call you 
when it's time for practice.

515
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,390
Forget it.

516
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,440
It's bad to get in the way
of their practice.

517
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,660
She's a handful.

518
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,410
To think she just made such an obvious outburst,
how come she doesn't recognize it herself?

519
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,020
Mom.

520
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,860
I won.

521
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:28,570
That's no good at all!

522
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,620
Hey, Saki!
What're you doing?!

523
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,040
You misplayed at the 3rd and 11th measures.

524
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,410
The tempo at the 13th measure is wrong.

525
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,670
I told you to play accurately, didn't I?!

526
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,580
I won for you.

527
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
Are you listening, Kosei?!

528
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,600
Even though I did my very best,
so that you'll get better...

529
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,600
Even though I won for you...

530
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,680
I've had enough!

531
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,900
I don't care if you die.

532
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,780
<i>My mother went back to the hospital after that.

533
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,150
<i>That night...

534
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,450
<i>She died...

535
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,370
<i>I killed her.

536
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,830
<i>And since then...

537
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,210
<i>the sound went missing.

538
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,050
Kosei is playing the piano!

539
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,720
Kosei, isn't that song...

540
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:44,690
Why don't we take a walk?

541
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,730
"Love's Sorrow..."

542
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,910
reminds me so much of Mom.

543
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,580
It's the piece that Saki loves the most.

544
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,670
She played it a lot during college.

545
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,000
Since you were born...

546
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,260
it seems like a lullaby
she played to you.

547
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,300
While she was playing it...

548
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,720
you were always so calmly 
sleeping beside her.

549
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,150
Will Mom let me play...

550
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,770
"Love's Sorrow" though.

551
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,450
Do I even have the right to play it?

552
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,120
If you're in doubt, just play it.

553
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,870
Play it, then listen to what Saki will tell you.

554
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,420
Can I go and look at the fish?

555
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,630
Go ahead. 
But don't tap on the glass.

556
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,050
I know!

557
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,640
Besides...

558
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,190
you are thinking way too much.

559
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,610
You were having so much fun playing the piano
when you were starting, you know.

560
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,980
Come on!

561
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,860
Like before, with all your heart,

562
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,700
try playing like you're passionately 
motivating yourself.

563
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,490
If you do that, something might change.

564
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,670
Mommy, come here!

565
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,290
There is a really cute fish here.

566
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,510
Could it be that...

567
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,380
the reason you can't hear
the sound is because...

568
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,970
it might be a gift?

569
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,200
Ms. Hiroko said that...

570
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,120
not hearing the sound may be a gift.

571
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,160
I wonder what it means...

572
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,340
Are you listening?

573
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,510
So you're asleep.

574
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,730
I'm looking forward to the gala concert.

575
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,650
It would be better if it comes soon.

576
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,820
It seems like we have time.

577
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:24,660
Leave it to me.
I'll be taking the spotlight.

578
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,490
That's why I'm counting on you.

579
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,540
Okay.

580
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,250
No.

581
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,670
You should've said 
you are the spotlight too.

582
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,960
But I'm an accompanist.

583
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,800
No, no.

584
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,090
The gala concert is all about standing out.

585
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,470
So pretty.

586
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,520
Yeah.

587
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,610
Thank you.

588
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,500
Twinkle twinkle little star.

589
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:14,870
How I wonder what you are.

590
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:19,500
Up above the world so high.

591
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,760
Like a diamond in the sky.

592
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,720
Twinkle twinkle little star.

593
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,850
How I wonder what you are.

594
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,520
If you please...

595
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,690
Would you consider switching the order?

596
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:43,800
No matter how many times you asked, 
the most prominent part of the program 

596
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,820
is the winner of the competition.

597
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,080
It's impossible to give the final performance
to someone who is late.

598
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,120
Besides, I was first against in inviting her.

599
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:59,130
To think she gave such profanity to music.

600
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,840
She didn't gave profanity.

601
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,680
This last minute cancellation is good proof.

602
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,060
She'll come.

603
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,310
She'll surely come.

604
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,690
That's why, please give us more time.

605
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,520
The line-up will not change at all.

606
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,610
We're done here.

607
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,990
<i>Next performer is Kaori Miyazono.

608
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,290
I wonder what happened.

609
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,580
Geez, don't make us worry.

610
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,640
Is Kaori Miyazono here?

611
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,180
Excuse me.

612
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:53,930
Yes.

613
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,730
Then, please go to the stage wing.

614
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,650
Hey. 
She isn't here yet.

615
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:05,150
The spotlight today 
belongs to Kaori Miyazono.

616
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,570
Then, I have no choice,
but to let them know she is here.

617
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,080
But just what are you going to play?

618
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,250
The gala concert...

619
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,080
is all about standing out.

620
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,120
Arima's playing alone
in a violin gala concert?

621
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,140
Just who does he think he is 
playing only as an accompanist?

622
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,140
It's different than their usual practice.

623
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,460
Yeah.

624
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,170
Kreisler's "Love's Sorrow..."

625
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,880
Rachmaninoff Piano Arrangement Version.

626
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,220
<i>I will prove it.

627
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,640
<i>I will take the spotlight
at this gala concert.

628
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,110
Why is he playing with such strength?

629
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,990
<i>Huh?

630
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,740
<i>I was playing this strongly?

631
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,000
<i>No.

632
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,040
<i>Mom's playing of "Love's Sorrow"
is more mellow.

633
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,440
<i>There.

634
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,520
<i>This piece is played more like this.

635
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,820
<i>This piece that has been 
my lullaby as a child...

636
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,380
<i>I should remember it.

637
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,090
<i>Imagine it.

638
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,310
Kosei, play it more gently.

639
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,730
As if you're gently stroking
the head of a baby.

640
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,650
Play it as if you're embracing the baby.

641
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,530
<i>Maybe the reason you can't hear
the piano's sound...

642
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,240
<i>is because it might be a gift.

643
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,370
<i>There's a sound...

644
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,290
<i>inside me.

645
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,090
You musn't. 
Didn't the doctor already say so?

646
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,090
I should go see him.

647
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,930
I have to teach him piano.

648
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,050
Please, let me go.

649
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,350
I don't have much time.

650
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,480
Even if I'm gone...

651
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:33,730
I should teach him 
how to be a proper pianist.

652
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,900
So that he would be able to survive.

653
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,280
So that my treasure...

654
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,410
would be able to be happy.

655
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:48,040
Saki.
Can you hear him?

656
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,500
Your son...

657
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,130
is bidding his final farewell.

658
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,900
I know this piece.

659
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,740
Memories of Kosei's mom is there.

660
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,450
<i>Isn't this correct, Mom?

661
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,240
<i>The piano is being played 
as if you're embracing it.

662
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,830
Even though there is "Love's Joy"
and "Love's Sorrow,"

663
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:33,670
why is it that you always play
"Love's Sorrow?"

664
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,670

665
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,220
<i>Mom is inside me.

666
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,350
The reason is, Kosei...

667
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,350
so that I get used to the sorrow.

668
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,690
<i>I am connected to Mom.

669
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,110
<i>That's what I believe.

670
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,320
<i>That's why...

671
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,440
<i>That's why, Mom...

672
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,740
<i>Good-bye.

673
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:39,690
Kosei!

674
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,320
Kosei.

675
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,650
Ms. Hiroko.

676
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:26,870
I wonder if it reached Mom.

677
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,170
My best piano playing...

678
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,050
Did it reach Mom?

679
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,810
Idiot.

680
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,400
Of course, it reached her.

681
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:27,970
Just when I was leaving the house,
I stumbled. Just stumbled.

682
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,680
Then, the ambulance came rushing in.

683
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,480
Having called the ambulance 
is really an exaggeration.

684
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,400
It's just anemia,

685
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,940
but my head was hit when I stumbled,

686
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,490
so I need to be examined. 
So in the end, I'm hospitalized.

687
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,320
But I'm glad you seem well.

688
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,160
Yeah.
I'm well, really well.

689
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,200
I'm really sorry for making you worry.

690
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,530
Don't worry about it.

691
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,000
Kosei did his best for you too.

692
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,620
Really, his performance was awesome.

693
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,290
That much, huh?

694
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,120
Yeah.

695
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,000
Well, I don't know much about music.

696
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,380
But I think it's next to how awesome 
you play the violin.

697
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,800
I thought so. 
I'm the best in that department.

698
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,380
Of course, you are.

699
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,970
I'll go buy something to drink.

700
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:12,720
What?

701
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,270
I'll go too.

702
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,180
Okay.

703
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
Kosei.

704
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,900
The vending machine is over here.

705
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,870
Sorry, I'm leaving.

706
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:12,910
Yes?

707
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,410
<i>Friend A!

708
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,870
<i>Why did you just leave?!

709
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:17,790
Sorry.

710
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,710
I just had things to do.

711
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:26,420
Don't think you're off the hook that easily.

712
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,800
<i>What?

713
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,590
Just kidding.

714
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:34,470
I'll let you pass this time. 
Next time, be sure to bring canele.

715
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,470
Okay.

716
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,140
<i>Also...

717
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,440
let me hear about you playing the piano.

718
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,900
<i>About you playing the piano 
at the gala concert.

719
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,230
<i>Got it?

720
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:52,240
Okay.

721
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,780
<i>Okay. 
That's good. Bye.

722
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,340
Ow...

723
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,620
What is this?

724
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,840
Why isn't it moving?

725
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,930
Please stand up.

726
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,600
Stand up!

727
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,190
You're my legs, right?!

728
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,940
Get up!

729
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,050
So Miyazono can't get out of the hospital yet.

730
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,180
Yeah. Even though she looked well
when we visited her...

731
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,140
You three seem to get along well.

732
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,760
About that...

733
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,980
No matter how many times we ask Kosei 
to come with us, he doesn't.

734
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,810
Even though Kao is waiting for him.

735
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,060
Are you sure? Is it alright 
for you to help your rival?

736
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:50,940
Rival?

737
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:53,530
No way. 
Why is Kao my rival?

738
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:57,530
I just think that Kosei
is the only one

739
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,410
who can talk to Kao regarding music.

740
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,330
Geez, you're being too kind, Tsubaki.

741
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,830
You don't have to be so hard on yourself.
You like him, don't you?

742
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:07,000
No, no, no, no!
There's no way I like him.

743
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,540
Hey, stop it already.

744
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,210
You're denying it too much.
You've been caught already. Admit it.

745
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,090
Alright.

746
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,050
You're awfully honest today.

747
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,970
But I'm not kind.

748
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,640
Whenever Kosei says he doesn't 
want to go to the hospital,

749
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,730
it makes me relieved.

750
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,110
I hate that about myself.

751
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,490
Makes myself look like 
it's nothing and deceiving.

752
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,740
That's excessively unpleasant, huh?

753
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,160
I'm sure...

754
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,500
if you lump it all together,

755
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,540
that is what you call being in love.

756
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,130
I don't know at all!

757
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,330
You always suddenly appear.

758
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,500
So you've just been released.

759
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
You heartless guy!

760
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,220
Why didn't you come visit me at all?!

761
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:48,970
Even though I've been 
looking forward to the canele.

762
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,480
Sorry.
You're already well?

763
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,480
Yeah. I'll be joyously coming back 
to school starting today.

764
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,940
Hey, where's Watari?

765
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,660
Watari is still at school.

766
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,910
I'll go get him.

767
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,240
Wait.

768
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,370
For a heartless guy like you,
I'll give you a chance for atonement.

769
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,550
I impose you to be the substitute.

770
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,530
Isn't this pretty?

771
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,620
Yeah.
It's pretty.

772
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,790
Okay!
Then, I'll buy this!

773
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,830
Wait!
That's cute!

774
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,090
Thank you very much.

775
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,930
Welcome!

776
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,850
Whoa!

777
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,440
Look!
Isn't it awesome?!

778
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,190

779
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:26,990
Delicious!

780
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,160
So cute!

781
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,200
Cute!

782
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,170
Hurry!

783
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,340
Here we go.

784
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,880
Okay, cheese!

785
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,520
W-wait!

786
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,570
I'll get wet!
I'll get wet!

787
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,530
It's okay!

788
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,400
I'll get wet!

789
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:11,120
Somehow...

790
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:13,660
this seems like a date.

791
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,290
But I've never been to one before.

792
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,880
Are you playing piano?

793
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,050
A little.

794
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,180
You know...

795
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,090
I was really glad...

796
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:38,690
that you said I did great during the first round 
of elimination in the competition.

797
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,990
That's why, it's your turn next.

798
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:55,790
Hey, after all,
you're an expressive performer...

799
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,910
Kosei Arima.

800
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,210
It's the second time.

801
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:04,800

802
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,590
You called me by my name.

803
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,550
Yeah.

804
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,510
We should get going.

805
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,310
Okay.

806
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,030
I forgot my bag.

807
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:40,460
Being at school at night
makes me feel excited somehow.

808
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,540
I wonder if a ghost might appear.

809
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,290
Do you believe in ghosts or not?

810
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,470
I just can't believe someone 
can leave their bag at school.

811
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,840
True.

812
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,700
What's wrong?
Where's your bag?

813
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,040
That's right.
The bag.

814
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:07,750
Let's see.
I wonder where my bag is...

815
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,340
Hey, don't tell me...

816
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:14,840
Sorry.

817
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:19,970
I lied.
There's no bag here.

818
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,770
But you came to school, right?
You were released at the hospital, right?

819
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,060
I'm sorry about that too.

820
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,610
I'm still not released yet.

821
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:42,240
I was approved to go out
for just one day.

822
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,080
I can't do many things
when I'm in the hospital.

823
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,830
And also...

824
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,640
I wanted to go to school
no matter what.

825
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,440
My sickness...

826
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,490
is a bit bad...

827
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,760
Just kidding.

828
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,980
I'm sorry.

829
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:50,810
Huh?

830
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,070
I wonder why?

831
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:02,820
Let's go back.

832
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,080
I'm fine.

833
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,410
I can walk by myself.

834
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,370
Let's go back.

835
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,420
I'm really fine!

836
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,730
Miyazono!

837
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,280
Miyazono!

838
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:38,900
Miyazono!

839
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,950
I'm really sorry.

840
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:44,660
No. It's not your fault.

841
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,370
Thank you for taking care of my daughter.

842
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,000
Arima.

843
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,290
Kaori asked to see you.

844
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:22,110
I'm sorry to surprise you.

845
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,370
It's okay.

846
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,620
It's because I'm selfish.

847
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:35,710
I will always make you suffer.

848
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,990
- That's not true...
- If that's the case...

849
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,720

850
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,100
If that's the case...

851
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,780
It would have been better
if we didn't meet.

852
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:28,740
Why don't you go visit her?

853
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:37,080
Don't you think you owe it to Kaori?

854
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,210
Let me see your face.

855
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,090
Kosei.

856
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,230
I...

857
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,570
couldn't say a word.

858
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:14,450
I just ran away.

859
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,210
That's why...

860
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,340
How should I act when I see her?

861
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:41,890
That's more the reason...

862
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:47,400
for you to go visit Kaori.

863
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,740
When she wants her own way...

864
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,700
or a shoulder to lean on...

865
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:56,830
Whenever she wants somebody
to do something for her...

866
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,700
she always turns to you.

867
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,380
But...

868
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,430
I just don't know what to say to her.

869
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,220
You'll figure that out
once you're there.

870
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,310
But it's impossible for me.

871
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,320
Whether it's impossible or not...

872
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:31,530
is up to the girl to decide.

873
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:11,780
Kosei!

874
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,160
Here.

875
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,620
Thanks.

876
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:25,370
You're opening it awkwardly.

877
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,840
So hot!

878
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,590
You're not too good with hot drinks.

879
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:39,890
No, this is really hot.

880
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,820
Kosei.

881
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,650
You like Kao, right?

882
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,660
Yeah.

883
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,380
How foolish of you.

884
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:21,470
Kao likes Watari, you know.

885
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,310
I know.

886
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:28,900
You're really stupid.

887
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,770
Kao likes Watari.

888
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:33,110
You are no match for him.

889
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:37,320
Yeah.

890
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,490
Aren't you stupid?

891
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:45,080
Kao likes Watari.

892
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,710
That's why...

893
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:52,920
That's why, you have no choice,
but to love me instead.

894
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,010
What?

895
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,470
To think you're a coward
who can't even visit her.

896
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:04,060
You'll regret it if you don't 
say it to her, you gloom!

897
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,350
That kind of...

898
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,640
That kind of guy is a no for me.

899
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,980
Idiot.
Idiot!

900
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,910
I burned my tongue.

901
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,830
I'm such an idiot.

902
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:15,960
Yo.

903
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,880
You have club practice today?

904
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:21,130
The matches are coming up soon,
so we don't have breaks.

905
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,430
Hey, Watari.

906
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,550

907
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,600
I...

908
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,150
I really like Miyazono.

909
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:39,650
Idiot, I know.

910
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,530
Okay.

911
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,550
Come in.

912
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,560
Hello.

913
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:22,780
Why did you come?

914
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,660
Because I promised you.

915
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:36,620
Let's eat.

916
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,760
No.

917
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,840
I want to eat under the sky.

918
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:02,530
I'll beat you if you say I'm heavy.

919
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:12,120
Delicious.

920
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:22,710
I've decided to participate 
in the East Japan Piano Competition.

921
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:27,090
I don't know how far 
I'll be able to pull it off.

922
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:29,890
But I'll move forward.

923
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:31,970

924
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,600
And I want to perform with you again.

925
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,160
I...

926
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,910
like you.

927
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:05,000
I know that you like Watari.

928
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,220
But...

929
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,430
I still want to perform with you.

930
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,390
That's why...

931
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,650
Please play with me once again.

932
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,990
You told me, didn't you?

933
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,410
"Do you really think you can forget?"

934
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,490
I can never forget.

935
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,160
The stage we stood on.

936
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,460
And your violin.

937
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,050
You're cruel.

938
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:20,750
Let's go back.

939
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:24,500

940
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,180
Are you alright?

941
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,480
I'm scared.

942
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,240
I'm scared and...

943
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,410
I'm scared and I can't help it.

944
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,300
I don't want to die.

945
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,550
No.

946
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,890
No!

947
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,020
I don't want to die!

948
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:34,360
Don't leave me alone.

949
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,930
I want to respect your decision.

950
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,720
But like I said before,

951
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,480
this surgery involves a big risk.

952
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,390
Yes.

953
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
I understand.

954
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,740
But still, let me have it.

955
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,490
No matter how small of hope there is...

956
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,370
I'll hold on to it.

957
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,750
I will go through it,
so that I will live.

958
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,290
I have...

959
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:36,840
an important promise I have to keep.

960
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,620
It's alright.

961
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:21,090
Kosei?

962
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,090

963
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:25,510
Your face looks scary.
Are you okay?

964
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:27,770
Hey.

965
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,190
Play.

966
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:32,730
We're pianists.

967
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,610
What you're feeling right now...

968
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,440
express it all in the piano
with all you've got.

969
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,300

970
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:03,840
Tweezers.

971
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,510
Here.

972
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,830
Carry.

973
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,050
<i>I can hear the sound inside me.

974
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,150
<i>I am here because I met you.

975
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,730
<i>I met you...

976
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,440
<i>and it frightened me a lot...

977
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:27,700
<i>Made me laugh a lot...

978
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:30,820
<i>Made my heart move a lot...

979
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,700
<i>They became sounds and it overflowed me.

980
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,910
<i>My sound.

981
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,870
<i>Will it be able to reach you, I wonder...

982
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:15,950
<i>It would be nice that it does.

983
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,000
This is Kosei's...

984
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:25,670
love letter to Kaori.

985
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,640
<i>The words we've exchanged...

986
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,850
<i>A little bit of regret...

987
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,770
<i>The humming of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star..."

988
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:48,900
<i>The scenery where I can't 
regret what supports me.

989
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:51,950
<i>They cheer me up.

990
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:55,240
<i>When I'm inspired...

991
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:58,200
<i>I will play.

992
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,250
<i>I'll play for you.

993
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,560
<i>Next time, I will tell you.

994
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,810
<i>I am here.

995
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,030
<i>I will not leave you alone.

996
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:36,330
<i>Like I will let you be alone.

997
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:38,370
<i>Reach it.

998
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:41,540
<i>Place everything I have.

999
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:42,660
<i>Reach it!

1000
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,910
<i>Dear Kosei Arima.

1001
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,086
<i>Writing a letter to someone 
I was just with awhile ago...

1002
01:49:06,492 --> 01:49:08,354
<i>feels a bit strange.

1003
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,620
<i>The first time I saw you perform...

1004
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,250
<i>was when I was five.

1005
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:18,880
<i>It was the recital of the piano school
I was attending.

1006
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,010
<i>The boy who appeared awkwardly,

1007
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,590
<i>hit his butt in the chair 
and made the audience laugh.

1008
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,140
<i>Facing the piano that was too large...

1009
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:29,850
<i>The moment when a note was played...

1010
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,270
<i>you became my admiration.

1011
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:37,360
<i>I wanted to perform with you someday
no matter what, so...

1012
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:40,490
<i>I started playing the violin.

1013
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,360
<i>But even still...

1014
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,990
<i>you stopped playing the piano.

1015
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,540
<i>After influencing one's life,
you are a horrible person.

1016
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:54,830
<i>Dimwit.
Slowpoke. Dummy.

1017
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:02,720
<i>When I found out we were in 
the same high school, I was elated.

1018
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,760
<i>I always kept thinking how could I 
find a way to talk to you.

1019
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:10,470
<i>But in the end, 
all I could do was watch you.

1020
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:15,060
<i>After all, the three of you
were always too close.

1021
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:18,820
<i>There was no space for me to slip into.

1022
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:24,500
<i>I had surgery as a child,

1023
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:26,660
<i>and then got treated regularly
as an outpatient.

1024
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:30,870
<i>When I collapsed in the first year of middle school,
I went in and out of the hospital, repeatedly.

1025
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,870
<i>The time I began spending in the hospital grew.

1026
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,710
<i>One night, at the hospital's waiting room,

1027
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,670
<i>when I saw my mother
and father crying...

1028
01:50:41,670 --> 01:50:43,010
Why?

1029
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:45,590
<i>I realized that I didn't have 
much time remaining.

1030
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,100
<i>That was the time...

1031
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,730
<i>when I broke into a run.

1032
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,610
<i>So that I don't take any regrets
with me to heaven...

1033
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:02,150
<i>I started doing whatever I wanted.

1034
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,490
<i>The contact lenses 
that I was so scared of...

1035
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,990
<i>I even changed my hairstyle.

1036
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:11,627
<i>Even the music scores that 
bossed me around haughtily,

1037
01:51:11,627 --> 01:51:13,378
<i>I played them my own way.

1038
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,420
<i>And then, just one...

1039
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:19,830
<i>I told just one lie.

1040
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,250
<i>I, Kaori Miyazono...

1041
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,380
<i>lied that I liked Ryota Watari.

1042
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:29,510
Why?

1043
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,010
<i>That lie would bring before me...

1044
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:35,640
<i>Kosei Arima.

1045
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:38,940
<i>It brought you to me.

1046
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,770
<i>Apologize to Watari for me, okay?

1047
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,240
<i>Also...

1048
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,700
<i>please apologize to Tsubaki for me.

1049
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:54,040
<i>I'm just someone who is passing by...

1050
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:57,500
<i>I didn't want to leave
an awkward mess behind.

1051
01:51:58,370 --> 01:52:01,630
<i>So I couldn't ask Tsubaki
to introduce us.

1052
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,840
<i>After all, Tsubaki...

1053
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,970
<i>was so crazy about you.

1054
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:14,260
<i>The "you" that my underhanded lie brought forth...

1055
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,140
<i>was far from how I imagined you.

1056
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:21,230
<i>You were more dark...

1057
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,150
<i>and passive than I thought.

1058
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,117
<i>Not to mention, a stubborn guy
and a camera voyeur.

1059
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:30,450
<i>Your voice was deeper than I thought...

1060
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:33,700
<i>and you were more manly than I thought.

1061
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,750
<i>And you were just...

1062
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:39,290
<i>as gentle as I thought.

1063
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,803
<i>The river that we jumped off 
from the Bridge of Bravery

1064
01:52:44,803 --> 01:52:47,210
<i>was cold and felt good.

1065
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,090
That was scary!

1066
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:50,303
<i>In the sandy beach we walked together,

1067
01:52:50,303 --> 01:52:52,550
<i>that squeezy feeling...

1068
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,970
<i>There's just something about 
school at night, right?

1069
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:06,520
<i>How the most unforgettable scenes 
can be so trivial, isn't it weird?

1070
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,400
<i>How about you?

1071
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:16,370
<i>Was I able to live inside your heart?

1072
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,300
<i>You made yourself home 
as soon as you barged in.

1073
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,210
<i>Do you think...

1074
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:26,630
<i>you'll remember me
at least a little?

1075
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:30,720
<i>If I forget you, you know 
you'd come back to haunt me.

1076
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:33,010
<i>You'd better not hit reset.

1077
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:35,760
<i>As if I ever would.

1078
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:38,310
<i>Don't forget me, okay?

1079
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:42,190
Okay.

1080
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:44,650
<i>That's a promise.

1081
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:47,820
Yeah.

1082
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,280
<i>Will it reach you?

1083
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,280
<i>I hope it can reach you.

1084
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,830
<i>Kosei Arima...

1085
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:22,600
<i>I love you.

1086
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:35,660
<i>Sorry I was so selfish.

1087
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,450
<i>Sorry a million times over.

1088
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:47,380
<i>Thank you.

1089
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:53,210
<i>Kaori Miyazono.

1090
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,730
You're on a break, right?

1091
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:11,020
Why don't you come in?

1092
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:21,780
It's just that when I'm confined here...

1093
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,750
You know!

1094
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:27,670
Right? Right? 
Feels great, doesn't it?

1095
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:34,550
Are you properly eating?

1096
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,340
Yeah.

1097
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,430
I'm eating like half the amount 
of what you're eating.

1098
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:47,020
Hey. 
What did you mean by that?!

1099
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:49,270
It sounds like I eat a lot!

1100
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:51,520
Don't you?

1101
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:57,400
Ow...

1102
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:00,320
Hey, don't think you're alone.

1103
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:04,040
I'll keep following you everywhere
like a bound ghost.

1104
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,370
That's why, don't think you're alone.

1105
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:14,750
So hot!

1106
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:18,220
Why is it already this hot 
when it's only spring break?

1107
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,430
Ow!

1108
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:21,390
See?
He's also here.

1109
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:23,140
What do you think you're doing?

1110
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:32,310
Are you eating properly?

1111
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:38,490
You two are thinking the same thing.

1112
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,570
What?

1113
01:57:03,063 --> 01:57:05,883

1114
01:57:05,883 --> 01:57:08,829

1115
01:57:08,829 --> 01:57:11,855

1116
01:57:11,855 --> 01:57:14,819

1117
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:19,558

1118
01:57:19,898 --> 01:57:27,227

1119
01:57:27,223 --> 01:57:28,910
<i>Kosei Arima.

1120
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:31,790
<i>What color is your surroundings right now?

1121
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,540
<i>My life, you see...

1122
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,550
<i>was really colorful because of you.

1123
01:57:38,769 --> 01:57:41,290
<i>I'll end up letting go of your hand.

1124
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:47,061
<i>"Hurry up," saying that 
you're making me worry,

1125
01:57:43,874 --> 01:57:47,061

1126
01:57:47,061 --> 01:57:49,979
<i>you start running off fast.

1127
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,204
<i>As I always only chased you,

1128
01:57:53,204 --> 01:57:57,554
<i>I was only watching your back,

1129
01:57:57,554 --> 01:58:01,982
<i>without even knowing the tears
that you were hiding.

1130
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:07,404
<i>I was happy

1131
01:58:07,404 --> 01:58:13,017
<i>because of that voice 
that disappears like wind.

1132
01:58:13,017 --> 01:58:20,113
<i>In haste, I called out your name.

1133
01:58:15,585 --> 01:58:20,113

1134
01:58:20,113 --> 01:58:23,335
<i>That smiling face that looked back,

1135
01:58:23,339 --> 01:58:30,229
<i>was saddeningly beautiful.

1136
01:58:31,169 --> 01:58:32,956
<i>In this spring,

1137
01:58:32,956 --> 01:58:35,896
<i>tears aren't stopping.

1138
01:58:35,896 --> 01:58:42,014
<i>That gentle warmth 
that was always beside me,

1139
01:58:42,014 --> 01:58:44,938
<i>still remains in the palm of my hand.

1140
01:58:44,938 --> 01:58:49,545
<i>Hey, the thing that 
you aren't there anymore,

1141
01:58:49,545 --> 01:58:52,499
<i>even though I know,

1142
01:58:52,499 --> 01:58:56,861
<i>I still end up calling you
over and over.

1143
01:58:56,861 --> 01:58:59,907
<i>To connect our feelings,

1144
01:58:59,907 --> 01:59:02,943
<i>even though I was holding that hand,

1145
01:59:02,943 --> 01:59:08,872
<i>your voice was always shaking painfully.

1146
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:08,872

1147
01:59:08,872 --> 01:59:13,599
<i>All that I couldn't put into words,

1148
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:17,286
<i>see that they are within me...

1149
01:59:17,286 --> 01:59:24,396
<i>living this moment.

1150
01:59:24,876 --> 01:59:30,394
<i>Good-bye....

1151
01:59:32,188 --> 01:59:36,567
<i>That love...

1152
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:44,157
<i>I won't forget.

1153
01:59:44,995 --> 01:59:47,886
<i>Tears aren't stopping,

1154
01:59:47,886 --> 01:59:50,890
<i>I won't be able to see you anymore right?

1155
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:53,901
<i>The days we spent together

1156
01:59:53,901 --> 01:59:56,919
<i>gradually become a distant light.

1157
01:59:56,919 --> 02:00:01,606
<i>Hey, even so, I have to go.

1158
02:00:01,606 --> 02:00:04,527
<i>Even if you aren't there,

1159
02:00:04,527 --> 02:00:08,865
<i>I'll go looking for tomorrow.

1160
02:00:08,865 --> 02:00:11,895
<i>Tears aren't stopping,

1161
02:00:11,895 --> 02:00:14,858
<i>I always loved you.

1162
02:00:14,858 --> 02:00:17,889
<i>No matter how many times spring comes,

1163
02:00:17,889 --> 02:00:20,944
<i>I won't forget anything, so...

1164
02:00:20,959 --> 02:00:25,714
<i>Hey, I already conveyed good-bye...

1165
02:00:25,714 --> 02:00:36,831
<i>I'll also live in the "now,"
where only you aren't there.
