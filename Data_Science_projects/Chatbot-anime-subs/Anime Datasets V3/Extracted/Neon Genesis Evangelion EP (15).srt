1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,420
The second and third
Ashino Lakes,

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,120
I hope there won't be any
more of those.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,500
I received a complaint from
Chairman Keel about the delay.

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,990
He came directly to me.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,500
He was very upset. He even
threatened to dismiss you.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,970
Adam is growing well,

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,700
and work on the dummy plugs for
the Eva Project is proceeding.

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,980
What are those old men of Seele
complaining about now?

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,240
The all-important Instrumentality
Project is behind schedule.

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,490
All the projects are linked.
There are no problems.

32
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,980
Including Rei?

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,810
Well, never mind.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,660
By the way, what should
we do about that man?

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,330
Leave him alone for now. The
same with the Marduk Institute.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,030
I agree, let him work
for us for a while.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,700
<i>Kyoto</i>

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,570
What started here, sixteen
years ago?

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Episode 15
A Lie and Silence

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,550
It's me.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,830
Yes, so it is.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
Shannon Bio, a foreign
chemical firm.

43
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,030
It has been here for nine years,
and not a single change.

44
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,420
The Marduk Institute has 108
affiliated companies.

45
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
106 of them are dummy
corporations.

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,650
And this is the 107th?

47
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,220
This is the corporate registration.

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,450
And you want me to take a look at
the board of directors, don't you?

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,890
You know about it already?

50
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,760
I know all of the names.

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,570
The Marduk Institute is supposed
to be an advisory body

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,800
controlled by the Instrumentality
Committee to select Eva pilots.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,070
What it really does is not clear.

54
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,940
Your duty is to investigate NERV.

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,340
Getting involved in the Marduk
Institute is inappropriate.

56
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,750
Well, be that as it may, I want
to see everything for myself.

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,240
<i>Hi, this is Kaji.</i>
<i>I'm out right now.</i>

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,120
<i>Please leave your name</i>
<i>and message.</i>

59
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,620
Help me, Kaji! Don't touch me,
you pervert!

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,970
That'll do it!

61
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,670
What's going on?

62
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,360
Well, I want to go out tomorrow.

63
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,740
So I've been calling Kaji to ask
him to take me, but he's been out.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,050
He's always out lately.

65
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,040
So, you'll have time tomorrow?

66
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,610
Regrettably so.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,990
Then, I have a favor to ask of you.

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,080
Well, it's like this...

69
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,390
A date?!

70
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,530
A friend of my big sister, Kodama,

71
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,260
keeps asking me to introduce
you to him.

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,290
I beg you!

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,380
Get to work!

74
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,420
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,520
YOU! Get to work!

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,450
<i>Microsis operation complete.</i>

77
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,260
<i>Graph measurement complete.</i>

78
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,360
Which dress will you wear tomorrow?
<i>Synch ratio is normal.</i>

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,460
For the wedding?

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,560
I wore the pink suit for
Kiyomi's wedding,

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
and the dark blue dress
for Kotoko's shower.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,770
What about the orange one?

83
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,270
You haven't worn that one
lately, have you?

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,540
Well, there's a reason for that.

85
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,840
It's too tight?

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,330
Yeah, so what?!

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,100
Should I get a new one
on the way home?

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,500
It's an extra expense.

89
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,720
We've been invited to so
many showers lately,

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,850
that the cost of all the gifts
is starting to add up.

91
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,790
Everyone's just rushing to get
married before they're thirty.

92
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,820
No one wants to be the
last one still single.

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,930
Okay, you can take off now.

94
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,420
<i>Good work.</i>

95
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,600
<i>I'm tired of these stupid tests.</i>

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,760
By the way, Shinji looks even more
downcast than usual today.

97
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,100
That's because of tomorrow.

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,550
Yes, tomorrow.

99
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,910
Tomorrow, I have to see my father.

100
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,420
What should I talk to him about?

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,990
Why do you ask me?

102
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,020
Because I've seen you talking
happily with him.

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,420
Say, my father, what kind
of person is he?

104
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,790
I don't know.

105
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,440
I see.

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,670
You've been watching me because
you wanted to ask me that?

107
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,620
When we were cleaning today,

108
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,420
you were squeezing the cloth.

109
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,940
The way you squeezed
it was like a mother.

110
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,180
A mother?

111
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,750
I thought it was like a mother.

112
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,360
I think you'll make a good
mother, Ayanami.

113
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,260
You're embarrassing me.

114
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,740
<i>You're the one who caused us to break up!</i>

115
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,310
I'm home.
<i>You're the one who caused us to break up!</i>

116
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,610
What's up?
<i> </i>

117
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,680
What's up?
<i>I was wrong. I must've been crazy.</i>

118
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,920
You'd better go to bed. Aren't you
going on a date tomorrow?
<i>I was wrong. I must've been crazy.</i>

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:03,980
You'd better go to bed. Aren't you
going on a date tomorrow?
<i>I don't care how you were!</i>

120
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,650
Yeah, with a hunk.
<i>I don't care how you were!</i>

121
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,050
<i>I don't care how you were!</i>

122
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,020
<i>I'm different now anyway!</i>

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,820
Hey, that's right, let me use your lavender perfume!
<i>I'm different now anyway!</i>

124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,520
Hey, that's right, let me use your lavender perfume!
<i>But I still love you!</i>

125
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,390
Absolutely not.
<i>But I still love you!</i>

126
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,360
Jeez, cheapskate!
<i>But I still love you!</i>

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,390
Jeez, cheapskate!
<i>You can't turn back the clock!</i>

128
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,660
It's not for kids.
<i>You can't turn back the clock!</i>

129
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,830
Is Shinji in his room?
<i>You can't turn back the clock!</i>

130
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,760
Is Shinji in his room?
<i>We can't go back to that time!</i>

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,230
He's been shut up since he got back.
<i>We can't go back to that time!</i>

132
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,530
He's been shut up since he got back.
<i>But I still love you!</i>

133
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,070
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father.
<i>But I still love you!</i>

134
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,500
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father.
<i>I tell you, it's impossible!</i>

135
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,330
If he doesn't want to, why doesn't he just say so?
<i>I tell you, it's impossible!</i>

136
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,570
I don't understand the Japanese.
<i>I tell you, it's impossible!</i>

137
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't understand the Japanese.
<i>It took me three years to forget you!</i>

138
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,470
Well, he doesn't really hate him.
<i>It took me three years to forget you!</i>

139
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,410
<i>It took me three years to forget you!</i>

140
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:27,970
That's the problem.
<i>It took me three years to forget you!</i>

141
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,070
That's the problem.
<i> </i>

142
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,100
Go away!

143
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,550
Well done, Shinji.

144
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,330
Shinji?

145
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,820
I'm opening the door.

146
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,830
Are you scared? Of seeing
your father by yourself?

147
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't run away.

148
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Unless you step forward,
nothing will change.

149
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,600
I know that!

150
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,210
You'll begin to realize,

151
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,910
after that first step, it's just as
important to take another step.

152
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,690
Anyway, go see him tomorrow
with your chin held high,

153
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,280
because you'll be seeing
your mother too.

154
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,580
Well, good night.

155
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,400
Hey, you bought a new dress for
tomorrow, didn't you? Let me see!

156
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,740
Oh, you want to see?
It's an expensive one.

157
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,300
The price doesn't always
reflect the design.

158
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,970
Tell me about it.

159
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,840
Did you pick one to Kaji's taste?

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,450
I don't think so. Not anymore.

161
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,100
<i>The next day.</i>

162
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,150
Well!

163
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,780
See you...

164
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,650
Later.

165
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,190
Place three bags in your heart...

166
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,430
Ladybugs with red, blue
and yellow dresses...

167
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,400
Now let us proceed with
the reception.

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,500
<i>Ryoji Kaji</i>

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,730
Little Ryoji's late.

170
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,540
That idiot has never been on
time in his entire life!

171
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,870
For your dates, you mean?
He's always on time for work.

172
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,170
Hey, girls! You look
marvelous today.

173
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,980
I couldn't get off work.

174
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,540
I don't believe that. You never
do anything anyway.

175
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,520
Why didn't you shave?
That stubble's awful.

176
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,110
Look, your necktie is crooked.

177
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,690
Well, thank you.

178
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,450
You two act like you're married.

179
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,730
Good point, Ri-chan.

180
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,250
Who the hell would marry
this dork?

181
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,180
It's been three years since the last
time we came here together.

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,480
I ran away then,

183
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,190
and haven't been back since.

184
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,660
My mother is resting here?

185
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't really believe that.

186
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,160
I don't even remember her face.

187
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,230
Man survives by forgetting
his memories,

188
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,230
but there are some things a
man should never forget.

189
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,900
Yui taught me about the
irreplaceable things.

190
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,890
I come here to confirm that.

191
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,540
You have no pictures of her?

192
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,980
There are none.

193
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,210
This grave is just a decoration,
too. There's no corpse.

194
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,150
So, the teacher was right.
You threw them away.

195
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,050
I keep everything in my heart.
That is enough.

196
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,650
Time's up. I'm leaving now.

197
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,790
Father!

198
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,910
Well, I'm glad we could talk today.

199
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,070
Indeed...

200
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

201
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,070
Not bad! I didn't know you played.

202
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,540
I've been studying since I was
five, but I'm not very good.

203
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,240
I don't really have any talent.

204
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,440
Perseverance is power.
I'm impressed.

205
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,710
I started studying because
my teacher told me to,

206
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,350
but I could have quit anytime.

207
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,780
So, why didn't you?

208
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,020
Because nobody told me to stop.

209
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,150
I should have known!

210
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,820
You came back early. I thought
you'd have dinner too.

211
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,990
He was just so boring!

212
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,530
So, while he was waiting in line
for the roller coaster, I left.

213
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,370
That's harsh.

214
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,860
Really, Kaji is the only cool guy.

215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,040
It's getting late.

216
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm going to the bathroom.

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,830
Are you going to leave me alone?

218
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,050
High heels...

219
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,120
We haven't really gotten together
to drink lately, have we?

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,890
Misato's drinking too
much, isn't she?

221
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,060
She's acting a little out of control.

222
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,320
Sometimes one drinks to keep
oneself under control.

223
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,800
We all do.

224
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,430
As someone who lived with her,
your words carry a weight of truth.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Well, I did live with her,

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,570
but that was before she started
wearing heels like a real woman.

227
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,610
That's not how we saw it back
when we were in school.

228
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,510
I was a kid.

229
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,420
That wasn't really life.
Kid's play is what it was.

230
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,520
Life isn't that easy.

231
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,020
Oh yeah, I forgot to give you this.
A souvenir from a cat.

232
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,320
Oh, thank you. You're very honest.

233
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,930
Only with the ladies. When it
comes to work, I'm less so.

234
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,830
I somehow doubt that.

235
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,060
What about Misato?

236
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,760
I lost once before.

237
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,900
It's not my style to keep fighting
a battle I'm sure to lose.

238
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,730
I think you still have a
chance to win.

239
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,940
What about you?

240
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,370
It's my policy to never
talk about myself.

241
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,900
There's nothing amusing
about me.

242
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,010
Why is Katsuragi taking so long?
Fixing her make-up maybe?

243
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,380
What were you doing in Kyoto?

244
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,820
No, that's from Matsushiro.

245
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,250
Don't try to fool me.

246
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,020
Your fingers will get burned if you
get involved in this too deeply.

247
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,620
That's the advice of a friend.

248
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,360
I'll take it seriously,

249
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,590
but I'd prefer to be burned by the
heat of my passion for you.

250
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,590
Should I buy you some fireworks?
But I'd prefer to be burned by the
heat of my passion for you.

251
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,900
Should I buy you some fireworks?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

252
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Welcome back!

253
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
You never change, do you?

254
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,400
Of course I change, living
means changing.

255
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
Homeostasis and transistasis.

256
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
What are those?

257
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,140
One is a force for the status quo,
and the other's a force for change.

258
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,380
Anything that contains these two
conflicting forces is alive.

259
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,140
Like men and women.

260
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,720
Well, I'll be leaving now. I've
still got some work to do.

261
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,920
Really?

262
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,160
Sorry to hear it.

263
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,650
Later.

264
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>Hey, Shinji? It's me.</i>

265
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,240
<i>I'm with Kaji. We're going</i>
<i>to be out drinking.</i>

266
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,410
Yes... Okay, later.

267
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,410
Was it Misato?

268
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,450
Yes, she'll be late, so don't
wait up for her.

269
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,480
Is she going to stay out
until morning?

270
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,080
I don't think so, she's with Kaji.

271
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,140
Are you an idiot?
That guarantees it!

272
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,700
Drinking so much you throw up
like a kid. How old are you?

273
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,530
I know, but I'm not a kid.

274
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,130
Well, neither of us are.

275
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,630
Damn right.

276
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,540
I can't believe you wear
high heels, Katsuragi.

277
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,300
Time's really flown.

278
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,410
Rough face... You need to shave.

279
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,970
I can walk now. Thank you.

280
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,050
Kaji, do you think I've changed?

281
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,480
You're even more beautiful.

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm sorry that I insisted on
breaking up with you.

283
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,130
When I said I had somebody else,

284
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,530
you knew that was a lie,
didn't you?

285
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,020
No.

286
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,410
It's just that I realized

287
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,340
you were so much like
my late father, Kaji.

288
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,390
When I realized that I
wanted a man

289
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,480
like my father, I was scared.

290
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,920
I was so afraid.

291
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,360
Being with you, Kaji...

292
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
Being a woman...

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,260
Everything scared me.

294
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,460
I hated my father, but fell in love
with someone just like him.

295
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,370
I chose to break everything
off and join NERV.

296
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,050
However, it turned out that my
father had worked for NERV too.

297
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,210
I tried to bury my feelings

298
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,410
by swearing vengeance
against the Angels.

299
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,520
That was your decision, Katsuragi.

300
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,630
You don't have to be sorry.

301
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,430
No, that wasn't a decision!

302
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,800
I just escaped from reality.

303
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
Escaped from the reality
called Father!

304
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,140
I'm just like Shinji.

305
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,630
I'm a coward.

306
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,740
I'm really sorry. I had to get
drunk just to tell you this.

307
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,640
That's enough.

308
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm just a child myself.
That's enough.

309
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm just a child myself.
<i> </i>

310
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,820
I have no right to tell
Shinji anything.

311
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,680
That's enough!

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm a coward! I just use men when I need to.
That's enough!

313
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,820
I'm a coward! I just use men when I need to.
<i> </i>

314
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,160
In the past, Kaji, I may have just...
just used you!

315
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm so pathetic!

316
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,660
I'm so pathetic!
That's enough! Stop it!

317
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,260
That's enough! Stop it!

318
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,460
I can't stand myself!
That's enough! Stop it!

319
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,760
I can't stand myself!
<i> </i>

320
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,210
Hey, Shinji, do you
want to kiss me?

321
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,720
What?

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
A kiss. A kiss? You've never
kissed a girl, have you?
What?

323
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,550
A kiss. A kiss? You've never
kissed a girl, have you?
<i> </i>

324
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,000
Then, let's do it.

325
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,800
But why?

326
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,500
But why?
Because I'm bored.

327
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,300
Because I'm bored.

328
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,130
Is that a reason?!

329
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,600
Do you not want to kiss on the
anniversary of your mom's death?

330
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,270
Afraid she may be watching
you from Heaven?

331
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,010
It's not that.

332
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,770
Are you scared?
It's not that.

333
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,340
Are you scared?
<i> </i>

334
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,580
Why would I be scared of a kiss?!

335
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,480
You brushed your teeth,
didn't you?

336
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,140
Then, here I come.

337
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,160
Stop breathing, it tickles me.

338
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,830
I should never kiss to kill time!

339
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,140
All right, here we are. Hang on.

340
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,110
Kaji!

341
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,450
Kaji!

342
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,860
Well, I'll be leaving now.

343
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,800
Why don't you stay with us, Kaji?

344
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,360
I'd be laughed at if I went
to work in this.

345
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,400
It'll be okay.

346
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,340
Hey, Kaji, it'll...

347
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,830
Later.

348
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,910
Lavender perfume...

349
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Please take care of Katsuragi.

350
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Sure.

351
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,020
Sure.
Well, night.

352
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,550
Well, night.

353
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,020
Goodnight.
Well, night.

354
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,040
Goodnight.
<i> </i>

355
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,830
What's wrong? You look sad.

356
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,230
It's because you kissed me!

357
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,458
<i>The next day</i>

358
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,970
Well, let me call the girl's roll.
Ayanami...

359
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,060
Oh, Ayanami's absent again?

360
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,971
<i>NERV Headquarter</i>
<i>Underground Central Section</i>

361
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,256
<i>Central Dogma</i>

362
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,174
<i>2008 meters below the surface</i>
<i>Terminal Dogma</i>

363
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,650
Hi, how are you feeling today?

364
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,210
I'm sober now, thanks.

365
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,350
I'm glad to hear that.

366
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,150
Is this your real job,
or your other job?

367
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,250
What do you think?

368
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,060
Ryoji Kaji of NERV's Special
Inspection Department...

369
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,960
At the same time, Ryoji Kaji of the
Japanese Department of Interior.

370
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,060
Oh, so you know.

371
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,270
You underestimate NERV.

372
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,100
Is this an order from
Commander Ikari?

373
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,570
No, my sole discretion.

374
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,670
If you keep doing this
other job, you'll die.

375
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,800
As long as Commander Ikari is
using me too, I can still do it.

376
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,680
However, let me apologize for
using you, Major Katsuragi.

377
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,120
It'll make us even for your
help yesterday.

378
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,680
Thanks very much, but...

379
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,550
The Commander and Ritsuko are
hiding something from you, and...

380
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,040
This is it.

381
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,750
This is...

382
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,960
Eva? No!

383
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,940
Impossible...

384
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,170
Yes, this is the source of everything
since the Second Impact.

385
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,660
The most important factor.

386
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,780
This is Adam.

387
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,150
Adam? Why is the
First Angel here?

388
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,580
Adam? Why is the
First Angel here?

389
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,220
You're right.

390
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know NERV at all.

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>To be continued...</i>

392
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Preview

393
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,300
Ikari Shinji finally surpasses Asuka and
scores the highest in the synchro test.

394
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,000
However, his overconfidence draws him into
Dirac's Ocean, with only little time to survive.

395
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,200
Next time:
"Deadly illness, then..."

396
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,900
Next time, service, service.
