00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,148
Father...

2
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:38,319
Father... Father...

3
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,767
Stop picking on my father!

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,344
R- run! Gohan, run away!

5
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,446
Father...

6
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:32,272
All right, I've decided. I think
I'll go back to where Mother is.

7
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,788
Ain't I gotten to...
Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place yet?

8
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,508
I wonder if Goku has arrived
at Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place

9
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,840
and is getting his training yet.

10
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:02,747
Uranai Baba-<i>sama</i> told us that even
once we gather the Dragon Balls,

11
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,784
not to bring him
back to life for a year.

12
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:10,755
Mmm... And one year is right about
the time when those Saiyan guys

13
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,916
are supposed to arrive here on earth.

14
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:18,062
I wonder if he'll be able to
defend earth against the Saiyans.

15
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,311
Bulma-<i>san</i>, aren't we there yet?

16
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,981
There's no doubt that he's
along this direction somewhere...

17
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,451
We have to find Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>
and them quickly,

18
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,319
and climb up Karin-to Tower.

19
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,989
Yamucha-<i>san</i> might already
have arrived there.

20
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,981
Earth's fate is in the balance.

21
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,939
Hey! It's time to eat!

22
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:13,275
Come quick, Tenshinhan! I've got
some top-notch cooking ready for you!

23
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,960
Ten-<i>san</i>, it's incredible!

24
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,296
How is it that there's so much?

25
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:34,288
I hired these guys to
make it all, of course!

26
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,971
I had nothing but first-rate ingredients
brought together! Right?

27
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,307
Must have cost some money.

28
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:48,646
Don't worry. I just finished a pretty
good job. By the way, Tenshinhan,

29
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:50,982
how long are you planning
on doing all this?

30
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,418
Until Ten-<i>san</i> beats Son Goku.

31
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,155
Cut it out, cut it out.
Things are peaceful now.

32
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:59,657
There's no use in getting any stronger.

33
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:03,928
And for that matter, you're strong
enough as it is in the first place.

34
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,361
I am not so strong.

35
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,935
When I met Son, I learned that
the world was a large place.

36
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:16,341
And it's not just Son, there's sure to be
other strong guys out there in the world.

37
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,468
That is why I train.

38
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,515
How about, instead,
you team up with me

39
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:26,618
and we hold up banks or something?
We could make a real bundle!

40
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,455
If we did, then you could eat as
much of this delicious stuff as you want!

41
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,290
After all, from now on,
money is everything!

42
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,693
Money talks in this world! As long
as we have money, we'll be happy!

43
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,297
Aren't you eating?

44
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,633
Ten-<i>san</i>, let's eat up!

45
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,536
That's more like it!
There's no need for you to hold back!

46
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,304
Go on, baldy, chow down!

47
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,639
R- right.

48
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,309
Y'know, Tenshinhan,
holding up banks is fun!

49
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,437
Just by shooting off your gun,
everybody gets the jitters!

50
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,284
Yeah, let's do it!
If you teamed up with me,

51
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:01,980
there's nothing we'd have to fear!
We'd be invincible!

52
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,490
Chaozu, training!

53
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,931
He's really got himself a hard head.

54
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,491
Ten-<i>san</i> can even
break rocks with his head!

55
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:21,265
That's not what I meant...
you stupid bastard!

56
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,171
I- I didn't mean it!

57
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:37,414
<i>Son, just what sort of</i>
<i>training are you doing?</i>

58
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,310
--<i>Oni?</i>
--Hey there! What are you doing, Pops?

59
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,279
What am I doing, <i>oni</i>?

60
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,806
I was asked by Great King Yama-<i>sama</i>
to clean this road <i>oni</i>.

61
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,253
I'm going to Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place!

62
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,256
<i>Oni</i>!? You're going
to Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place?

63
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:15,593
I've never seen a daredevil
dead person as big as you <i>oni</i>!

64
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,595
Is there still a long way to go?

65
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:21,032
Of course there is!
From what I've heard,

66
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:24,001
you're still only about halfway
to the halfway point <i>oni</i>.

67
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:28,770
Still only halfway to halfway!?
It is pretty long then, huh?

68
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:32,068
<i>Oni</i>?

69
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,671
Hey, what's the matter <i>oni</i>?

70
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,015
I need a little break!

71
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,180
<i>Oni</i>.

72
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,926
If you want me to take you part
of the way, I can give you a ride <i>oni</i>!

73
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,294
Get on back of here <i>oni</i>!

74
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,455
Really? Yahoo!

75
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,632
Ready, Pops!

76
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,566
All right, here we go <i>oni</i>!

77
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:38,760
Chaozu!

78
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,351
Ten-<i>san</i>, you did it!

79
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:56,752
No. I still have much more
to do than just this.

80
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,893
O- oh, no!

81
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,748
<i>How could I have done that?</i>
<i>l messed up the control over my power.</i>

82
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,826
<i>At this rate, it will</i>
<i>reach where that kid is!</i>

83
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,568
Hang in there, hang in there!

84
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:24,128
T- this is a big one!
And I can't stand earthquakes!

85
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,104
Tenshinhan!

86
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,988
Tenshinhan!

87
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,478
Ten-<i>san</i>!

88
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,308
Ten-<i>san</i>!

89
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,920
I've located Tenshinhan!

90
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:24,719
Where the hell have you gone!?

91
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,697
I made it!

92
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,385
I'm cold!

93
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,067
Huh?

94
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:42,105
Oh, my! Have I done it again?

95
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,643
Apparently, he's within those mountains.

96
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:49,409
That's just the kind of place you'd
expect Tenshinhan-<i>san</i> to be training!

97
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:56,848
I'm really sorry
I've been a bother to you.

98
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,992
I'll go back to the
Kame House for now.

99
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:05,930
That will be great. Please give
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i> my regards,

100
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,265
and tell him that we are continuing
to train as he would expect of us.

101
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:12,603
Yes, you certainly are.
Okay then, take care of yourselves.

102
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:14,264
--Be careful.
--Farewell!

103
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:23,280
Chaozu, now we can devote
ourselves to training.

104
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,248
She's an odd person.

105
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,797
Such pretty flowers!

106
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,566
They smell nice!

107
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,985
Stupid bastards! I've been
looking for you, you know!

108
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:37,818
You're trying to get rid of me,
but I won't have it!

109
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:44,151
Now cut out that stuff already,
and get over here!

110
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,455
Keep out of this!

111
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,894
B- bullets!?

112
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,005
I- impossible! To think
that Son could have died!

113
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:10,054
But Goku is training
in the Other World.

114
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:13,924
And we need to be sure that we can
keep up when the two Saiyans get here.

115
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:17,261
Kami-<i>sama</i> is going to be
training you, after all!

116
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:18,596
Ten-<i>san</i>!

117
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:21,265
It's something better than I could
have hoped for! We'll go immediately!

118
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,631
Ten-<i>san</i>, we can train!

119
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:25,603
What's more...

120
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,434
What is it, baldy!?

121
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,610
Hey, Tenshinhan...

122
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,613
If you're trying to run away from me,
I'm not about to let you.

123
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,915
I don't care if you're going to
Kami-<i>sama</i>'s place or anywhere else,

124
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,849
I'm going to come with you.

125
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,994
<i>l'm going to have Kami-sama</i>
<i>train me through-and-through!</i>

126
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,724
<i>Son, let's make sure</i>
<i>we meet again!</i>

127
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:10,111
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, I'm Son Goku...

128
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:15,942
<i>Oni</i>!

129
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:23,716
Yow! Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you're training
is as tough as I expected...

130
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:36,038
Ee-yow!!

131
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:45,673
W- where is this place?

132
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:51,687
I wonder if I've arrived at Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s
place without even realizing it.

133
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,122
That smells good!

134
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,171
That fruit looks delicious!

135
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:29,558
<i>Just where exactly</i>
<i>has Goku fallen into?</i>

136
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:35,132
<i>And as Umigame was anxious about,</i>

137
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,669
<i>and the Turtle Hermit was</i>
<i>unable to offer a reply to,</i>

138
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:44,801
<i>will Goku and the others be able</i>
<i>to defend earth against the Saiyans?</i>
