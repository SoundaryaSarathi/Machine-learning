1
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,730
Cockroach...

2
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,790
Under Shinichirou's shoe, there is a cockroach, too.

3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,010
In Shinichirou's hat, there is a cockroach, too.

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,540
Inside Shinichirou's heart, there is...

5
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,490
Yuasa Hiromi.

6
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,640
Fly.

7
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,200
Fly.

8
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,700
Go on!

9
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,050
Stop it...

10
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,010
I knew it...

11
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,500
I knew it... it was useless...

12
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,300
If you can't make your own decisions,

13
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,440
You won't have fun...

14
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,130
You won't be happy...

15
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,570
and you won't be able to laugh...

16
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,020
As I thought, you can't cry if you don't decide to yourself.

17
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,110
I was only looking down on you, because I thought, like me, you can't fly...

18
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,110
But, that was wrong...

19
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,700
You only chose not to fly.

20
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,370
You hold up your head and look straight ahead.

21
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,170
That's the same as flying...

22
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,900
Yeah,

23
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,170
I think Noe will return home soon.

24
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,570
Yes.

25
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,110
It didn't seem like anything happened, so relax.

26
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,760
Pass it along to him, as well.

27
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,530
Yup.

28
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

29
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,610
Bye.

30
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,370
What was she talking about?

31
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,510
I was the one comparing myself to Ground.

32
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,420
I was the one not noticing how great Ground really is.

33
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,800
The one opposing everything, was me, I chose to escape from reality.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
Ground chose not to fly,

35
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,990
but I didn't decide on anything myself.

36
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,610
The dance, the picture book...

37
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,790
Noe...

38
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,690
even Hiromi...

39
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,160
The reason I didn't want to do the dance wasn't because I'm bad at it!

40
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,700
It's because I didn't want to be compared to Dad!

41
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,850
The reason I didn't draw the picture book wasn't because I didn't feel like it!

42
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,640
It's because I was scared of learning my limits!

43
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,770
Welcome home, Noe.

44
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,130
I'm home.

45
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,550
Go on and wash your hands, it'll be ready soon.

46
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
You must be hungry, right?

47
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,770
Being out all night...

48
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,750
Hey, don't cling to me so hard.

49
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,610
The food will...

50
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,690
Thank you.

51
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,110
Thank you.

52
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,150
Thank you.

53
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,000
It's chilling cold... Let's head back in and get ourselves warmed up.

54
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,840
Enjoy.

55
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,260
Sorry for the trouble, ma'am.

56
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,920
Hey, where's the young master?

57
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,390
He should've gotten changed by now...

58
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,850
Hey...

59
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,510
I'll go have a look.

60
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,020
He should be getting ready in your room.

61
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,970
Alright.

62
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,300
Oh, you helping him change?

63
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm envious!

64
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,150
Now now, don't talk such nonsense, have some more!

65
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,380
Take a look! Try some of our local wine!

66
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,320
The three consecutive year award winning, Namida Sankei!

67
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,660
It's so delicious it'll truly make you cry...

68
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,950
You need any help?

69
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,700
That looks good on you.

70
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,220
Thank you.

71
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,890
Shinichirou-kun too.

72
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,620
Alright, one bottle of Namida Sankei to bring with you!

73
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,830
Did you get any sleep after what happened?

74
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,450
Well, err...

75
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,040
That really scared me last night...

76
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
Sorry I called...

77
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,170
And you even practiced so hard for today...

78
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,170
That doesn't matter...

79
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,280
The reason I couldn't sleep was...

80
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,970
Ahh, well... the lack of sleep isn't a problem.

81
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,690
Since it'll make me more alert.

82
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,020
I wonder where I can see you best...

83
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,480
I was thinking that I'd like to watch Shinichirou-kun from the closest possible place during the Hounou dance.

84
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,990
Perhaps near the shrine office would be best?

85
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,410
When the festival comes, I will be at the front row looking at Shinichirou dancing!

86
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,750
I guess so...

87
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,030
Alright, it's done.

88
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,760
Thank you...

89
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,180
It'll be really crowded, so don't force yourself just to watch.

90
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,510
I'm not going to the festival...

91
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,810
I decided it by myself.

92
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,640
Alright, it's time!

93
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,490
YEAH!

94
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,100
Excuse me!

95
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,230
Coming through!

96
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,650
Sorry I'm late!

97
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,610
Oh, we're doing fine over here.

98
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,700
We have a lot of free time until the Hounou dance ends.

99
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,260
Sorry I had you do all the work!

100
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,080
Ai-chan, it's been a long time.

101
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,410
Wow! Hiromi-chan, you look really good in a kimono!

102
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,930
Huh?

103
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
I wonder if she came to see Shinichirou...

104
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,340
His girlfriend, huh?

105
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,840
<i>I'm</i> his girlfriend.

106
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,200
Well, I guess all these are things I wouldn't know about.

107
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,730
Isurugi-san!

108
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,470
Hold on!

109
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,060
Last night...

110
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,230
What did you say to Shinichirou-kun last night?

111
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,070
Shinichirou-kun told me yesterday...

112
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,810
Everything... He said he'll do everything properly.

113
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,120
I have always loved Shinichirou-kun.

114
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm sure Shinichirou-kun feels the same about me.

115
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,970
I'm sorry...

116
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,040
I know I'm being selfish for what I've said,

117
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,670
But, we finally understand each other.

118
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,550
We can finally face each other honestly...

119
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,550
Sorry, but please leave us be.

120
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,990
We...

121
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,860
They're beautiful.

122
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,450
Your tears.

123
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,980
Ahh, I'm starving.

124
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,300
Hey, where you off to, master?

125
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,390
Oh, err, just some place.

126
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,440
Here, sorry for the wait!

127
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,020
Hey bro, the one just now wasn't completely cooked.

128
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,070
That's because we use only selected wheat!

129
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,260
Half cooked is just right.

130
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,740
Well said...

131
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,740
Alright, next custo-

132
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,430
Yo.

133
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,620
Ai-chan went to the community center, so I'm watching the store for her.

134
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,630
You're getting along well, aren't you?

135
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,460
Speaking of it, what are you doing?

136
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,470
What do you mean?

137
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,090
Should the star of the Mugiha dance really be loitering around here?

138
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,770
Really... What am I doing?

139
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,600
Huh?!

140
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,150
Shut up, Shinichirou!

141
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,450
Inside Shinichirou's butt, there is a cockroach, too!

142
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,470
Noe...

143
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,520
There was a call... from a printing company in Tokyo.

144
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,530
The boss went to watch the festival.

145
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,400
You can hang out here for a while.

146
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,910
Why did you decide that on your own?

147
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,950
You told me you were going to specialty school!

148
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,460
Why are you going to work, all of a sudden?

149
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,100
Because I promised Granny.

150
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,320
Remember that you locked yourself in your room after Granny died?

151
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,600
You didn't even come out to play with your friends.

152
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,600
I felt that I had to protect you...

153
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:14,900
Forever...

154
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,730
But... I am getting more and more confused.

155
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,070
I thought I only wanted to protect you, but I've done a lot of pointless stuff.

156
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,220
Onii-chan?

157
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,490
I love you.

158
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,610
I love Jun too.

159
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
But I think I love you a bit more than that.

160
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,540
It's strange to have such feelings,

161
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,760
that's why I asked him to take care of it.

162
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,740
Him?

163
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,170
I don't get it.

164
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,510
Is it really that strange to say you love me?

165
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,510
How is it wrong?

166
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,190
May I kiss you?

167
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,870
Didn't we kiss when we were kids?

168
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,650
Alright.

169
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,450
But, in return, you need to rethink about getting yourself a job.

170
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,890
Onii-chan...

171
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,060
That's probably the kind of kiss that I'd want.

172
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,080
I made many selfish decisions...

173
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,990
but being by your side... is too painful.

174
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,550
Inside Shinichirou's heart...

175
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,350
Inside my heart...

176
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,500
I didn't realize onii-chan's feelings...

177
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,820
Nor did I realize Yuasa Hiromi's feelings...

178
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,490
I didn't even realize how Shinichirou really feels.

179
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,830
Can tears really be shed...

180
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,840
...from my eyes which haven't seen anything?

181
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,340
Looks like this year's lead suddenly got better!

182
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,010
I'm pretty sure that's Nakagami's son.

183
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,390
Like father, like son.

184
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,280
But, why all of a sudden...

185
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,670
"When Raigoumaru came to,

186
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,590
"He's was tempted by the red seeds,

187
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,630
"And stood up on the cliff."

188
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,360
"'I want to fly!'"

189
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,350
"Is it because he wants to eat those red seeds?"

190
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,810
"Or is it because of this white snow?"

191
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,380
"That I do not know."

192
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,070
"But, that's what Raigoumaru was thinking deep within."

193
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,580
Yeah...

194
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,700
The only reason that I thought of drawing a picture book was...

195
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,950
because of those eyes... that believed I could fly.

196
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,400
You want to fly high in the sky.

197
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,470
Not for anyone else's sake,

198
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,840
Not for glory or history.

199
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,050
"And Raigoumaru spread his wings and flew."

200
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,950
The dance was great, wasn't it?

201
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,790
I know! I was totally into it!

202
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,010
I watched. It was really good.

203
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,630
Yeah...

204
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,050
Hiromi, I... need to...

205
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,300
Are you looking for Isurugi-san?

206
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,220
Huh?

207
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,220
I told her...

208
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,500
I told Isurugi-san not to interfere with us anymore.

209
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,270
Are you mad?

210
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,230
No, not really...

211
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,360
It's about time for me to go.

212
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,570
The festival is about to end.

213
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,780
Don't leave me alone...

214
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't leave me alone...

215
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,390
I wonder how the view is from the sky...

216
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,440
My picture book... I finished it!

217
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,800
Can I see it too if I look from the sky?

218
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,330
I want you to see it!

219
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,290
I want to know what you think!

220
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,640
Really?

221
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,810
Thank you.

222
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:54,870
Let's go in.

223
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,500
I hate how I am now.

224
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,270
Shinichirou said I can fly.

225
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,420
Your tears
