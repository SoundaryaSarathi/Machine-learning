1
00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:04,964
An enormous evil power
is about to be revived.

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,626
Finally, the time for the
final battle is here.

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,570
O sacred moonlight, please
give me strength.

4
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:16,073
Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and Mars,

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,240
we will always be together!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

7
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

8
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

9
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

11
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

12
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

13
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,257
The sunspot has continued
its abnormal expansion

16
00:01:58,257 --> 00:02:00,459
and all over the world various
natural disasters, such as

17
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,495
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
and hurricanes are occurring,

18
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:04,930
believed to be due to
this phenomenon.

19
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,765
Concerning this, the
Meteorological Agency

20
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,901
has said that this is a first
in observation history

21
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,903
and they cannot say how
it will affect Japan.

22
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:12,768
We have to do something
about it soon.
And they cannot say how
it will affect Japan.

23
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:23,214
The Sailor Warriors Die!
The Tragic Final Battle

24
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:32,224
Okay, everyone, thank you
for waiting!

25
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:35,227
This is Usagi's special curry and rice!

26
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:38,831
I'm so touched that you
cooked dinner!

27
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh, Dad, you're making such
a big deal out of it!

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,570
Okay, everyone, shall we dig in?

29
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,839
Is this really edible?

30
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:51,333
How rude! It looks bad,
but the taste is for real!

31
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,616
What's wrong, Usagi? Is something
the matter?

32
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:08,785
It's spicy!

33
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,759
I knew it.

34
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,327
Hikawa Shrine

35
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:18,504
Finally, it's time.

36
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,372
I can't wait!

37
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,341
I can't believe we've finally
come this far.

38
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:23,808
Hey, hey, Rei.

39
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:27,971
Did you at least kiss Yuichiro
before you left?

40
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:32,584
Why are you asking all of a sudden?!

41
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,820
Because if something were to happen,

42
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,954
you'd regret it.

43
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,184
Nothing like that is going to happen!

44
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,425
Ouch! You're mean! I was
just worried for you, Rei!

45
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,631
It's none of your business!

46
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,862
Usagi, let's stop thinking
about "what ifs".

47
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,502
She's right.

48
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,070
Like me? When this is all over,

49
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,664
I'm planning on having
a full-blown romance!

50
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:59,271
Mako... You're right. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,273
Love, huh? Maybe, me, too...

52
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,450
Come on, we don't have time
for chitchat.

53
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,892
Everyone, makeup!

54
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:18,158
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,108
Mercury Power

56
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,643
Mars Power

57
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:32,811
Jupiter Power

58
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,613
Venus Power

59
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,410
Makeup!

60
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:49,561
You're going to D-Point in the
North Pole in one shot!

61
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,629
How?

62
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,632
You'll combine your powers to teleport.

63
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:57,769
We're injured, so we'll stay behind
to avoid getting in your way,

64
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,937
but you'll be okay, right?

65
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,073
As long as the sailor warriors
work together,

66
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,541
you'll be able to defeat
Queen Beryl for sure!

67
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:41,005
Sailor Teleport!

68
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:00,128
Good luck!

69
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,226
May everyone comes home safely.

70
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,266
It's COLD!

71
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:12,210
How can you all act like
there's nothing wrong?!

72
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,547
Shut up! If you stand up straight,
you won't be cold!

73
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,811
When it's cold, it's cold
no matter what you do!

74
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,341
This certainly doesn't bode well.

75
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,189
Everyone, I found it!

76
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:27,090
A large amount of evil energy is
being released from over there!

77
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,106
Queen Metalia will be revived shortly.

78
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:43,008
I will not allow you to interfere!

79
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,778
Whoever wants to give them a
death sentence, come forward!

80
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,906
Please allow us, the DD Girls, to
take that assignment!

81
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,119
Wait!

82
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,459
The evil energy reading
is growing stronger!

83
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:10,632
It's coming!

84
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,940
Tuxedo Mask...

85
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:20,979
Tuxedo Mask!

86
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,181
Wait! It could be a trap!

87
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,046
This would usually be a trap.

88
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,618
But...

89
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:29,721
You get targeted first because
you're so simpleminded!

90
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,489
But...

91
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,922
I'll check into it right now.

92
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,859
Help me, Sailor Moon.

93
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:41,765
Sailor Moon...

94
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:47,372
I just can't leave him like that!

95
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:47,773
Wait, Sailor Moon.

96
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:48,573
Wait!
Wait, Sailor Moon.

97
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:49,074
Sailor Moon!
Wait, Sailor Moon.

98
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:49,768
Sailor Moon!

99
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,235
But he's suffering! How can you
ignore him like that?!

100
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,048
Let me go!

101
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:57,749
Everyone, watch out! He's a monster!
Let me go!

102
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,017
Everyone, watch out! He's a monster!

103
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,109
What?!

104
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,126
I told you so!

105
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,559
I'm sorry!

106
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,135
Hey, monster! How dare you trick me?!

107
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,371
I was a fool for being so gullible,

108
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:22,808
but you're bigger fools for crushing
a girl's innocent feelings!

109
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:26,478
Because, because, you've
seriously made me mad!

110
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:27,512
So, now...

111
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:28,877
You talk too much!

112
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,943
Anyway!

113
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,041
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

114
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:39,825
Oh! Five?!

115
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:44,023
You guys don't stand a chance
against us in D-Point!

116
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,830
Sailor Moon, I love you.

117
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,607
What kind of ninny would fall
for the same trick twice?!

118
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:58,410
Don't fall for it as I'm saying that!

119
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,743
But what if he's the real
thing this time?!

120
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,282
See?!

121
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:04,850
But!
See?!

122
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,578
But!

123
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:09,352
Don't underestimate us!

124
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,881
Oh! Motoki!

125
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,846
Moon Tiara...

126
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:37,337
Fire...

127
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,390
We can't! Jupiter will get
caught in our attack!

128
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,053
Don't worry about me! Hurry,
go to where Queen Beryl is!

129
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:59,804
You've got some nerve using
electric shock against me!

130
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,039
What?!

131
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,370
Prepare yourselves!

132
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:07,140
Supreme Thunder!

133
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:12,341
You impertinent little...

134
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,248
Die!

135
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,827
Why you!

136
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:55,186
Jupiter!

137
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,298
Everyone...

138
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,095
We're coming to help you!

139
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,498
I'm done...

140
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:10,564
Instead, everyone hurry to
where Queen Beryl is.

141
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,180
No! We can't! We have
to all go together!

142
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,115
Mako, remember what you told me?!

143
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:19,743
That you'd have a full-blown
romance when you got back!

144
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:22,352
That's what you told me.

145
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,091
You shouldn't lie!

146
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:28,753
The King of Hell will yank
your tongue out.

147
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,287
There's no time for crying, Princess.

148
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,862
Come on, cheer up...

149
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:48,077
Mako!

150
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:52,774
You can't! You can't die!

151
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,177
Come on, let's go.

152
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,280
No!

153
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,748
Sailor Moon!

154
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:24,517
If this is what we have to go through,

155
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:26,712
we should just give them the
Silver Crystal.

156
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,321
What are you saying?!

157
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,992
That's right. That's what we should've
done from the start!

158
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:33,559
Listen, Queen Beryl! You can have
the Silver Crystal!

159
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,427
Wait, Sailor Moon!
Listen, Queen Beryl! You can have
the Silver Crystal!

160
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:35,694
Idiot!
Listen, Queen Beryl! You can have
the Silver Crystal!

161
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:37,161
Listen, Queen Beryl! You can have
the Silver Crystal!

162
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:40,800
Let me go! Because I have this,
that's why Mako...

163
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,927
I just want to get this over with
and go home...

164
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,565
I'm sorry, but please understand.
Don't waste Jupiter's death.

165
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,275
They're coming!

166
00:12:59,318 --> 00:12:59,952
Okay!

167
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:03,251
You three go on ahead.
I'll hold them here.

168
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,157
But...

169
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:07,059
Past this point, we'll need
your powers,

170
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,463
since you have stronger attacks!

171
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:11,497
So, go!

172
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,294
Ami, you're not going to...

173
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,498
I won't die.

174
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,801
That's a promise!

175
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:20,431
Yes!

176
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:39,882
Now, come and get me!

177
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:44,891
Urawa!

178
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,560
So, I get to see this kind
of illusion too.

179
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,970
Bubble

180
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,345
Spray!

181
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:25,902
It's an illusion, but it has real heat!

182
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,330
Okay, the origin of this illusion
is the stone on her forehead!

183
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:34,138
I'll have to get rid of the origin
of the illusion.

184
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:37,314
Bubble

185
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,477
Spray!

186
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:55,401
Hurry up and turn into a roast pig!

187
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,068
How rude!

188
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:57,036
Then how about a baked potato?
How rude!

189
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:57,695
Then how about a baked potato?

190
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,070
Die!

191
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:15,449
Maybe this will be the
last time I use this.

192
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,628
I can't use my illusions anymore!

193
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:45,017
Ami's...

194
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:47,419
Ami's...

195
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,354
Ami's dead!

196
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,824
Don't cry like a baby
every single time!

197
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,890
Remember, more enemies
will be coming at us!

198
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:05,733
But... But I never expected
something like this...

199
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,570
Watch out!

200
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:12,505
Minako!

201
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,841
Stop it! You can have the Silver
Crystal, so let Minako go!

202
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,683
If you do that, I'll never forgive you!

203
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:29,028
Fool! Begging for her life
won't do you any good!

204
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:33,089
We'll take the Silver Crystal
after we kill all of you!

205
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,663
First, we'll take care of this one!

206
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,629
Minako!

207
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,606
Crescent

208
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,409
Beam!

209
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,673
Minako!

210
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:26,819
Sailor Moon.

211
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,153
What?

212
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:30,553
We always fought, but it was fun.

213
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:32,958
Why are you saying?!

214
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,426
I have to say it, just in case
something happens.

215
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,125
We said we weren't going
to talk about "what ifs"!

216
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:46,205
Oh, wait! I understand!
I'll do the rest by myself!

217
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,174
I'll beat them all and beat Queen
Beryl, and I'll come home,

218
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,335
so, Rei, go back home ahead of me!

219
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:53,540
I don't want you to die!

220
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:58,844
You still have the final big battle
ahead of you,

221
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,818
so you have to conserve your energy.

222
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,794
Oh, come on, no one
says I have to die!

223
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:12,161
Okay, Rei's gonna go take
care of them real quick!

224
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,468
Fire...

225
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,172
They're fast!

226
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,474
Rei!

227
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:38,884
Rei?

228
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,261
You're mine!

229
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,648
Rei!

230
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:04,081
How dare you?!

231
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:25,836
Now, that finally leaves
just the princess.

232
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,667
Rei!

233
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,642
Prepare to die!

234
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:35,007
What?!

235
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:40,716
I'm not done yet.

236
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,391
Fire

237
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:48,791
Soul!

238
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:08,908
Just like you said, I should
have kissed Yuichiro...

239
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:13,881
I really wish I had.

240
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,895
Mako...

241
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:24,463
Ami...

242
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,931
Minako...

243
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,159
Rei...

244
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,969
I know, this is a dream.
It's just a dream.

245
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,475
When I wake up,

246
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:38,705
everybody will say, "Good morning!"
Just like always.

247
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:43,639
And Rei will call me,
"Clumsy Usagi"...

248
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,389
Come on, cheer up.

249
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,730
Usagi, be strong!

250
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:06,701
Don't give up hope!

251
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:10,008
Usagi, stand up!

252
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:11,100
Okay.

253
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,341
We'll always be together!

254
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,119
Everyone...

255
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,655
Now, run!

256
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:34,362
Okay!

257
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:42,535
That's right! I'm not alone!
Never alone!

258
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:14,795
During the day, the
fragrance of flowers

259
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:18,444
During the night, the
twinkle of the stars

260
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:26,146
It's a world no one knows about

261
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:30,050
With white shoes clicking

262
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,860
Cross the white moon bridge

263
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:41,960
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

264
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:48,603
Offer a prayer to the moon

265
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:57,344
It will surely bring you happiness

266
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:04,552
Go round and round, the
moon's merry-go-round

267
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:12,827
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

268
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:20,373
She's always watching over us

269
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:26,903
Moon, moon princess
