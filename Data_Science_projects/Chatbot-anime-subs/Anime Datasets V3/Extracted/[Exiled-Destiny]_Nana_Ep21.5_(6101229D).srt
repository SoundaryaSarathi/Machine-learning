1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,638
Say, Nana Komatsu. Remember
close to our high school graduation,

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,678
we stood beside each other
and looked onto the school grounds

3
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:07,938
from the girls' toilet?

4
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:13,808
Those stories of love you'd tell me then?
Please, never tell me those again.

5
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,038
When I was darkness at that time

6
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:43,878
With trembling lips

7
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,968
In a corner of a room I cry

8
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,048
The more I struggle

9
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,888
The more this wound deepens

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,048
The broken promise hurt me

11
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,788
Nobody can save me

12
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,968
God, I have only one request

13
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:09,598
Stop tearing apart my love

14
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:12,938
I need your love

15
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,168
I'm a broken rose

16
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:19,108
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

17
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:21,278
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

18
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:24,048
I need your love

19
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:27,358
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:30,288
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

21
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:34,248
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

22
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:37,228
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:55,508
Hello! Welcome to another evening
at Junko's room.

24
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,778
Good to see you. How've you been?

25
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,788
In any case this place
always has no customers.

26
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,948
No, they'll come.
I'm sure they'll come tonight.

27
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:06,958
Shin and Nobu and Yasu.
Or maybe the members of Trapnest.

28
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,258
What's this?
Did the Demon Lord tell you?

29
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:11,928
Oh, a customer really came.

30
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,298
Welcome!

31
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,288
Junko. Congratulations
on the grand opening!

32
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:19,098
Huh? Why you, Koichi Sato?

33
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:24,338
I hear you have some serious fans.
They've gotta be real maniacs.

34
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,408
They're not maniacs!

35
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,448
So, how's Nana doing lately?

36
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,048
Huh? By Nana,
you mean Nana Komatsu?

37
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,988
Mhm. She hasn't dropped by
Jackson Hall lately,

38
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,578
and as a result I don't get to
appear in this anime much.

39
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,248
Did something happen
between her and Shoji?

40
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,428
You really are the worst!

41
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,168
I have totally lost respect for you!

42
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,398
I just didn't get a chance to talk about it.

43
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,938
I wasn't necessarily hiding it.

44
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,998
Don't make excuses! You were planning
on two-timing them, weren't you?

45
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,908
Junko! Do you think I'm capable
of doing something like that?!

46
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:01,348
Of course not!

47
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,688
You can't do it, yet you try and
reach for more than you can handle,

48
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:06,308
and as a result, you hurt
a young woman's loving heart.

49
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,718
You think she's hurt.

50
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:12,818
Of course she's hurt!
Sachiko's in love with you, right?

51
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,658
But maybe I'm just hoping that she is.

52
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,958
She hasn't actually told me
that she likes me.

53
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,728
And nothing has changed since.

54
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,568
We still continue seeing each other
as no more than friends.

55
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:25,228
Your intellectual level has remained
the same since junior high.

56
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,898
This is nonsense!

57
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,008
Junko!

58
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:31,698
Don't talk to me like that!
What should I do to make things right?!

59
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,508
You hafta put an end to this.

60
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,348
So Sachiko's more important
to you than Nana?

61
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,388
You're wrong!

62
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:45,688
Koichi Sato, I'm going to work!

63
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,198
I'm gonna break ties with her!

64
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,988
I'll do what I can to be buried
in the same grave with Nana!

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,258
Sorry to keep you. Let's hurry.

66
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,308
Wait, Sachiko!

67
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:03,098
I hafta talk to you about something.

68
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,188
You know!

69
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,408
Sorry.

70
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,308
- I'm really sorry.
- You've done nothing wrong, Shoji.

71
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:41,138
I jumped to conclusions on my own
and got carried away.

72
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:46,548
I will be careful not to interfere.

73
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:51,988
I will never interfere in your relationship
with your girlfriend.

74
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:58,998
So... please.
Can't we at least be friends?

75
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:02,128
Don't ask me to end this.

76
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,268
That's strange.

77
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:17,718
Shoji should be done with work,
but I get his answering service.

78
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,718
I wonder if he forgot to switch it on.

79
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,688
He's probably cheating on you.

80
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,278
Shoji wouldn't do such a thing!

81
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:24,888
I'll send him an email.

82
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,288
You know, there's nothing
we can do about Shoji.

83
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,008
You know, I didn't think
he was the kinda guy

84
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:41,238
who was capable of cheating,
by any means.

85
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,008
As far as I know, neither did I!

86
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,778
He's not just fooling around, either.
He's serious about the other girl.

87
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,108
He's seriously fallen in love with Sachiko.

88
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,808
He's no longer able to
think rationally or morally.

89
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:54,748
There's nothing we can do.

90
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,558
Shoji!

91
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,528
I came.

92
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,558
Hachi wouldn't shut up
about wanting to see you.

93
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:05,628
Umm... Then allow me
to show you to your table.

94
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,058
This way, please.

95
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,378
Sachiko.

96
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,988
They're finally finished.
Someone's coming out.

97
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:34,558
Really?

98
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:35,998
Sachiko!

99
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:54,978
What are you doing?
What's with this woman?

100
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,758
She's my girlfriend.

101
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:02,788
Huh?!

102
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,028
You telling me that
you have two girlfriends?

103
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:11,428
You sure have it good!

104
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:12,918
Don't!

105
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,068
Sachiko! It's okay, stay back!

106
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,478
Don't be violent with Shoji!

107
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,438
Stay out of this!
This has nothing to do with you!

108
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,138
You're the one who
has nothing to do with this!

109
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,178
If you want to hit someone, hit me!

110
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:27,878
H-Hey!

111
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,578
I was the one who had a crush on him!

112
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:33,118
I knew he had a girlfriend,
and still I could not stop myself!

113
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,378
Hachiko!

114
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:37,528
Why are you just standing there?!
This is your fight!

115
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,578
You do something!

116
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:40,258
If you don't fight, you've accepted defeat!

117
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:42,918
He's your man, isn't he?
Fight to get him back!

118
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:46,598
I don't want him.

119
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:52,798
I don't even wanna see his face.

120
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,518
Is that so. So that's what happened.

121
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:08,848
That's right.

122
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,688
Hey, speaking of the cheating fellow.

123
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,188
He's getting closer.

124
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,168
Oh, he's leaving.

125
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,628
You fool. It's because
you tease him too much.

126
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,568
Hey, Shoji. Come over here.
Let's drink together.

127
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,038
I'm home.

128
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:29,838
Hachiko!

129
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,308
A live show! A live show!

130
00:08:31,308 --> 00:08:33,818
They had an opening in
an upcoming event at Shimokita,

131
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,338
and they're letting us
fill that spot and play.

132
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,278
Huh?

133
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:38,778
It's for thirty minutes on May 5th!

134
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:47,558
Yay!

135
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:50,058
Don't cry, Hachiko!
We're gonna party today!

136
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,708
Thank you.

137
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:23,288
I see. And has Nana been able to
recover from her problems?

138
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,818
Well, yeah, I guess you could say
she recovered, but...

139
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,618
Huh? Then she's back to
feeling depressed again?

140
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:29,918
Oh, no worry of that.

141
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:32,568
She's had many things going on,
one after another.

142
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,328
And did I mention "many things"?

143
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:35,298
Hm?

144
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,638
Let him tell you the story, Koichi Sato.

145
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,038
Being able to have dinner
with the BLAST band members,

146
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:44,378
and the chance to talk with Nana...
I'm so happy I could die.

147
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,268
It's like I'm still in some dream.

148
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:48,438
You're exaggerating.

149
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:53,648
No, really. I've been a BLAST fan
since the very beginning,

150
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,348
but nothing like this has ever happened.

151
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:56,778
It really is like a dream to me.

152
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,988
I see. When you say since
the very beginning, when was that?

153
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:01,998
It was with the first set of members,
back when Ren was in the band.

154
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,618
So, almost four years ago?

155
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,998
It was a shock when Ren left BLAST,
but don't you think Shin, the new bassist,

156
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:10,198
plays just like Ren does?

157
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:14,068
So at the live concert it was like a revival
of the BLAST of old times.

158
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,608
I was really thrilled.

159
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,868
Name a guitarist you respect.

160
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,348
Ren Honjo!

161
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,378
That's the flower of the lotus, isn't it?
Why did you choose the lotus?

162
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,378
Actually, it's the ren.

163
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,158
No way.

164
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:35,228
Still that's no reason
to come to my place.

165
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,298
Please tell me, Nobu.
You know a lot about this, don't you?

166
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,138
Ren was BLAST's bassist.

167
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:44,138
He and Nana were lovers
and they lived together,

168
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,838
but two years ago
he was offered the chance

169
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:46,928
to become Trapnest's guitarist.

170
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,838
He came to Tokyo alone,
and no one's heard from him since.

171
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:51,708
So I told him everything.

172
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,908
Wait! No one's heard from him since?
Then what about him and Nana?

173
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,078
They had a tearful breakup, right?

174
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,848
That's right. And there's nothing left
for me to tell you.

175
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:17,438
I don't hate Ren and I don't
wanna badmouth him,

176
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,808
but Ren decided to
leave BLAST and join Trapnest

177
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,538
without talking it over
with Nana or myself.

178
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,278
Only Yasu knew about it.

179
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,148
So at that time, I really felt betrayed,
and it was a great shock.

180
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:36,158
As a fellow musician,
my pride was shot down

181
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:37,718
and I couldn't shake off
this feeling of utter defeat.

182
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:44,488
But both Nana and I acknowledged
Ren's talents and we respected that.

183
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:48,398
We could predict that this would be
better for Ren's sake,

184
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,698
and of course, that proved to be true.

185
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:59,008
I believe this was the best outcome.

186
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:01,938
But Nana, .,

187
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,048
Back then, she could've
gone with him if she desired.

188
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:09,718
But rather than choose
happiness as a woman,

189
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,588
she chose to protect her pride.

190
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:16,828
I think that's the reason
why she's so insistent on

191
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:19,388
succeeding as a musician,
no matter what.

192
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:21,698
She has her heart set on someday

193
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,898
reaching the level of success Ren, .,
Trapnest is enjoying.

194
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:29,368
From time to time, it pains me
to see that about her.

195
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,248
Do you still love Ren?

196
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,148
You knew.

197
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:01,298
I'm sorry. Acting as if I didn't know.
But, .,

198
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,168
You brought me here knowing, right?

199
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:06,868
Thank you.

200
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,518
Ren...

201
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:32,688
Hm?

202
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,048
That thing you said earlier. Is it true?

203
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,098
Which one?

204
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,598
Right now, I'm not about to
give up my pride

205
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,198
so I can't live with you like we used to.

206
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:48,668
But it would be nice if we could
maybe meet like this from time to time.

207
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:54,578
Hold each other
and talk about each other.

208
00:16:56,018 --> 00:17:01,488
And one day when we're much older,
when I no longer care about

209
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:05,078
pride and vanity,
when I've grown tired of singing...

210
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,718
Then can I return to that home too?

211
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:25,438
So that's pretty much what happened.
Huh? Where'd Koichi Sato go?

212
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,238
He went home a moment ago.

213
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,418
Did he pay?

214
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,318
There. He left a Jackson Burger for you.

215
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:35,118
Barter trade?!
But I love his Jackson Burgers!

216
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:36,348
Though that one's already cold.

217
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:38,818
Welcome!

218
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,918
What is Ms. Sakagami, age 38,
doing here?

219
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,028
Because of her serious fans...

220
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:48,638
who don't exist.

221
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:49,618
No they don't.

222
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,968
- Excuse me, you people over there.
- Y-Yes?

223
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:54,508
I hear you're friends of Nana Komatsu.

224
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,638
What is it with that girl? First of all,
when it comes to her work ethics...

225
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:01,818
You know this woman is
your typical character

226
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,848
who ends up having
very few appearances.

227
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,248
Even fewer than Koichi Sato.

228
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:07,848
Mhm. This is very strange.

229
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,558
Why are we visited by

230
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:11,218
all these characters
who hardly appear in the show?

231
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,558
That's because this is where

232
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,118
the "Characters with Few Appearances"
gather.

233
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:17,798
- Huh?
- Huh?

234
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:19,858
With you three at the lead.

235
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,368
- No way!
- No way!

236
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,468
Th-That's impossible.

237
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,458
We will have many more appearances.

238
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,208
You'll have no more.

239
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,468
- That's not your decision to make!
- That's not your decision to make!

240
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,368
You've got plenty blooming lately
right in your own garden.

241
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,178
I want happiness as soon as possible too.

242
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,508
Or rather, a boyfriend.

243
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,608
Then we'll organize a party.

244
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:44,548
Not that way. I want a love
that's meant to be.

245
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,988
Oh, but now that you mention it,
a party might be good, too.

246
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,058
Say, Yasu, do you have a girlfriend?

247
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,768
Unfortunately, I'm not popular
with the women.

248
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,798
Say, Nobu, don't you have a girlfriend?

249
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:58,198
I don't.

250
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:00,468
Presently recruiting
"within-reach characters".

251
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,738
Super within-reach character

252
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,238
Welcome home, Nana.

253
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:20,588
Miss Komatsu!

254
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,528
How long is it taking you
to sort those postcards?

255
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,198
You really are slow!

256
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,168
Miss Komatsu!

257
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:27,228
Can't you even make copies properly?!

258
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,258
I'll call you later.

259
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,568
Come on, Ms. Sakagami.
What are you doing here wasting time?

260
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:33,058
Please get back to work.

261
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,808
Ms. Sakagami!

262
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:36,638
The Chief says I'm fired!

263
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:37,938
- Naturally.
- Huh?

264
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:41,178
No way. Ms. Sakagami.
Although you were hard on me,

265
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:44,348
I thought you were the kinda person
who would stand up for me in the end.

266
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,218
Do you think the world exists for you?!

267
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:49,478
It's a result of how spoiled
you've been acting. Farewell.

268
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,628
Unidentified Caller

269
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,228
- Yes?
- Nana?

270
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:08,478
It's me, Takumi.

271
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,968
Do you have a moment to talk?

272
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,008
Sure.

273
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,038
I reached into the sky

274
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:55,548
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

275
00:20:56,218 --> 00:21:00,918
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

276
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:06,918
Like colorful balloons

277
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,038
I'm alone

278
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,768
My hand had no place to go

279
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:19,398
And gently you took it

280
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:20,578
Starless night

281
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:24,778
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

282
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:30,578
I want to feel your warmth

283
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,458
Tears are falling down

284
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,558
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

285
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:43,058
Of your hand holding mine

286
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:11,288
So, there you have it. How did you enjoy
the second episode of "Junko's Room"?

287
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,268
Until the next time!

288
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,798
- Goodbye!
- You are pathetic.
