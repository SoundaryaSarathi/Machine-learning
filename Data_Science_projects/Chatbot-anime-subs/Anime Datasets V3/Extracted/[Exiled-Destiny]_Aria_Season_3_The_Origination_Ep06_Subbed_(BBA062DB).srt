1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,070
I made another mistake...

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,470
Geez, you must be such a handful for Alicia.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,140
Did she scold you?

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,500
No.
Did she scold you?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,870
No.

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,270
No.
Then, what did she say?

7
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,070
Then, what did she say?

8
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,410
She said "My, my," and giggled.
Then, what did she say?

9
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,640
She said "My, my," and giggled.

10
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
She's way too nice...

11
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,450
But I guess "My, my. Giggle!"
is what you'd expect from Alicia, right?

12
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,780
No, what she should have
said was, "Hey, hey. Grumble."

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,600
Such big strawberries!

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,060
Yeah! They're also very sweet.
Such big strawberries!

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,530
Yeah! They're also very sweet.

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,630
Sir, I'd like these, please.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,440
Here's your change.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,740
Athena, you forgot to take what you bought!

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,210
Akari! Your change, your change!

21
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,610
Ah, my mistake!

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,980
Geez, what are you doing?!

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,750
Sorry, Aika.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,840
Why are you always like this, Athena?

25
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,160
It's you...

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,020
Hello!

27
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,630
Hello Alice, Athena.

28
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,220
Hello.

29
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,230
"Akari, I got scolded by my mother again."

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,630
"Ai, I get scolded by Aika a lot, too."

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,480
"I know she scolds me because
she cares about me, but..."

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,850
"I wish I didn't have to get scolded at all!"
"...I wish I didn't have to get scolded at all!"

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:43,630
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,900
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

35
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,050
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,860
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,260
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,760
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,170
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

40
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:33,640
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:43,410
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,700
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:57,440
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,580
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,180
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

46
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,020
That Wonderful Extracurricular Lesson...

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,940
Huh?!

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,400
A-Are you helping me practice, President Aria?

49
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,580
He's... helping?

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,350
So heavy!

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,850
I see, President Aria!
This is strength training, isn't it?

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,860
This is visual acuity training, isn't it?

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,800
Visual acuity?

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,270
President Aria fell asleep already...

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,570
This is balance training, isn't it?

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,070
Hey, Akari! No playing around allowed!

57
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,910
Yes!

58
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,480
You...

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,310
...always end up enjoying
practice a little too much!

60
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,220
You're going to get scolded by Alicia
if you keep this up, you know.

61
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,940
Right, Junior?

62
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,990
Th-that's right...

63
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,720
Sorry...

64
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,420
Scolded...

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,660
Reflect! Reflect on your actions!

66
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,170
Um, Akari, how does Alicia scold you?

67
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,160
Huh?

68
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,080
I don't think... Alicia... has ever... scolded me...

69
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,680
Say what?!

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,780
Not even once?!

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Nope.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,550
Now that you mention it, I don't think
I've ever seen her get angry, either.

73
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,900
I see... I guess that makes sense...

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,870
Knowing Alicia, there's no way
she'd scold someone...

75
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,570
Let alone get mad...

76
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,070
After all, this is Alicia we're talking about!
Impressive, as expected of Alicia!

77
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,670
She truly is a water fairy descended
from the heavens! Miss Perfect!

78
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:24,480
But, come to think of it, I've never seen
Athena scold you either, Alice.

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,990
That's really obvious.

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,030
I may scold clumsy Athena at times,
but I never get scolded myself.

81
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,100
Oh?

82
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,430
Well, I guess that makes sense.

83
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,710
Even I'm forced to scold Athena sometimes,

84
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,370
so it's really a mystery why
Alicia doesn't scold Akari.

85
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,080
P-President Aria!

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,820
I was about to really make a loud noise there.

87
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,330
My, my.

88
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,070
Are you all right?

89
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,030
Yes...

90
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,340
Even Alicia is human.

91
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,910
There must be times when she's irritated
or angry, when no one's around.

92
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,380
Besides, if she truly cares about Akari,
she should scold her properly.

93
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm really sorry!
Besides, if she truly cares about Akari,
she should scold her properly.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,550
It's all right.
Besides, if she truly cares about Akari,
she should scold her properly.

95
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,670
It's all right.

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,270
Alice?

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,590
W-What are you doing, Alice?

98
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,990
A-Ah, yes...

99
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,600
Since the members of the
Aria Company always treat me so well,

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,390
I thought I'd secretly return the favor
by helping out with the cleaning.

101
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,010
Oh, no!

102
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,180
What are you doing up there?

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
N-Nothing...

104
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,380
U-Um...

105
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:19,130
I woke up early, so I thought I'd come by
and say hello before going to school.

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,490
Eh?

107
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,810
Huh? Alicia, what happened?

108
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,440
My customer had another commitment,
so I finished early today.

109
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,980
Why don't we all have some tea together?

110
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,650
Yay! I get to have tea with Alicia!

111
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,050
I'm happy for you, Aika-

112
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh, impressive, President Aria!

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,350
I-I'm so sorry, President Aria.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,330
Are you all right, President Aria?

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,770
Come to think of it, where's Alice?

116
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,470
She said she had something
to do today, and went home.

117
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,480
President Aria?

118
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,270
Huh?
Wha-?!

119
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,590
Alice?

120
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,950
What are you doing here?
I thought you had something to do?

121
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,490
S-Something to do...

122
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,390
I-I finished early and had a hunch that there
might be a tea party with Alicia, so I came back.

123
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,560
Huh?

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
A hunch?

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
I was right, wasn't I?

126
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,710
Are you all right?

127
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,780
Geez, what are you doing?

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,110
W-W-W-W-What am I going to do?!

129
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,650
This was Alicia's favorite teacup...

130
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,750
My, my, what was that sound?
What?!

131
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,380
My, my, what was that sound?

132
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,280
I-I'm sorry!

133
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,130
Thank goodness...

134
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,860
...none of you were hurt.

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll help clean it up.
...none of you were hurt.

136
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,700
I'll help clean it up.

137
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,570
I'm really sorry!

138
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,840
My, my, it's all right. Don't worry about it.

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,370
Again, she didn't scold her.
My, my, it's all right. Don't worry about it.

140
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,670
Again, she didn't scold her.
I'm really, really sorry!

141
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Oh, no! Akari's gondola is drifting out to sea!

142
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
Don't worry!

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll go after it!

144
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Aika, what should I do?!

145
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,490
This is all because you
didn't tie the rope properly!

146
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,980
Oh, no!

147
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,250
This is a really good chance to see her get mad!

148
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,800
This is a really big mistake.

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,790
Even Alicia will have no choice
but to scold Akari for this.

150
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,130
My, my...

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,710
It looks like the mooring rope was
hit and severed by something sharp.

152
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,550
Thank you so much, Alicia.

153
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,850
It's all thanks to President Aria
for noticing it right away.

154
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,550
Thank you so much, President Aria!

155
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,460
Come now, let's all finally have some tea.

156
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,930
Yes!

157
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,830
Just what you'd expect from Alicia!

158
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:10,370
Akira would have just jumped to conclusions
and yelled, "Hey Aika! You tied it wrong!"

159
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,270
She really was calm, wasn't she?

160
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,610
But...

161
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,080
...if this really had been Akari's mistake...

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,380
...then surely, even Alicia would have scold-

163
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,390
Surely she would have scolded her... right?

164
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,640
Could it be...

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,210
...that she doesn't scold Akari,
because she's given up on her?

166
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,110
That couldn't be it... Could it?

167
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,240
Alicia...

168
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,650
It's been a week since then.

169
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,910
I've been unable to find any clues
to reveal what Alicia is thinking.

170
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,520
Maybe Akari making a really big mistake
is the only way to find out, after all?

171
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,430
Thank you for waiting.
Here is your special parfait.

172
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,740
This is to replenish the blood sugar in my brain,
so I can come up with a much better plan!

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,240
What a coincidence, Alice.

174
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,680
Are you on your way home from school?

175
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,380
Y... Yes.

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,010
Would you mind if we join you?

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,010
P-Please...

178
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,880
Th-This is really awkward.

179
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,760
I-Is this some kind of...

180
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,090
...punishment?!

181
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,590
Same one, please.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,970
Yes, certainly.

183
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,380
Has she figured out that I've
secretly been observing her?

184
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,290
Say, Alice.

185
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,850
Y-Yes?!

186
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,630
My, my

187
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,330
My, my
My, my.

188
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,500
My, my.

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,070
Naughty troublemakers who snoop on
other people from the shadows...

190
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,230
...must be punished, don't you agree?

191
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,270
I-I'm really in a pinch!!

192
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,880
Could this be the first time
we've ever been alone together?

193
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,910
Eh?

194
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,180
Ah, yes...

195
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,380
Now that you mention it...

196
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,230
Isn't it strange, considering
how long we've known each other?

197
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,450
Yes.

198
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,630
So Alice, is there something
you'd like to ask me?

199
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,830
Thank you for waiting.

200
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,140
W-W-What do you mean?

201
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,680
You've been watching me
a lot lately, haven't you?

202
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,850
You were looking at me so intently,
it made me a little self-conscious.

203
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,020
Since we're alone, you're welcome
to ask whatever you like.

204
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,540
Giggle

205
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,110
Giggle
I knew it, she saw right threw me!

206
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,300
She truly is Miss Perfect!

207
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,380
In that case... Go for broke!

208
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,080
Um... Alicia, why don't you scold people?

209
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,520
Akari told me. She said that
she's never seen you be angry.

210
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,860
I was wondering why that is.

211
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,910
You never scold your apprentice,
no matter how grave a mistake she makes?

212
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,040
If that's true, don't you think
you're being a bit cold?

213
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,720
Excuse me, President Aria.

214
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Could you please go give this
to that little girl sitting over there?

215
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,170
Um...

216
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,900
Alicia?

217
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,010
U-Umm...

218
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,220
Alicia...

219
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,590
Hello?

220
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,530
Mr. Cat, is this candy for me?

221
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,660
Thank you!

222
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,280
My, my.

223
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,510
President Aria, that was amazing!

224
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,280
The errand was a big success!

225
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,560
That girl is really happy, too.

226
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,190
Now this time, go to the boy
sitting at the next table.

227
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,300
Thank you!

228
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,870
Amazing, amazing! That was
much quicker than before!

229
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,910
What do you think?

230
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,210
Ah, yes...

231
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,420
He delivered them successfully.

232
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,990
Alice, why don't join me for
a walk after you finish your parfait?

233
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,120
Eh?

234
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,410
Um...

235
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,840
His first try took a while, didn't it?

236
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,350
Why didn't you point out his mistakes, like when
he got sidetracked or went to the wrong table?

237
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,690
You see...

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,710
...say President Aria and I were playing a game,
trying to split a watermelon blindfolded.

239
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,040
I wouldn't shout, "Not that way, not that way!"

240
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,010
I'd keep shouting, "This way, this way!"

241
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,710
If I kept shouting, "not that way," President Aria
would become afraid of making mistakes.

242
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,220
Eventually, I don't think he'd be able to move.

243
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,940
That's my way of doing things.

244
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,710
Umm...

245
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,160
What would you do if he kept on
making mistakes, though?

246
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,290
Well...

247
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,870
If that happened, I'd reflect on my own
lack of knowledge alongside him.

248
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,960
Eh?

249
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,080
After all, I'm just an imperfect human being.

250
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,700
As a mentor, when you
instruct your apprentice...

251
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,060
...there are times when things
just don't go the way you want them to.

252
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,870
When that happens, I often think to myself,

253
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:17,340
"Ah, teaching and being taught are,
in fact, very much alike."

254
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,640
So, in that case, all I can do is try to
see things from Akari's point of view.

255
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,210
I'll share her challenges, share her defeats...

256
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,650
And, in the very end, I hope to
share her happiness as well.

257
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,370
Alicia!

258
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,210
Alice!

259
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,700
My, my.

260
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,240
It's one coincidence after another today, isn't it?

261
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,850
President Aria, I was wondering where
you went, and here you are with Alicia!

262
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,700
We were also wondering where Junior
could be, since she was late for practice...

263
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,560
...and we catch her strolling
around with Alicia? No fair!

264
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,000
Alice, please keep the conversation
we had just now between us, okay?

265
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,200
Why?

266
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,070
Because...

267
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,170
...it's embarrassing.

268
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,590
I don't see any point in keeping it a secret.

269
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,070
The two of you are so alike, I get
embarrassed just watching you both.

270
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,790
That was really disrespectful of me.

272
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,490
Please scold me.

273
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,230
My, my.

274
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,800
Yay!
My, my.

275
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Yay!

276
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,160
Hey! No monopolizing Alicia allowed!

277
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,930
"I wish my mother was like Alicia."

278
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,110
"Hmm... But then my mother
wouldn't be herself, would she?"

279
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,350
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

280
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:47,090
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

281
00:22:49,800 --> 00:23:00,940
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

282
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:09,870
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

283
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:23,260
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

284
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:32,330
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

285
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:45,550
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

286
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,090
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

287
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:57,290
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

288
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,620
And my day begins
Hajimaru
