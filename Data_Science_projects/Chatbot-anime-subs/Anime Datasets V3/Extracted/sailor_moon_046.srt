1
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:08,196
Everyone, thank you for
giving me courage.

2
00:00:09,936 --> 00:00:13,428
Evil beings, in the name of the moon,

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,007
Princess Serenity will
seal you away!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

5
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

6
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,687
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

7
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

8
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,534
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

9
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

10
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

12
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

13
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,948
So, this is the Dark
Kingdom's stronghold.

14
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:08,192
Ami, Rei, Mako, Minako...

15
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,822
I'll do my best to the very end!

16
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:21,806
Usagi's Everlasting Wish!
A New Reincarnation

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,953
So, little girl, you have come.
I will show you what Hell is.

18
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:50,071
Welcome, Princess! You have
done well to come this far.

19
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:53,643
I praise you for a job well done.

20
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,011
Queen Beryl.

21
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,280
Yes, I am Queen Beryl.

22
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:08,589
Endymion, kill the princess!

23
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,456
As you wish.

24
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:28,447
Moon Healing Escalation!

25
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:37,412
You are wasting your time.

26
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,994
You are still not a
full-fledged princess.

27
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:43,363
Even if you use the Silver Crystal,

28
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:46,299
you will not be able to
remove Queen Metalia's

29
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,324
dark energy from Endymion's body.

30
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:53,472
Stop wasting your time and quietly
hand me the Silver Crystal.

31
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,480
Sailor Moon.

32
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,315
Die.

33
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:25,334
Mamoru...

34
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,602
Dumpling Head.

35
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,488
Mamoru...

36
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:11,884
Soon, the sun will be covered
entirely by sunspots

37
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,409
and Queen Metalia will be revived.

38
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,983
That is enough, Endymion.

39
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:27,166
Cut off the princess's head!

40
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:32,403
It's no use!

41
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:42,105
Soon, Queen Metalia will be revived.

42
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,151
When she fills this world
with her dark energy

43
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,584
by using the Silver Crystal,

44
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,248
she is certain to utilize its
power to the maximum.

45
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:55,188
Everything you have been doing
will have been meaningless!

46
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,160
Endymion has dark energy within him.

47
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,754
You will not be able to
defeat him so easily.

48
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,193
Stop...

49
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,659
Sailor Moon!

50
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:12,531
Stop...

51
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:16,075
Die!

52
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:18,771
Please stop!

53
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:36,988
Please remember.

54
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,899
I am Serenity.

55
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,635
In the distant past, we swore
to love one another.

56
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:44,728
I am Serenity of the Moon Kingdom.

57
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:48,937
Anyone who opposes the
Dark Kingdom must die!

58
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,912
You are just being corrupted
by the bad energy.

59
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:55,107
Please regain your gentle heart...

60
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,281
I don't want to.
I don't want to fight you!

61
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,751
So, please.

62
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,467
What?!

63
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,584
Who am I?

64
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,484
I can't remember anything!
Am I all alone?!

65
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:44,422
No, you're not.

66
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:50,325
You have me.

67
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:51,795
What?

68
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:56,107
Don't worry. You're not alone.

69
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,023
Mamoru!

70
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,624
Usagi...

71
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,697
Thank you.

72
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:26,766
Mamoru...

73
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,971
I'm so glad!

74
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:35,481
I will not forgive you, Princess!

75
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:39,185
Trying to steal Endymion
from me again!

76
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,278
I will not forgive you!

77
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,429
Mamoru!

78
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:59,772
Endymion, why do you
protect that girl?!

79
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,340
If you had married me,

80
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,468
you could have been the
king of all the worlds!

81
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,777
Impossible!

82
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,843
Mamoru, hang on!

83
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:16,717
How can something
like this defeat me?

84
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,656
Energy?!

85
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,759
Is Endymion's love for that girl
destroying my body?!

86
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:33,135
I won't accept it!
I will never accept it...

87
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,734
Mamoru! Mamoru!

88
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,707
Hurry, leave this place!

89
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:42,303
What?

90
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,080
And go back to being an ordinary girl,

91
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:49,587
and find a cool boyfriend
or something.

92
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:53,715
You're the coolest, Mamoru.

93
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:04,827
Mamoru...

94
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:07,272
Mamoru!!

95
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,647
Queen Metalia, please
lend me your power.

96
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:54,512
Please give me the power to
defeat that hateful girl!

97
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,885
Very well.

98
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,092
The time has come to bestow
hatred and suffering

99
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:07,129
to all living creatures in this universe.

100
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:12,772
Queen Beryl, kill everything
and everyone

101
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:15,741
and turn the world pitch-black!

102
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,483
I'm sorry.

103
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,423
I can't kiss you.

104
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:45,038
Rei, Ami, Mako, and Minako...
They all died

105
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,768
before they could even kiss
the boy they loved.

106
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:52,935
So, I can't find happiness
just by myself.

107
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,105
I'm sorry, Mamoru.

108
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,918
I'm not going to run away.

109
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,409
There are still things I have to do.

110
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:06,487
Watch me. I'll do my best.

111
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:44,263
I have finally obtained the
energy of darkness.

112
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,929
I will rule this world!

113
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:00,842
So, you have come, Princess.

114
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,486
This time, you will die.

115
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,080
Princess!

116
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,157
Die!

117
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,912
Jubancho Shopping District

118
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:51,053
It's the end.
The end of the world has come!

119
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:55,134
Queen Metalia's dark energy
has been released!

120
00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:59,072
Wait, Luna!

121
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,741
Out of my way!
I'm going to D-Point!

122
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:05,268
It's useless!
There's nothing we can do now!

123
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:08,081
I know all that!

124
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,879
But, at this rate, Usagi will...

125
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,320
She'll unleash the power
of the Silver Crystal!

126
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,780
Then Usagi will die,
just like Queen Serenity!

127
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:23,117
I know! But there's no other way
to save the world now.

128
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,287
Don't do it Usagi!

129
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,864
Don't unleash the power
of the Silver Crystal!

130
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,036
If you do, Usagi, you're going to die!

131
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,463
Moon Healing

132
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:10,075
Escalation!

133
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:18,885
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

134
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:24,891
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

135
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:25,758
Why?! Why you go to such
lengths to defy me?!
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

136
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:29,262
Why?! Why you go to such
lengths to defy me?!
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

137
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:31,164
You dream of a beautiful future,
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

138
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,698
but you are sure to eventually realize
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

139
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:33,232
but you are sure to eventually realize
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

140
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:36,903
that this world is already
ugly and filthy!
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

141
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:37,937
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

142
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:38,805
No! I have faith!
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

143
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:39,739
No! I have faith!

144
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,574
No! I have faith!
Guided by the light of the moon

145
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:46,612
In love? Friendship?
Or, in the trust between people?
Guided by the light of the moon

146
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,147
We will meet again and again

147
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,148
I have faith.
We will meet again and again

148
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:53,252
I have faith in this world that
everyone tried to protect!
We will meet again and again

149
00:16:53,252 --> 00:17:00,126
Fool! There is nothing left to believe
in this rotten world!
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

150
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:06,725
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

151
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,008
Together once again, weekend,
God, grant us a happy end

152
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:19,579
Please! Please, Silver Crystal...
Together once again, weekend,
God, grant us a happy end

153
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,546
Together once again, weekend,
God, grant us a happy end

154
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:21,347
Past, present, and future,
I'm crazy for you

155
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,450
Make me believe even more
in the world
Past, present, and future,
I'm crazy for you

156
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,975
that everyone had faith in!
Past, present, and future,
I'm crazy for you

157
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:28,888
The fond memories of when we met

158
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:32,158
You shouldn't talk so
casually about love.
The fond memories of when we met

159
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:33,759
The fond memories of when we met

160
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,293
Hikawa Shrine
The fond memories of when we met

161
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:34,827
Hikawa Shrine
Don't get the wrong idea!
The fond memories of when we met

162
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,062
Hikawa Shrine
Don't get the wrong idea!
I'll never forget your gaze

163
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,397
Hikawa Shrine
I don't care for Yuichiro like that.
I'll never forget your gaze

164
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:38,664
I don't care for Yuichiro like that.
I'll never forget your gaze

165
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:39,866
I'll never forget your gaze

166
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,467
So what if he already
has a girlfriend?
I'll never forget your gaze

167
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:42,535
So what if he already
has a girlfriend?
From among the thousands
of stars, I can find you

168
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:44,270
We just have to go for it!
From among the thousands
of stars, I can find you

169
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,171
From among the thousands
of stars, I can find you

170
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,007
As long as they're happy,
that's all that matters.
From among the thousands
of stars, I can find you

171
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:48,407
That's all that matters.
From among the thousands
of stars, I can find you

172
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:49,342
That's all that matters.
You even turn coincidences into
chance, I love that way of life

173
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,844
You even turn coincidences into
chance, I love that way of life

174
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,379
Everyone...
You even turn coincidences into
chance, I love that way of life

175
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,047
Now that I have obtained
the energy of darkness,
You even turn coincidences into
chance, I love that way of life

176
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:55,848
Now that I have obtained
the energy of darkness,

177
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:59,011
I will not be sealed away
by the Silver Crystal!

178
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,022
Everyone, lend me your strength...

179
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:08,855
Please!

180
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:15,968
Coming across a strange miracle

181
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:20,769
We will meet again and again

182
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:22,575
Mercury Power!

183

190
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,657

00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,425

00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:42,656
I believe in it, miracle romance

193
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:59,571
Everyone, thank you.

194
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,297
When I wake up in the morning,

195
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,460
a pure white curtain of lace
is rustling in the breeze.

196
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:26,205
The cuckoo clock in the room
says it's 7 o'clock

197
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:30,437
and Mom's voice says,
"You'll be late if you don't get up!"

198
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,479
I'm still half asleep,

199
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:37,074
and I think, "Please let me sleep
for 3 more minutes."

200
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:41,587
I'm late for school every
single day like clockwork,

201
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:43,956
my teacher makes me
stand out in the hallway,

202
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:46,186
and I get failing grades on my tests.

203
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:50,624
The crepes we'd all eat
on the way home.

204
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:54,892
We'd gaze dreamily at a party dress
in a show window.

205
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:59,763
The little things bring such joy
and I'm happy.

206
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,107
I wish...

207
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:06,406
I wish I could go back to
that kind of normal life.

208
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,547
I want to go back.

209
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,694
I'm late!

210
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,360
I'm leaving!

211
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:36,941
It's a miracle.

212
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:40,513
Not only did the sunspots disappear,

213
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,515
but everyone was also transmigrated.

214
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:43,916
In the moonlight, I look up at
the sky and I think of you

215
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:44,784
But I feel a little sad for them.

the sky and I think of you

222
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,860
What?
In the moonlight, I look up at
the sky and I think of you

223
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,761
They just need to meet
each other again.
In the moonlight, I look up at

225
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:00,099
I close my eyes and
I whisper your name
