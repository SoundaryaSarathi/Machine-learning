00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:41,032
W- why do we have to wait for Kakarrot!?

2
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:45,704
Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans.

3
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:52,978
We have to punish traitors. We're going
to kill his son and his friends...

4
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:54,969
...right before his eyes.

5
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:59,985
After that, we're going to
deal with him, nice and slow.

6
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:04,285
We're going to make him aware of just how
powerless he is, as he writhes in agony.

7
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:14,666
And today, after another
three or four hours...

8
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,003
...we should be able to put on
a magnificent, hellish show for him.

9
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,339
I get it! So that's why!
That sounds great!

10
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:25,677
That's all assuming that he
gets here in the next three hours.

11
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:30,348
I'll leave Kakarrot to you,
but please let me take those other three!

12
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:33,018
Do as you like. However,

13
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:37,682
do it after we get the Namekian
to tell us about the Dragon Balls.

14
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:46,255
I sure hope that Kakarrot does come!

15
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,308
Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

16
00:01:56,308 --> 00:02:02,611
Dammit, what are you doing, Goku?
Has he really come back to life?

17
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:12,991
Say, at this point, what if we ran away?

18
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:16,995
There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn!

19
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:22,600
Fool! They plan on wiping out
all of humanity in any case.

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,338
Even if you run away now,
you'll end up the same.

21
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:31,209
D- dammit! Please, Goku, get here!

22
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,112
Show us how much stronger
than them you've become!

23
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,847
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

24
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,687
Not yet?

25
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,212
Guys! Hang in there a little longer!

26
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,300
Piccolo, Goku is sure to be here
in the next three hours, right?

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
Who knows?

28
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,106
Think of some way to
inflict some damage on them,

29
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,975
however little,
before Son Goku gets here.

30
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,312
Regardless of how much power
Goku may have gained at Kaio's place,

31
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:12,650
his chances of fighting both of them
and winning are next to impossible.

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,245
We've made some tremendous enemies here.

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,996
If only I... I had been more
reliable earlier, Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>...

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,333
...might not have had to die...

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,002
That's right!

36
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,062
Who knew you were such a coward!?

37
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:40,445
Piccolo, be reasonable.
Gohan is still only 5 years old.

38
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:43,348
Ordinarily, he'd be
in kindergarten right now.

39
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,618
It's miraculous
that he's even here, isn't it?

40
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,620
Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

41
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,624
Gohan, I thought I had
raised you up to be a man.

42
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,626
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

43
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,630
P- please re-train me
for the next three hours!

44
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,299
Don't act like a spoiled child!

45
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,969
I've got no time for cowards!
Get out of here, now!

46
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,199
P- Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

47
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,314
P- Piccolo!

48
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:21,183
<i>Gohan, l've taught you everything I know.</i>

49
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:29,116
Gohan, come back! You've got to show
Goku how big and strong you've grown!

50
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,587
Gohan!

51
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,337
Kid!

52
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:41,005
You trying to run away!?

53
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:45,343
Well, that would be
the smart thing to do.

54
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:48,039
W- who's running away!?

55
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,617
I just have to go pee!

56
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:57,452
And if you guys are going
to go home, now is your chance.

57
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,825
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

58
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:09,460
Your momma's belly-button sticks out!

59
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:14,973
That brat! H- how...

60
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:20,070
How did you know my mommy's
belly-button sticks out!?

61
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:34,926
The mysterious energy that had enveloped
the battleground has disappeared,

62
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:38,997
as though it were never there,
which has allowed us to get closer,

63
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:42,489
so we are going to try to get in
as close to the scene as we can.

64
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:48,940
What in the world could be happening?
I am unaware of the details,

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,610
but could it be that
they have called a time-out?

66
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,947
I- in any event, it's certain
that the intense fighting

67
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:59,617
that was going on earlier
is not occurring now.

68
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:02,287
Could they be taking a break?

69
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,289
What could this be?

70
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,291
I don't care what it is.

71
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:11,629
If they can buy even one minute-
one second of time to let Goku come back,

72
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,300
nothing could work
to our advantage better.

73
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,972
I guess so. I wonder if Son-<i>kun</i>
will get back during this time.

74
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,640
On the other hand,

75
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,778
if Piccolo gets killed,
Kami-<i>sama</i> dies too, right?

76
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:29,647
What happens to our world
if that happens!?

77
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:30,982
Isn't it obvious?

78
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:37,655
Either way, if Son-<i>kun</i> and the others
don't defeat those Saiyans...

79
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,215
...all of us are going to be killed.

80
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,598
Goku! Get here quick and defeat them!

81
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,099
If I have to die anyway,

82
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:52,270
I wish I could have collected
more gals' panties before I went.

83
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,606
Frankly, that's not possible.

84
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:56,941
Then there's no way they can win!?

85
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:59,477
I'm saying that there aren't
any gals that are stupid enough

86
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:01,775
to let their panties be stolen by you.

87
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:05,617
--Why, you jerk...
--Gohan!

88
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,953
Chichi, have you come around?
Are you okay?

89
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,622
Pa!

90
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,291
W- where's Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

91
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,626
Relax.

92
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,719
He's still all right.

93
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:20,965
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

94
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,634
He's doin' fine.

95
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,302
We have to hurry and save him!

96
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:28,640
We can't! That's nowhere
that we can get close to!

97
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,310
All we can do is wait here.

98
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,369
Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

99
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,267
I'm going to go have a little fun.

100
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,604
I can't just sit still here
for three hours, after all.

101
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:04,609
Suit yourself. But Nappa,
don't go overdoing it, now.

102
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
Why not?

103
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,281
For the sake of the hellish show
we're going to have in three hours.

104
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,950
That's Vegeta for you!

105
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,317
It'll be fine, don't worry about it!

106
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,628
One of the Saiyans has
taken to the skies by himself!

107
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,256
Where exactly is he planning to go?

108
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,973
I- it appears that he is
coming toward our direction!

109
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,703
He is rapidly approaching us!

110
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,780
G- get us out of here!

111
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,561
H- he's chasing after us!

112
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,795
H- here he comes!

113
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,901
Run!

114
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,478
You guys are a blight!
Away with you!

115
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,364
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

116
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,797
C- Chichi!

117
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:43,701
So this planet has this
sort of military, does it?

118
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,499
This should be a good time killer.

119
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:26,871
I thought these guys would be a little
more effective, but they're all worthless.

120
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,278
Beat it!

121
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,235
You guys were a waste of my time.

122
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,838
By the way, hasn't Goku
come by the way yet?

123
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:10,588
No matter how funny my jokes are,
this is no time for laughs.

124
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,991
The fate of the earth is at stake!

125
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,152
Hurry, Son Goku!

126
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,364
I see it!

127
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,160
Just a little farther!

128
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,011
Goku's presence!?

129
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:38,038
Yeah! He is getting close!
He just might be in time!

130
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,964
Another two hours, huh?

131
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:02,139
You know, this planet Earth here

132
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,977
is a more wondrous world
than any I've seen before.

133
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,445
We'll be able to sell
this one for a lot!

134
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,527
So this is the level
of people it has, huh?

135
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:40,344
One more hour.

136
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:44,974
Kakarrot hasn't just lost
his nerve and run away, right?

137
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,621
<i>Go for broke....</i>

138
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,987
<i>Looks like that's all we can do.</i>

139
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,297
He's arrived! Son Goku has arrived!

140
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, Kami-<i>sama</i>! Hurry!

141
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,461
The Serpentine Road has ended!

142
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,734
That was fast!
That was wonderfully fast!

143
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,640
<i>Now then, there are only</i>
<i>ten minutes left.</i>

144
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,917
<i>Shall I finish up with a little more fun?</i>

145
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:49,108
Scream! Suffer! Writhe in agony!

146
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,321
You'd only live until tonight anyhow.

147
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:02,315
We're going to turn all of you
on earth into space dust.

148
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:07,196
And the most hellish show still awaits.

149
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,941
There are two powerful <i>Ki</i>,
separated from each other.

150
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,642
What's going on?

151
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:25,639
<i>And so, with Goku still absent,</i>
<i>the three hours had passed.</i>

152
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,661
Time.

153
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,923
Damn!

154
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,699
Looks like waiting for him
didn't do any good.

155
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,275
He's still not here?

156
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,945
That coward Kakarrot did not come.

157
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:58,282
F- Father is not a coward!

158
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,285
Dammit! Why isn't he here!?

159
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,344
<i>Son Goku...</i>

160
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:09,293
Now then, to take my time
in making you hurt...

161
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,630
It's too bad I couldn't show
this to Kakarrot, though.

162
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,694
<i>lt's almost time when I could die, too...</i>
<i>Dammit, I feel like a suicide trooper!</i>

163
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:31,304
There's only one possibility
for us to beat him.

164
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:37,988
Of course, that's only
if everything goes well. Listen up.

165
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:42,550
First, Kuririn, you go
all-out to draw his attention.

166
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:48,599
And then I will find an opening
to grab his tail, a Saiyan's weak point.

167
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:51,268
R- right...

168
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:53,938
Once his power fails him,
and he can't move,

169
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:58,943
Gohan, you'll call up all of
your power and rush him. Got that?

170
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:02,613
Yes. It'll be okay.
I won't run away this time.

171
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:08,245
Of course you won't. Remember that
the fate of the earth rests in your hands!

172
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,720
<i>All right!</i>

173
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:21,031
<i>Awesome! That's Piccolo for you!</i>
<i>l'm starting to see a little light here.</i>

174
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,633
<i>We just might win!</i>

175
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,035
Gohan, believe in yourself!

176
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:29,165
When you set your mind to it,
your power is even greater than mine.

177
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,436
<i>All right!</i>

178
00:17:58,602 --> 00:17:59,603
Goku!

179
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:00,604
Kami-<i>sama</i>!

180
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,273
Hurry and grab hold!

181
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:03,941
You're on!

182
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:10,210
T- that kid! He really did come
back from Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place!

183
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,618
Okay, I'm off!

184
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,609
My training went great!

185
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,919
--We're counting on you!
--Good luck, Son Goku!

186
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,961
Guys!

187
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,629
Gohan!

188
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:27,654
Please be alive!

189
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:35,639
Here he comes!
Son Goku is quite tired.

190
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,309
Hey!

191
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,675
Karin-<i>sama</i>!

192
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:45,942
Here are the last two Senzu beans!

193
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,987
Thank you!

194
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:51,322
These will be a great help!

195
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,324
We're all counting on you!

196
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,121
I'll eat one of them right now...

197
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,002
All right, I'm at full health!

198
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:07,027
Kinto Un!!

199
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,675
It's been a long time, huh!?

200
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,370
I could sure use your help!

201
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:20,351
There are some incredible <i>Ki</i>
gathered all together! That way!

202
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,685
<i>Hurry, Goku!</i>

203
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,687
<i>We're counting on you, Goku!</i>

204
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,882
<i>As fast as you can!</i>
