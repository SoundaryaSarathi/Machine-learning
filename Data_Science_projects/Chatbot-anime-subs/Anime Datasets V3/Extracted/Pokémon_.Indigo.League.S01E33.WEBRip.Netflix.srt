00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,836
If Tommy is still alive,
he would be just about this age.

174
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,715
Ah, you mean Tomo.
You won't have to look far.

175
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,801
His address is listed right here
in the Safari Zone directory.

176
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,927
[gasps]

177
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,512
Really? Thank goodness.

178
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,223
We saw him out in the jungle
just before you came.

179
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,185
My friends and I'd be glad to help you
find him if you want us to.

180
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,144
Pika, pi.

181
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,522
-Oh, please let us help you.
-It would be our pleasure.

182
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,524
Thank you all so much.

183
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:31,237
Now we can finally be united with our son
and live together as a family.

184
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,118
Ah, it's lovely
riding through the jungle like this.

185
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,081
[all groaning and panting]

186
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,750
How'd we end up with a job like this?

187
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,586
It's because you had to go
and volunteer us all.

188
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,547
You're the one who said:
"Oh, please let us help you."

189
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,509
[groans] Why did we have to go
and open our big mouths?

190
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,135
I apologize for this.

191
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,097
Papa doesn't get outdoors much,
and he's not in the best of shape.

192
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,473
I admit it.

193
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,934
Pika. Pika?

194
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,019
[whimpering]

195
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,771
Wait, what's that?

196
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,730
[all] Huh?

197
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,982
Ow! My lumbago. Ow!

198
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,443
[whimpers]

199
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,364
-A baby Kangaskhan.
-It looks like it's injured.

200
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,908
-Leave it to me.
-Can you treat it, Brock?

201
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,121
Don't forget, Ash, I've been studying
to be the world's best Pokémon breeder.

202
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,581
You'll be just fine.

203
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:28,253
This'll sting a little, but it'll make
your wound heal faster. I promise.

204
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,506
[screeches]

205
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,384
-Look out behind you!
-Huh?

206
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,927
[groans]

207
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,138
-Pika, pi!
-Tomo!

208
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,473
You hurt Kangaskhan. That bad.

209
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,933
No, we didn't.

210
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,395
Brock was just trying to help
the baby Kangaskhan because it's hurt.

211
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,564
That is,
until you threw your boomerang at him.

212
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,774
Now apologize!

213
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,360
Uh, what's the matter?

214
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,571
You people or Pokémon?

215
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,738
Ah!

216
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,699
I'm a person, you creep!

217
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,661
Hurry, my dear. It sounds
like they may have found our Tommy.

218
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,289
Huh? Who you, old man?

219
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,168
I am Papa, this is your mama,
and you are our son, Tommy.

220
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,129
Tommy, come home
with your mommy and daddy.

221
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,342
They Pokémon or peoples?

222
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,094
They're peoples... Uh, people!

223
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,848
Tommy these two people are your parents.
Your mother and father.

224
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,309
They've been looking for you
for a very long time.

225
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,727
Mother? Father?

226
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,354
It's no good, Ash. He doesn't know them.

227
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,815
He was only three
when they were separated.

228
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,777
Take a good look. Try to remember.

229
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:40,325
This is your mother and your father,
and your real name is Tommy.

230
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,245
Think back, Tommy.
Try to remember, Tommy.

231
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:51,336
[all singing and humming]

232
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,507
[all singing and humming]

233
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:02,931
[all singing and humming]

234
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:09,354
[all singing and humming]

235
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:15,109
[all singing and humming]

236
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,235
[all gasp]

237
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,488
-Tommy.
-Do you know me, son?

238
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,615
Do you remember them now, Tommy?

239
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,325
[groans]

240
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,536
Tomo mama Kangaskhan!
Mama Kangaskhan!

241
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,122
[groans]

242
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,959
-What are you doing, Papa?
-He'll be fine.

243
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,920
We'll just take him home
and start from scratch.

244
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
Look what you've done to him.

245
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,549
Tommy, can you hear me? Tommy.

246
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,344
Tommy. Tommy!

247
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,515
Tommy, my little boy.

248
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,101
Mama. Mama!

249
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:53,064
[laughing]

250
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,068
[mother] Tommy. Tommy! Tommy.

251
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:01,489
-Are you all right, Tommy?
-Mama.

252
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,742
Tommy. Oh, my little boy remembers me.

253
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,204
That clonk on the head must have helped
bring your son's memory back.

254
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,124
Tommy, my boy, remember Papa?

255
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,418
Doh! [groans]

256
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,129
One memory at a time, okay, Papa?

257
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,590
Forgive us, Tommy.
You must have been so lonely.

258
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:23,553
We'll never be separated again.
Now let's go home.

259
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,139
Your mother and your father
have been looking all over for you

260
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,724
for years, Tommy.

261
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,019
I know it's going to be hard
to leave the Kangaskhan, Tommy,

262
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,022
but wouldn't it be a whole lot better
to live with your real parents?

263
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,108
Sometimes, the real parent's
the one who raises you,

264
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,986
but this is a real unusual situation.

265
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,620
Tomo mama Kangaskhan,
but this lady Tomo mama too.

266
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,706
You can't live with both of them, Tommy.

267
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,417
Kangaskhan mama too!
This lady mama too!

268
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,127
Tommy head feel bad.

269
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
Tommy. Huh?

270
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,341
I need your help.
Someone's poaching Kangaskhan again.

271
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,427
[all gasp]

272
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,554
[grunts] Kanga, Kangaskhan!

273
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
Tommy!

274
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,098
Come on, let's go.

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,519
[Tommy] Kanga!

276
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:18,900
Tommy must feel that those Kangaskhan
are his real parents after all.

277
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
He's completely turned into Tomo.

278
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,322
I guess we'll have to give up.

279
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,201
Don't say that, Mama.
Deep down, Tommy is still our boy.

280
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,911
Papa.

281
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,371
Yes?

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,129
All right,
let's get this show on the road.

283
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,090
Now I will present my impression

284
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,801
of an injured Kangaskhan
for your enjoyment.

285
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,137
[in a low voice]
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!

286
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,264
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!

287
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,141
[all grunting]

288
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,519
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!

289
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,104
Kangaskhan, kangas.

290
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,776
[growling]

291
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,738
They're headed this way.
They can't tell it's a fake.

292
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,534
[laughs] Our plan's a success.
We're finally getting our Pokémon.

293
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,287
James, put the Kangaskhan to sleep,
and we'll round them all up!

294
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,707
Firing tranquilizer.

295
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:22,130
[all grunting and yelling]

296
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,383
[growling]

297
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,844
[grunts]

298
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,266
Kangaskhan.

299
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,353
Now's our chance.
Let's get our new Kangaskhan.

300
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,688
Kanga!

301
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,314
[gasps]

302
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,444
You bad Kangaskhan.

303
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,447
Tomo angry! [grunts]

304
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,906
Kangaskhan?

305
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,909
-It's jungle boy.
-He ruined our plan last time.

306
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,828
This time, let's show him who's boss.

307
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,166
Rocket punch.

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,002
[screams]

309
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,588
That Team Rocket. We got to stop them.

310
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,262
Bulbasaur, I choose you.

311
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,891
Bulbasaur!

312
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,351
Bulbasaur, quick.
Use your vine whip now!

313
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,853
Bulbasaur!

314
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,901
Squirtle, I choose you.

315
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,110
Squirtle, Squirtle.

316
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,822
Squirtle, go!
Give them your skull bash attack.

317
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,450
Squirtle! Squirt!

318
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,410
Kanga!

319
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,663
Kanga, kanga, Kangaskhan!

320
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:42,126
-All that banging is giving me a headache.
-This ought to fix that.

321
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,212
Kanga, kanga, kanga!

322
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,757
[grunting]

323
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,175
Huh?

324
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,177
[Meowth] You've been a bad boy.

325
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,262
Tommy! Pikachu.

326
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,472
Pika.

327
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,016
Charmander, I choose you.

328
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,434
Char!

329
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,647
Pikachu, Charmander,
thunder shock and flamethrower.

330
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,901
-Pikachu!
-Char!

331
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,363
[grunts] Kanga!

332
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,661
[all yelling]

333
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,288
-Great!
-Tomo do it!

334
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,127
-Oh, no!
-Get in quick!

335
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,634
[laughs]
They think they have us beat, do they?

336
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,844
Let's give them a taste
of our super punch.

337
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,514
One super punch coming right up.

338
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,599
[all] Huh?

339
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,561
Don't worry!
We're coming to save you, Tommy!

340
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,732
[all screaming]

341
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,741
[all] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again.

342
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,796
Tommy's parents saved us all.

343
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,758
They sacrificed themselves
so they could save their son's life.

344
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,052
They really loved him.

345
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,930
[whimpers and sobs]

346
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,016
[wails]

347
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,441
Pikachu.

348
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:34,155
[wails]

349
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,908
[muffled singing]

350
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>You are my little Tommy</i>

351
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,583
[all] Huh?

352
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,712
Tommy, your father and I decided
that if you love the Kangaskhan so much,

353
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,131
we'll stay here
and protect the Pokémon with you.

354
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,426
Let Mama and Papa
join your family, Tommy.

355
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,137
[all] Huh?

356
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,890
Papa. Mama.

357
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,476
[yells]

358
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,145
We'll be together from now on, Tommy.

359
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,063
Good.

360
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,576
[Ash] Do you think Tommy and his parents
really can be a family?

361
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,454
[Brock] Ash, they love each other.
They'll be just fine.

362
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,917
It might be tough, though.
After all, they were apart for five years.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,920
And it's going to be hard for them
even to communicate.

364
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
Pikachu.

365
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,383
Pika? Pika, pika!

366
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,509
[all] Huh?

367
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,302
[laughter]

368
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,518
[all] Kangas, kangas, Kangaskhan!

369
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,478
[both] Kangas, kangas, Kangaskhan!

370
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,607
-I think you're right, Brock.
-Like I said, they'll be just fine.

371
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,526
Kanga, Kangaskhan!

372
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,112

<i>Seeing the happy family reunited,</i>

373
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,116
