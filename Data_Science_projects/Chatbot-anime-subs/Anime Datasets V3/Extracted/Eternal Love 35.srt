4
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,479
Qian Qian, I haven't seen you in days.
I missed you terribly.

5
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,360
Have you missed me?

6
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,840
I came to tell you some important news.

7
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,159
Do you know who reincarnated into
Yuan Zhen's father in this lifetime?

8
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,639
Could it be your grandfather?

9
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,360
It isn't my grandfather,
but that is close.

10
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Then...

11
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
Lord Shaoyang of Dong Hua Zi Manor.

12
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,520
Dong Hua Dijun?

13
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,400
Could Xiao Jiu have--

14
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,039
I'm going to close the window.

15
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
Are you sleeping on
the inside or the outside of the bed?

16
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,840
I'll... sleep on the floor.

17
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,919
Qian Qian, if you sleep on the floor
or the bed tonight

18
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,800
the end result will be the same.

19
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,960
If you had any magic power

20
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,319
you could fight me
then we'd both end up wounded.

21
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,520
But haven't I already
sealed away your powers?

22
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,879
Or perhaps, are you only
putting on a show of reluctance?

23
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,280
Lord Ye Hua, you must be joking.

24
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm just afraid the bed is too small.
I don't want to be a bad host.

25
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm used to sleeping on the outside.

26
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Are there really roc birds
in the mortal realm?

27
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,839
The roc bird was borrowed from Buddha.

28
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,639
My second uncle and Si Ming
had grudges.

29
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,160
Si Ming has put a lot of energy
and effort into this.

30
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,720
I didn't expect Star Lord Si Ming
would be so vengeful.

31
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,439
He planned such an elaborate scenario.

32
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,160
If I ruin his plans,
won't he bear a grudge against me?

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Qian Qian, don't you worry.

34
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
He still owes me a big favor.

35
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
Do you want me to
hold you while you sleep?

36
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,800
As I expected.

37
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,480
I know you move around in your sleep,
so that's why I said I'd hold you.

38
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,879
The bed is too small.

39
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,600
Yes, it is indeed.

40
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,279
Qian Qian.

41
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,319
Do you know the immortal Si Yin?

42
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,920
I've... heard of him but never met him.

43
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,079
Didn't he retire and go into seclusion
with High God Mo Yuan?

44
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,079
I thought you would know more.

45
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,600
I don't know any more.

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,959
Ghost Lord Li Jing
made a painting of Si Yin

47
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,639
and has been searching for
Si Yin's whereabouts in private.

48
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,839
The painting landed in my possession.

49
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,920
I took a quick look.

50
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,439
And noticed it looked like
you dressed as a man.

51
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,680
It must be a coincidence.

52
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,519
It's getting late. Go to sleep.

53
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,000
Third Prince, are you also
going to the Feast of Peaches?

54
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,839
Excuse me, excuse me.

55
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,240
I don't know why
I've been doing that all day.

56
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,720
It seems someone is talking about you
behind your back again, Si Ming.

57
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,279
How can that be?

58
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,759
Such an easygoing, idle deity like me
wouldn't be the subject of any gossip.

59
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,800
Where is the Crown Prince?
I had seen he was here just now.

60
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,879
He's thinking about
a certain high goddess.

61
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,639
He snuck off to the mortal realm
while everyone is making a toast.

62
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,720
He'll be back in
a half a cup of tea's time.

63
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,159
Qian Qian, come bind my hair for me.

64
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Are you talking to me?

65
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Mi Gu said that you are
quite good at combing hair.

66
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,399
I have an audience with
the Heavenly Lord today.

67
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,864
It wouldn't be good to look disheveled.

68
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,679
All done.

69
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,240
In the past, you...

70
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,840
It's nothing.

71
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,120
Qian Qian.

72
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,039
Carry this string of beads.

73
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,559
You are no different from a mortal now.

74
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,919
It is unlikely that
you will encounter any danger

75
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,679
but it is still good to take precautions.

76
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
I'll return to the Celestial Palace now.

77
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,559
Oh, last night, I was so busy
that I forgot to tell you

78
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,159
on the first of the sixth month,
hold Yuan Zhen back

79
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,600
and then send someone to
push Dong Hua Dijun into the water.

80
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,200
This way, you can protect Yuan Zhen

81
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,039
and you won't be
hindering Dong Hua Dijun

82
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,639
from experiencing the
hardships of life.

83
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,320
This way, everyone will be satisfied.

84
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,200
All right.

85
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,639
What serious matters
was he busy with last night?

86
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,879
I nearly forgot about Xiao Jiu.

87
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,639
Master.

88
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,679
I was just about to go looking for you.

89
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,159
- Follow me.
- Yes.

90
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:34,000
Master, what is on your neck over there?
It seems to be...

91
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
You noticed such a tiny red scar?

92
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,879
Someone once told me

93
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,879
you are so kind that you wouldn't
even step on an ant on the road.

94
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,600
It seems that is true.

95
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,720
Do you know that to not step
on an ant on the road

96
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,919
not only requires kindness,
but also attentiveness?

97
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,759
Kindness and attentiveness are the same.

98
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,159
Yes.

99
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,399
In this case, I shall test
your attention to detail.

100
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,039
Please proceed, Master.

101
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I know you were living in the Daoist
temple before you were 16 years old.

102
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,679
You only entered the imperial palace
after turning 16 years old.

103
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,840
So, I won't pose any difficulties.
I will only ask you two questions.

104
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,320
One is regarding the Daoist temple,
and the other is regarding the palace.

105
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,200
In the Daoist temple you were living in

106
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
there was a nun
who wore white robes.

107
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,440
There was a fly whisk she often used.
What was the fly whisk made out of?

108
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
Fly whisk?

109
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,159
You don't need to answer yet.
I'll ask you another question.

110
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,480
In the imperial palace
you are living in now

111
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,559
there is a woman who has a birthmark
of a plumed cockscomb on her forehead.

112
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,559
Where does this woman reside, what is
her position, and what is her name?

113
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,000
Master, I am not well-informed.

114
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
While I lived in the temple, I had never
seen the white-robed nun you mentioned.

115
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,879
As for this woman who has
a plumed cockscomb on her forehead

116
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,480
I do know of her.

117
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
She is the Honored Lady Chen
who lives in Handan Quarters.

118
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,320
As for Honored Lady Chen's name...

119
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,960
I truly do not know.

120
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
<i>Xiao Jiu followed Dong Hua here.</i>

121
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,000
It's already rare for you
to have this level of attentiveness.

122
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,600
However, you must be even more meticulous
as you study Daoism.

123
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
You may go for today.

124
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,320
Go and take note of the manner
in which you study.

125
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,519
Yes.

126
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:56,200
<i>Yuan Zhen, you are actually
meticulous enough.</i>

127
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
<i>Any more investigation
and you'd be a nosy man.</i>

128
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,200
Miss.

129
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,279
What orders do you have,
Daoist Master?

130
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,399
Take me to Honored Lady Chen's
Handan Quarters.

131
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,600
Yes, please follow me.

132
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,960
Daoist Master, this is Handan Quarters.

133
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,320
Xiao Jiu, Aunt is here to see you.

134
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,320
Aunt, Aunt!

135
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,240
Aunt, I'm begging you,
don't take me away!

136
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,759
I love him, Aunt! I can't lose him.
I'm begging you, Aunt!

137
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,399
I'm begging you!

138
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll do anything to repay you
in the next life!

139
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,039
Please let me be with him!
Aunt, I'm begging you.

140
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,480
<i>With this crazy behavior</i>

141
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,240
<i>could she have used
the Two Lives Curse on herself?</i>

142
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
Please, I'm begging you.
I'll repay you any way I can.

143
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Someone come!

144
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,080
Help Honored Lady Chen inside.

145
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,080
<i>Why did Xiao Jiu use
the Two Lives Curse for no reason?</i>

147
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,240
Aunt, please don't take me away.

148
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
I want to be with His Majesty
for all lifetimes.

149
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,879
Aunt! Aunt!

150
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,080
Wait, why did Aunt come here?

151
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,624
If Aunt knows I used the Two Lives Curse,
wouldn't she drag me back to Qing Qiu?

152
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
Then how will I repay my debt?

153
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,519
My queen, aren't they respected members
of the Celestial Tribe?

154
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,879
Why would they be in our palace?

155
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,942
Because I am going to use
their bodies to save my child.

156
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,513
Your Highness, it was already
a capital offense to use puppets

157
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,360
to kill high immortals
of the Celestial Tribe.

158
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,840
If His Majesty were to
know of today's events

159
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,679
wouldn't you be adding to your crimes?

160
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,200
Your Highness, quickly return them!

161
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,720
Shut your mouth. Who are you to
tell me what to do, you lowly servant?

162
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
- Your Highness, do not be angry!
- Guards.

163
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Take this lowly servant
to the water dungeon.

164
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

165
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,279
And summon the generals in.

166
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,039
- Yes.
- Your Highness, I won't do it again!

167
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,640
Your Highness, I won't do it again!
Your Highness!

168
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,160
I really like this body.

169
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,799
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness...

170
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,519
Come have a look.

171
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,599
- High God Mo Yuan?
- High God Mo Yuan?

172
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,880
Your Highness, hasn't he been missing
for over 70,000 years?

173
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,279
I will explain this to you in a few days.

174
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,880
I summoned you here to tell you
to prepare the elixir chamber.

175
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,119
I am going to use the furnace.

176
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,200
And use Mo Yuan's body to make
an elixir for my son's recovery.

177
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,960
- That's...
- Elixir?

178
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,240
That's correct.

179
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,359
In a few days, my son will possess

180
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,039
the vitality of
the Celestial Tribe's God of War.

181
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,079
Don't you all find it amusing?

182
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,680
Aunt, unfilial daughter Feng Jiu
has come to beg for forgiveness.

183
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,160
You've really used the Two Lives Curse?

184
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,660
You are wise, Aunt.

185
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,640
Sit down and talk.

186
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,880
Since you've come to repay a debt

187
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,559
why did you use
the Two Lives Curse on yourself?

188
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,759
A while ago, I entered Dijun's dream

189
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,079
to ask him if he has
any unfulfilled wishes

190
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,079
or any unattainable infatuation.

191
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,920
What did the stone-faced Dijun say?

192
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,049
Don't tell me he said
he doesn't want any riches

193
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,440
or to conquer the world,
but only to win someone's heart?

194
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
You are wise, Aunt.

195
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,545
Dong Hua Dijun is
so unambitious in this lifetime.

196
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,119
It must be because he experienced

197
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,220
the fickleness of human relationships
in his early years in the mortal realm

198
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,000
and thus, wishes for a woman
who would never leave him.

199
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,559
So, you inserted yourself?

200
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,920
I didn't throw myself in.

201
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,720
It was just that Star Lord Si Ming said
Dijun didn't encounter a woman he loves.

202
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,319
But on the first of the sixth month,
he will encounter a woman he adores

203
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,440
yet the one the woman loves
is Crown Prince Yuan Zhen.

204
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
Yuan Zhen?

205
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,079
So, I wanted to offer him
my heartfelt affections.

206
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,440
When Dijun encounters the one he loves

207
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
I would leave with my work
having been done here.

208
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,039
I had thought this was a great plan

209
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,400
but after borrowing
Honored Lady Chen's body

210
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
I couldn't say any affectionate words
when I saw Dijun.

211
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,559
Dying embers are not easily rekindled.
Don't brood over it.

212
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,200
That's why I could only use
the Two Lives Curse on myself.

213
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,640
During the day, I am able to
adore Dijun very much.

214
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,680
When the sun sets,
I can be free of such a task.

215
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,640
Were you taken advantage of by Dijun?

216
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,480
Dong Hua Dijun only visited
Handan Quarters once

217
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,279
but he left after some time.

218
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,039
Look at you.

219
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,160
Everyday, you make yourself
love him so desperately.

220
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,519
Why are you doing this?

221
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,720
I just think loving someone is an act
that requires dedication.

222
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,839
It is pretending not to be in love
when others are looking

223
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,960
but being in love
when others aren't looking.

224
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,799
Never mind. You should just go.

225
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,559
You can continue offering
your heart to him.

226
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,359
When you were in Qing Qiu, you lived
such a free and unrestrained life.

227
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,279
Look, now you're feeding fish in this
place, all for Dong Hua Dijun.

228
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,000
What can you say?

229
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,680
It seems Zizhu Quarters
is a place for immortals.

230
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
You came back?

231
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,359
There's something I forgot to tell you.

232
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,359
The day after you left for
the Eastern Sea banquet

233
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,279
Heavenly Lord's grandson, Ye Hua,
came to see me in the Peach Tree Woods

234
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,079
and asked me things about you
from 300 years ago.

235
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,240
I told him that after
your battle with Qing Cang

236
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,599
you slept for a long time
before waking up.

237
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,839
He left and didn't ask anything else.

238
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,920
Bai Qian, your engagement with Ye Hua
won't fall through again, will it?

239
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,519
Probably not.

240
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,039
That's good.

241
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,960
Zhen Zhen really misses your cooking.

242
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,119
When will you have time to come
to the Peach Tree Woods?

243
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,000
But I'm still repaying a debt
in the mortal realm.

244
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Repaying a debt?

245
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,960
The Two Lives Curse
is working well on you.

246
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,680
Aunt, he's threatening me.

247
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,000
He's threatening you

248
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,920
only because he wants you back
to cook for Fourth Brother.

249
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,519
That's true.

250
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,559
By the way, Aunt,
why did you come today?

251
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,400
- For Yuan Zhen.
- Yuan Zhen?

252
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,319
Yuan Zhen is the Crown Prince's cousin.

253
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,039
He was sent to the mortal realm
because he did some things.

254
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,319
I won't speak at length here.

255
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,240
Didn't you just say?

256
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,160
On the first of the sixth month,
a beauty will fall into the water.

257
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,839
Yuan Zhen will save the beauty.

258
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,319
And the beauty will
fall in love with him.

259
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,599
Dong Hua Dijun will also
fall in love with the beauty.

260
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,799
Yes.

261
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:18,000
So, I am going to is pull Yuan Zhen out
of Dong Hua Dijun's trial of love.

262
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,359
Have you thought of a plan yet, Aunt?

263
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,279
I have.

264
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,160
On the day the beauty falls into
the water, I will hold Yuan Zhen back

265
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,279
and then find someone to
push Dong Hua Dijun into the water.

266
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,319
Dijun will naturally go
and save the woman.

267
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,119
When the two fall for each other,
Yuan Zhen will no longer be involved.

268
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,400
Xiao Jiu, are you willing to be the one
who pushes Dong Hua Dijun into the water?

269
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,240
I am restricted by the Two Lives Curse.
I am not myself during the day.

270
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,839
We will be lucky,
if I don't ruin your plan.

271
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm afraid I won't be able to do it.

272
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:53,079
Never mind. That is true.

273
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,599
If I can't find anyone,
then I'll have to do it myself.

274
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,000
So you're here.

275
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,680
I went to the mortal realm
to look for you.

276
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,240
Let's go. I've been waiting a long time.
Come to the West Sea with me.

277
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,559
- Let's go.
- The West Sea?

278
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,039
Yes. I was just at the West Sea.

279
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,559
I had happened upon the second prince
of the West Sea in the mortal realm.

280
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,359
Mo Yuan's disciple,
Bai Qian's Senior Disciple?

281
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,759
That's him.

282
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,680
I came across him in a restaurant in the
mortal realm and we had a meal together.

283
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,519
Someone just happened to come
to report from the Crystal Palace.

284
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,160
I watched as worry spread across
his face as he listened

285
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,519
and he wouldn't stop drinking.

286
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,519
So, I asked him about it.

287
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,920
It turns out the matter
he is worried about

288
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,599
is something you can help with.

289
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,960
Me?

290
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,079
Yes, you, High God Zhe Yan.

291
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,279
Come on.

292
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,839
Thank you for coming to examine my son.

293
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,079
I do not know whether
I can treat him yet.

294
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,200
Why not let me take a look first?

295
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
Yes. This way, please.

296
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,521
<i>It's said that on
a certain day 600 years ago</i>

297
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:44,119
the West Sea's eldest prince's
weakened body

298
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,559
steadily began to deteriorate.

299
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,059
The healers of the West Sea
examined him

300
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,160
but could not find the cause
and were at their wit's end.

301
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,240
They watched as the eldest prince
coughed up blood.

302
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,892
They had no choice but to
send a request

303
00:25:56,892 --> 00:25:59,839
to the Medicine King in heaven
to solve this conundrum.

304
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,440
However, Medicine King
could not figure out why he was ill.

305
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
In the end, he could only
prescribe two medicines

306
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,779
so that Die Yong would stop
coughing up blood.

307
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:11,440
<i>Before Medicine King departed</i>

308
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,559
he said the eldest prince's illness
did not seem to be a bodily sickness.

309
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,119
In that case, he could not
do anything as Medicine King.

310
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,279
Seeing as there was nothing left to try

311
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,839
they sought medical treatment
from all around the world.

312
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,960
But in the end, nobody has
managed to cure him.

313
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,880
<i>How could this be?</i>

314
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,079
High God, you have
such a grave expression.

315
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,240
Is my son...

316
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
Do not worry, Water King.

317
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,480
Eldest Prince's life is not in jeopardy.

318
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,079
Then do you have a way to heal my son?

319
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,880
Let me think about this some more.

320
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,839
Why do you have such an odd expression?

321
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,279
The eldest prince's illness
is quite strange.

322
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,440
Give me a few days.
I'll tell you after I find the truth.

323
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,640
It is rare to see you so cautious.

324
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,079
<i>Yuan Zhen.</i>

325
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,119
<i>I miss you very much.</i>

326
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,119
- Aunt.
- Follow me.

327
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,160
Sit down.

328
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,680
I will stand.

329
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,319
I have found a way to
help Yuan Zhen through his trial.

330
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,240
- Allow me offer my heartfelt thanks.
- No need. Sit down.

331
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,335
Everything is in order to
divert Yuan Zhen's trial

332
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,400
except for the one in the crucial role of
pushing someone down.

333
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,240
Pushing someone?

334
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,319
Simply put, on the first of
the sixth month, when the beauty appears

335
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,759
someone needs to push
the emperor into the water.

336
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,319
All right, I'll do it.

337
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,000
When the time comes,
you will use an invisibility spell.

338
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,599
When the beauty appears

339
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,119
walk quietly to the emperor's side
and push him into the water.

340
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,960
However, this will cause
your powers to turn against you.

341
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,720
It is rather dangerous for you to do it.
It should be done by someone strong.

342
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,440
Since this deed must be done,
then I'll have my lord do it.

343
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,920
That would be good.
After all, he is Yuan Zhen's father.

344
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,880
It would be most appropriate
for him to do this misdeed.

345
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,960
I will find my lord now
and tell him to see you.

346
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,240
All right. You must be quick.

347
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,337
There isn't much time until the first of
the sixth month in the mortal realm.

348
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,640
Do not worry, Aunt.

349
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,119
<i>Now the preparations are complete.</i>

350
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,920
High God, you took me in
70,000 years ago.

351
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,240
Now 70,000 years later,
you are going to save my son.

352
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,960
You are certainly our savior.

353
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,400
Your Highness, the altar will be ready
before the sun sets.

354
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,920
Good.

355
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,240
Then I shall wait another few hours.

356
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,039
What?

357
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,160
Bai Qian wants me to push
Dong Hua Dijun into the water?

358
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,519
Yes.

359
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,400
You agreed?

360
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,559
Aunt said this is
the only way to save Yuan Zhen.

361
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,640
Why?

362
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Time is tight. I didn't have
time to ask many questions.

363
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,000
But since this is what Aunt says, then
this must be the only way that will work!

364
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,960
Could it be...

365
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,680
She wants to use this chance
to take revenge on us?

366
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,680
Revenge?

367
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,839
You might not know this.

368
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,880
Those who use their powers
to change fate in the mortal realm

369
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,599
will be punished.

370
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,240
Bai Qian could have chosen anyone.
She had to choose me?

371
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,519
Isn't she using this to take revenge
on me for canceling my engagement to her?

372
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,730
My lord, you cannot say that of my Aunt.

373
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,759
She agreed to go to
the mortal realm to help me

374
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,119
out of regard to our relationship
as mistress and servant

375
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,079
disregarding any former enmity.

376
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,799
Moreover, she has always been
the Aunt I respect the most.

377
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,319
She would never use this chance
to turn on us!

378
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,039
All right, all right.
Do not be mad.

379
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
I am being narrow-minded.

380
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,200
Do not get excited.

381
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I will go to the mortal realm now.

382
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,799
- High Goddess.
- Sit.

383
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,440
I must apologize for what happened.

384
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,039
No matter what, it was wrong of me
to break off our engagement so suddenly.

385
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,759
No need to mention the past. Sit.

386
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,960
Has anyone ever told you

387
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,519
you look very much like
High God Mo Yuan's 17th disciple, Si Yin?

388
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,279
I had met him once. You two--

389
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:44,039
Water King, since you have come
for Yuan Zhen

390
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,960
then there's no need to
speak of anything else.

391
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,440
- Let's talk about tomorrow.
- Yes.

392
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,000
To be honest

393
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,200
the one you are to push into the water
is Dong Hua Dijun.

394
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,880
I was going to have your wife do this,
but she is with child.

395
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,039
It would not be very good.

396
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,240
Thank you for taking
such thorough consideration.

397
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,920
No need to be polite.

398
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,599
I'll begin talking about
what you are to do tomorrow.

399
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,680
All right.

400
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,440
When the time comes tomorrow,
you will use an invisibility spell...

401
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,639
Crown Prince, you really cannot stop
worrying about the high goddess.

402
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,519
That is Dong Hua Dijun after all.

403
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,440
Do not worry, Your Highness.
Dijun is not one who is petty.

404
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,239
<i>When the time comes,
the roc bird will appear.</i>

405
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,440
<i>I must hurry and summon Yuan Zhen.</i>

406
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,280
Go call the crown prince to me.

407
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,480
Yes.

408
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,639
Crown Prince, the Daoist Master
requests to see you.

409
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,840
Master?

410
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,280
Master, have you called me here
at this time for an urgent matter?

411
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,079
It is good you have come.

412
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,599
For some reason, a ray of light
just flashed through my mind

413
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,280
and I suddenly understand

414
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
all the principles I normally
couldn't comprehend.

415
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,639
Would you like to know why?

416
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,440
Of course I would like to know.

417
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,760
Great.

418
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,079
Go wait for me at your hall.
I will follow soon after.

419
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,079
Could it be that song and dance
are more important than my teachings?

420
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,320
No, no. I am wrong.
I will leave right away.

421
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,320
Look there. That looks like a roc bird.

422
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,840
I can't believe such a big roc bird
exists in this world.

423
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,119
It looks so ferocious
and is flying so quickly.

424
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,480
Such a big roc has been mentioned
in the scriptures.

425
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,079
Could it be appearing now as an omen?

426
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,000
Your Majesty, this is clearly
an auspicious omen.

427
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,760
An omen of fortune?

428
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,079
You say this is an auspicious omen
just on the basis of one bird?

429
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,679
Your Majesty, it's dangerous!

430
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,519
Shut your mouth.

431
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,159
Your Majesty, watch out!

432
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,519
Your Majesty!

433
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,159
Help!

434
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,599
Your Majesty, don't go near the water!

435
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,840
Your Majesty!

436
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,559
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

437
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,440
- Your Majesty!
- Help!

438
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,199
Guards! Go save her!

439
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,559
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

440
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,800
Your Majesty! Guards!

441
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,440
Your Majesty! His Majesty cannot swim!

442
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,360
Guards, come quick!

443
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,320
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

444
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,599
- Guards! Quick!
- Come quick!

445
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,440
Quickly, quickly!

446
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,639
Someone save His Majesty!

447
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,880
- Your Majesty is in the water!
- Your Majesty!

448
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,480
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

449
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,639
<i>Even with all my preparation</i>

450
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,119
<i>I did not foresee that Dong Hua had
reincarnated into someone who can't swim.</i>

451
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,119
<i>Who will save the beauty now?</i>

452
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,280
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- Quickly! Quickly!

453
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
Your Highness must not use your powers.

454
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,159
- Someone come!
- Quickly!

455
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,719
How are you? Are you all right?

456
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,039
Why would someone push me into the water?

457
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,039
Perhaps it is because
the Crown Prince trusts you so much

458
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,239
attracting the envy of others

459
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,559
and someone made use of the chaos
to teach you a lesson.

460
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,920
Ye Hua, you used your powers.
It is against heaven's law.

461
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,280
As long as you are safe,
it doesn't matter what happens to me.

462
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,199
Since you saved me, what will happen
to Dong Hua and Feng Jiu?

463
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,480
High Goddess, they are all right.

464
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,199
This was the original trial
for them to endure.

465
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,760
In a few months, the Little Princess
will get what she wants.

466
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,000
That is good.

467
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,679
In that case, you two should
return to the Celestial Palace.

468
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,960
It isn't good for a Crown Prince
to stay in the mortal realm for too long.

469
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,760
My task isn't finished yet. I have to go.

470
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,840
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty, wake up!

471
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,199
- Your Majesty, wake up!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

472
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,920
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

473
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.
Wake up, Your Majesty!

474
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,280
I cannot live on without you,
Your Majesty!

475
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,840
Your Majesty!

476
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,880
Were you the one who saved me?

477
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,719
Don't speak. The physician
will be here soon.

478
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,000
Hold on a while longer.
Hold on a while longer.

479
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,880
You will be all right, Your Majesty.

480
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,320
Quickly! Save His Majesty!

481
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,440
- Quickly!
- Your Majesty!

482
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,239
What?

483
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,320
You pushed High Goddess Bai Qian
into the river yourself?

484
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,519
Is she in any danger now?

485
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:44,079
I did not expect the Crown Prince
to be nearby.

486
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,000
He used his powers to save her.

487
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,079
<i>This princess is so easy to deceive.</i>

488
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,920
<i>I had told her to go to the mortal realm
to teach Bai Qian a lesson.</i>

489
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,039
<i>Who knew that she would even dare to
plot to take a high goddess's life?</i>

490
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,920
<i>If she succeeded,
that would have been fine.</i>

491
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,840
<i>But she has failed.</i>

492
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,760
<i>If the Crown Prince were to investigate
this matter</i>

493
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,280
<i>it could be a lot of trouble.</i>

494
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,440
You are so senseless.

495
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,320
How could you do such a thing
to the Aunt of Qing Qiu?

496
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,840
I understand the jealousy
you have for her.

497
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,360
However, His Highness will be
ruling over the four seas.

498
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,880
It will be inevitable for there to be
many women in his palace.

499
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,400
How can you enter Xiwu Palace
if you are so prone to jealousy?

500
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,119
Sister, didn't you tell me to--

501
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,119
You misunderstood me.

502
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,920
But don't be afraid.

503
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,679
Only Xin Nu and I will know.

504
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,920
Let's think of a way so that you will
become the Crown Prince's woman.

505
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,440
And use a happy occasion
to bury this incident.

506
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,920
Are you speaking the truth, Sister?

507
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,280
Of course.

508
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,519
I genuinely like you,
so naturally, I will help you.

509
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,880
Don't worry.

510
