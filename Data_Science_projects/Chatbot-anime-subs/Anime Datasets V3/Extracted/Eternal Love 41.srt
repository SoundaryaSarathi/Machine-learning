<i>[Episode 41]</i>

3
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,319
High God.

4
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,439
We're going to the West Sea.

5
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,680
The West Sea? Not Qing Qiu?

6
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,439
Not Qing Qiu. The West Sea.
We must not delay.

7
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,560
We may lose a life if we are late.

8
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,599
<i>High Goddess! High Goddess!</i>

9
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,039
<i>High Goddess!</i>

10
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,400
High Goddess.

11
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,159
You said the young prince
would wake up at midnight.

12
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,520
It's past midnight.
He doesn't seem to be waking up.

13
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,479
Instead, his face is turning even redder.

14
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,840
I was extremely anxious
and could think of nothing else

15
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,759
so that's why I came to disturb you.

16
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,639
When ordinary children drink fruit wine

17
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,199
they do sleep until
the middle of the night before waking.

18
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,879
It seems I've overestimated A-Li.

19
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,520
He will probably sleep
until tomorrow morning.

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
But look at how rosy his face is.
That means the wine is wearing off.

21
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
You don't need to worry.

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,479
Don't tell me you haven't
slept at all since yesterday?

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Don't worry. I'll transfer some of
my immortal energy to him later.

24
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,000
I ensure you he'll be lively again
when he wakes tomorrow.

25
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,240
However, it would be best for him
to eat some thick porridge tomorrow.

26
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,439
Go rest for now. Regain your energy and
make some porridge tomorrow morning.

27
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,759
But if the young prince keeps you
from sleeping peacefully...

28
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,000
Look at the way he is sleeping.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Even if I roll him back to Qingyun Hall

30
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
he might not even notice.

31
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
How could he bother me?

32
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,720
Taking care of children sure isn't easy.
Ye Hua really has a lot of patience.

33
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,519
Come on.

34
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,360
The prince still hasn't awakened?

35
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,480
It's a shame you went through
the trouble to make this porridge.

36
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,720
The porridge won't be good cold.

37
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,240
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?
If you don't mind, please try my cooking.

38
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
No need.

39
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,839
It took me two hours
to make this porridge.

40
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,639
It'd be a shame to throw it away.

41
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,627
Besides, you are going to
the Heavenly Spring later.

42
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,639
It wouldn't be good to go
on an empty stomach.

43
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,040
That's true. I'll have a taste then.

44
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,399
You are skilled indeed.

45
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,240
- High Goddess.
- High Goddess.

46
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,120
What a big fuss.

47
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,639
The Lord of Numinous Treasures
sure is thoughtful.

48
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,800
Your Highness.

49
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
I went for a walk this morning

50
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
and was guided here by
the pure immortal energy.

51
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,879
I came here without realizing.

52
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,279
What is the matter?

53
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,560
Is there a special guest at
the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

54
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,800
Your Highness,
it is High Goddess Bai Qian.

55
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,639
The Aunt of Qing Qiu?

56
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,920
How come you didn't report it to my hall?

57
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,360
Your Highness, the Crown Prince ordered
that nobody is to disturb Aunt.

58
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,560
No need to be afraid.

59
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,319
I understand you are
one to follow orders.

60
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,199
It's just that you don't understand that
I am the only consort of Xiwu Palace

61
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,079
and Aunt is the future Crown Princess.

62
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,600
By all reason, I should come to
pay my respects.

63
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,160
Your Highness, His Highness ordered

64
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,543
that nobody is to come near
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

65
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,399
It's just that Aunt of Qing Qiu
has come today.

66
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,839
As her junior, if I don't make
my salutations and pay my respects

67
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,800
won't that be a violation of
the Celestial Palace's etiquette?

68
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,439
Besides, I haven't seen
the young prince in a long time.

69
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,240
I can take a look at him too.

70
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,040
But the high goddess has already
left for the Realm of Supreme Purity

71
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,800
and the prince is still sleeping.
Your Highness shouldn't go in.

72
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,935
The Realm of Supreme Purity?

73
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:19,420
Hasn't the Lord of Numinous Treasures'
Realm of Supreme Purity

74
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,519
been closed for a long time?

75
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,079
Has it been reopened?

76
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,466
His Highness said the high goddess was
injured in a battle in the Ghost Realm

77
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,319
so that's why she's gone to treat
her wounds at the Heavenly Spring.

78
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,680
Is that so?

79
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,559
Then that is even more reason that
I must see to this high goddess

80
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,864
in His Highness's stead.

81
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,960
I'll come back later.

82
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,759
When I first saw her, I also thought
she was one to break the rules.

83
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,240
Sure enough, last night, Miao Qing
from the Eastern Sea got into trouble.

84
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,519
I don’t know what exactly she did.

85
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,080
I heard our lady pled for
forgiveness for Miao Qing last night

86
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,240
and knelt for half the night
in His Highness's study.

87
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,759
Her Highness is truly one of a kind.

88
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,080
She is beautiful and kind.

89
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,799
Yet, for some reason,
His Highness does not like her.

90
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,960
I have been serving in
Her Highness's hall for so long

91
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,879
but I've never seen
His Highness come by even once.

92
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,320
Her Highness has such a hard time.

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,759
Yes, Her Highness is
so kind and benevolent.

94
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,159
She will suffer a lot under
the high goddess from Qing Qiu.

95
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Let them finish.

96
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,240
Have you heard the high goddess from
Qing Qiu is already 140,000 years old?

97
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,559
She's already 140,000 years old?

98
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,360
Then... Then isn't she
an old woman already?

99
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
She knows no shame in her old age.

100
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,039
She must have used her powers
to enchant His Highness.

101
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,360
I vaguely remember there is
a rule in the Celestial Palace

102
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,840
that one must not make
inappropriate comments about high gods.

103
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,639
Is that right?

104
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,399
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,159
Those two maids are outrageous.

106
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,840
I am not angry

107
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,480
but hearing someone say such things
is just not pleasant.

108
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,159
I do not mind too much.

109
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,679
However, the Celestial Palace
is so large.

110
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,840
People must know that
the rules aren't just for show.

111
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,879
Don't you think?

112
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,679
You are right.

113
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,600
Noise and disturbances are
frowned upon in the palace.

114
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,159
I think these two maids
are a bit too lively.

115
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,559
I'm afraid they aren't suited
for this job.

116
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,039
Why don't you pick another job for them?

117
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
A-Li isn't coming today.

119
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,240
It'll be boring being alone
at the Heavenly Spring.

120
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,720
Wait here.
I'm going to pick out a few books.

121
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,679
Did you give wine to A-Li?

123
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,840
He has been sleeping since
yesterday afternoon.

124
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
What happened?

125
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,600
I merely gave him
a little too much fruit wine.

126
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
He was just drunk.

127
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,860
He still hasn't woken up.
Why didn't you report this to me?

128
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,360
Why didn't you summon the Medicine King
to take a look at him?

129
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,759
A-Li is still a child.
Why are you so anxious?

130
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,480
When I was young,
I drank Zhe Yan's wine in secret

131
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,279
and slept for five days without waking.

132
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,200
My parents didn't seem fazed.

133
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Besides, A-Li is a boy.

134
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,279
If you pamper him too much,
he will grow up to be effeminate.

135
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,000
You did not raise A-Li

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,960
so you have been
regarding him as a stepson.

137
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,440
If he were your own son, would you
still be able to say these words?

138
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,120
That's correct.

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Such a lively and likable child
couldn't be mine.

140
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,720
It's just a shame that the woman
who gave birth to A-Li

141
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,159
has already jumped off Zhuxian Terrace.

142
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,879
What I learned at Kunlun Mountain was
the way to being free and unrestrained.

143
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,320
Naturally, I did not learn to be
kindhearted and merciful

144
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
and am unable to treat your A-Li well.

145
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,600
I remember Lord Ye Hua's consort
is most kindhearted.

146
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,080
She must be able to
take good care of A-Li.

147
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,799
Then he won't have to suffer with me.

148
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
You don't need to say
such things to anger me.

149
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,519
You know that is not what I meant.

150
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,440
<i>I was criticized by those two maids
early in the morning</i>

151
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,759
<i>and now I am being scolded by
the Crown Prince.</i>

152
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,080
<i>I came here to recuperate,
not to be angered.</i>

153
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,799
High Goddess!

154
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,519
Did you see who left the hall just now?

155
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,159
What's the matter? Speak slowly.

156
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,519
You should punish me.
It is all my fault.

157
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,440
You treat the young prince so well.

158
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,679
Even if my lady were reborn,
she would be grateful to you.

159
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,919
If the young prince ends up in
Consort Su Jin's hands because of me

160
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,399
- then I... I...
- You just said...

161
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
Riceball is in Su Jin's hands?

162
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,200
What do you mean?

163
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,000
I am speaking too fast.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,957
Right after you left,
Consort Su Jin arrived.

165
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,919
She said she was led here
by the immortal energy

166
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,759
and came to the Hall of Beautiful Youth

167
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,000
to greet the honored guest and
visit the young prince.

168
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
- Su Jin came to see me?
- Yes.

169
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,519
But 300 years ago, His Highness said

170
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,360
Consort Su Jin is not allowed to
come near the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

171
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,320
She has abided by the rule
all these years.

172
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,679
But for some reason,
she suddenly came by today.

173
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,120
I was able to block her.

174
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,799
I just went to the back to fetch water

175
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,799
and now the young prince is gone!

176
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,480
Don't worry.

177
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,080
It was Ye Hua who took Riceball.
It has nothing to do with Su Jin.

178
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,240
Is that the truth?

179
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Why would I lie to you?

180
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,240
If Su Jin had taken Riceball,
I would have taken him back already.

181
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,799
Would I be here comforting you?

182
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,000
That's good, that's good.

183
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,360
But, it seems you are
very wary of Su Jin.

184
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
Does this Su Jin

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,759
have anything to do with A-Li's mother
jumping off Zhuxian Terrace?

186
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,440
The Heavenly Lord ordered that
nobody speak of that.

187
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,519
The maids who knew about it

188
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,679
were all sent to various deity mountains

189
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,639
and are no longer in
the Celestial Palace.

190
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,360
All right, you don't need to say
any more. I understand.

191
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,600
Where are they now? Take me to them.

192
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,960
If Riceball is fine,
I will bring him back.

193
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,399
Yes.

194
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,320
Your Highness need not worry.

195
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,799
The prince just has a low tolerance.
He is not in any danger.

196
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,799
He just needs to soak in
this sobering bath

197
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,583
and he'll wake before nightfall.

198
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,399
What is the matter with A-Li?

199
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,440
Third Prince, the young prince just has
a low alcohol tolerance

200
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
and had too much to drink.

201
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,000
- All right. You may go.
- Yes.

202
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,879
Someone told me you rushed out of the
Hall of Beautiful Youth carrying A-Li.

203
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,840
I thought something
had happened to A-Li.

204
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,480
I thought that bringing
Bai Qian up to Heaven

205
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,879
with your wedding coming soon
would make you more cheerful.

206
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,200
But look at you now.
You don't look any happier.

207
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,279
Is it because you're anxious
about becoming a groom?

208
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,840
I heard High God Zhe Yan
went to the West Sea

209
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,559
to treat the Water King's
eldest son's illness.

210
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,319
Heavenly Lord, Zhe Yan is currently
at my Crystal Palace.

211
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,440
You are very fortunate.

212
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,559
When Ye Hua was severely ill

213
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
it was thanks to
Zhe Yan's medical expertise

214
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
that Ye Hua's life was saved.

215
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,359
It seems your eldest son
will recover soon.

216
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,680
Thank you for
Your Majesty's auspicious words.

217
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,480
Where is Dijun?
How come he isn’t back yet?

218
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,440
Heavenly Lord, by Dijun's orders

219
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,480
he is to live 60 years
in the Mortal Realm

220
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,160
to experience all the hardships
of the Mortal Realm.

221
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,960
It has only been 40 days.
He still has 20 days left.

222
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,839
Is he satisfied with what is written
in your Book of Destiny?

223
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,720
I can't say if he is satisfied,
but there are enough setbacks in store.

224
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,079
All the difficulties Dijun wants
to experience must be provided to him.

225
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,480
Is that so?

226
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
At this moment in the Mortal Realm

227
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,722
Dijun is traveling in disguise

228
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:02,039
meets with misfortune,
and is attacked by assassins.

229
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,839
Attacked by assassins?

230
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,160
That one is good.

231
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,799
When Dijun was God of Heaven and Earth,
he was never defeated.

232
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,759
Nobody would dare offend him.

233
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,200
Now that he is in the Mortal Realm

234
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,039
let him have a taste of misfortune

235
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,263
and being attacked by assassins.

236
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,319
<i>Feng Jiu, take care.</i>

237
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,319
Jiu'er, Jiu'er!

238
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,440
Dijun, it hurts.

239
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,319
Dijun?

240
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,920
Jiu'er, who are you calling out to?

241
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,000
I am calling out to Dijun.

242
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,559
<i>Who is this Dijun she speaks of?</i>

243
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,319
<i>Never mind. Let's not worry
about him for now.</i>

244
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,799
Jiu'er.

245
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,240
If it hurts, why don't you cry?

246
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,079
Before I entered the palace

247
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,880
I was closest with my aunt.

248
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,279
Aunt would often teach me

249
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,960
that I may be a woman

250
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
but I must be unafraid of death

251
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,960
and protect the ones I want to protect.

252
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,000
<i>Feng Jiu, you are a princess of Qing Qiu.</i>

253
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>In the future, you will be
inheriting my throne</i>

254
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,720
<i>and protecting the people of Qing Qiu.</i>

255
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>How can you cry so easily?</i>

256
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,279
Jiu'er.

257
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,160
I am the man who will protect you.

258
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,000
No...

259
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,480
If you do not kill me tonight

260
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,960
then I will kill you by my sword!

261
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,480
<i>There's nothing suspicious.
They are just normal mortals.</i>

262
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,119
There really has been a murder!

263
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,839
You and you! Go see if
there are any left alive!

264
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,119
- Yes!
- Yes!

265
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,000
Where can I find a physician?
Where is there a physician?

266
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,240
Physician! Physician!

267
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,079
Miss, do you know
where I can find a physician?

268
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,359
Dijun.

269
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,400
Jiu'er.

270
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Tell me.

271
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,480
Who is this Dijun you speak of?

272
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,640
It is you, Dijun.

273
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,160
On the day you saved my life

274
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,200
I started to like you.

275
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,319
I like you so very much.

276
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,559
Dijun.

277
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,599
You have to promise me.

278
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,200
No matter what

279
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,359
you must not forget
our promise of two years.

280
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,640
<i>Promise of two years?</i>

281
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
<i>That is indeed between me and Jiu'er.</i>

282
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,400
<i>But Dijun...</i>

283
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
<i>Could it be that in Jiu'er's hometown</i>

284
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,680
<i>they call the emperor by the name Dijun?</i>

285
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,279
Jiu'er.

286
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,319
Don't be afraid.

287
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,920
I... will make sure you live.

288
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,359
Whether I live isn't important.

289
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,480
I am just afraid

290
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,559
you will forget me once I die.

291
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,200
You... You will not die.

292
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,599
You will not die.

293
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,839
Hero... hero...

294
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,640
Be careful. Your sword can kill.

295
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,200
Yan Zhi.

296
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,720
Where did you find her?

297
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,759
While I was out, I saw
she was gravely injured

298
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,680
so I brought her back here.

299
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,799
She is from the Nine-tailed Fox Clan.

300
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,319
How do you know that?

301
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,451
Even if I can't see

302
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:04,960
I can recognize
the Nine-tailed Fox Clan by their scent.

303
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,160
Yan Zhi, is she especially young?

304
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
Yes.

305
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,079
There is only one girl in the younger
generation of the Nine-tailed Fox Clan.

306
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,480
Her name is Bai Feng Jiu.

307
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
If my guess is right

308
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,839
she is Bai Feng Jiu,
niece of Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

309
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,480
Bai Feng Jiu?

310
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,720
She was born after I left Qing Qiu.

311
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,720
Although I have never met her

312
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,039
I know Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu has
a plumed cockscomb on her forehead.

313
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,440
Yes, there is a birthmark.

314
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,680
It's red and looks similar to
a plumed cockscomb flower.

315
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,839
Did you bring her here
to do something to her?

316
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,680
No, Sister-in-law.
I did not know who she was.

317
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,079
I just brought her back
to treat her injuries.

318
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,720
I didn't know she was
a princess of Qing Qiu.

319
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,039
That's good.

320
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,160
Even if you brought her back
by coincidence

321
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,519
it was her aunt, Bai Qian

322
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,359
who took away my beauty
out of hatred for me.

323
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,119
Good, very good.

324
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,440
She has been sent to me.

325
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,240
Son.

326
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,799
Bear with it for now.

327
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,039
Use this woman's body to wake up.

328
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,319
I will find a fitting immortal's body
for you later.

329
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,400
What did you say?
What are you going to do?

330
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,319
What am I going to do?

331
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,759
I'm going to use this woman's body

332
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,839
to wake my Ying'er.

333
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,839
You cannot do that.

334
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,599
Yan Zhi.

335
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,640
Don't you want to see
your nephew wake up?

336
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,319
Only by using a high immortal's body
can my son wake up.

337
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,960
Yan Zhi.

338
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,359
This is a chance given to us
by the Heavens!

339
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,920
I won't allow you to use
this sort of ancient sorcery.

340
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Sister-in-law, just let him go
and bury him.

341
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,720
On the day he was born, he was already...

342
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,519
He was already dead.

343
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,759
No, no! He isn't dead!

344
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,359
He is just sleeping.
He just won't wake up.

345
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,759
Even if his father doesn't want him,
I want him to live!

346
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,000
I risked my life
to give birth to Ying'er.

347
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,960
He must live!

348
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,319
Sister-in-law, I didn't want to
tell you so soon

349
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,079
but it seems
there is no other option now.

350
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,880
Do you know of divine fungal grass?

351
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,640
Divine fungal grass?

352
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,000
In the Celestial Tribe

353
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,960
divine fungal grass is a miraculous plant
that purifies immortal energy.

354
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,880
It is also a sacred item in the
Celestial Tribe for cultivation practice.

355
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,079
Those of the Celestial Tribe

356
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,440
use it to transfer their cultivation
to save others.

357
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,319
I think since he is half immortal

358
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,039
as long as we have
this sacred item from the Celestial Tribe

359
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,119
perhaps he may have a chance at waking.

360
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Divine fungal grass?

361
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,039
How come I have never heard it mentioned

362
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,920
and how come nobody has ever
told me about it?

363
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,799
I only heard Father mention it by chance.

364
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,359
As long as we get divine fungal grass

365
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,359
then I can transfer
my cultivation to him.

366
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,000
Then he may have a chance to live.

367
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,359
Since it is a sacred item
of the Celestial Tribe

368
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,359
it must be strictly guarded.

369
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,920
Will you really take me there?

370
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Trust me. I will take you there.

371
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,319
For the sake of Li Jing's child,
I am willing to give it a try.

372
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,960
So, you must let me save
Bai Feng Jiu first.

373
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,200
Even if Bai Qian wronged you

374
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,039
Bai Feng Jiu has never harmed you.

375
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
After I save her, we'll head out
to Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

376
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,599
<i>I don't know if
she is speaking the truth.</i>

377
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,200
<i>Now that I am not the Ghost Queen</i>

378
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,759
<i>I cannot find myself
a high immortal's body.</i>

379
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,240
<i>This is a rare chance in front of me.</i>

380
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,279
- Sister-in-law?
<i>- I am right outside.</i>

381
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,640
<i>If you have any evil intentions</i>

382
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,599
<i>I will take your life right now.</i>

383
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,759
Sister-in-law, what's the matter?

384
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,319
It's nothing. I think you are right.

385
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,839
I've thought it through.

386
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,599
I am the Ghost Realm's princess

387
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,000
but I have no home to return to
and am wandering the Mortal Realm.

388
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,480
You are Qing Qiu's princess.
Why have you come here?

389
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,039
<i>Is what she said true?</i>

390
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,039
<i>It's impossible.
Why would she be so nice?</i>

391
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,400
<i>No, I don't care what she is up to.</i>

392
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,920
<i>If I follow her</i>

393
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,160
<i>there will come a moment when
Zi Lan cannot protect her.</i>

394
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,359
<i>If I really must,
I will risk my life to kill her</i>

395
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,039
<i>so Qing Cang can break out of
the Bell of the East Emperor's seal.</i>

396
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:28,240
My baby, when your grandfather comes out,
he will definitely like you.

397
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
He will definitely save you.

398
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,079
Little Mute, tell him I'm a good person.

399
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,240
Your wife is awake. Go see her.

400
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,599
My goodness, I was so scared.

401
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,640
Why are you here?

402
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,759
There was a murder case
on the outskirts of town.

403
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,720
I originally came to
investigate the case.

404
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,960
Then I heard you brought back a man
and woman who were covered in blood.

405
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,559
I was worried about you.

406
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,559
How long have we known each other?

407
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,920
About five years.

408
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,720
Already? I've been here
for five years already?

409
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
It's time to move again.

410
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,240
Move? Where are you moving to?

411
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Anywhere will do.

412
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,759
North, south, east, west.
I'll head in a random direction.

413
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,280
Then... I'll go with you.

414
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
You'll go with me?

415
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,920
You're a woman.
You need a man to protect you.

416
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,599
I have no parents anyway.
I'll go with you wherever you want to go.

417
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,079
I'll protect you.

418
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,519
Surround them.

419
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,079
- Yes.
- Yes.

420
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:51,000
Your Majesty, I am late to rescue you.
The Heavens protected Your Majesty.

421
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,519
I was late to rescue you.
Allow me to die as an apology.

422
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,079
I am not a merciful emperor.

423
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,400
Cao Jing plotted a rebellion.

424
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,519
Not only must his entire clan
be slaughtered

425
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,079
but all high and low officials,
merchants, and civilians

426
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,800
who have had any interaction
with the Cao clan in the past 20 years

427
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,192
must be interrogated.

428
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,914
The case must be
thoroughly investigated!

429
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:34,639
Your Majesty, is... the Crown Prince
to be interrogated as well?

430
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Yes.

431
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,239
Your Majesty.

432
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,360
If you are tired, then sleep more.

433
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,760
I have slept for a long while already.
I've slept so much that my head aches.

434
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,039
Jiu'er.

435
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,599
- This arrow...
- Your Majesty need not speak of it.

436
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,280
Your Majesty just needs to remember
that I took this arrow willingly.

437
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I do not need any rewards.

438
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,159
I only ask that Your Majesty remember me

439
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:34,000
and keep me in your heart
for all lifetimes.

440
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,280
I... will not betray you in any lifetime.

441
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,400
Are you looking for the bells?

442
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,400
Has Your Majesty seen them?

443
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
I kept them.

444
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,039
Good, that's good.

445
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,559
Can Your Majesty bring them to me?

446
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,199
What is this?

447
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,920
This is the arrow that wounded you.

448
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,760
Your Majesty kept it?

449
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,000
I am not just keeping it.

450
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,760
I will keep it for the rest of my life.

451
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,480
This bell...

452
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,519
You have always worn it
all the time that you have been with me.

453
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,079
Is it very important?

454
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,159
It was given to me by someone
who is very important to me.

455
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,239
Si Ming, come here.

456
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,119
What orders do you have, Third Prince?

457
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,800
I heard Miao Qing of the Eastern Sea
was sent back?

458
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,320
I do not know of Xiwu Palace's affairs.

459
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,079
Is there anything you don't know about
in the Celestial Palace?

460
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,360
It's rumored that the princess

461
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,159
put an aphrodisiac
into the Crown Prince's soup last night.

462
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,719
The Crown Prince discovered it

463
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,960
and Consort Su Jin came over
to plead for forgiveness.

464
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,010
It was at that moment that
Qing Qiu's Aunt arrived.

465
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,010
With Aunt's word

466
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,755
the Crown Prince immediately sent
the princess out of Xiwu Palace.

467
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,036
That's the rumor.

468
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,239
Problems arise wherever there are women.

469
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,519
Yes.

470
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,039
It's a good thing Mo Yuan did not
accept female disciples. If he had...

471
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,679
Who knows what would have
happened to Kunlun Mountain?

472
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,400
Yes.

473
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,840
This is the Book of Destiny?

474
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,679
Let me see how Dijun
is attacked by assassins.

475
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,800
All right.

476
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,679
This isn't right.

477
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,400
What isn't right?

478
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,159
Dijun has survived the assassination

479
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,800
but there are a lot of words
missing here.

480
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,440
Look at this empty space.

481
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:04,380
Could it be that someone from
the Celestial Tribe or the Ghost Tribe

482
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,784
has appeared near Dijun?

483
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:11,760
It's all right as long as Dijun is safe.
This isn't a big issue. Don't worry.

484
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,079
If he does encounter someone,
that is fate.

485
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,119
It's not something you or I can control.

486
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,639
Let's go.

487
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,119
- High Goddess.
- How is Riceball now?

488
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,719
The young prince has woken up.

489
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,559
If he's awake, why hasn't he
returned with you?

490
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,599
His Highness said the prince was
in a sobering bath

491
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
and will remain in Zichen Hall tonight.

492
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,440
So he's not coming back tonight?

493
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,360
Never mind. I'll go take a look.

494
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,559
Queen of Qing Qiu?

495
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,639
Unmarried women don't know how
to take care of children.

496
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,000
A-Li is so young.

497
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,159
He was given so much wine and
slept for a whole day and night.

498
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,280
She doesn't even feel guilty.

499
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,119
When she marries into Xiwu Palace,
I'm afraid A-Li will have a hard time.

500
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,079
Most people in Qing Qiu
are good at drinking wine.

501
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,760
She did not do it intentionally.

502
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,440
Yes, Mother thought I liked to drink

503
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,599
so she allowed me to
drink a bit too much.

504
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,880
Mother? Who taught you that?
Was it High Goddess Bai Qian?

505
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:45,920
She is Mother,
the one in Father's painting.

506
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,519
The painting?

507
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,360
Your Highness, I was also shocked
when I saw Aunt a few days ago.

508
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,199
She does look very similar.

509
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,840
I always hoped you would forget
what happened 300 years ago.

510
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Now that you are interested
in this high goddess

511
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,480
I am unexpectedly feeling uneasy.

512
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:27,722
