1
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:16,610
Eriol, dinner is almost ready.

2
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:17,701
Ok.

3
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,345
What are you writing?

4
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:26,544
Can you understand it?

5
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:29,353
It’s been a long time
since we’ve seen her.

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,054
It’s almost over.

7
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:48,232
Sakura-san’s magic
has become much stronger.

8
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,077
She should be able to do it soon.

9
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,747
Hey! Hurry up or
your stew will get cold!

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,117
Ok, I’m coming.

11
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:01,011
Really, you two just
don’t appreciate the work

12
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,183
I put into things… hey…

13
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:05,883
Look! Look! Look!

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,290
[Sakura, the Past, and Clow Reed]

15
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,932
Damn! What’s with this snow!?

16
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,073
I guess that won’t work.

17
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,254
I can’t just keep running.

18
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:11,582
I have to do something about them.

19
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,308
All right, if you want
to play snow with me…

20
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,778
O Card created by Clow,

21
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:15,917
discard thine old form and be reborn.

22
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:19,951
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

23
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,321
Snow!

24
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,766
Snow! Destroy all these little snowmen!

25
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,811
Sakura has managed to defeat us again…

26
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,541
Keep it up… for a little while longer.
Sakura-san.

27
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:09,571
Sakura-chan!

28
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,210
Tomoyo-chan! Shao Lan-kun!

29
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:13,909
Are you ok?

30
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,043
I’m sorry I missed it.

31
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,984
I made you a new costume too!

32
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:26,154
Promise you’ll wear it next time,
pretty please!

33
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:30,595
I’m not really sure whether
there will be a next time…

34
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:32,196
That’s okay!

35
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,793
You’ll manage.

36
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:39,734
That’s right, soon all of the cards

37
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:42,837
will be Sakura Cards.

38
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:47,570
It looks like you’ve become
as strong as Clow himself.

39
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:48,778
No way…

40
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,315
Don’t you think so kid?

41
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,822
Y… Yeah…

42
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:59,553
No… not yet… Clow
is still much stronger.

43
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,528
Why do you always have
to be so depressing?

44
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,295
I’m just saying what’s true.

45
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,104
Clow-san…

46
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,125
What’s wrong? Can’t sleep?

47
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:40,194
Yeah. Say, Kero-chan…
what was Clow-san like?

48
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,590
Why this all of a sudden?

49
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:43,700
I been thinking…

50
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,904
Earlier you said it’s good that

51
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,439
my magic is growing so quickly…

52
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:55,773
But Yue keeps saying “Not yet”

53
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:56,775
and…

54
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,187
Well, Yue still misses Clow a lot.

55
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,852
Don’t you remember him?

56
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:09,227
I’ve forgotten a lot over the years…

57
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:11,329
Is that so…

58
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,764
You know, it was a very long time ago.

59
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,830
You’re our mistress now.

60
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,339
But I’m not as strong as him yet!

61
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,177
I’ll do my best
when strange things happen…

62
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:30,110
But if Clow-san was here,
I’m sure he could do better.

63
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:35,980
I wonder if it’s really so good
that I’m your mistress…

64
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:38,824
What are you saying?

65
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:41,017
Of course it’s good!

66
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:42,523
But…

67
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:46,526
Clow was Clow and you are you.

68
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:50,901
There’s no point
in comparing the two of you.

69
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:55,603
Now stop worrying
about it and get some sleep.

70
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,025
Today reminds me

71
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,756
a lot of that day…

72
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,517
That day?

73
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,090
Oh! Did I say that out loud?

74
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:23,269
Since you reminded me of him,

75
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:26,072
I rememberd the day he died…

76
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,334
– The day Clow… 
– Yeah.

77
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:33,841
It was about this time of year…
It was snowing just like today.

78
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,206
He didn’t seem very old

79
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,221
He’d just come to the end of his life,
or so he said.

80
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,422
Up until the end…

81
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:51,058
We never saw him die.

82
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,664
What is it? You look so surprised.

83
00:07:56,403 --> 00:08:00,430
Could he still be alive? If he is…

84
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,433
Of course not… forget it, forget it.

85
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,604
There’s no way he would have left

86
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:07,072
Yue or me if he was.

87
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,176
But why then do we always sense his aura

88
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,346
when something strange happens?

89
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,745
Um… that’s…

90
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:21,861
could he have done
something before he died?

91
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,892
I should go and ask him!

92
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:28,996
Ask who?

93
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:30,335
Clow-san!

94
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,897
Eh? You’re going to use the Return card?

95
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:38,438
Yes, I’m going back
to the past to talk with Clow.

96
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,680
He might know something
about what’s going on.

97
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,109
But the Return card
requires a lot of magic!

98
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,350
If something were to happen…

99
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:53,500
Kero-chan said it would be ok
if we use the power of the cherry
tree at the Tsukimine Shrine.

100
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,503
Shao Lan: Still!
You shouldn’t risk it!

101
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:03,067
Thank you.
For worrying about me.

102
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:19,748
You ready?

103
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:25,586
Return!

104
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:39,296
I’m off ok?

105
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:41,768
Please be careful!

106
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:59,083
I’ll surely come back. I promise. I
promise on this spot that if I say a lie…

107
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:07,929
May a thousand needles prick me

108
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,663
till I die.

109
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:14,705
I’ll see you later then.

110
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:24,576
Okay.

111
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:28,179
Please, take me to a
time just before Clow died.

112
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:37,493
Clow-san…

113
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,606
Where is this?

114
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,186
Oh? Is that Kero-chan over there?

115
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:10,421
What is it, Kerberos?

116
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,324
Oh Yue…

117
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,767
Even though it’s spring,

118
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:19,099
this cherry tree isn’t blooming anymore…

119
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:21,471
That’s too bad.
I guess it isn’t time yet.

120
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:23,406
When will it be then?

121
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:24,739
At that time.

122
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,446
What’s that supposed to mean?

123
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,416
I wonder if it’s ok.

124
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:33,812
I wonder what Kero-chan
and Yue-san are doing?

125
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,549
They’re waiting.

126
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,460
Umm… Clow-san! I’m…

127
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,938
Please…

128
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,427
Is that better?

129
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,971
Geez, of course it is.

130
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:41,552
Kero-chan and Yue-san look so happy.

131
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:56,934
They both look very happy…

132
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:07,939
Did you sleep well?

133
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,881
Clow! Umm… I’m…

134
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,785
This is a quiet place
to rest during the day.

135
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:25,791
Umm there’s something
I’d like to ask you…

136
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:27,555
um… you see…

137
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,268
About the future?

138
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:32,630
Eh? Um… yeah.

139
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:35,767
What is it you wanted to ask?

140
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:40,543
Uh, well, you see, strange things

141
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:41,971
are happening and…

142
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:46,117
we always feel your aura
when they appear.

143
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:50,353
So I was wondering
if you had done anything?

144
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,325
If I will, I did.

145
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,395
If I won’t, I didn’t.

146
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,229
What’s that mean?

147
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,930
Clow! No, don’t use the Bubble card!

148
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,798
Stop… please… heh heh…

149
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,074
Oh dear.

150
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,114
It’s nice here, isn’t it…

151
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,813
Very peaceful.

152
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:22,747
And how are you?

153
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:25,818
Do you like these children?

154
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,252
I love them! Kero, Yue,

155
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,256
and the cards!

156
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:38,363
But… but I’m not you after all…

157
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,302
Please wait! Clow-san!

158
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,479
The summer is over so soon.

159
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,824
Each season passes into the next.

160
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:08,861
Have you ever thought
about how sad it is?

161
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:10,766
I have.

162
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:17,671
Because I am just like season
that passes into next very soon.

163
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,415
Oh! Clow-san!

164
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:53,941
Huh?

165
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,276
That chair

166
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,647
is the same one as the one
in Eriol-kun’s house.

167
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,546
Explain yourself Clow!

168
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:03,186
What does this mean?

169
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,553
It’s as I told you Yue.

170
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,522
I will leave this world today.

171
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:11,757
That’s not something to joke about…

172
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,292
I’m sorry, it is not a joke.

173
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:16,327
Why!?

174
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,369
It is my time.

175
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:19,227
Your time?

176
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,004
Impossible.

177
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,569
You’re the world’s greatest magician.

178
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,003
You made us!

179
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:32,206
Even so, everything must die, in time…

180
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:35,183
Even me.

181
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,351
Why!?

182
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:42,037
There will come someone
who will care for you in my place.

183
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,306
I don’t want anyone else.

184
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:51,299
Then this person shall
require your approval.

185
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,802
I wouldn’t approve of anyone else!

186
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,368
It won’t just be up to Yue,

187
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,608
You’ll have to approve as well,
Keroberos.

188
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:01,879
Are you serious?

189
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,514
You two and the Clow cards

190
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:11,487
used all my effort and magic to create.

191
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,192
So, I sincerely hope that you guys

192
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:18,793
will be happy with your new master
after I am gone.

193
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,225
That is my final wish.

194
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:31,333
Every life comes to an end at some point.
Even ours.

195
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:36,046
It is a part of being alive.

196
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:39,145
What happened to Kero-chan
and Yue-san?

197
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,557
That is why I’m glad that

198
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,025
you have become their new mistress.

199
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,059
But I’m…

200
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,931
No… but you’ll do fine.

201
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,628
Please take care of them.

202
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,643
Ok? Sakura-san.

203
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,936
I can’t do it!

204
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:10,441
I can’t become you!

205
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:18,222
I don’t want them to forget about you…

206
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:25,228
but… but I’m not you…

207
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,230
That’s what I expected.

208
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:33,105
You are you.
I don’t expect you to be me.

209
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:38,676
There are many things
that only you can do.

210
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:40,506
Only me?

211
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:45,150
We can’t live in the past forever.

212
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:50,489
The future is always ahead of us.

213
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,590
The winter is over.

214
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,535
A new spring has begun.

215
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:12,462
Don’t worry.

216
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:16,965
I am me, and you are you.

217
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:23,644
That is the way things
are supposed to be.

218
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:37,727
Are you ok, Sakura?

219
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,625
Are you hurt?

220
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,959
No.

221
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,798
Did you see him?

222
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:46,938
Don’t tell me you didn’t…

223
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,598
No… I met him…

224
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,710
But, I didn’t get a chance to ask him…

225
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:57,472
What were you thinking!?

226
00:20:57,951 --> 00:20:59,043
But,

227
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,647
why was everyone at Eriol’s house?

228
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,591
Huh? Eriol, your classmate right?

229
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:10,858
That’s impossible! Clow died…

230
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:14,895
Oh, yes… I seems have seen him before…

231
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:16,228
You didn’t remember?

232
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,928
My member deteriorates…

233
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,904
Yue was at Eriol’s house… 
But he didn’t say anything…

234
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,810
Could their memories have been altered?

235
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,375
But who would…

236
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,046
Clow Reed.

237
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,058
Eriol-kun!

238
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:46,522
What are you?

239
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,467
I am currently known as Eriol.

240
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:54,034
But I used to be called Clow Reed.
