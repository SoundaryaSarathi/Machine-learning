Feels weird to be back in a city,
huh, Misty?

16
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,160
Sure does.

17
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,371
Being out in the jungle was great,

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,623
but it's kind of nice
to come back to civilization.

19
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,627
Hey, Pikachu, let's have a humongous meal
when we get to the Pokémon Center.

20
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,879
Pi, pika! Pika!

21
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,339
[Misty] I want a hot dog.

22
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,801
[Brock] I want a deep-dish,
extra-cheese pizza. Mm!

23
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,762
-Hey, what's that thing?
-What thing?

24
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,181
-Let's go see!
-Wait for us, Ash!

25
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,435
[all gasp]

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,444
Wow! Look at that!

27
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,653
Pika!

28
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,739
That's an amazing bridge.

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,117
-So it's been completed already.
-Huh?

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,495
Hey. The map says
it's still under construction.

31
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,708
But if it's completed, we can go straight
to Sunny Town on the opposite shore

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,585
without going all the way around.

33
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,464
Great! We'll cross the bridge
and get to the next town.

34
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,798
Come on. Let's go! [laughs]

35
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,508
Pika!

36
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,896
Well, I'm afraid the bridge
isn't completely finished.

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,064
See there?

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,023
[all] Huh?

39
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,402
That means we can't take the shortcut.

40
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,448
Even if it were finished,
this bridge is only for cars anyway.

41
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,825
The bridge is only for cars?

42
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,702
Couldn't we just walk across it?

43
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,288
Well, this bridge is over ten miles long.

44
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,666
It'd be dark
before you reached the other side.

45
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,584
Ten miles long?

46
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,504
Of course you might be able to cross
if you had bicycles.

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,630

00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,006

-[man] Hey, Norman!
-Ride safely.

50
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,387
I thought you said
the bridge isn't finished.

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,931
The road isn't finished,
but the bicycle path is.

52
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,766
-[woman] Hi!
-Hi, girls!

53
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,852
If you had bikes, you could cross too.

54
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,562
Wish we did.

55
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,564
- [Misty] Well...
-Oh!

56
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,984
If a certain someone here
hadn't totally destroyed my bike,

57
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,780
we could be just zipping
right across this bridge now, couldn't we?

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,989
Well, yeah. Maybe.

59
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:18,907
[laughs]

60
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,869
Hmm...

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,459
It's no use. We can't afford these.

62
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,710
Pika.

63
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,753
[all groan]

64
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,424
Let's go to the Pokémon Center
and figure out a plan.

65
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,800
Sounds good to me.

66
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,511
I'll probably come up
with a brilliant idea.

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,933
Well, what's your brilliant plan?

68
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,145
Will you be quiet?
I'm still thinking of it.

Excuse me, if you could spare some time,
would you mind helping me out?

related to the Joy in Gringy City?

I'm her cousin.

80
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,922
Ah, but you're much, much prettier
than she is.

81
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,424
That's just fine, but...

82
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,510
I'm worried about the Pokémon 
in Sunny Town,

83
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,929
just over the bridge, that's very sick.

84
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,307
-Oh. [gasps]
-Huh?

85
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:31,897
I need someone to deliver this medicine
to the Pokémon Center in Sunny Town.

86
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,359
Normally I'd go myself,
but I'm too busy with sick Pokémon 

87
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,069
to leave the center right now.

88
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,697
-It's just over the bridge, right?
-That's right.

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,532
But we don't have any bicycles.

90
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,744
No problem.
I'll let you use some of our bicycles.

91
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,953
Huh?

92
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,288
-Huh?
-Hey...

[both laugh]

94
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,376
We'll do anything we can
if it's to help a sick Pokémon.

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,922
Even if that means we'll have to zip
across the bridge on bikes.

96
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,089
That's great.

97
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,051
The bikes are in the parking lot.
And thank you.

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,469

00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,497
You see, we're getting to cross the bridge
after all.

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,541
Right, Ash. We sure got lucky.

across the bridge.

Ha! We've got them
right where we want them.

114

You think we got a chance this time?

115
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,351
Well, it's not like this place
is new to us, you know.

116
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,980
You could almost call it our hometown.
Isn't that right, James?

117
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,023
So we'll have the home team advantage.

118
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,234
James, prepare to attack.

119
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,361

This is a great workout.

123
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,665
Yeah,
and since we lucked into those bikes,

124
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,542
it won't be long till we're in Sunny Town.

125
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,710
Right, Brock.

126
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,171

127
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,594
Okay. Time to hit the road.

[chuckling] Uh, a bicycle gang?

136
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,445

I don't think I've seen you before.

140
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,000
Uh, we're not really from around here,
so see you.

-[boy 1] That's right.
-[boy 2] Get them, boss.

See you again sometime!

That's no introduction!

150
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,853
When we say introduction,
we mean Pokémon battle.

151
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,480
A Pokémon battle?

152
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,899
All right. I accept.

153
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:25,570
I'd do anything for an introduction
to a girl like you.

154
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,905

Get lost, loser.
I only care about my bike and my gang.

Is that a no?

00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,915
All right.

160
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,792
Let's get started.

161
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,877
Then we'll see who's the master.

162
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,089
Huh.
You think you can play with the big boys?

00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,093
All right, Golem. Tackle attack!

178
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,177
Golem!

179
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,220
Bulbasaur!

180
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,555
Golem!

181
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,597
[screams]

182
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,101
Are you okay, Bulbasaur?

183
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,978
Bulbasaur.

184
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,187
[sighs]

185
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,481
Return, Bulbasaur.

186
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,567
Charmander, I choose you.

187
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,944
Char! Char!

188
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,320
Charmander. Ember!

189
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,322
Char! Char!

190
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,703
Heh! Trying to heat things up?
It ain't going to happen.

191
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,621
Go, Golem! Rock throw now!

192
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,623
Golem! Go!

193
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,666
Char!

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,712
Charmander, flamethrower!

195
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,713
Char!

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,759
Charmander, fire spin now.

197
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,718
Char!

198
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,137
Golem!

199
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,474
Ha! I wonder how long it can take this.

200
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,101
[grunts] Golem. Tackle attack now.

201
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,352
Golem!

202
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,105
-Char!
-Charmander, run!

[all laughing]

205
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,613
Golem, return.

206
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,784
Huh?

207
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,535
[yells]

208
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,789
Now it's my turn to show you.

209
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,707
I choose you, Cloyster.

210
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,918
Crush this wimp!

211
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,670
Cloys!

212
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,631
Huh? What's a Cloyster?

213
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,008
[Pokédex]
<i>Cloyster. A bivalve Pokémon.</i>

214
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,220
<i>Its shell is incredibly strong</i>
<i>and resistant to a bomb.</i>

215
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,597
<i>Its shell only opens when it attacks.</i>

216
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,642
-Okay, no sweat.
-It's a water Pokémon.

217
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,227
-Just leave it to me.
-Huh?

218
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,728
You battle?

219
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,189
[laughs] This should be quick.

220
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,652
[thinking] <i>Which one would be best</i>
<i>against Cloyster's hard shell?</i>

221
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,153
<i>I know.</i>

222
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,656
Starmie, go!

223
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,534
Psy?

224
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,203
Huh? Psyduck, what are you doing here?

225
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,205
I wanted Starmie, not you.

226
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,373
Psy?

227
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,708
Well, now that you're out, give it a try.

228
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,168
Psy-i-i-i!

229
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,212
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck...

230
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,213
[laughing]

231
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,298
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck.

232
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,216
[all laughing]

233
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,676

[all laughing]

235
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,638
I have never seen such a pathetic Pokémon.

236
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,099
[whimpers]

237
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,059
[laughing]

238
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,018
Psy?

239
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:46,980
My gut hurts!

240
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,109
Psyduck, use your tail whip attack.

241
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,027
Psy.

242
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,489
Psy. Psy. Psy...

[snickering]

245
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,703
Huh?

246
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,454
Pika-pi.

247
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,664
Pikachu.

248
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,918
Psy. Psy. Psy.
Psy. Psy. Psy.

249
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,755
Psy! [grunts]

[all laughing]

252
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,595
And we were supposed to be attacking.

253
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,471
Psyduck, scratch it now!

254
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,514
Psy!

255
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,349
[grunting]

256
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,353
[grunting frantically]

[all laughing]

258
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,819
[thinking] <i>Um, let 'em laugh. Just wait</i>
<i>till they see Psyduck's real power.</i>

259
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,779
Psy... [screams]

260
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,241
Psyduck, use your disable attack.

261
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,826
Psy? Psy? Psy?

262
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,370
Oh, just attack, you dumb duck!

263
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,748
Go on and use your confusion attack.

264
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,084
Psy. psy...

265
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,210
Psy!

266
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,130
Ah. Can't you remember your own attacks?

267
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,258
Misty it's because its headache
isn't bad enough yet.

268
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,385
Come on, Cloyster! Score a knockout!

269
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,929
Go for the head! Go for the head!

270
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,307
They're even starting to cheer
for our side. [laughing]

271
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,392
Cloyster, clamp it with your shell.

272
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,525
Cha?

273
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,652
[screams]

274
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,154
[grunting]

275
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,281
Looks like this battle's over.

276
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,575
Psyduck needs help.

277
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,161
I'll have to give it a headache myself!

278
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,121
Don't do it, Misty!

279
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,166
-[sirens blaring]
-[all] Huh?

280
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,627
Looks like the next town wants to rumble.

281
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,506
Who is that?

282
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,841
[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.

283
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,426
[James] Make it double.

284
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,679
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation...

285
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,181
To unite all peoples within our nation...

286
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,642
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

287
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,395
To extend our reach to the stars above...

288
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,356
-Jessie.
-James.

289
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,776
Team Rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

290
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,987
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

291
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,239
Meowth. That's right.

292
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,700
Tyra, it's been awhile.

293
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,159
Big Jess!

294
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,870
You're looking good, Chopper.

295
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,831
Little Jim.

296
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,875
Big Jess and Little Jim?
What's that about?

297
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,047
Huh! Well, nerd, we had a pretty bad
reputation here back in the old days.

298
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,216
You were Chainer Jessie.

299
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,177
[laughs]

300
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,722
[Tyra] <i>Big Jess was really cool,</i>

301
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,350
<i>swinging her chain around</i>
<i>while she rode her bicycle.</i>

302
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,603
And then there was Trainer James.?

303
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,024
<i>Little Jim was the only one</i>
<i>in the bike gang</i>

304
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,109
<i>who had to use training wheels.</i>

305
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,571
[laughing]

306
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,450
I suppose we really were crazy back then.

307
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,995
Well, I guess our secret past
isn't secret anymore.

308
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,956
I kind of wish it still was a secret.

309
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,041
Pika.

310
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,754
But I see you're still into kid stuff,
riding around on bicycles.

311
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,756
Real gangs ride unicycles.

312
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,885
I guess your cycle gang
must save a ton of money on handlebars.

313
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,304
Tyra, we're not in a gang.

314
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,348
We are members of the famous Team Rocket!

315
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,309
[both] Team Rocket!

316
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,440
And I'd like to have all of you help us
to take care of these little pests

317
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,442
that are always ruining our plans.

318
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,903
I'll do anything for Jess and Jim.

319
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,405
Then capture all of their Pokémon.

320
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,366
[all yelling]

321
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,326
-Let's go!
-Come on!

322

[groans]

324
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,124
Hey, who's causing all the trouble
on this bike path?

325
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,085
The cops. Let's split!

326
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,421
I thought you were going to help us.

327
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,548
They're all a bunch of scaredy-cats.

328
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,803
I'm getting kind of scared myself.

329
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,096
[both] Uh-huh.

330
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,647
So you're just trying to deliver
Pokémon medicine to Sunny Town?

331
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,234
Right, Joy, the beautiful
Pokémon Center nurse sent us.

332
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,946
Of course, she can't compare with you,
Officer Jenny.

333
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,448
You need to get there,
so I'll give you an escort.

334
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,366
Huh?

335
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,617
[cell phone rings]

336
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,245
This is 303.

337
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,163
Roger. Over and out.

338
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,332
There's been an accident. I'll have to go.

339
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,376
That's okay. We'll be fine.

340
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,377
Be careful.

341
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,294
-Okay.
-Thanks.

342
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:28,052
We should get moving, Ash.
A sick Pokémon's counting on us.

343
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:28,970
Let's go.

344
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,850
[thunder rumbling]

345
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,439
-[Ash] Ah!
-Pika!

346
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,857
Pikachu! We better hurry!

347
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,024
Pikachu.

348
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
[grunts]

349
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,327
[James]
They're riding right through the storm.

350
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,789
-No kidding.
-I knew those kids were all wet.

351
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,750
That wind could blow 'em
right off of the bridge.

352
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,212
They must be insane.
I'm glad we're inside.

353
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,505
-[Tyra] Big Jess.
-[Chopper] Little Jim.

354
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,548
Hm?

355
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,719
We know you want to be out there.
You could ride a storm twice this intense.

356
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,179
I could?

357
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,931
Big Jess,
lead us into the eye of the storm

358
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,517
and show us how to ride Big Jess style.

359
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,977
I... I...

360
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,731
[both]
Show the whole gang how to really ride.

361
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,734
[both trembling]

362
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,778
[Chopper]
You're not scared of this storm, are you?

363
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,365
I'm not. I just wish
I had my training wheels with me.

364
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,909
What about you, Big Jess?

365
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,826
[whimpering]

366
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,162
[thinking]
<i>I guess I have no choice.</i>

367
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,415
All right, now I'll show you kids
what riding's all about.

368
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,334
I wish I could go with you.

369
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,794
Meowth, we'd never leave you behind.

370
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:44,879
[groans]

371
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,176
The medicine still hasn't arrived.

372
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,762
<i>But they should be there by this time.</i>

373
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,847
Maybe they won't get through the storm.

374
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,191
[both] Ah!

375
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,109
[Misty] What's that?

376
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,072
[Brock] A drawbridge. That ship's
trying to take shelter in the bay.

377
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,202
-What do we do?
-We'll have to wait till it gets through.

378
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,038
We can't wait. They need that medicine.

379
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,459
Oh, I wish we were out of this rain.

380
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,336
Hey, look there.

381
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,214
How you going to get past that?

382
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,715
Hang in there, Little Jim.

383
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,843
Show us all what you can do, Big Jess.

384
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,180
-Do we really have to do this?
-I guess so.

385
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,979
-Ash, don't!
-There's a sick Pokémon waiting.

386
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,981
I can't let it down. [grunts]

387
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,607
Ash, wait up!

388
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,068
[panting]

389
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,070
[grunting]

390
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
Just have to keep going
for that sick Pokémon.

391
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,534
I have to make it. I just have to.

392
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,996
Ah!

393
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,415
[all yell]

394
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,127
Oh, no. They're not going to make it.

395
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,503
Ah!

396
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,588
[both] We'll drown!

397
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,299
-We'll bounce!
-[whimpers]

398
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,135
[Jessie grunts]

399
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,179
[grunts]

400
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,222
[all yelling]

401
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,933
We made it!

402
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,394
They did it! They're awesome!

403
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,565
[all]
Team Rocket's splashing down again!

404
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,819
[klaxon blows]

405
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,405
All right. Now you have to battle us.

406
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,033
I'm delivering medicine
for a sick Pokémon.

407
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,868
-Out of my way.
-What?

408
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,828
You mean
that's why you're out in this storm?

409
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,038
That's right.

410
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,833
Unbelievable. That's a real biker for you.

411
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,544
Listen up, guys!
We're going to take them there in style.

412
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,422
[all cheering]

413
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,931
Don't worry, Ash.
We'll clear the way for you.

414
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,562
Huh?

415
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,695
[Ash] Here, Nurse Joy.

416
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,198
You made it through in a storm like this.

417
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,158
Now this little one will be just fine.

418
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,872
[both] All right!

419
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,417
Sorry for making you worry about us.
We made it just in time.

420
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,461
<i>That's great. Thank you.</i>

421
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,837
[all chatter]

422
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,382
From now on,
we're calling you Awesome Ash.

423
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,800
Mighty Misty.

424
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,428
Well, gosh, I'm not really that awesome.

425
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,764
You could call me honey.

426
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,934
Argh!

00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,313
