1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,410
[Sakura’s wonderful friend]

2
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:13,820
Sakura.

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,090
Sakura.

4
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:20,861
I can’t eat any more.

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,529
Who was it that set
the alarm to seven o’clock?

6
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,530
Weren’t you going to wake up early?

7
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,661
Huh? Osaka accent?

8
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:31,766
There is nobody with
an Osaka accent in my family.

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:35,203
The TV…

10
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,080
isn’t on.

11
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,010
Which means…

12
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:49,522
What is it?

13
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,453
A stuffed animal?

14
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:55,529
You’re still half asleep.

15
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,825
Hey, wake up.

16
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:03,028
Oh yeah, the guard of the Clow Cards.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,702
Finally awake?

18
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,036
I’m the beast of the seal Cerberus.

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,273
Oh yeah,

20
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,046
A book Clow Card

21
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,074
I found in our basement,

22
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,611
I don’t really understand it,

23
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,418
but there were magical cards inside.

24
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,014
I scattered them

25
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,690
and I was asked by
this Cerberus to gather the cards.

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,927
What a nice morning,

27
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:29,095
Card Captor Sakura.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,328
I keep saying,

29
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:31,928
it’s impossible for me.

30
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:34,995
You’re too modest.

31
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:38,338
You see,

32
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:41,941
You’ve already got back the Fly card.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,312
Look. Look.

34
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:46,209
And it was terrible.

35
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,344
Breakfast is ready.

36
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,152
OK!

37
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,350
Good morning, brother.

38
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,823
She came down after
only being called once.

39
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,125
I wonder
if it’s going to rain today.

40
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,760
There was somebody to wake me up today.

41
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:07,067
Huh?

42
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:08,897
The alarm clock…

43
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:17,671
Good morning, mom.

44
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,277
Good morning.

45
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,775
Good morning, dad.

46
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:22,777
Good morning.

47
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,287
It looks good today.

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,423
Well, better than the monster’s I suppose.

49
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,392
Well dad, let’s eat.

50
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,301
Thanks for breakfast.

51
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:46,469
You really are early today.

52
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,506
I have morning cleaning duty,

53
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,285
Monster.

54
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,528
Welcome back.

55
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,132
Here, a present.

56
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:18,698
Well, I’m leaving.

57
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:22,642
Modern children sure are busy.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,473
My dad and brother have school too,

59
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,374
so if you wait a little
you can turn on the TV.

60
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:30,713
Your dad is still a student?

61
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:32,280
He is a college professor.

62
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,990
Don’t leave the room
while anybody else is home.

63
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:38,153
Everybody would be shocked.

64
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:39,388
Fine.

65
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,658
Ah!

66
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,766
It’s already this late?

67
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,132
I gotta hurry!

68
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,230
I’m leaving!

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,407
I’ll take a little detour.

70
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,017
I came to Yukito’s place.

71
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,997
Yukito isn’t here.

72
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,601
What?

73
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,369
You were here?

74
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,762
Good morning, Sakura-chan.

75
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,397
Good morning.

76
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,110
You’re early.

77
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,635
I have cleaning duty.

78
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,211
How commendable.

79
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:31,410
Oh yeah.

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,609
Want to decorate your classroom?

81
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:38,646
Is it OK?

82
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:39,952
Yeah.

83
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:46,724
Thank you.

84
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,331
Take care.

85
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,232
Thank you so much!

86
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:55,464
I’m going.

87
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:00,869
Today is a good day.

88
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,111
Yay! I’m first!

89
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,220
You’re early, Sakura-chan.

90
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,687
Good morning, you’re early too.

91
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:22,862
Good morning.

92
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,296
Did you have some sort of duty too?

93
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:27,162
No,

94
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:30,566
I had something I wanted to show you.

95
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,171
A video?

96
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,947
Last night I filmed
something very interesting.

97
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:43,549
Ah?

98
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,985
What was that?

99
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:57,357
This is a close up.

100
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,299
Huh?!

101
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:08,802
What’s wrong Sakura?

102
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,206
Is it a Clow Card?

103
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,106
Where? I’ll fight you so come on!

104
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,178
Uh, oh.

105
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,085
My, he looks the same.

106
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:33,064
It was stuffy in there.

107
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,035
Why did you come with me?

108
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,932
I thought I would check out
the daily life of the Card Captor.

109
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:45,180
May we please be introduced.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,213
He says his name is Cerberus.

111
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:51,680
He doesn’t seem to match the name.

112
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,317
He seems more of a Kero-chan.

113
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:54,554
Really.

114
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,525
Don’t call me like a frog!

115
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,890
I am the beast of the seal
who protects the Clow Cards,

116
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:00,893
Cerberus

117
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:03,026
Clow Cards?

118
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,134
Here I go.

119
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:12,973
Here.

120
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:19,080
And therefore Sakura
became Card Captor Sakura.

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,740
How wonderful.

122
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:25,447
The Card Captor protecting the city

123
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,713
From the chaos of the Clow Cards.

124
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,450
How cool!

125
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,325
Something so difficult
is impossible for me.

126
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,595
No, Sakura-chan can do it.

127
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:34,826
Can I please

128
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:37,097
see you use magic?

129
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,499
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

130
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:41,904
But…

131
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:43,364
I don’t mind. I don’t mind.

132
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,504
Nobody is looking, so go for it.

133
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,685
Key which hides
the power of darkness.

134
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,422
Show your true form before me.

135
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,660
Under the contract,
I Sakura command you.

136
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,722
Release.

137
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,634
You can use magic with this rod right?

138
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,941
But I need a card.

139
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,003
Here you go.

140
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,314
When did you get that out?

141
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,516
So, do you have a special pose?

142
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,018
Why?

143
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:33,319
A special pose and magical phrases

144
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,623
are the key to a magical girl.

145
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:38,585
Bye!

146
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,020
Goodbye!

147
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,798
Bye!

148
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,494
Good morning.

149
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:14,386
Good morning.

150
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:15,422
Good morning.

151
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,231
Good morning…

152
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,100
What’s going on?

153
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,302
Sakura-chan.

154
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:28,742
Look at that.

155
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:32,878
Oh!

156
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,276
What is this?

157
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:40,881
I don’t know. It was like this
when we got here this morning.

158
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:46,629
Huh?

159
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:50,524
I wonder who did this prank?

160
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,568
But I suppose we have to clean it up now.

161
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:00,706
Uh, oh…

162
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,101
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan.

163
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,342
Good morning.

164
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,842
This looks pretty bad.

165
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:09,779
What could do this?

166
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:13,746
Could it be that this is
the work of a Clow Card?

167
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,956
It is the work of a Clow Card.

168
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,995
So it was.

169
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,798
Geeze, it was really tough to clean it up.

170
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,729
But because of that class was shortened.

171
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:30,873
I was happy about that…

172
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:32,765
But

173
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,473
what kind of
Clow Card would mess up school?

174
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:37,910
I don’t know.

175
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:40,006
Anyways Sakura,

176
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,340
this is a job for the Card Captor.

177
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:43,480
Why?

178
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:46,980
If this is the work of a Clow Card
you have to catch it.

179
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:48,619
That’s why I say it’s impossible.

180
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,454
I wonder who it was
that scattered the cards?

181
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,090
Well then we will go to school tonight.

182
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:58,865
Tonight?

183
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,036
Night is no good.

184
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,201
Why?

185
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,732
Because, school at night is horrible…

186
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,477
Ah!

187
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:11,178
I won’t. I won’t. I absolutely won’t.

188
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:16,178
But there are cards
that will only move at night.

189
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,847
The school at night might be dangerous.

190
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:19,950
Tomoyo-chan.

191
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:23,490
So I’ll come too.

192
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,491
We must capture

193
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,329
Sakura-chan’s heroism on video.

194
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:30,021
Why?

195
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,592
It’s because that is my hobby.

196
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:34,796
All right!

197
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,239
Tonight the three of us will attack.

198
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:38,772
Now that it has been decided

199
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,344
we need to hurry to perfect
a special pose even more.

200
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,539
Yeah! We’ll start training right away.

201
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,470
Ah!

202
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,380
I’m scared.

203
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:58,761
It’s fine. It’s fine. I’m with you.

204
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,727
I don’t think it’s fine.

205
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,505
Did I keep you waiting?

206
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,904
No, I just got here.

207
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:23,078
Strange?

208
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:27,678
Let me introduce you.

209
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,355
These are my bodyguards.

210
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:34,928
Ah…

211
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,296
Well then miss.

212
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,169
Yes. If I call you, come and pick me up.

213
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,206
That’s incredible.

214
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,807
There aren’t many elementary school students
with bodyguards.

215
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,884
Oh, elementary school students
who can use magic are even more rare.

216
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:56,348
That may be true.

217
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:59,046
More importantly, come over here.

218
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,725
Oh!

219
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,427
What is this?

220
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:15,732
Well, let’s change.

221
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:17,330
Why?

222
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:18,633
Sakura,

223
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,202
you’re going to catch Clow Cards now right?

224
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:22,273
Yeah.

225
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:26,077
When you do something special,
you have to wear special clothes.

226
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,839
What?

227
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,842
Exactly!

228
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,178
If you don’t dress appropriately
for a Card Captor

229
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,559
you may lose to the card on spirit.

230
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,653
I’m so happy you understand.

231
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,723
So, change Sakura.

232
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:43,030
I have hats too.

233
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,165
So, so. Go inside.

234
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:00,612
How wonderful, Sakura-chan.

235
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:03,580
It’s embarrassing.

236
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,015
It’s nothing to be embarrassed about.

237
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:09,785
Oh yeah, I have one for Kero-chan too.

238
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,422
For me too?

239
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,423
It’s cute and matches Sakura.

240
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,265
Really?

241
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,870
I don’t feel any tension.

242
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,805
Uh!

243
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,480
I wonder what that sound was.

244
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:33,779
What’s wrong?

245
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,216
Ah…

246
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,783
This is the aura of a Clow Card.

247
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:49,790
Oh!

248
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:53,536
Oh…

249
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:55,433
Calm down.

250
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:57,328
But… But…

251
00:14:58,308 --> 00:14:59,536
Ar!

252
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,439
It’s chasing. It’s chasing us.

253
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:06,405
Sakura-chan.

254
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:07,374
Yes!

255
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,614
Look.

256
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,247
There is nobody there but a shadow.

257
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,348
Shadow?

258
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:18,191
Look out!

259
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,926
Kero-chan, is that a Clow Card?

260
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:23,430
That is…

261
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,405
That is the work of the Shadow card.

262
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,367
Kero-chan, you go with Tomoyo-chan.

263
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,301
Leave it to me.

264
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,008
Key which hides the power of darkness.

265
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:44,811
Show your true form before me.

266
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:48,953
I Sakura command you.

267
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:52,223
Release.

268
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,192
How wonderful.

269
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,976
Wind, become now the chains that bind.

270
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:12,937
Windy.

271
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:27,985
Eh!

272
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:35,427
Use the Fly card and run away
for the time being.

273
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:36,601
Fly.

274
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,403
It’s horrible!

275
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:44,037
It looks like the Shadow card

276
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:47,212
gathered the shadows of all the students.

277
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:50,709
It’s impossible for Sakura
to fight against this many.

278
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,020
Isn’t there some way?

279
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:56,717
The student’s shadows would disappear
if hit by light.

280
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,990
That would leave just the true Shadow

281
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:01,226
which she could just hit with magic.

282
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,996
But it’s night now.

283
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,199
If that’s it, then leave it to me.

284
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:07,628
Oh?

285
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:10,639
Oh!

286
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,569
That’s why I said it was impossible.

287
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:20,515
What should I do?

288
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,317
Hey! Let go.

289
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,890
Ar… r… aar…

290
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:40,994
Help me!

291
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:52,342
Ar?

292
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,250
Uh?

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,583
The shadows are gone.

294
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:02,818
Sakura

295
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,593
The shadows disappeared.

296
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:07,960
All but the main one will disappear

297
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:10,094
when hit by light.

298
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,824
It is impossible to call the sun,

299
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,668
but I can turn on the lights at least.

300
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,338
Thank you, Tomoyo-chan.

301
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:22,940
Sakura. That is the main one.

302
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,210
All right.

303
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,622
Now, Sakura!

304
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,863
Show the results of your training!

305
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:56,210
Wind, become now the chains that bind.

306
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,676
Windy.

307
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:17,222
Return to your rightful form. Clow Card.

308
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,345
She did it!

309
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:36,577
Just what we would expect
from Card Captor Sakura.

310
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,383
How wonderful.

311
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,359
Chiharu-chan,

312
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,061
have you seen Tomoyo-chan?

313
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,669
I saw her going into the A/V room.

314
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,798
Thanks.

315
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,602
Tomoyo-chan.

316
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:08,146
Thanks a lot for yesterday, this is in thanks.

317
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,510
Oh?

318
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,351
Huh!

319
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:18,318
I’m so glad it filmed well.

320
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,321
You even filmed this?

321
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,495
Of course.

322
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,023
I wouldn’t let even a second

323
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,062
of Sakura-chan’s heroism escape.

324
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:31,034
From now on when you go to catch cards

325
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,840
be sure to call me.

326
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,604
Eh?

327
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,945
We must leave the exploits of the Card Captor
for posterity.

328
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:39,713
Tomoyo-chan.

329
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:40,910
And then…

330
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:44,816
Leave your costume
for each time to me too.

331
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,117
Next time I’ll put
on more frills and a ribbon too.

332
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,221
Er…
