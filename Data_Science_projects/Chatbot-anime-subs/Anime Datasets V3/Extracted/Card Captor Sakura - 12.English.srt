1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:05,002
[Sakura’s never ending day]

2
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,586
What we have here is a model
that was made of it.

3
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:17,523
The real one was made of
valuable things like gold,

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,122
silver, and ivory.

5
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,621
At Tomoeda elementary

6
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:24,530
every term we have a special lesson

7
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:26,661
where people’s parents

8
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:29,466
talk about their own jobs.

9
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:36,700
So, how was such a large pyramid
constructed?

10
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:40,138
Yes, today is my dad’s turn.

11
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,073
He is a college professor.

12
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:43,511
This is actually the first time

13
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,443
I have had a class with him.

14
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,180
I always thought archaeology

15
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:51,184
seemed difficult,

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,283
but it seems sorta fun.

17
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:59,457
In Giza

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,631
the biggest of all the pyramids

19
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:03,170
was said to have taken forty years.

20
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:07,437
There may be some that took longer than
that to build.

21
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,674
This pyramid is said to have used
2,700,000 stones.

22
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,743
Your father is wonderful.

23
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:14,673
Which means

24
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,449
he was a king with great power over the people…

25
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:21,487
Huh? I thought I had ten minutes left.

26
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:32,230
It would be nice

27
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,157
if class always felt this short.

28
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:36,626
The chime before lunchtime

29
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:37,971
never seems to come

30
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,896
and the one to end breaks always comes

31
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:40,865
right away.

32
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:45,337
Is it true that there is a curse of the pharaohs?

33
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,743
That’s a difficult question.

34
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,740
They say many people who
have disturbed the graves of kings

35
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:52,517
have been cursed.

36
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:56,955
But then pyramids were not always graves.

37
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:58,152
Eh?

38
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:00,219
There was one king in Egypt

39
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,993
who was said to have made
at least five pyramids.

40
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:05,295
Five?

41
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,361
Strange isn’t it,

42
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,528
to have five graves?

43
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,097
But then there are many pyramids
with people in them.

44
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,102
What were they made for?

45
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,305
You seem to like this sort of subject.

46
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:18,537
Yes.

47
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,137
If you are interested come over
to our house sometime.

48
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,817
I have even more interesting examples.

49
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,044
May I?

50
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:26,009
Of course.

51
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,655
Kinomoto’s dad really is great.

52
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:34,822
Kinomoto? Kinomoto?

53
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,456
Didn’t you notice by the name?

54
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:39,365
He is Sakura-chan’s dad.

55
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:49,341
What is that for?

56
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:57,916
I wonder if today’s talk was
a little difficult?

57
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,910
No, it was really interesting
and easy to understand.

58
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:03,185
That’s good.

59
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,483
What do you want to eat today?

60
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,226
Wasn’t it my brother’s turn to cook?

61
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:12,658
Touya says he has a test tomorrow.

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,167
So I’m doing it for him.

63
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,126
I see, well then…

64
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,606
Break is over already?

65
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,243
Breaks always seem to go by quickly.

66
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,042
Well, hurry up.

67
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:28,879
Yeah.

68
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:42,822
What is Sakura doing out at this hour?

69
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:45,788
This is the time when good kids
should be in bed.

70
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:47,329
All right!

71
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:58,610
Good luck on your test.

72
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,180
Umm, please take this.

73
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:08,852
What is it?

74
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,487
Sakura-chan.

75
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,556
A meat bun.

76
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,590
Ah dinner? Thank you.

77
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:18,896
Yuki, you’re hungry right?

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,960
Thank you, Sakura-chan.

79
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,526
It’s late, so go to sleep.

80
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,529
Good night.

81
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,805
Good night.

82
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,611
All I said was meat bun.

83
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,469
Hurry and go to sleep,
I am turning out the light.

84
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:34,472
Well then,

85
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,473
good night.

86
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,239
Good night.

87
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,253
Tomorrow is the last part,

88
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,981
it was a long journey.

89
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,084
But Yukito-san is next door.

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,925
I feel all excited.

91
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,297
Kero-chan,

92
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,758
you started that game today didn’t you?

93
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,332
I actually planned on finishing
it in one day.

94
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:00,036
Your eyes will go bad.

95
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:29,695
Why is it ringing this late at night?
Where’s that bell?

96
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:31,837
Isn’t that the clock tower

97
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,267
at Sakura’s school?

98
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,242
You can really hear it.

99
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,872
Would it usually go off at this hour?

100
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:46,245
I’m sure that bell shouldn’t ring
after five in the evening.

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,017
Aren’t you mad?

102
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:52,490
But, that clock has never broke before.

103
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:05,839
I’ll be late!

104
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,197
You weren’t able to sleep well since then, huh?

105
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,840
Time to finish

106
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:13,136
my long journey.

107
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:15,176
I’m going.

108
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:20,877
Be sure to study well. Well then.

109
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,755
The data is gone!

110
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,132
How do you think you will do?

111
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:37,102
It’s hard to do this high pitched part.

112
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:40,332
I’m sure you’ll do fine.

113
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:41,602
I wonder.

114
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:42,835
Of course.

115
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,144
I haven’t practiced enough.

116
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,604
Relax.

117
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,011
Yeah.

118
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,680
Let’s see… Next is Kinomoto-san.

119
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:54,543
Yes!

120
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:57,855
Sakura-chan.

121
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,295
It’s the next phrase.

122
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,625
Over here!

123
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,796
I made a weird sound.

124
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,128
The rest was very well done.

125
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,433
It’s because you told me to relax.

126
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:47,931
But your performance was wonderful.

127
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,205
I didn’t think it was the same song.

128
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,706
I should have practiced more.

129
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:55,974
Huh?

130
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:03,018
Li-kun is practicing
even though the test is over.

131
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,824
Perhaps it’s because
he didn’t do well on today’s test?

132
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:08,451
But, it’s dangerous
to do that while walking.

133
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,762
I wonder if Li-kun moved
from Hong Kong on his own.

134
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,760
Now that you mention it,
I have never heard him talk of his family.

135
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:17,898
Look out!

136
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:26,842
Splendid!

137
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,805
Amazing!

138
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,682
Li-kun, that was an amazing shot.

139
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,356
Cheers to both your tests being over.

140
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,858
Cheers!

141
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,255
Delicious!

142
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,032
It’s because you tried hard.

143
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,035
Hey, did your test go well?

144
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,405
So-so.

145
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:57,366
I can’t stand it. I messed up one note.

146
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,042
Are you sure it wasn’t just one note, right?

147
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,242
No!

148
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,517
It’s not embarrassing to make a mistake.

149
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,509
But, even though the test is over,

150
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,387
practice the parts you couldn’t do well.

151
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,749
Yeah.

152
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:25,769
I did it!

153
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,240
Today I will be sure to save it right.

154
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,872
Save. Save.

155
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,442
I did it!

156
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:40,447
Kero-chan did you hear that?

157
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,613
Wasn’t your recorder test over?

158
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,618
Yeah, but my dad told me

159
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,619
to practice the parts I couldn’t do well today.

160
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,895
That’s your father,

161
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,924
he says good things.

162
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,992
I’ll practice at school tomorrow too.

163
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,560
All right, tomorrow for sure
I will clear the last stage.

164
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,267
This can’t be!

165
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,065
I am sure I saved it yesterday.

166
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:36,374
You saw me right?

167
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,341
Really?

168
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,972
Let’s see, today is… I’ll be late!

169
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:41,314
I have to do it all again.

170
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:42,871
I’m going.

171
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,518
Why? Why? Why?

172
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,986
Let’s do our best
on the recorder test today.

173
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,337
How do you think you will do?

174
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,130
I practiced yesterday so…

175
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,940
Just what I would expect,
then you will be fine?

176
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,412
It’s the same as yesterday.

177
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:19,245
We had a recorder test yesterday, right?

178
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,685
I had a toast with my brother
and Dad at home

179
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,057
after finishing the test.

180
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,992
Sakura-chan are you getting nervous?

181
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:29,495
That’s not it.

182
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:33,923
Let’s see, next is Kinomoto-san.

183
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:34,958
Yes!

184
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,695
Sakura-chan.

185
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,694
That’s Sakura,

186
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,121
she always does well at the key time.

187
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,426
Is it a familiar feeling?

188
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,965
You go to a place for the first time,

189
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:15,136
but you get the feeling it isn’t the first.

190
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,373
Or when you talk to somebody

191
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,973
you feel you had the same
conversation before.

192
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:24,181
But my memory is very clear.

193
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,412
That kid over there…

194
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,879
It is the same after all.

195
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:32,086
Which means?

196
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,584
It’s the same as yesterday,

197
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:37,360
after this Li-kun is going to
kick in a soccer ball that flies at him.

198
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,460
Oh, he really did come.

199
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:45,069
Huh? He isn’t practicing the recorder.

200
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,036
Don’t you think it is strange?

201
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:51,340
We had a recorder test yesterday too right?

202
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:56,439
It seems like it is just you and me.

203
00:12:56,983 --> 00:13:00,077
The ones who have noticed that
we are repeating the same day as yesterday.

204
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,213
This is the work of a Clow Card.

205
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:05,747
Didn’t you feel it?

206
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,521
The aura of a Clow Card.

207
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:12,163
The card is over there.

208
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,164
Look out!

209
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,669
A little bit different from yesterday.

210
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,907
Li-kun that was an amazing shot.

211
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:44,923
It looks very good on you.

212
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,363
What is this?

213
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,033
I made it in the image of a fairy
that can fly in the night sky freely.

214
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,300
It’s impressive that you know
the location of the Clow Card.

215
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:58,842
That was…

216
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,873
The camera is ready.

217
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:02,645
Well then, let’s go.

218
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:16,994
I feel it,

219
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,298
this is the aura of a Clow Card.

220
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:32,072
Huh?

221
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,941
What?

222
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:45,886
I wonder what happened?

223
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:52,854
It’s the card of time.

224
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,348
Kero-chan, this is…

225
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,546
It’s Time.

226
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:12,543
Time?

227
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,179
The card of time.

228
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:16,485
It can freely control the flow of time.

229
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,922
The camera is ready.

230
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,427
People without magic power

231
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,263
can’t tell that time is being controlled.

232
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:26,763
Time

233
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,136
choses the biggest clock in town
and is playing with it.

234
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:34,134
So he’ll reverse a day again
like he did today?

235
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:37,566
He can only use the power to
reverse a day once per day.

236
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,478
And he can only use it at 12:00 midnight.

237
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:41,375
Twelve o’clock?

238
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,384
What if it hits twelve

239
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,377
and Time reverses the day again, like today?

240
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:51,952
We have to live through the same day again.

241
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,222
Another recorder test?

242
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,222
My battle will go again? Hurry and seal it!

243
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,333
But what if time is stopped again?

244
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:02,729
I have to hurry!

245
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,571
What is that?

246
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,877
Oh no! This time he has sped up time
just for the clock tower.

247
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,204
Oh!

248
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:36,936
I looks very good on you.

249
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,265
You did it on a fairy image right?

250
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,630
That’s right!

251
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,565
I am so happy you understand.

252
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:48,038
It really is tiring to repeat
the same day three times.

253
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,507
When can I go to the last stage?

254
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,687
Really, I have taken that recorder
test three times now.

255
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,319
Why do we have to go through
the same time again?

256
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,882
Isn’t it better to get out sooner?

257
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:01,851
But Dad, and my brother

258
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,230
had a toast after finishing the test,

259
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,791
and then reviewing for the test…

260
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,860
What are you doing?

261
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,992
Li-kun, is your face OK?

262
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,333
It hit him right as he turned around.

263
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,740
But the ball did go into the goal.

264
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,172
It was splendid.

265
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,668
Time is unified with the clock tower.

266
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,377
If you break the clock tower
with some attack magic.

267
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,114
It will return to a card won’t it?

268
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,209
You mustn’t do that.

269
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:26,576
Why?

270
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,682
Everybody in town relies on that clock.

271
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,723
I can’t break it.

272
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:35,119
Then are you satisfied to leave
the card like this?

273
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,625
Well, I can’t leave it alone…

274
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,131
But we can’t break the clock.

275
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,262
If you won’t break it

276
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,264
then we have to get close
without being noticed.

277
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:48,633
Oh!

278
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:51,740
He is in the clock tower.

279
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,777
He can see you easily

280
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:54,807
if you fly in using magic.

281
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,109
Oh!

282
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
No mistake, he is above here.

283
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:37,586
Return to your rightful…

284
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,483
Did you not make it in time?

285
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:41,586
Is it no good?

286
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:43,453
Look out!

287
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,590
Li-kun!

288
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:47,297
You

289
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,931
Hurry and use the Shield card.

290
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,274
Shield,

291
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:00,112
protect me from the time’s power.

292
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,647
Shield!

293
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:14,652
You did it!

294
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,517
All right!

295
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,261
The card’s power can’t pass into Shield.

296
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:21,895
He’s running.

297
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,502
Come forth impact!

298
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:42,552
You prepared for it?

299
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,554
Sakura, hurry!

300
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,085
Return to your rightful form,

301
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:51,063
Clow Card!

302
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,372
Why?

303
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:07,709
The card becomes the property of the one
who returned it to normal.

304
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,307
I sealed it.

305
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,513
The one who sealed Time’s power is him.

306
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:15,284
It’s hard to accept, but the Time card
belongs to him.

307
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:17,878
It can’t be.

308
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,165
Good morning.

309
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:29,596
Now time will flow normally from today on.

310
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:33,505
That’s right. Although I never noticed.

311
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,799
Sakura-chan, what is the recorder for?

312
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,676
Wasn’t today the recorder test?

313
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,174
That was yesterday.

314
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:45,545
We have a sketching test
starting from the first hour today.

315
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,686
I forgot what day it was!
