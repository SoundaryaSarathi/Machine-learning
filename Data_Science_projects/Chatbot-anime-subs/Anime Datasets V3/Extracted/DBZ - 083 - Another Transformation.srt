"Fear Me!! Freeza Does Battle With a
Third Transformation"

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,330
What?

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,770
DIE!!

4
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,500
G- Gohan!

5
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,740
Full power!

6
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,140
Hang in there, Gohan!

7
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,910
Thank you, Piccolo-san!

8
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,260
Quite strange. That little one should not
have such a battle power.

9
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,030
After recovering from near-death,
it is as if he is a different person altogether.

10
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,970
That's it! The little one is a Saiyan!

11
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,130
But whose child is he? Twenty years ago, with
the exception of Vegeta, Nappa and Raditz,

12
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,900
the Saiyans were supposed to have been
exterminated.

13
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,640
So whose is he?

14
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,020
He doesn't look like either Vegeta or Nappa...

15
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,060
So he's Raditz's child? There is something
there that reminds me of him.

16
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,870
T- That blast that just got bounced back...

17
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,310
You've gotten stronger, Gohan. I'm so glad.

18
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,680
But it was no use. I put everything I had into that,
and it still didn't connect against Freeza!

19
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,290
That brat...

20
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,150
He is indisputably drawing closer to
becoming a Super Saiyan.

21
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,990
You!

22
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,970
You must have figured it out!
After coming one step away from death,

23
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,900
when we Saiyans recover, our
strength increases!

24
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,740
Now listen! Before Freeza makes his final
transformation, you must render me half-dead!

25
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,420
Well? Do it now!

26
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,050
The blood of the Saiyans must be
completely cut off.

27
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,270
Not because I believe in ridiculous legends, such as
the Super Saiyan, history's greatest warrior,

28
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,830
but because I do not feel well with
them around.

29
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,270
It is the principle of it all, with the little
one and Vegeta growing stronger so quickly.

30
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,670
If I injure myself, there will be no
effect! You must do it!

31
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,940
B- But my power isn't enough to
bring you to near-death!

32
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,610
Don't worry. I'll lower my battle power as
low as it will go. Your power will be enough.

33
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,790
We're just lucky that Namekian kid down
there can heal people instantaneously.

34
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,120
No matter how much I may hate you,
how can I?

35
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,030
Besides which, it's just about time for Goku
to recover.

36
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,100
Kakarrot is a lowest-class warrior! He won't
get any stronger than that!

37
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,970
Very well.

38
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,990
It would be a simple matter to blow
you all to pieces in this current form,

39
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,650
but before I kill you, I will have you witness the terror
of an ultimate power, even more frightening than death!

40
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,990
Ultimate... what now?

41
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,790
H- How can it be?

42
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,940
I do you a great service! You will experience
a terror even greater than that of Hell's.

43
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,830
And so, gaze upon my final transformation!

44
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,070
My true form!

45
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,010
You rotten...

46
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,980
P- Piccolo-san!

47
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,750
If you do it now, there's still time. Hurry!

48
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,260
What!? What's wrong with this planet?

49
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,110
It's all over! I'm going to die here!

50
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,500
If I'd known Son-kun was coming, I could have
left searching for the Dragonballs up to him!

51
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,070
Gohan-kun is a fool! Kuririn is an idiot!
I hate you, Son-kun!

52
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,240
Freeza's Ki is rising again. Am I going
to get out of here in time?

53
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Hurry up! This is the only way!

54
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,580
It can't be...

55
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,600
Dammit!

56
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,600
There's no other choice!

57
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,340
That's not good enough! You have to
shoot a stronger Ki!

58
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,050
Can't you even do that, you
good-for-nothing fool!?

59
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,950
T- That's good...

60
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,610
I'm at last going to become... a Super Saiyan...

61
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,290
W- Why did Kuririn-san shoot Vegeta?

62
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,010
G- Gohan! Get out of here!

63
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,900
Right!

64
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,050
Are you okay, Piccolo-san?

65
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
I can't say that I am...

66
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,610
I know! It's all right, we can heal those injuries!
There's a Namekian named Dende that can heal injuries!

67
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,610
I'll go get him.

68
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,880
Gohan!

69
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,080
Kuririn-san, where's Dende?

70
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,170
What!? You say you can't heal me?

71
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,890
T- That's right!

72
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,840
You're saying you could heal the
others, but not me?

73
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,310
You killed many of my friends as well!
I cannot heal someone like that!

74
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,480
Y- You brat! So long as you don't
heal me, Freeza will not be beaten!

75
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,850
I won't!

76
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,530
H- Hurry up... I'm starting to
lose consciousness...

77
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,500
I... I... I...

78
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm going to save the other one.

79
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,540
Damn...

80
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,230
You... brat...

81
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Vegeta and the other Saiyans gain a whole lot
of strength once revived from near death.

82
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,460
You knew that, didn't you?

83
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,560
Y- Yeah.

84
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,640
And so, he had me blast him on purpose.
It sounded like he was sure he could beat Freeza!

85
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,340
So that was why?

86
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Dende!

87
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,910
Dende!

88
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,910
Vegeta!

89
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,840
They said... you can heal injuries. Is that true?

90
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,260
Y- Yes!

91
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,210
Dende...

92
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,570
I see, so that's it!

93
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,070
Unbelievable! Do I have the same ability?

94
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,360
No. You, like Nail-san, are a warrior-type.

95
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,530
More importantly, Dende, I know how
you feel, not wanting to heal Vegeta.

96
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,690
For now, without him, there isn't anything
we can do!

97
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,190
He...

98
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,430
He's just like Freeza! He's also killed
so many Namekians!

99
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,550
Go heal him for me.

100
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,920
I can beat Vegeta now, but I can't
possibly beat Freeza.

101
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,900
What now? Freeza is...

102
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,570
He's finishing his transformation!

103
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,050
Ah, hell. All this time, we should have
masked our Ki and hidden somewhere.

104
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,250
If we had done something like that, he would just
blow us away, planet Namek and all!

105
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,930
He doesn't have any more use for this planet!

106
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,540
T- That is one impossibly huge Ki.

107
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,520
T- The incredible beast is about to appear!

108
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,320
Dende, please! Heal Vegeta!

109
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,900
Dende...

110
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,910
We can see him now!

111
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,620
You little turd!

112
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,970
You just be grateful that I didn't kill
you right here!

113
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,240
So that's Freeza's battle power?

114
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,890
Looks like he's revealed his true self.

115
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,090
Freeza, or anyone else, bring it on!

116
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,290
I have now become a Super Saiyan!

117
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,870
So this is Freeza? Such an incredible Ki!

118
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,910
At last, Freeza completes his
third transformation.

119
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,620
Is there any hope left for Gohan
and the others?

120
