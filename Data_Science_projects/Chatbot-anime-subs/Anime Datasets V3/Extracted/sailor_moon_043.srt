1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:04,597
Let's see... My dear Dark Kingdom,

2
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:06,299
as of today, I, Sailor Moon

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,968
have decided to quit being
a sailor warrior.

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,869
Please let me join your organization.
Sincerely.

5
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:14,006
Hey, Sailor Mars!

6
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,406
Thanks so much for picking
on me all this time!

7
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,603
In the name of the moon,
I'm gonna punish you!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

9
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

10
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,687
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

11
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

12
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

13
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

14
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

15
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

16
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

17
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:05,224
Sailor Moon, prepare yourself!

18
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,380
It's time to give up, Sailor Moon!

19
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,870
No way!

20
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:23,650
Really?

21
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,242
Then, we have no choice.

22
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,753
Good-bye, you dummy.

23
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,789
Sailor Moon,

24
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:36,129
in the name of Mars,
I will chastise you!

25
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,256
Fire

26
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,333
Soul!

27
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:45,701
Ouch!

28
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,907
Oops!

29
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,239
Ouch!

30
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:02,379
Is Usagi Going It Alone?
The Sailor Warriors Get Into a Big Fight

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,573
Yet another abnormal energy reaction.

32
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,075
For the last several days,

33
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,805
a similar energy reaction
has been detected.

34
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:29,516
Perhaps some change is coming
over the Silver Crystal.

35
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:30,850
What?

36
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,952
He should be done investigating
about now.

37
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,288
Monster Oniwa Bandana,
are you there?

38
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,255
Yes!

39
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,882
Oniwaw Bandana is here.

40
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,352
Did you find the origin of
the abnormal energy?

41
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:45,125
Banban.

42
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,296
Pardon.

43
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:51,804
This is?

44
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:52,998
Banban.

45
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:57,677
As we expected,

46
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:00,580
the abnormal energy is coming
from the sailor warriors.

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,482
Not only that, but it is because

48
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,084
Sailor Moon is fighting with
the other warriors.

49
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,486
Banban.

50
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:10,013
Unbelievable!
Sailor Moon and the other warriors?

51
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:14,584
Is this infighting? Or a trap?

52
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:17,487
What do you think, Kunzite?

53
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,934
Please give me some time.

54
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,231
Very well.

55
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,003
Continue investigating!

56
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,732
Certainly. Banban.

57
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,131
Jewelry

58
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:33,805
Banban.

59
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:36,081
Who are you?!

60
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,552
A burglar!

61
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:42,214
I am taking the jewelry! Banban!

62
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:49,996
Mom!

63
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,224
Banban!

64
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,567
Hold it right there!

65
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,932
Sailor Moon!

66
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:02,006
I'm a sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

67
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:03,700
Banban.

68
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:05,411
In the name of the moon...

69
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,469
Hey!
In the name of the moon...

70
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,010
What are you doing?!

71
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:14,120
Quit acting cool all by yourself!

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,322
You messed up my pretty face!

73
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,224
I think you actually look
better than before.

74
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,059
What did you say?!

75
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,527
Why did you come here?

76
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,121
You're an eyesore!

77
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,634
I'm the one who first
got wind of this case!

78
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:30,103
You were probably
eavesdropping on us.

79
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,105
Don't talk about me like
I'm some thief!

80
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:33,640
Oh, I've heard just about enough!

81
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,208
You are in our way!

82
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,643
Look who's talking!

83
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,276
Sailor Moon my butt!

84
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:38,578
What's going on?
Sailor Moon my butt!

85
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,846
Shut up!
You're always clumsy and
making mistakes,

86
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:40,613
You're always clumsy and
making mistakes,

87
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,115
always nothing but useless!

88
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:43,776
On top of that, you've got this
long dragging hair!

89
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,186
Aren't you just ashamed of yourself?!
Honestly!

90
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:51,318
What?!

91
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,560
Sailor warriors in a big fight
at the site of an incident!

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,827
Oh! Hey! Wait!
Sailor warriors in a big fight
at the site of an incident!

93
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,129
Oh! Hey! Wait!
This is a huge scoop!

94
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:56,396
Who are you?!
This is a huge scoop!

95
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,624
Who are you?!

96
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,397
I'm a freelance reporter for
the weekly, "Surprise."

97
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,664
That's enough already!

98
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,639
The weekly, "Surprise", is that
notorious tabloid magazine

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,767
that writes about anything,
whether it's true or not!

100
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:13,806
Something like that.
So, how did the fight start?

101
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:19,786
The thing is, the thing is,
that was just a joke!

102
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:21,654
There's no way the sailor
warriors of justice

103
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:23,485
would be fighting among
themselves, right?!

104
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:25,924
Isn't that right?

105
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:30,630
There's something weird going on!
Oh, I know!

106
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,190
It's because Sailor Moon keeps
messing up, isn't it?!

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,435
Or are you fighting over a boyfriend?

108
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:35,935
This is ridiculous!
Or are you fighting over a boyfriend?

109
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:36,936
This is ridiculous!
Let's go home!

110
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:40,540
Oh, wait! You can tell me!

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,908
I can't believe this.

112
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,170
Come on!

113
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:45,178
What was with that?

114
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:46,212
Excuse me...
What was with that?

115
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:46,701
Excuse me...

116
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,384
That's right! Where's the monster?!

117
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,753
I think she left during that commotion.

118
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:54,654
Oh...

119
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:55,955
Excuse me...

120
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,223
Yes?

121
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,554
Could you help us?

122
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,888
Sorry about that!

123
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:11,437
So, the burglar got away, too.

124
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,472
Oh, really?

125
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:14,340
It was just weird.

126
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,608
What was?

127
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:19,100
It seems Sailor Moon and the
other warriors are fighting.

128
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,750
No way! I don't know about
the other warriors,

129
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,486
but Sailor Moon is cute and sweet!

130
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:28,321
There's no way she'd have
a fight with them.

131
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:29,913
You think so?

132
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,858
Of course!

133
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,059
Say...

134
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,160
Oh?! You're from yesterday's...

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,694
Tell me more about what you
were just talking about!
Oh?! You're from yesterday's...

136
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:36,496
Tell me more about what you
were just talking about!

137
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,157
Oh, shoot.

138
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:41,134
Oh, that's right, I should
introduce myself.

139
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,437
My name is Nana Asahina and
I'm a freelance reporter!

140
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,961
Nice meet you!

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,711
So, you guys seem pretty close
to Sailor Moon.

142
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,845
What?

143
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,981
Just a little...

144
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:58,017
Why wouldn't Sailor Moon
be having a fight?

145
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,919
Do you have any basis
for believing that?

146
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,216
Naru!

147
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:06,092
I hear you've been saved by
Sailor Moon many times!

148
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,560
Usagi...

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,363
Did you talk to Sailor Moon
about anything last night?

150
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,832
Did she say any nasty things
about the other warriors?

151
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:14,534
I'm in a hurry, so...

152
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:18,171
Wait up, Usagi! Hey, that wasn't fair!

153
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,038
If something happens,
just give me a call!

154
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,639
She's way too persistent!

155
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,225
What's the square root of two?!

156
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:57,910
That hurt! Mars kicked me for real!

157
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,107
If we don't do this seriously,
it won't be good practice!

158
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:06,018
But... But that kick was full of hatred!

159
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:07,246
What?!

160
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,481
Mars, I hope you're not...

161
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,860
What are you looking
at me like that for?!

162
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,363
Besides, you're the one who
came up with this plan!

163
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,332
It's pitiful of you to start whining now!

164
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm not whining!

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,337
Tuxedo Mask is being held captive
by the Dark Kingdom

166
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:26,703
and I'm going to save him,
no matter what!

167
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:27,974
And to do that,

168
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,603
we have to look like we're seriously
fighting each other!

169
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:35,181
But the butt you kicked with
all your strength hurts!

170
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,382
That's enough!

171
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,985
Listen to me! If we don't fight
like we really mean it,

172
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:43,189
they'll never take you, their enemy,
to their hideout!

173
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,157
I know that.

174
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,926
Mars is right.

175
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,328
We don't really want to do
anything this dangerous,

176
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:52,491
but we're doing it because
you insisted.

177
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,563
Yes, yes, I know.

178
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,538
Hey, Artemis, did you find out anything

179
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,842
about the gossip reporter who
showed up at the jewelry shop?

180
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,044
Well, there's something
suspicious about her.

181
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:06,045
What?!

182
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,580
I knew it!

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,547
Sailor Moon Breaking Up?
They're Fighting!
D'oh!

184
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,715
Sailor Moon Breaking Up?
They're Fighting!
It's already out?!

185
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:11,817
Sailor Moon Breaking Up?
They're Fighting!
Sailor Moon Showed Up in Harumi
Oh, no! I look funny in that picture!

186
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,853
Sailor Moon Breaking Up?
They're Fighting!
Sailor Moon Showed Up in Harumi
Oh, come on, that's how
you always look.

187
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,422
What did you say?!

188
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:17,855
Stop it!

189
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:22,157
She's a freelance reporter who
suddenly became popular recently.

190
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,864
Politics, economics, entertainment...

191
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,266
She's getting huge scoops
in every field!

192
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,568
There's no way she's a normal person!

193
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,871
Maybe she's been turned
into a monster?

194
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:32,672
I think so, too.

195
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:33,339
All right!
I think so, too.

196
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:33,964
All right!

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,476
If a monster's approaching us,

198
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:41,280
that means my strategy
was a success!

199
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,339
It could just be a coincidence...

200
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,253
Anyway, we better start the
final stage of our plan, then!

201
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:47,987
Yeah!
Anyway, we better start the
final stage of our plan, then!

202
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:48,454
Yeah!
Usagi, this is going to be
pretty dangerous.

203
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,356
Usagi, this is going to be
pretty dangerous.

204
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:51,791
Are you going to be okay?

205
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,226
Huh? Probably...

206
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:55,594
There's nothing to worry about!

207
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:58,085
We'll be right there,
watching over you!

208
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:00,132
Do you want me to take your place?

209
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:01,500
So, that's the truth of it.

210
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,435
What?

211
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,437
Your plan was to give me a hard time,

212
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:07,239
and then try to become
the leader, wasn't it?!

213
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,365
What?!

214
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:10,943
Usagi, you're thinking too much.

215
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:14,447
Because Rei never goes easy on me.

216
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:16,415
SOMEONE's just too clumsy!

217
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,007
What did you say?!

218
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:26,058
You're nasty! Don't spit on me!

219
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,860
It's turned into a real fight.
You're nasty! Don't spit on me!

220
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,394
It's turned into a real fight.
Yuck! Quit it!

221
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,656
Yuck! Quit it!

222
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:31,697
Freelance Reporter
Nana Asahina

223
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,066
Freelance Reporter
Nana Asahina
Let's see... Is it around here?

224
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,124
Let's see... Is it around here?

225
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:38,037
Oh, here it is!

226
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,698
Wow!

227
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,074
This is a pretty nice condo!

228
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:44,810
It must be nice to live in
a place like this!

229
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,313
This is no time to be getting
carried away, Usagi!

230
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:49,148
She could be a monster!

231
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:50,945
Oh, I almost forgot.

232
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:53,108
V!

233
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:58,758
Welcome!

234
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:02,928
Well, Sailor Moon asked me to
deliver this to you.

235
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:04,589
It's from Sailor Moon?

236
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:12,465
"I want to quit being a sailor warrior
of love and justice."

237
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,809
"I don't want to fight with those
other warriors anymore."

238
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,911
"I want to make a
shocking confession,"

239
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:22,847
"so I will be waiting at the Juban
Cemetery at 11 pm tonight."

240
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,819
But why did this come to you?

241
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:28,354
I have no idea.

242
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:32,518
People often say that I look
dependable, so...

243
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,756
You big fat liar.

244
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,533
Thank you! I can write another
huge scoop with this!

245
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,330
I'm so glad!

246
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:10,964
Monster Oniwa Bandana,
are you there?

247
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,192
Banban.

248
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,728
How are things coming along?

249
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,809
I see.

250
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,845
It seems there is no doubt
that Sailor Moon

251
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,047
is being isolated by the other warriors.

252
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,115
Banban.

253
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,743
Looks like it is time for me
to go out there.

254
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:42,722
It's time.

255
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,670
Thank you for the letter.

256
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,812
When did you...

257
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,680
Is it true that you're going to split

258
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,616
from the rest of the sailor warriors?

259
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:05,449
Of course! I don't even want
to see their faces anymore!

260
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,021
Really?

261
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,756
That's right!

262
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:11,658
Really, really?

263
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:14,661
Really, really! I've already
made up my mind!

264
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:15,923
I see...

265
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,424
In that case...

266
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:24,933
Ban, ban, ban, ban,
ban, bababa, ban!

267
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,596
You're a monster!

268
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,509
Master Kunzite!

269
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,843
What?!
Master Kunzite!

270
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:30,571
What?!

271
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:35,782
Kunzite?! I never made an
appointment to see you!

272
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,884
I'm supposed to be interviewed now!

273
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:40,520
Baban! There will be
no more interview!

274
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,255
What?! Really?!

275
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:45,659
It seems you have been isolated
from the other warriors...

276
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,794
How about it? If you join our side,

277
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,762
you will be able to see Endymion
anytime you want.

278
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,699
Don't be ridiculous!

279
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,033
I'm a sailor warrior for love
and justice, okay?!

280
00:14:57,504 --> 00:15:01,441
Endymion cannot move right now,
due to certain circumstances.

281
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,677
What?! Is he sick?!

282
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,167
Well, I wouldn't know.

283
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,575
But I am sure he will be happy
if you come see him.

284
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,978
Perhaps asking you to join us
is too much to ask.

285
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:18,258
Then, how about just coming
to see Endymion?

286
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:19,392
You'll take me to see him?

287
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:22,128
Of course, but on one condition.

288
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,527
A condition?

289
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,467
Hand over the Silver Crystal.

290
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,695
What?

291
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:32,863
If you miss this chance, you will
never see Endymion again.

292
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:37,773
Tuxedo Mask must be sick.
What should I do?

293
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,013
What is your answer?! Banban.

294
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,674
Well...

295
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,650
Will you hand it over?

296
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,882
Okay! But only after
I see Tuxedo Mask!

297
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,491
It looks like they fell for it.

298
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,694
Master Kunzite.

299
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,033
Damn. So, it was a trap, after all.

300
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:03,003
Come on, now that it's been
decided, let's go!

301
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,370
I don't care about Sailor Mars
and the rest anymore!

302
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,842
That is a good attitude to have.

303
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:19,119
What is this?!

304
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:19,919
An entrance leading to
the Dark Kingdom.
What is this?!

305
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,511
An entrance leading to
the Dark Kingdom.

306
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,082
What?!

307
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,662
It's kind of creepy.

308
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:29,763
Will you change your mind, then?

309
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:30,330
No, I'll go!
Will you change your mind, then?

310
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,531
No, I'll go!

311
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:35,335
I can't believe this!
He's as mean as Sailor Mars!

312
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,971
Why does she always keep
bringing up my name?!

313
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:38,571
Now, now.
Why does she always keep
bringing up my name?!

314
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:39,506
Now, now.

315
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:42,407
Tuxedo Mask, I'm coming!

316
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,110
Baban!

317
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,578
Now, hand over the
Silver Crystal. Banban.

318
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:00,153
Not until after I see Tuxedo Mask!

319
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:04,898
Still saying that even now!
Then you will die right here!

320
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,535
We will look for the Silver Crystal
afterwards. Banban.

321
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,671
I don't have the Silver Crystal with me!

322
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,073
What?!

323
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,507
Sailor Moon is...

324
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:15,108
Let's go!

325
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:15,809
Wait!
Let's go!

326
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,242
Wait!

327
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:19,700
If we go now, everything
will be ruined!

328
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:23,083
Fool! Once I kill you,

329
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,885
there will be nobody left who can
use the Silver Crystal.

330
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,446
You dug your own grave, Sailor Moon!

331
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,291
Damn!

332
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,781
Everyone, just be patient!

333
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,863
I get it. They're testing to see

334
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,766
if Sailor Mars and the rest
will come to rescue me.

335
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,234
Everyone, please don't come.

336
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:44,362
No matter what happens,
you can't come!

337
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:47,707
We go now!

338
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:48,141
Okay.
We go now!

339
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,005
Okay.

340
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,377
We can't!

341
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:50,944
Are you still saying that?!
We can't!

342
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,412
Are you still saying that?!

343
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:53,680
Out of my way!

344
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,016
Mars, you actually really hate
Sailor Moon, don't you?!

345
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,244
Jupiter...

346
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,286
That's...

347
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:01,788
If I hated her,

348
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,188
I wouldn't be watching something
this important for her!

349
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:07,694
Sailor Mars feels the same
as we all do.

350
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:10,162
Mars, I'm sorry.

351
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,737
Die!

352
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,068
Sailor Moon!

353
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:23,071
Everyone, don't come!

354
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,750
I can't let them do this anymore!

355
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,220
Man, she's so arbitrary.

356
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,995
Stop right there!

357
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,189
Baban?

358
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,988
Sailor Mars!

359
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,801
Sailor Mercury!

360
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,834
Sailor Jupiter!

361
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,805
Sailor Venus!

362
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,680
That's the end of our charade!

363
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,147
Prepare yourselves!

364
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,143
Everyone!

365
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:09,045
Fools! I had seen through your
monkey business long before!

366
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:13,960
Anyway, release Sailor Moon!

367
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,261
I'm angry now!

368
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:18,025
Fire

369
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,700
Soul!

370
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,894
Baban!

371
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,539
Supreme

372
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,572
Crescent

373
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,077
Thunder!

374
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:37,140
Beam!

375
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,226
If you want to trick me,

376
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,889
you should study acting a little more!

377
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,824
Baban!

378
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,463
It is time for you to die!

379
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:58,269
Ban! Baban!

380
00:19:58,538 --> 00:19:59,835
Sailor Moon!

381
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,699
Die!

382
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,735
What?!

383
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,617
You better just give up!

384
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,050
Why you!

385
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:16,147
Ban, ban, ban, ban,
ban, ban, ban, ban!

386
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:21,294
We will chop you to pieces! Banban!

387
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,629
Not so fast!

388
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,756
Bubble

389
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:30,769
Spray!

390
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,073
What is this?!

391
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:36,643
I pulled all-nighters to come up
with this plan

392
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:38,678
and you saw through it that easily?!

393
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:41,981
That's outrageous!
Rhododendrons are beautiful!

394
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:43,383
What are you talking about?!

395
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:47,342
Anyway, in the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

396
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:49,355
Impudence!

397
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:50,557
Shut up!

398
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,718
Fire

399
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,721
Soul!

400
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,060
Ouch! That is hot, hot, hot!

401
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,124
Now, for the finish!

402
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:14,641
Moon Healing Escalation!

403
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,350
Refresh!

404
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,026
We did it!

405
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:28,161
Yeah!

406
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,830
Hey, why did you guys show up?

407
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,865
I was doing perfectly fine on my own!

408
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,735
Because you were crying
like a little baby!

409
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:38,071
When was I crying like a little baby?!

410
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,370
Today, at 11 o'clock, 16 minutes,
and 28 seconds!

411
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,004
The way you say it is mean!

412
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,553
I don't know how they keep this up.

413
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,453
Won't someone please stop them?

414
00:21:56,522 --> 00:22:00,460
Hey, I heard rumors that the sailor
warriors were breaking up!

415
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,295
Is it true? So, how about it?

416
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:02,729
I'm sick of this!
Is it true? So, how about it?

417
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,718
I'm sick of this!

418
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:15,464
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

419
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:19,079
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

420
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:26,815
It's a world no one knows about

421
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,718
With white shoes clicking

422
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:34,528
Cross the white moon bridge

423
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:42,594
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

424
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:49,238
Offer a prayer to the moon

425
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:58,012
It will surely bring you happiness

426
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:05,186
Go round and round,
the moon's merry-go-round

427
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:13,496
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

428
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:21,041
She's always watching over us

429
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:27,537
Moon, moon princess
