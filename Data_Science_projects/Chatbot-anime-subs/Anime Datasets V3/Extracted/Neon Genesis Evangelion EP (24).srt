1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:34,582
Momma! Momma! They chose me!

23
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:38,842
I'm an elite pilot! I'll defend
Mankind as the best in the world!

24
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:43,812
I have to keep it a secret, so
I'll only tell you, Momma!

25
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:48,822
Everyone's being so nice to me,
I won't feel so lonely anymore!

26
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:53,452
I'm okay now, even without Papa.

27
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,702
So, look! Look at me!

28
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,962
Momma!

29
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,482
Synch ratio zero.

30
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:12,052
I can't be the Second
Child anymore.

31
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,282
I have no reason left to live.

32
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,192
Nobody cares about me anymore.

33
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:19,622
My papa, my momma,
nobody cares.

34
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,022
I have no reason left to live.

35
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:32,962
Are you Asuka Langley Sohryu?

36
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,712
The Second Intelligence
Division reports

37
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:38,472
that they have taken the Second
Child into custody.

38
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:41,842
Really? It isn't like them to lose
her in the first place,

39
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,512
and then to take seven
days to find her.

40
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,352
They must have done
so intentionally.

41
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:48,052
They're trying to make trouble
for us, aren't they?

42
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,542
It could be.

43
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:53,422
The Fifth Child arrives to
replace Asuka today.

44
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:55,222
This whole thing is just
too convenient.

45
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,302
Rei Ayanami...

46
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,842
There's a feeling about her.

47
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,132
Almost like my mother...

48
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:13,002
Rei Ayanami and my mother...

49
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,342
What are you doing with
them, Father?

50
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:19,902
Commander Ikari...

51
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:24,582
Did you know my cat died? The cat
my grandmother was caring for?

52
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:28,522
I hadn't taken care of it
for a long time,

53
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,462
but now I know that I'll
never see it again.

54
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:34,432
Why did you destroy the
dummy system?

55
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,562
It wasn't the dummy system
that I destroyed. It was Rei.

56
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:42,512
I'll ask you once more.
Why did you do it?

57
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:45,682
I'm not happy anymore, not even
when you make love to me.

58
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:47,912
Go ahead and do whatever
you want with my body,

59
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,182
it's never stopped you before!

60
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,112
You disappoint me.

61
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,422
Disappoint?!

62
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:55,222
You had no hopes or expectations
of me to start with!

63
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:58,582
I was nothing! I am nothing!
Nothing!

64
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,992
What can I do now, Mother?

65
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,662
Asuka, where have you
disappeared to?

66
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,302
But what could I talk to her about?

67
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,202
Could I talk about Ayanami
with her?

68
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:28,452
Toji, Kensuke... Their homes were
destroyed and now they've left.

69
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:34,082
Friends, I don't have anybody left
whom I could call my friend.

70
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,412
Nobody!

71
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:40,192
I can't go see Ayanami again. I
don't have the courage to face her.

72
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,952
I don't even know how to talk
or act around her now.

73
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:49,572
Asuka... Misato...
Mother... What do I do?

74
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,732
What can I do?

75
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,852
Singing is good.

76
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,832
Singing brings joy and
revitalizes the soul.

77
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,892
I think that Song is the greatest
achievement of the Lilim culture.

78
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,462
Don't you agree?

79
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:24,472
Shinji Ikari?

80
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,642
How do you know my name?

81
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,512
Everyone knows your name.

82
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:31,712
Not to be rude, but you're rather
ignorant of your own position.

83
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:35,222
Really? And you are?

84
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:40,062
I am Kaworu, Kaworu Nagisa. Like
you, I'm one of the chosen.

85
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,592
The Fifth Child.

86
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,992
You're the Fifth Child?! You...

87
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:45,762
Nagisa-kun...

88
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,362
Call me Kaworu, Ikari-kun.
Nagisa-kun...

89
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,102
Call me Kaworu, Ikari-kun.
<i> </i>

90
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:50,862
Oh no, you can call me Shinji.

91
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:57,262
The Fifth Child has just arrived.

92
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:01,242
Nagisa, Kaworu of the Seashore.
His records were erased,

93
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,752
just like Rei.

94
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,112
But one record remains.

95
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,552
He was born on the day
Second Impact occurred.

96
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:11,052
The Committee sent him directly
to us. There must be more to it.

97
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:14,792
The Marduk Report's file on the
Fifth Child was classified,

98
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,632
so I hacked into the Intelligence
Department's computer system.

99
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,562
I can't believe you did that!

100
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,222
It was worth doing.

101
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,892
I found out where Ritsuko is.

102
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,142
What do you want to do about
the Fifth Child's synch tests?

103
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:31,912
I don't have any tricks up
my sleeve this time.

104
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:33,402
Let's see what he can do.

105
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,112
Down another zero point three.

106
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,602
Yes, Sir.

107
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,782
Are these data readouts correct?

108
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:44,822
All testing systems are operating
correctly, Sir.

109
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,762
The MAGI confirm that there
are no data errors.

110
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,462
It's incredible that he can
synch with Unit 02

111
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:52,802
before we've even configured
the core. He's amazing.

112
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,802
But this isn't possible!

113
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:57,502
On this system it can't happen.

114
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,272
Nevertheless, it is happening.

115
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:02,762
We must accept that and begin
investigating why it's happening.

116
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,342
You're the First Child, aren't you?

117
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,502
Rei Ayanami.

118
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,352
You're the same as I am.

119
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,542
Who are you?

120
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:22,162
The Fifth Child has made
contact with Rei.

121
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,362
I see.

122
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:24,932
The MAGI are currently analyzing

123
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:27,102
the nature of the Fifth and what
his powers may be.

124
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:30,302
We still don't know who
or what he is.

125
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,190
Who in the hell is this boy?

126
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,530
<i>Authorized Personnel ONLY</i>
<i>If you enter without my permission, you shall die!</i>
<i>Entry Forbidden!</i>

127
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:42,412
Shinji hasn't come back yet either.

128
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,072
I'm not deserving of his trust.

129
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:52,192
<i>Central Dogma is now open.</i>
<i>Please use Route 3 to transfer.</i>

130
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,492
Hi, you weren't waiting here
for me, were you?

131
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:58,232
No, well, not really
waiting anyway.

132
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,562
So, what are you doing?

133
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:04,522
Well, usually when the tests end,
I just take a shower and go home.

134
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:09,372
But I don't really want to go
home these days.

135
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:13,682
You have a home to return to and
that will lead you to happiness.

136
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:14,882
That's good.

137
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:16,112
You think so?

138
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,772
I'd like to talk some more.
May I come with you?

139
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,282
To the shower.
Aren't you going now?

140
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,962
Do you mind?

141
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:28,722
Oh, no, I don't mind.

142
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:38,732
You are extremely afraid
of first contact.

143
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,442
Are you that scared of affection?

144
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,872
If you don't get close to others,
you won't be betrayed,

145
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,112
and you won't hurt each other.

146
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:50,102
However, neither will you
forget what loneliness is.

147
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,422
Man can never make loneliness
disappear because man is alone,

148
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,392
but man can forget.

149
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:59,552
So man can find the will to live.

150
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:08,832
It's time.

151
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,402
Is this it?

152
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,772
Yeah. I have to go to bed.

153
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:13,472
With me?

154
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,272
No, you have your own room, I think.
With me?

155
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:18,212
No, you have your own room, I think.
<i> </i>

156
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,732
Right...

157
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:24,402
Man always has pain in his heart.

158
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,312
Since his heart feels pain,
he experiences life as pain.

159
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:34,322
You are delicate like glass.

160
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,122
Am I?

161
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:37,762
Yes, and that earns my sympathy.

162
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:39,192
Sympathy?

163
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,330
In other words, I love you.

164
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,498
The twenty-fourth episode

165
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,375
The final Angel

166
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:52,412
NERV was formed as SEELE's
executive branch.

167
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:56,212
It was created to carry out
our scenario.

168
00:09:56,212 --> 00:10:00,022
However, it has been taken
over by a selfish man.

169
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,022
Yes, it has. We must return
it to our control.

170
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:04,892
Before the Promised Day.

171
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:08,632
We must restore NERV and the Eva
series to their original purpose.

172
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:12,762
Ikari will answer to SEELE
for his malfeasance.

173
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,562
It will not be much longer.

174
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:21,472
The Lance of Longinus that was
hindering our wish is gone forever.

175
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,512
The last Angel should
appear soon,

176
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:26,952
and our wish will be attained
upon destroying that Angel.

177
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,112
Soon, very soon, Yui.

178
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,052
Why am I here?

179
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:36,482
Why am I still alive?

180
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,812
For what purpose?

181
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:41,052
For whose purpose?

182
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,432
The Fifth Child...

183
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:47,032
In what way are he and I alike?

184
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,232
Why?

185
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:59,142
I am glad this apartment is in the
suburbs. Thank God you're safe.

186
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:02,112
But there is no guarantee
this won't happen again.

187
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:06,252
So, the Horaki family will take
care of you starting tomorrow.

188
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,722
I won't be able to see you
for a while, Pen Pen.

189
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,732
I think I should sleep
on the floor.

190
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:22,762
No, I am staying at your place.
I should sleep down here.

191
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,372
What do you want to talk about?

192
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,102
You want me to listen
to you, don't you?

193
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:37,172
Many things have happened
since I came here.

194
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:43,982
I used to live with my teacher.
They were calm and boring days.

195
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,482
I was just living.

196
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,762
But I was fine with that!

197
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,892
There was really nothing
I had to do.

198
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,402
Do you hate people?

199
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:57,702
Not really, I don't care.

200
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,032
But I hate my dad.

201
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:04,232
Why did I tell Kaworu that?

202
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:10,412
I was probably born to meet you.

203
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:15,022
Did you get his data?

204
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:18,462
This is it. I got this from Ibuki
without her knowledge.

205
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:21,762
I'm sorry that I made you do this.

206
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,702
What's this?

207
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,832
No wonder Maya can't reveal this.
This is not theoretically possible!

208
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,302
You're right. The issue gets
even more mysterious.

209
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:36,212
How can he fix the synch ratio
at whatever point he wishes?

210
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:39,172
I have to take another chance.

211
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,152
What a surprise to see you here.

212
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,082
I have a question for you.

213
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,282
Our conversation is
monitored here.

214
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,722
I don't care.

215
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:50,852
What is the boy, the Fifth Child?

216
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,782
He is probably the last Angel.

217
00:12:56,232 --> 00:13:00,362
Well, let's go. Come, Adam's alter
ego and Lilith's minion.

218
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:09,142
Eva Unit 02 is activating!

219
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,212
That's impossible! Where's Asuka?

220
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,912
She's in room 303!
I've just confirmed it!

221
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:15,352
Then who the hell is piloting it?!

222
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:19,052
It is unmanned! There is no entry
plug inserted in Unit 02!

223
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,992
Unmanned? So, the Fifth
Child is not there?

224
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,962
AT Field detected in
Central Dogma!

225
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:26,722
Is it Unit 02?

226
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,462
No, the blood pattern is Blue!
It's definitely an Angel!
Is it Unit 02?

227
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:29,892
No, the blood pattern is Blue!
It's definitely an Angel!
<i> </i>

228
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,382
What the hell?!

229
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,362
That boy? An Angel?

230
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:39,302
<i>Target has passed the Fourth</i>
<i>Layer and is still descending.</i>

231
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,512
It's no good! We can't cut the
power to the linear carriage!

232
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:43,112
<i>Target has passed the Fifth Layer.</i>

233
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:46,542
Close all Central Dogma shutters!

234
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,142
Buy us some time!

235
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,422
<i>Closing all shutters immediately.</i>

236
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>All personnel evacuate.</i>
<i>All personnel evacuate.</i>

237
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:57,862
Unbelievable, SEELE itself
sent an Angel to us.

238
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:01,762
The old men want to advance
another step with our help.

239
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:06,972
The last Angel has invaded Central
Dogma. It is currently descending.

240
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,232
Just as we planned.

241
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:12,972
Ikari, you were our good friend,
our comrade and conspirator,

242
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:15,072
but this is your last job.

243
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:19,132
I expect that you will use Unit 01
to accomplish the mission.

244
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,622
Unit 02 has penetrated
the armored shutters!

245
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,892
Target has passed the
second wall.

246
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:28,952
Pursue it with Unit 01.

247
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:29,792
Yes, Sir!

248
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:30,462
Use any means to keep it from
invading Terminal Dogma.

249
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:34,412
Use any means to keep it from
invading Terminal Dogma.

250
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:40,132
But why did the Angel
take Unit 02?

251
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:43,072
Is it going to fuse with Unit 02?

252
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,672
Or is it going to bring
destruction?

253
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,312
Lie! Lie! It's a lie!

254
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:51,812
I don't believe that Kaworu
is an Angel! It's a lie!

255
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:55,052
<i>This is a fact, face it. Sortie.</i>

256
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:56,542
<i>You got it?</i>

257
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,352
Shinji is late.

258
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:05,662
<i>Eva Unit 01 is descending via</i>
<i>Route 2. Pursuing the target.</i>

259
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:09,132
You betrayed me! You
hurt my feelings!

260
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:11,332
You betrayed me just
like my father did!

261
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,132
Unit 01 has reached
the Fourth Layer.

262
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:14,572
It's about to confront the target!

263
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,362
There he is!

264
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,972
I have been waiting
for you, Shinji.

265
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,462
Kaworu!

266
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,742
I'm sorry, Asuka!

267
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:34,352
The Eva series was born from Adam.
Humans must abhor their existence.

268
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:37,292
Lilim try to survive even if it
means using the thing they hate.

269
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,812
I do not understand this.

270
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:44,762
Kaworu, stop this! Why are
you doing this?!

271
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:47,672
Eva is created from the
same tissue as I am.

272
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:50,272
I am also born from Adam.

273
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:52,872
So I can synchronize with it as
easily as if it has no soul.

274
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:56,602
Unit 02's soul is now
shutting itself up.

275
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,042
An AT Field?!

276
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,282
Yes, that's what you
Lilim call this.

277
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,652
This is the light of the soul,

278
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,482
sacred territory where no
one should intrude.

279
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,222
Don't you Lilim know?

280
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:13,832
Everybody has an AT Field.

281
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,092
I don't understand what
you're talking about!

282
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:20,472
<i>Both Evas have reached</i>
<i>the deepest layer.</i>

283
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,902
<i>Target is twenty meters away</i>
<i>from Terminal Dogma.</i>

284
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:28,012
If Unit 01's signal disappears and
then any change occurs...

285
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:31,612
I know, self-destruct the
entire complex.

286
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,552
It's better than letting the
Third Impact occur.

287
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:35,952
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,852
I don't mind it if it's with you.

289
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,342
Thank you.

290
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:49,152
It is human fate. Human hope
is made with sorrow.

291
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:53,462
What is this?!

292
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,002
The strongest AT Field ever
has been detected!

293
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:56,302
The strongest AT Field ever
has been detected!

294
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:58,042
Light, magnetism,
sub-atomic particles!

295
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,642
It's shutting out everything!
We can't monitor anything!

296
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,072
This is absolutely impossible!

297
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:05,242
Signals from the target, Unit 02
and Unit 01 are lost!

298
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:07,072
We've lost communication
with the pilot!

299
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:20,652
Kaworu!

300
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,322
Wait!

301
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,412
Final safety system released!

302
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,572
Heaven's Door is opening!

303
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,312
The Angel has finally reached it.

304
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,612
Hyuga...

305
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:52,962
What now?

306
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:53,932
What's going on?!

307
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:55,232
Another AT Field!

308
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:59,322
A field as strong as the first one
has surrounded Terminal Dogma!

309
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,102
It's invading the other AT Field!

310
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,042
Impossible! Is it another Angel?!

311
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,642
I don't know! I can't confirm it!

312
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:08,272
God! It just disappeared!

313
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,072
Disappeared? The Angel has?

314
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:19,282
Adam, our mother. One born of
Adam must return to Adam.

315
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,982
Although it could destroy
all humanity?

316
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,792
No! This is...

317
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,122
Lilith?!

318
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,422
I see. I understand Lilim now.

319
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,142
Thank you, Shinji.

320
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:47,182
I wanted you to stop Unit 02.

321
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:50,552
Otherwise, it would have
survived with her.

322
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:52,752
Kaworu, why?

323
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:54,592
Because it is my destiny to live

324
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:58,042
although it would bring
destruction to humanity.

325
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:04,302
I would prefer to die here.
Life and Death are equal to me.

326
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:07,902
Death of the self, that is the
only absolute freedom.

327
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:08,922
What are you?

328
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:13,902
I don't understand what
you're talking about!

329
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,732
That is my will.

330
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,542
Now, destroy me.

331
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,202
Otherwise you will be destroyed.

332
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,252
Only one life form can be chosen

333
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,952
to evade the destruction
and inherit the future.

334
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,942
And you are not the existence
that should die.

335
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,192
You need the future.

336
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,532
Thank you, my life was meaningful
because of you.

337
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:13,322
Kaworu said he loved me.

338
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:21,162
I have never, never had
such kind words.

339
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:26,232
He was like me, and like Ayanami.

340
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:29,872
I loved him too.

341
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:34,112
Kaworu should have survived.

342
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,642
He was much better than I am.

343
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:43,122
