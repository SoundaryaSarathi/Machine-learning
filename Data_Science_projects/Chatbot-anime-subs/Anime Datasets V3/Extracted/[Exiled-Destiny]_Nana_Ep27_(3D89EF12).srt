1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,800
No matter how close
we are as friends,

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,390
and no matter how often I commute to
the studio to see them practice,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,940
bottom line, I am not
a member of BLAST.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,730
As I'm repeatedly reminded
of that fact,

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,010
I'm left with the feeling of fear
rather than loneliness.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,150
Why am I so weak?

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,870
Blinking eyes call the wind

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:49,510
A smile clears all the noise away

9
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,080
The angel in your eyes whispers

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,260
"Everything begins now"

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,490
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,300
It's like being caught in a wave

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,460
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,930
Breath held, arms reaching out

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,170
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,810
You're the only one I can see

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,750
Baby my wish on a wing

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,720
This sky is torn

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,120
By a single overflowing word

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,670
Shin, where did you forget your keys?

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,230
Ring, ring!

22
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,680
Wh-What?

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,140
Where's the woman?

24
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,180
Woman?

25
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,780
Good for you.
You haven't brought one in.

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,360
Mind your own business.

27
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,380
I brought you breakfast, darling.

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,190
What the hell are you up to?

29
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,030
How do you expect me to eat all that,
first thing in the morning?

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,760
I have cake, too.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,800
I don't get it!

32
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,840
Here!

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,530
And a whole cake at that?

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,720
It's gotten cold,

35
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,750
so I'll warm it up in
the microwave, okay?

36
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,150
What is all this?

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,420
You still don't get it?
Boy, you're slow.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Wait, Nobu.
Where are you going?

39
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,990
To thank her.
Or actually, to apologize.

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,130
But it's still six in the morning!

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,430
Hachiko will still be asleep.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,190
You're right.

43
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,930
She said she's working today,

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,530
so if you wanna apologize,
do it in the evening.

45
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,010
Besides, you've got work
during the day too, right?

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,050
Anyway, let's eat.

47
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,280
Today is Sunday the 29th of July.

48
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,420
The weather will be pleasant
across the country.

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,420
However, in the Tokyo region,

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,680
there will likely be strong winds
in the evening.

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,390
Coming up after the commercial break

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,650
is fortune-telling based
on blood type.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,390
You know, I've been thinking
from before...

54
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,300
Hachi's a really good cook.

55
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,200
You think so?
I think she's normal.

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,560
I'll leave the leftovers,

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,890
so share it with Shin,
and have Yasu come over, too.

58
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,060
I'll tell him to drop by
on his way back from work.

59
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,790
But don't you think it would be
nicer for all of us

60
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,330
to go and see Hachi tonight?

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,660
We should also say hi
to Misato while we're at it.

62
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,900
Do as you wish.
I've got work tonight,

63
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,430
so I'll have some of this cake
while I still have the chance.

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,900
But it would be a shame to cut it.

65
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,140
Let's take a picture of it.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,140
Took one already.

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,310
Give it to me!

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,420
He didn't respond to the alarm clock,
or the noise I made.

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,260
Takumi must be really tired.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,140
And still, he agreed to see me.

71
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,570
I'm glad, but...
I'm feeling a bit guilty.

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,780
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU DURING
A BUSY TIME. THANKS.
I'LL EMAIL YOU.

73
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,310
I thought that for Takumi,

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,780
I was just a convenient woman
he could do it with whenever he pleased.

75
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,040
But as things stand,

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,180
I'm the one who's
taking advantage of Takumi,

77
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,190
as a man who will hold me
whenever I feel lonely.

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,180
I don't want it.

79
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,950
I said I don't want it!

80
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,020
I told you, I only came here
because you gave me too much last time!

81
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,060
Then you can take this as
an advance payment for the next time.

82
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,620
Sorry, Take. I was still asleep.
Am I late?

83
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,160
I figured as much, so I told you
to be ready at an earlier time.

84
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,200
Not to worry.

85
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,920
I brought you a change of clothes.

86
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,660
Oh, thanks.

87
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,690
I'll put them here,

88
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,000
so get ready while I go and
get Reira checked out.

89
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,130
Huh?

90
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,240
Reira stayed here, too?

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,710
I heard you're not feeling well.
You have a cold?

92
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,850
No, no. I just got carsick.

93
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,220
But I've never known you to
have motion sickness before.

94
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,790
Are you worried?

95
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,290
Of course. If you break down,
our entire band comes to a stop.

96
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,230
You'll cause problems for everyone.
Don't forget to oil the joints.

97
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,560
Don't talk of me like some object!

98
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,570
Just a figure of speech.
Then I'll drink it myself.

99
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,460
That day, my work involved
selling milk at a supermarket.

100
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,070
It's a sweet and delicious milk...

101
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,510
- I wonder how much longer
...produced in Hokkaido.

102
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,410
- I'll be repeating days like this.
- Please give it a try.

103
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,610
It's a sweet and delicious milk...

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,310
- Days of no progress.
...produced in Hokkaido.

105
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,560
Huh? My keys aren't in here.
Did Misato not go out today?

106
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,960
NANA KOMATSU
FROM
SEIICHI AND HARUE MIZUKOSHI

107
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,220
No way! From Mr. Mizukoshi?
What is it?!

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,130
WE GOT MARRIED

109
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,960
He didn't hafta notify me about that.

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,800
That's so nice. I envy them.

111
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,410
I wanna hurry and get married, too.
His wife is so cute.

112
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,970
He said he knew her since
they were kids.

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,280
I want a cool childhood friend, too.

114
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,820
I don't care if I don't find
a challenging job.

115
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,880
If I could just cook every day
for someone I love,

116
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,330
that'd make me so happy.

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,560
But marriage is unthinkable
with Takumi.

118
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,930
I should hurry up and
put an end to this pathetic relationship

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
and start a real one.

120
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,910
But can a person like me find someone

121
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,570
who will love me
for the rest of my life?

122
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,010
What if things keep going like this
and I can't find anything to live for?

123
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,110
Am I gonna grow old and die alone?

124
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,290
Welcome home, Miss Hachiko!
Everyone's been waiting for you!

125
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,720
- Huh?
- We're celebrating.

126
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,320
They just got a contract with
the record company!

127
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,160
We haven't signed it yet, though.

128
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,120
Like I said, what reason
do you have to hesitate?

129
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Well... There are a number of things.

130
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,070
Hachi!

131
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm sorry. Your cake was delicious.

132
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,670
Shin.

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,640
Make me your wife.

134
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,840
Hey, Shin! What are you doing?!

135
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,220
Unable to play the guitar or piano,

136
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,590
I could never become
a member of BLAST...

137
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,020
But no one can surpass the love
I feel for BLAST and their music.

138
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,660
And I swear to this for
as long as I live.

139
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,600
So for a straight-up punk band like us

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,080
will do better in the long run
if we take our time

141
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,910
and go about on our own for a while,
building a fan base,

142
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,450
rather than suddenly going big and
signing with a record company.

143
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,670
Why?

144
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,920
Sure, there are many skilled artists
as good as pros

145
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,690
who haven't signed a contract
with a major label,

146
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,450
but if you're planning on
going pro eventually anyway,

147
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,720
why do it in such a roundabout way?

148
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,200
You have an offer on the table
from an industry leader.

149
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,200
You seem to know your music, Misato.

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,970
When it comes to going pro,

151
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,200
our Queen, for one,
is feeling a sense of urgency,

152
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,540
and I had initially thought if
we're gonna do this anyway,

153
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,670
why not go big and become pro?

154
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,640
However, after thinking it
through some more...

155
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,080
Come on. You don't need to
think things through that much.

156
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,540
I know you wanna be safe and tap
a bridge before you cross it,

157
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,810
but too much tapping will
cause it to collapse.

158
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,910
However, in the world of
the major labels,

159
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,350
everything's driven by sales.

160
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,280
Even if you come up with a hit song,

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
unless you follow it up with another hit,

162
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,420
the public will be quick to desert you.

163
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,990
Once you're left with the image
of being a one-hit wonder,

164
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,030
it'll be extremely difficult to
make a comeback.

165
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,820
I see. In other words,
you're saying

166
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,870
it would be better to
get established first

167
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,700
by attracting fans
that will stick with you,

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,130
and then switch to a major label
once you've built that foundation.

169
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,370
That's right.
Besides, with our current position,

170
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,340
we'd pretty much hafta agree to a contract
that favors the record company.

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,670
Do you mean money?

172
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,780
No, various things.

173
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,510
But if we build a reputation,
there will be more offers to go pro,

174
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,180
and we'd be able to choose
among them

175
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,880
for one that provides
the best conditions.

176
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,820
I don't care about the terms!

177
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,920
Let's go pro and take
our chances from there!

178
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,350
We simply need to sell songs, right?!

179
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,450
That's right, that's right!

180
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,530
But to be honest,
in your present state,

181
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,360
I don't believe you can write
several marketable songs in a row.

182
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,160
Nonsense! Sure, he can!
Like, he already has!

183
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,170
Think about it!
I'm not a big fan of punk music,

184
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
and frankly, I've never been
interested in punk music at all!

185
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,980
I only know the Sex Pistols

186
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,740
because I watched that movie,
"Sid and Nancy"!

187
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,370
And even then,
I was left with the feeling

188
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,940
that I don't really understand
punk music!

189
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,490
Is that so?

190
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,520
But... I like the songs Nobu writes.

192
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,660
And it's not that I'm favoring
his music because we're friends.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,060
I've thought so ever since
I heard his music for the first time.

194
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,600
I was totally surprised!

195
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,700
I was deeply moved!

196
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,170
It's so cool, it gave me goose bumps.

197
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,500
There is no way you won't sell.

198
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,400
You know... Hachi...

199
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,600
It's okay, I understand.

200
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,700
Thank you.
Don't say another word.

201
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm so happy I could cry.

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,350
But I also think you're capable
of writing songs that will be popular.

203
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,210
Really?

204
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,230
With the original BLAST,
Ren wrote most of the songs,

205
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,390
so I do believe the music appealed
to only the hardcore fans.

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,160
But compared to Ren's music,
Nobu's music is closer to pop.

207
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,960
With a little work,
I think the music could gain support

208
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,330
from a wide range of listeners.

209
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,960
But Ren's songs are very popular
with the general public.

210
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,940
That's because now he's writing songs
to suit the Trapnest style,

211
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,670
as a professional.

212
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,750
Yeah. You're very knowledgeable, Misato.

213
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm impressed.

214
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,910
I'm impressed with Ren.

215
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,810
He not only creates songs
to suit the band,

216
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,080
but the songs he does write
become major hits.

217
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,280
But the reason Trapnest's songs
are so popular

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,350
has more to do with
Takumi's arrangements.

219
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,050
No matter what kind of song,
if it falls in Takumi's hands,

220
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,120
he can make it fit into Trapnest's style.

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,660
You know, I've always wondered,

222
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,000
doesn't Ren mind having Takumi
completely change the music he writes?

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,070
I mean, don't most bands
arrange their songs together?

224
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,840
I wouldn't wanna be ordered
to play in a certain way.

225
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,610
He's listening to the opinions
of others, it seems.

226
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,120
He seems to trust his band members.

227
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,680
In the past, Takumi used
to write the songs too,

228
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,520
so it was a complete one-man band.

229
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,250
And that led to clashes,
which is why back in their amateur days,

230
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,420
the band members
kept changing, right?

231
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,820
Naoki is their second drummer
and Ren is their fourth guitarist.

232
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,730
You really know all the details.

233
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,290
Anyone would be uncomfortable
in such a band.

234
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,610
Of course, Ren knew all this
when he joined Trapnest, right?

235
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,070
Yeah. But Ren supported
Takumi's beliefs from the start.

236
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,440
What's this belief?

237
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,810
He'd say, " I'm the only one
who can create a sound

238
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,950
that would bring out the ultimate
beauty in Reira's voice."

239
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,290
Oh, wow. I just thought for
a moment how cool that was.

240
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,500
Me too.

241
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,900
But didn't it make you jealous,

242
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,590
having him talk about
your girlfriend like that?

243
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,260
How do you know about that?

244
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,900
I believe there's very little data
I don't know

245
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,070
when it comes to anything to do
with local bands from my hometown.

246
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,800
I will stop at nothing until
I know everything. It is my belief!

247
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,870
Is that so?
But we split up a long time ago.

248
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,570
I know!

249
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,410
I had no idea.

250
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,140
Jealous?
Should I be feeling jealous?

251
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,380
That's a strong bond
we're talking about here.

252
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,650
They could even be a couple.
It's Takumi we're talking about.

253
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,390
This is no time to be thinking
how cool that sounded.

254
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,620
We kinda got off subject.

255
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,920
The issue here is not about Trapnest.

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,660
It's about the future of our band.

257
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.

258
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,930
Geez. You always change
the subject like that

259
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,700
whenever it turns to you.

260
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,270
I feel like there's something wrong with me
for not being jealous.

261
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,980
But we shouldn't be making
any decisions about the band

262
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,010
without Nana present.

263
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,220
That's right.

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,720
So, what time is Nana returning?

265
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,940
Oh, she said she'd be working,
so she might not make it.

266
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,710
No way. Nana isn't coming?

267
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,290
I haven't seen her for days.

268
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,920
Well, I did see her on stage yesterday,
but that's one-sided.

269
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,920
Hey, Hachi. We're outta wine.
Will you go buy some?

270
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,230
But it's not safe alone,
so take Nobu with you.

271
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,040
You go buy it yourself.

272
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,910
But I'm obviously under the age limit,
so they won't sell me any.

273
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,680
It's okay, Hachi, I'll go alone.

274
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,980
Or rather, don't come.

275
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,210
That's no good.

276
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,310
You're borderline whether
or not you look old enough.

277
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,950
But Hachi's looking sexier lately,
so she'll be okay.

278
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,650
Sexier?

279
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,690
So go.

280
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,550
What am I gonna do?

281
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,220
If it's just the two of us,
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

282
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,990
You know...

283
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,390
There's no point in me coming with you
if you're gonna keep such a distance.

284
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,530
At least walk in front of me.
I'd worry if I can't see you.

285
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,400
Right.

286
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,060
Actually, I'd rather not walk in front!

287
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,390
I feel uneasy about someone
walking behind me!

288
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,330
Oh, sorry... but...

289
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,530
Is it okay if I walk next to you?

290
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,890
I'd rather you do that, please.

291
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,400
Thank you!

292
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,440
F-For what?

293
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,420
I thought you would never talk
to me again.

294
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,220
So I'm glad that you came tonight.

295
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
What are you talking about?

296
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,060
That's nonsense.
Of course I'll talk to you.

297
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,530
Why are you apologizing?
You've done nothing wrong.

299
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,730
That's not true. The truth is,
I'm a really horrible woman!

300
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,710
What do you mean horrible?

301
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,840
How horrible?

302
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,120
But it's true.
You're idealizing me for sure, Nobu!

303
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,510
Otherwise, there's no way
you'd fall in love with me!

304
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,350
Aren't you idealizing the creature
known as woman a bit too much?

305
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,380
If you knew the real me,
you'd be disappointed.

306
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,630
Don't you think that maybe

307
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,490
she was lonely from her break up
with her boyfriend?

308
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,160
Then, disappoint me.

309
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,530
I want you to.

310
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,080
Because I don't know what else
I can do to stop loving you.

311
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,190
Hey, Yasu, tell me the rest of
the story we were talking about earlier.

312
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,560
So that I can learn from you.

313
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,960
What about?

314
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,190
About Reira.

315
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,700
Didn't you get jealous after
hearing Takumi's beliefs?

316
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,770
Yeah, I got jealous. Real jealous.

317
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,100
Really?

318
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,210
I was jealous of his talent,

319
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,650
his confidence and
his reckless personality.

320
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,580
Reira was in love with Takumi.

321
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,450
Even before we started going out,
for some reason,

322
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,750
she liked to stick around me.

323
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,630
I'm a year older than her,
so I was like an older brother to her.

324
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,930
Takumi has always been a womanizer,
but he never approached Reira.

325
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,770
I guess you could say
she was really important to him,

326
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,900
but only as his diva.

327
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,470
I love to sing, and would love
to become a singing machine.

328
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,110
A machine that has no desire
or feels any jealousy.

329
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,780
A high-performance machine
that will never feel tired.

330
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,320
But if I throw away my emotions,

331
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,120
it would be impossible to
sing beautifully, wouldn't it?

332
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,060
Being human is exhausting.

333
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,530
She captured my heart.

334
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,000
So then, I convinced her
to give up on him

335
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,700
and go out with me.

336
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,970
You convinced her.

337
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,500
But then when I started dating her,

338
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,480
I felt even stronger that
I could not compete against Takumi.

339
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,380
Looking back,
I know it was just petty jealousy.

340
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,180
I couldn't bring myself
to be there for Reira

341
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,410
when she had issues with the band

342
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,920
and when she was worried
about moving to Tokyo.

343
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,320
I couldn't support her
when she needed me the most.

344
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,960
So not surprisingly, we broke up.

345
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,230
But couldn't you support her now, Yasu?

346
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,970
No. I doubt she needs
my support anymore.

347
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,700
And besides, my hands are full
taking care of you guys right now.

348
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,340
I hafta say goodbye to Takumi.

349
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,710
If I can't do that, then I must free myself
from these arms.

350
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,620
I can say goodbye, can't I?
I can.

351
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,820
It'll be okay.

352
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,120
And this time for sure,
I'll be really happy.

353
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,960
Because in these arms is
all the future I ever wanted.

354
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,890
That's what I believe.

355
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,800
Where's Hachiko?

356
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,530
Oh, she went to buy some stuff.

357
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,540
Gimme a break.
Did I just miss her again?

358
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,470
And after speeding to get here faster.

359
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
She'll be back soon.

360
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,670
She might be a while.

361
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,720
Why?

362
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,350
We sent her out with Nobu.

363
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,740
Really?! Way to go, Shin!

364
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,110
Don't come back until the morning!
I'm counting on you, Nobuo!

365
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,820
Huh?!

366
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,290
But I thought Miss Hachiko
has a boyfriend.

367
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,050
I bet 10,000 yen that they'll do it.

368
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,860
I bet 10,000 yen that they won't.

369
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,560
I bet 100 yen that he'll come
before they even do it!

370
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,720
You're so cheap.

371
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,280
Hey, Nana.

372
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,840
The feelings I swore that night
still remain unfaded in my heart.

373
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,390
Those shining dreams we had back then,
please don't forget them.

374
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,020
I reached into the sky

375
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,540
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

376
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,910
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

377
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,910
Like colorful balloons

378
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm alone

379
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,750
My hand had no place to go

380
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:45,390
And gently you took it

381
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,570
Starless night

382
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,760
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,570
I want to feel your warmth

384
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,450
Tears are falling down

385
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,540
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

386
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,040
Of your hand holding mine
