1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,970
A customer booked a tour,
and she specifically requested me!

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,740
It's time to show how much
you've learned from your training.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,040
Please do your best.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,910
Okay!

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,610
If you're ever in trouble, just shift your "wonderful"
power into overdrive and do your best, okay?

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,440
Okay!

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,010
Or you could always escape
by sculling backwards at full speed.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,810
Okay!

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,210
Uh, no...

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,020
"Dear Ai, ever since the end of Carnevale,"

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,390
"spring has been coming
ever closer to Neo-Venezia."

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,460
Welcome back, Alicia!

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,470
Good job.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,010
That was really fun!

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,170
Here, please take my hand.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,940
Thank you.

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,940
"Now that the tourist season is over,
we Undines aren't as busy anymore."

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,750
We have one more appointment left today.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,820
Tomorrow, we have one appointment in the
morning, but none in the afternoon as of yet.

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,760
Hello, this is the Aria Company.

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,000
Eh? P-Pardon me.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,310
Yes, we will be waiting for you.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,240
Well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,350
My, my. What's the matter?

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,750
Umm...

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,520
It was a booking request.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,290
And the customer said
she'd like me to be her guide.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,620
Oh, my!

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,930
Congratulations, Akari.

30
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,060
You'll have to work hard tomorrow.

31
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,600
Yes! I'll do my best!

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:06,850
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

33
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,890
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,180
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,950
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:38,420
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,880
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,300
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,830
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

40
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:06,780
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,750
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:20,560
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:29,670
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

44
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,230
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

45
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,650
That Smiling Customer...

46
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,130
No big springtime yawns allowed!

47
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,660
Right! Sorry...
No big springtime yawns allowed!

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,060
Right! Sorry...

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,030
It's just that I couldn't decide
today's route until this morning.

50
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,170
That customer sounds suspicious.

51
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,310
Eh? How so?

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,910
If this person called the Aria Company and wanted
you, a Single, even though Alicia was available...

53
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,580
...there has to be some kind of reason behind it.

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,150
What kind of reason?

55
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,220
For example, maybe this customer
wants to have fun teasing a Single!

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,990
Huh?!

57
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,420
S.S.
Akari
Big Catch
Huh?!

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:21,620
S.S.
Akari
Big Catch

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,260
S.S.
Akari
Big Catch
I heard there are customers
who request Singles...

60
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,690
S.S.
Akari
Big Catch
...just so they can toy with them by making
impossible and unreasonable demands!

61
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,060
...just so they can toy with them by making
impossible and unreasonable demands!

62
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,770
If this customer's like that, Akari will be
teased like crazy, and it'll end in disaster.

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,400
Wait!
If this customer's like that, Akari will be
teased like crazy, and it'll end in disaster.

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,870
Wait!

65
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,540
Maybe...

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,140
Huh?
Maybe...

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,540
Huh?

68
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,910
This customer could be
the legendary surprise examiner.

69
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,810
Surprise examiner?

70
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,410
It's just a rumor, but...

71
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,180
...supposedly there are examiners
sent by the Gondola Association.

72
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,120
They ride in a Single's gondola and conduct
surprise inspections on their aptitude.

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,680
So, what happens if you fail the inspection?

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,490
Apparently, if you fail, you get
demoted from a Single to a Pair.

75
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,800
W-W-What should I do?! W-What should I do, Aika?!

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,470
W-Wait! Calm down, Akari!
W-W-What should I do?! W-What should I do, Aika?!

77
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,990
W-Wait! Calm down, Akari!

78
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,600
See you later, then.

79
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,170
Akari.

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,810
Akari.

81
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,540
Do your best, even if your
customer is difficult, okay?

82
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,220
Please try not to fail, okay?

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,310
Okay. Thank you, Aika, Alice.

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,730
Well then... Let's go practice, shall we, Junior?

85
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,720
Yes, Aika.

86
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm back.

87
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,760
Welcome back, Akari.

88
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,300
It's almost time for your booking, isn't it?

89
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,460
Yes.

90
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm... a little nervous, though.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,750
My, my. It has been a while, hasn't it?

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,980
Yes.

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,720
Oh, that's right.

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,210
I marked my chosen guide route
on a map yesterday.

95
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,280
Umm...

96
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,760
Found it!

97
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm Amarantha. I believe I have
an appointment for today?

98
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,630
Ah, yes!

99
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,340
Welcome to Aria Company!

100
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,780
My name is Akari Mizunashi,
I'll be your guide today.

101
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,280
Pleased to meet you!

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Pleased to meet you, too.

103
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,490
Please wait a moment
while I prepare for our trip.

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,870
Please watch your step.

105
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,200
Thank you.

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,960
Excuse us.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,900
Why don't you sit next me?

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,540
Let's enjoy this together.

109
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,280
Ma'am, is there any specific place
that you'd like to see?

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,980
Let's see...

111
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,790
I'll leave it up to you.

112
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,250
Eh? You'll leave it up... to me?

113
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,660
I've been a big fan of Neo-Venezia
ever since I was young.

114
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,730
I've visited this city several times, so I've
already seen all the major sightseeing spots.

115
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,670
I see.

116
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:31,100
So, if you don't mind, could you show me
a side of Neo-Venezia that only you know?

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,020
Yes, I'll do my very best!

118
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,930
They're off.

119
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,430
Aika, I thought we were going to practice?

120
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,800
W-Well, aren't you worried about Akari
being out there on her own, though?

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Besides, you can leave if you want, Junior.

122
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,670
No, I'll accompany you.

123
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,120
If she is the legendary examiner, I'm really
curious what kind of inspection she performs.

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
I-I see...

125
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay, Junior! Let's get going then!

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,260
Go!

127
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,480
Roger!

128
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,120
Ma'am, please look at the
building up ahead on your right.

129
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,300
It's not a historic building, but...

130
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,870
If we move over here...

131
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,980
Please notice the statue on the roof.

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,740
Oh, my.

133
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,060
When you're in this exact spot,
the statue appears to be holding Ukijima.

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,290
Oh, my! How interesting.

135
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,920
It really is.

136
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,860
Thank goodness!

137
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,130
Akari?

138
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,200
Yes?

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Could you move the gondola
forward a little, please?

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,100
Yes ma'am.

141
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,340
Is this okay?

142
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,710
Yes.
Is this okay?

143
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,380
Yes.

144
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,650
Could you go in between
those two palina, please?

145
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,710
Of course.

146
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,420
Is this spot okay?

147
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,620
Yes, thank you.

148
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,420
It's two statues now!

149
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,360
This view can only be seen when
you're in between these two palina.

150
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,000
You've been here before,
haven't you, Ms. Amarantha?

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,640
Yes, I've been here once before.

152
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,820
But it was fun.

153
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,690
Where are you going to take me next?

154
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,020
Well then, allow me take you
to our next destination.

155
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,450
Is there something special about this spot?

156
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,440
Not that I know of...

157
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,630
It looks like everything's going well.

158
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,720
So far, sure. But the scary part is yet to come.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,020
Junior! Back up, back up!

160
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,070
This pastor is creating an accurate
miniature replica of Neo-Venezia.

161
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,640
It's been two years since I started this as a hobby.

162
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,940
The main island of Neo-Venezia
is finally starting to take shape.

163
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,320
I wonder what they're looking at?

164
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,620
Who would have thought there'd be
a sightseeing spot here?

165
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,160
What's the matter, President Aria?

166
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,430
Oh, is that so?

167
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,710
Last time I was here, you had only
completed the District of San Marco.

168
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,270
I'm guessing it'll probably take me another
five years to complete the whole thing.

169
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,580
Feel free to come back and see it anytime.

170
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,280
Thank you very much.

171
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,180
There are many different kinds
of people here, aren't there?

172
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,290
Yes!

173
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,890
Everyone's a big fan of Neo-Venezia.

175
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,600
The Original
Buttered Baked Potatoes

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,310
Here you go.

177
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,170
Thank you very much.

178
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,850
Here, Alicia.

179
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,040
Thank you, Akari.

180
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes, yes. There's one for you, too.

181
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,060
It's delicious.

182
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,160
Yes. It's the best buttered
baked potato in Neo-Venezia, after all!

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,830
President Aria, it's hot,
so I'll cool it down for you.

184
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,540
Here you go.

185
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
Excuse me, Mr. Shopkeeper.

186
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,020
Yes?

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,250
Have you changed the butter recently?

188
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,760
Well, the shop I always used to
purchase my butter from closed down.

189
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,060
Does it taste bad? I thought
I chose a good new butter, but...

190
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,930
Not at all, it tastes even better now.

191
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,270
Really? What a relief!

192
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,360
Thank you for your continued patronage!

193
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,460
Continued?

194
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,210
I want to eat buttered potatoes, too!

195
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,510
Please restrain yourself, Aika.

196
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,170
But...

197
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,490
Oh, my.

198
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,520
Our scheduled time is almost up.

199
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,900
Ah, yes. It is, isn't it?

200
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,240
Thank you very much for
today, Akari. I had so much fun!

201
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,290
Um, Ms. Amarantha, Alicia.

202
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,900
There's one more really special
place I'd like to show you.

203
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,560
Is there any way you'd allow me
to take you to one last spot?

204
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,340
I still have some time. Please, let's go see it.

205
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,910
Thank you very much!

206
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,350
I wonder what happened?

207
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,990
Maybe... the lady said she failed?

208
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,330
Ehh?! N-No way!

209
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,490
L-Let's hurry and follow them!

210
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,650
Yes!

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,170
That's such a narrow canal...

212
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,430
I wonder where they're headed?

213
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,070
How far are they planning to go?

214
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,450
We've arrived.

215
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,470
We'll be going through some narrow passageways,
so please keep to the center of the gondola.

216
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,820
This is the back garden of a convent,

217
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,760
which was submerged and abandoned
when the water level rose.

218
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,850
What a spectacular place.

219
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,230
I hope you're satisfied with the tour?

220
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,240
Akari?

221
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
Yes?

222
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,960
What's behind that door?

223
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,740
Umm...

224
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm not sure.

225
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,280
Why don't we go have a look?

226
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,820
Ah, yes!

227
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,690
Let's keep going straight.

228
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,720
Okay.

229
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,610
A forked canal, huh?

230
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,510
I wonder which way they went?

231
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,640
This way!
This way!

232
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,620
Let's go beneath that tree, Akari.

233
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,550
O-Okay.

234
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,460
Amazing!

235
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,730
But it's still early in the season
for the wisteria to be flowering...

236
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,910
It gets plenty of sunlight here, but...

237
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,080
...notice how it's shielded from the cold winds
because it's surrounded by buildings?

238
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,050
That's why, compared to outside,
this tree always flowers a little earlier.

239
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,060
So that's it!

240
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,130
That's wonderful.

241
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,890
Ms. Amarantha.

242
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,570
By any chance, were all the
places that I showed you today...

243
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,240
...places that you'd already been before?

244
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,840
I see...

245
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:14,680
I took to you to places which I thought
were my very own special spots, but...

246
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,530
Akari.

248
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,140
Right now, my heart is filled with
wonderful memories from today.

249
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,340
But...

250
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,750
You showed me so many places today,
and I was able to feel your heart in all of them.

251
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,630
I could feel that your heart was eager to share
your favorite parts of Neo-Venezia with me.

252
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,420
My heart...

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
That's what's most important.

254
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,140
No matter how delicious the food is,
no matter how beautiful the scenery is,

255
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,130
in the end, if your heart isn't in it,
it won't be a truly wonderful memory.

256
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:20,510
What I truly wanted to see today was you,
doing your best to show me around.

257
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,990
I can see you've definitely inherited
the Aria Company's spirit of hospitality.

258
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,920
I'm relieved.

259
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,020
Yes!

260
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,600
Oh?

261
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,550
Aika, Alice!

262
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,280
Um, Aika said she was w-worried about you, so...

263
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Wha-?!
Um, Aika said she was w-worried about you, so...

264
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,180
Um, Aika said she was w-worried about you, so...

265
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,720
N-No I didn't! You're the one who was
hung up on some legendary examiner!
Um, Aika said she was w-worried about you, so...

266
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,090
N-No I didn't! You're the one who was
hung up on some legendary examiner!

267
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,250
N-No I didn't! You're the one who was
hung up on some legendary examiner!
You have wonderful friends.

268
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,460
It was your idea first, Aika.
Yes, they truly are.

269
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:56,990
It was your idea first, Aika.

270
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,360
It was your idea first, Aika.
What are you talking about?!

271
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,220
What are you talking about?!

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,800
Say, Akari.

273
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,170
I'm not the only one who likes to
take tours on a Single's gondola.

274
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,730
Is that so?

275
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,880
The current system of allowing rides on a
Single's gondola for a lower price...

276
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,820
...was created so that everyone
could help nurture them.

277
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:31,090
In that way, the whole city helps to
raise the next generation of Primas.

278
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:38,150
I guided Ms. Amarantha
when I was a Single, too.

279
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,190
So did Akira and Athena.

280
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,760
Eh? Akira, too?

281
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,360
Um, did Athena cause you any trouble?

282
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,140
Not at all.

283
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,310
I have very joyful memories with all of them.

284
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,490
I feel that every time a wonderful
Undine masters her craft,

285
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,220
the city of Neo-Venezia
becomes even more wonderful.

286
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,450
That's why I choose to
tour on a Single's gondola.

287
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,070
Seeing you all grow as Undines
is my greatest happiness.

288
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,740
One day...

289
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
One day, when I mature as
an Undine and become a Prima...

290
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,510
...may I guide you again?

291
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,650
Yes. I look forward to it.

292
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,230
Thank you very much for today.

293
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,170
My thanks to you as well.

294
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,340
Please come visit us again!

295
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,310
Yes, of course. Let's meet again.

296
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,870
See you then.

297
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,980
Alicia.

298
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,550
I have to do my best
and become a Prima, don't I?

299
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,250
That's right.

300
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,430
"Dear Ai, today I felt as though
the entire city of Neo-Venezia..."

301
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,460
"No, as though all of Aqua
was watching over me."

302
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,810
"She was a wonderful
customer, wasn't she, Akari?"

303
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:32,550
"Maybe it was Aqua itself that sent her to you."

304
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,980
"Don't you think so, Akari?"

305
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,490
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

306
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,360
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

307
00:22:48,930 --> 00:23:00,110
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

308
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:09,110
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

309
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:22,400
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

310
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:31,530
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

311
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:44,720
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

312
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,260
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

313
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,460
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

314
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,700
And my day begins
Hajimaru

I discovered a new shop!

What, what? What kind of shop?

You're acting really childish, Aika.
