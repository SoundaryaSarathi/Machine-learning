1
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,960
Was it last year?

2
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,610
When we were having a competition with Hotarugawa,

3
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,290
Isurugi-san... err... No. 4 and I were the head of each team.

4
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,610
After talking to him a bit... Well...

5
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,100
I thought he was kind of nice, and had a crush on him.

6
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,520
So you were...

7
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,060
This talkative...

8
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,030
But for someone like me...

9
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,960
It's probably impossible.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,300
You are...

11
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,240
Not the person I know so well.

12
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,760
In my private world...

13
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,940
You were...

14
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,520
Without any decoration,

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,290
smiling like a flower.

16
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,610
Shin-chan?

17
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,800
Are you going out?

18
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,790
Good morning.

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,810
Oh... mornin'!

20
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,800
Have a safe trip!

21
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,060
Ah... I'm leaving.

22
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,150
What are you doing?

23
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,880
The old man that often comes to our store hurt his leg.

24
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,540
Oh.

25
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,880
I was delivering; one serving of red bean paste and two of cream.

26
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,570
Oh...

27
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,780
What's wrong?

28
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,110
It's all Ai-chan's fault.

29
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,020
What is?

30
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,280
It's because you surprised me.

31
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,110
Hey!

32
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,440
Come shopping with me!

33
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Eh? I don't feel like it.

34
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Come on, it'll help you relax!

35
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,720
Let's go! let's go!

36
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,620
Okay, okay!

37
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,780
I guess you're right...

38
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,420
At a time like this it would be nice to see Miyokichi's stupid face...

39
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,300
...Miyokichi?

40
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,580
You're not calling him?

41
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,390
Ah! He told me he had something to do today! { Sub starts too late if you want to include the "Ah!" in the sub. }

42
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,370
That's right!

43
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,070
In that case...

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,340
Let's go!

45
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,120
Come on, let's go! let's go!

46
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,140
Hey-

47
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,960
Ai-chan!

48
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,410
Hurry, hurry!

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,060
Hey, what about this one?

50
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,160
Ah, looks nice.

51
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,450
And this...?

52
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,970
Fits you.

53
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,310
And this one?

54
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,370
It might be nice!

55
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,930
Couldn't you pay more attention?

56
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,770
As far as I'm concerned, anything will do.

57
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,450
Eh? Something that normal?

58
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,280
Where are you going?

59
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,510
Toilet.

60
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me, I want this one!

61
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,450
Tah-daah!

62
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,680
Come on, eat up! Eat up!

63
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,810
Today, it's all---on---me!

64
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,990
Is it okay?

65
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,140
Of course!

66
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,640
Since, you know...

67
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm the one at fault.

68
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,650
It was my own misunderstanding.

69
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,390
Shinichirou...

70
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,070
The reason she wanted to be friends with Noe...

71
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,210
is to get closer to a guy that knows Noe.

72
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,820
A guy that's closer to Noe than me!

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,090
I see...

74
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,860
Well, come on, think about it,

75
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,210
Not like you could actually get back on your feet right after realizing that,

76
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,960
But that's what time is for!

77
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,770
Sometime, for sure...

78
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,220
Naturally...

79
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,520
The time will come when you'll naturally forget about it.

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,390
Cheer up!

81
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,740
You're just like a little brother to me, you know,

82
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,970
With a face looking like that,

83
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,620
Onee-chan will get worried!

84
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,210
You're so proud.

85
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,000
Who was it that found Miyokichi for you?

86
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,140
Nosy bastard!

87
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,140
I'll go buy some juice.

88
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,360
You really are nosy...

89
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,390
Welcome home.

90
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm back.

91
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,380
Umm...

92
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,210
Umm... could it be...

93
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,210
...that you're avoiding me?

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm sorry!

95
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,480
That I...

96
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,680
asked you for such a strange favor...

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,970
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,650
Don't be.

99
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,900
I mustn't...

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,440
No, it's okay!

101
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,230
I was just a bit surprised.

102
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,450
I mustn't say this...

103
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,010
In order to get close to that No. 4...

104
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,760
You wanted to befriend his sister...

105
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,960
I never could've figured that out.

106
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,770
That wasn't the only reason-- I...

107
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,150
No! don't worry about it!

108
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,920
I guess I was just being stupid.

109
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,610
How I feel about you...

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,310
But you know, you could have just told me from the beginning.

111
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,240
How I feel about you...

112
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,990
It was a bit sly of you.

113
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,610
I...

114
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,470
Shin-chan?

115
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,910
I need to talk to you. Do you have time?

116
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,170
Shin-chan...

117
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,450
Those eyes...

118
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,380
They look just like your mother's.

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,870
I'm the worst...

120
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,990
Take a look, I switched to another gel. How is it? It's different from before.

121
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,530
I have a date with Ai-chan after school!

122
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,990
Ah, why won't they let us go home already?

123
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,970
It would've been great if you'd tagged along yesterday.

124
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,160
Not like you actually have anything important to do...

125
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,660
So, you could've come...

126
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,390
Here!

127
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,770
Today's share!

128
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,400
This one's brother...

129
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,970
Is there something on my face?

130
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,730
No.

131
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,540
Wait!

132
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,070
Why?

133
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,120
What are you...?

134
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,340
My reflection is there...

135
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,330
My nose looks bigger.

136
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,230
You are collecting tears, right?

137
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,050
Eh?

138
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,930
Right now I could make them.

139
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,020
Tears.

140
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,080
Because I feel like I might cry.

141
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,090
Why do you feel like crying?

142
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,540
I'm not telling.

143
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,640
You're mean for leading me on.

144
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,830
Yeah... that's because I <i>am</i> mean.

145
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,620
As you are now, your tears have no value.

146
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,990
Weak tears!

147
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,400
Gutter tears!

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,500
Slimy tears!

149
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,220
Puke tears!

150
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,230
"Puke"? You...!

151
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,460
I'll help you purify your tears!

152
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:43,870
Eh?

153
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,070
Okay, let's do this quickly.

154
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,000
Just like when you learned how to swim at the pool.

155
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,890
Did you even consider that there might be viruses or germs in there?!

156
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,880
There are more germs in Shinichirou.

157
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,500
We are killing off those germs with this.

158
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,640
Here!

159
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:16,910
Here.

160
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,810
Good work.

161
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,540
Is it warm?

162
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,290
Isn't it usually... the guy who does something like this?

163
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,440
Shinichirou is the one who's cold, right?

164
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,260
I guess so...

165
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,710
But, this...

166
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,080
Isn't it a bit too big for you?

167
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,910
It was my granny's.

168
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,710
Your grandmother?

169
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,240
Yeah. My beloved... my beloved granny!

170
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,930
My grandmother, who took my tears with her to the skies.

171
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,120
Your tears...

172
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,400
To the skies?

173
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,700
No way! No way! I want granny to come home with us!

174
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,410
Don't be so selfish, Noe!

175
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,980
No way!

176
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,340
Oh my, Noe is such a crybaby...

177
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,610
Granny will soon be going on a journey to the skies.

178
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,110
To the skies?

179
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,880
That's right! When that time comes, I'll bring Noe's tears along with me!

180
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,010
Noe's tears?

181
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,110
That's right. And then the crybaby Noe won't cry anymore.

182
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,450
That's a lie! You can't give or take tears from someone!

183
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,470
You can't take just anyone's...

184
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,780
A very...

185
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,560
A very important person's tears are the only ones you can take.

186
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,820
A very...

187
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,660
A very important...

188
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,890
Since then, I've been unable to cry.

189
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,620
It's because... granny took my tears with her.

190
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,150
Did her childhood memories really make her think that?

191
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,080
Eventually, I want to be able to cry.

192
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,050
But to do that, I have to first collect tears from someone.

193
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,370
But...

194
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,440
You couldn't take them from just anyone.

195
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,300
Yup.

196
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,650
It has to be the selected tears of someone that I care about.

197
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,300
It has to be the tears of someone elegant who's always looking up, towards where my granny is.

198
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:44,060
And that's me... and the one before me was Raigou-maru...

199
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,020
The tears of a chicken...

200
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,630
Do you get it?

201
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,560
That kind of gutter tears won't do.

202
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,020
I get it.

203
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,460
What do you want to do? Is it karaoke, after all?

204
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,200
Hmm... I don't really feel like it.

205
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,610
Then, let's go shopping!

206
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm broke, though...

207
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,610
Don't worry! I helped out with cutting the crops,

208
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,860
so I have quite a lot to spend!

209
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,660
No thanks, that wouldn't feel right.

210
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,130
Oh, that's the rumored Isurugi Noe.

211
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
She's cute...

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,720
What's with that? Ai-chan is cute!

213
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,820
Thank you.

214
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,890
I'm sorry!

215
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,790
It's not that...

216
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,240
You surprised me.

217
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,110
I'm sorry, too.

218
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,500
Let's go.

219
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,010
You know...

220
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,460
It's fine if you want me to get along with her.

221
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,230
Yuasa Hiromi.

222
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,700
Since the cause of your worthless tears...

223
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,100
is probably her, right?

224
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,640
Is that your female intuition?

225
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,700
That's not it. It's just what I really think.

226
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,050
So that's it.

227
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,370
Why is she in pain,

228
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,950
what can you do to help her... you need to think about this sincerely.

229
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,110
Think about it... sincerely...

230
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,950
To me...

231
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,260
She...

232
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,880
I thought she always had such a pale and tormented face...

233
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,810
What if I could help her?

234
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,890
And yet...

235
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,300
After I found out she likes another guy...

236
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
It's fine with me to get along with her...

237
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,510
As long as Shinichirou cheers up.

238
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,630
I used to think she was a girl that I couldn't begin to understand...

239
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,730
But...

240
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,340
Then, could you also think sincerely about the food from the skies?

241
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,260
Eh?

242
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,020
You can't eat those!

243
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,010
Why?

244
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,110
Then, you try them!

245
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,030
Okay.

246
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,490
Why are you laughing?!

247
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,710
Because your face looked so funny!

248
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,780
You're terrible!

249
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,040
Hiromi...

250
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,370
Can I give up on her?

251
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,540
Right now I'm not sure.

252
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,970
But...

253
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,540
What are you doing?!

254
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,250
What are you guys doing?!

255
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,690
What am I doing!?

256
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,690
How's it going?

257
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,480
Eh?

258
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,280
The picture book.

259
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,870
Why don't you show it to me sometime?

260
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,550
What's troubling you?

261
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,740
Pumpkin or corn...

262
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,900
I wonder which one will grow closest to the sky...

263
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Are you planning to cook?

264
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,500
Yes.

265
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,700
How rare, that you would do that.

266
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,240
This'll be the next food from the sky.

267
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,940
Is it for that back-carrying guy you told me about?

268
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,110
Back-carrying guy?

269
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,090
Sounds like a monster!

270
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,960
Take this one.

271
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,130
Sweet potato?

272
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,540
Yeah. It's close to the sky!

273
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,090
A lot of them grow at the top of the big tree.

274
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't make fun of me!

275
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,290
And then, Shinichirou said my face looked funny!

276
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Lift your head.

277
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,860
It was the first time someone told me that.

278
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,030
Granny always said how cute I am, but you know...

279
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
It's not like I'm angry.

280
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,880
Since everyone has different opinions.

281
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,850
Shinichirou's also unique in some ways...

282
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,470
There, let's go.

283
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,950
The red snow that the angel released...

284
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,960
Turned white, and piled up.

285
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,170
On the cracked ground...

286
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,700
On the muddy water...

287
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,450
It piled, and piled...

288
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,580
Until it became a snow-white field.

289
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,180
Everywhere...

290
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,650
White everywhere.

291
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
Alright!

292
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,490
Mornin'.

293
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,560
M-morning!

294
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,990
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,980
For the way I spoke before.

296
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,050
That's why... umm...

297
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,210
That one is...

298
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,350
Face-wash...

299
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,870
Cellphone!

300
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,470
Thank you!

301
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,550
Umm... why'd you take a photo?

302
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,580
Because it's common in manga and the like,

303
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,210
but it doesn't happen often in real life.

304
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,720
T-that doesn't mean you have to take one, does it?

305
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,030
Your smile was also quite bright!

306
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,260
T-that's because I was looking at the camera!

307
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,870
I can also...

308
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,190
It seems I can also make Hiromi smile.

309
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,440
Found you.

310
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,330
N-no. 4...

311
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,870
Wh-why are you here?

312
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,840
You sure are friendly in our first conversation...

313
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,390
Nice to meet you.

314
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,320
I'm Noe's brother, Isurugi Jun.

315
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,890
Nice to meet you! I'm Nakagami Shinichirou.

316
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,800
I know.

317
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,870
What's with this guy... just now he...

318
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,500
You really resemble your sister.

319
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,550
Not at all.

320
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,960
He's confusing me... no!

321
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,620
This won't do! I can't get caught up in his pace!

322
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,520
Eh... then... mind if I ask what business Isurugi Noe's brother would have at our residence?

323
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,400
I have a request.

324
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:04,970
Huh?

325
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,090
I want you to go out with her.

326
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Go out with Noe.

327
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,310
<b>What?!

328
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,230
Although I didn't say so clearly,

329
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,250
but I want the two of you to stop wandering around together.

330
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,850
Ah, you mean No. 6 on your team?

331
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,830
I came into your room because I wanted to tell you this.

332
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,130
I don't like nosy boys like you.
