1
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,601
Sakura-chan,

2
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:14,928
you don’t really feel asleep recently.

3
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,465
Yeah, if it’s just a little,

4
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:19,836
I won’t feel too tired anymore.

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,340
This must mean
your power is growing!

6
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,316
Power?

7
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,075
Everyday

8
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:30,283
you become more cute,

9
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,746
pretty and confident.

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,492
So I don’t ever want to stop being
by your side to videotape you.

11
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,421
So I can help you
with all of your costume!

12
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,660
It is just too great!

13
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:48,172
Tomoyo-chan…

14
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,705
But when we are together

15
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:51,883
something dangerous might happen to you.

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:57,768
Compared with all I can get,
this is actually small price to pay.

17
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:03,917
Besides… whenever I am with you,
everything will be alright.

18
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,815
Re, really?

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,527
Sounds embarrasing…

20
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:14,260
You look very cute too
when you are embarrased.

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,864
Oh, Tomoyo-chan, please…

22
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,012
[Sakura, Tomoyo, and the Ball Trap]

23
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:45,026
– Everybody come here.
– OK!

24
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,726
Today there well be a b-ball contest.

25
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:51,460
Today well play basketball

26
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,628
and see.

27
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:56,662
That sounds like its gonna be fun.

28
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,304
Go!

29
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,618
Go!

30
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:16,449
Sakura-chan!

31
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,687
Sakura-chan go!

32
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:26,994
I did it!

33
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,333
Sakura-chan is really great!

34
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:30,904
Next,

35
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,334
Hiiragizawa and Li go!

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,261
Eriol-kun, Shao Lan-kun, go!

37
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:02,366
Let me have a chance.

38
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,212
Great!

39
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,733
That’s too bad, it just bounced out

40
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,909
He’s too focused.

41
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:50,284
Go! Go!

42
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:56,648
Calm down.

43
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:01,087
Just think about the basketball
going into the hoop.

44
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,408
Very great!

45
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,755
You just have to calm down
and think about yourself!

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,718
Then you can do it

47
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:34,563
Good!

48
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:36,355
Class is over.

49
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,432
Yes!

50
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,720
Really want to sleep.

51
00:04:58,522 --> 00:04:59,648
Whenever I walk

52
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,748
it makes me even more tired

53
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:24,981
Clow!

54
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,881
Why…

55
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,449
How can you be right there?

56
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,019
You should already not be in this world!

57
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,493
I did a lot of impossible things.

58
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,260
But I couldn’t tell anyone,

59
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,933
including Kerberos and you.

60
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,032
Your power is used up

61
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:55,472
Although you can’t get power

62
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,281
from your new master.

63
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,878
So our disguise is

64
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,952
a big difference from 
your real self, Yue

65
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:06,587
But

66
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,652
everything that is happening is
totally different then I expected.

67
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,486
It is very interesting.

68
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,664
I cannot tell you

69
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,365
that I really exist yet.

70
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,033
Temporarily forget this.

71
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,844
What? What? What?

72
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,074
Are you ok?

73
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,479
Did I fall asleep?

74
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:39,720
– Yeah.
– I went to sleep again?

75
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,621
Sorry if I bothered you.

76
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:42,888
Not at all.

77
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,958
What? I wonder how I got on
the other side of the fence.

78
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,868
Sorry to trouble you.

79
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,401
It wasn’t much.

80
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,532
Yuki!

81
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,542
What do you want Touya?

82
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:02,609
Because I saw that you didn’t come back…

83
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,675
Really?

84
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:05,949
Sorry.

85
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,387
He is… what kind of person?

86
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,406
You were thinking of Sakura-chan right?

87
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,745
No!…

88
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,247
Really? You’re not thinking of her?

89
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:48,690
You were thinking of Sakura-chan

90
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,829
You like Sakura-chan.

91
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,532
You still haven’t told
Sakura-chan this yet

92
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,531
I…

93
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,667
Sakura-chan has a very kind heart.

94
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,905
If you don’t tell her

95
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,402
then she won’t know.

96
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,550
But she has someone else that she likes.

97
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,278
That’s only because

98
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,319
you haven’t told her yet.

99
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,250
There are a lot of people
that like Sakura-chan.

100
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,525
Because Sakura-chan is cute
and also a kind person.

101
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,595
I know that.

102
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,489
You know that she likes somebody, who?

103
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,532
Hiiragizawa

104
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,106
I think Hiiragizawa isn’t who she likes

105
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:42,374
Sakura-chan only consider Eriol

106
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,577
as a friend,
so you can’t say she likes him.

107
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,447
You can say he likes her,

108
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,510
but he only looks at her
with friendly eyes.

109
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,388
You are a very good observer.

110
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,351
Because she is Sakura-chan.

111
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,060
I hope that

112
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,264
you can express what you’re thinking.

113
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,768
You don’t want

114
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,400
to tell other people what you feel

115
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,369
No matter what you’re thinking,

116
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,537
if you don’t say it
then you won’t be able to transmit it.

117
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:16,943
I’m done dressing,

118
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,717
will this do?

119
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:28,691
It’s too great!

120
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,057
I am going to go get my viedo camera!

121
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,762
Does this look alright?

122
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,925
– Yes.
– Really? Thank you!

123
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,004
No matter what you’re thinking,

124
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,103
if you don’t say it
then you won’t be able to transmit it.

125
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,805
I’d like to ask…

126
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:09,924
That is Clow-san’s aura.

127
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,249
I can feel it… it’s inside the school

128
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,225
That is Clow Reed’s power…

129
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,094
but,

130
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,690
Why did Tomoyo bring that brat here?

131
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,595
Because he came with me from
Tomoyo-chan’s house.

132
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,001
She was trying on clothes.

133
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:52,536
Did you eat food?

134
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:57,313
How could you eat food without me?!?

135
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:59,445
I also brought cake for Kero-chan.

136
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,082
– Really?
– Yup.

137
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,750
That’s great!

138
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,254
Tastes great!

139
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,549
Kero-chan you can really eat.

140
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:13,522
I am doing this for everybody.

141
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,089
What doing for everybody? You’re a pig!

142
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,398
You…

143
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:21,431
Actually she always helps me.

144
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:24,237
I can’t do anything.

145
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,267
It won’t be that way.

146
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,940
Li-kun has fulfilled his duty.

147
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:33,440
You have to believe in yourself.

148
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,283
Tomoyo, come here.

149
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,923
Let’s go?

150
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,524
ok

151
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,032
This hall is very scary.

152
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,527
Here we go again.
Your scared of ghosts right?

153
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,299
But…

154
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,507
It will be ok.
I’ve never seen a ghost before.

155
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:58,966
And I cant feel
anybody’s presence

156
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,334
Really?

157
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,705
Thank you Shao Lan-kun.

158
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:04,579
Shao Lan-kun?

159
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,479
Last time on the elavator,

160
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,914
he said that
I could call him Shao Lan-kun

161
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,017
and he said, “Can I call you Sakura?’

162
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:15,353
Really?

163
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,316
Right, Shao Lan-kun?

164
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:27,695
– Basketball?
– How could it just appear right here?

165
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,502
Its moving by itself!
Its probably a ghost!

166
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,477
No this isn’t a ghost.

167
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,344
Clow’s presence is growing

168
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:43,683
Lets go!

169
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,448
The basketball is gone.

170
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,348
It’s gone, really.

171
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,961
It flew into this classroom.

172
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,428
It’s ok, lets go to
a different room and look.

173
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,333
– What’s wrong?
– What are you doing?

174
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:42,669
I thought you wanted to go
to a different place and look.

175
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,546
I don’t think

176
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:45,805
that’s the right place.

177
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:50,981
This can also go to another classroom

178
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:52,885
What did you say?

179
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,888
How come this is now the music class?

180
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:00,463
How did this happen?

181
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,195
May be because the space
changed everything.

182
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,664
How did that happen?

183
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,736
– The basketball.
– I can feel a great power

184
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,375
Lets go over there and look.

185
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,312
– Tomoyo-chan!
– Sakura-chan!

186
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,651
Tomoyo-chan! Tomoyo-chan!

187
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,788
Tomoyo-chan!

188
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,262
How did we get back to this room?

189
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:45,131
It can’t be.

190
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,176
How could

191
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,768
she have disappeared like that?

192
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,011
Don’t cry.

193
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:54,079
Crying won’t help.

194
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:55,852
Hurry up and think.

195
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,719
How could we go back to room 5B.

196
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:06,394
Yes.

197
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,595
But what can we do?

198
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,635
Right! We can use the sword

199
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:14,097
card to slowly cut into the classes.

200
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,537
There’s no regular rules to follow

201
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,139
So we don’t know

202
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,376
what time shell be in room 5B.

203
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,237
So, how far the sword card

204
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,671
can cut is compared to its power.

205
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:26,712
If we don’t do it right,

206
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,416
then the walls that are too thick

207
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:31,653
Then well probably be stuck in the walls

208
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,658
Brat, have you ever learned how
to find people kind of magic?

209
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:39,959
If there is something that she
left behind then we can find her.

210
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:41,722
Oh, yes!

211
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,498
There’s Tomoyo-chan’s umbrella!

212
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,736
But Tomoyo is in that classroom

213
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,481
It won’t work! I can’t think straight or
I just can’t think of anything!

214
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:14,326
Tomoyo-chan. She said herself that
she’s not scared.

215
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,559
I have to hurry and find her out.

216
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,540
That’s Tomoyo-chan’s voice!

217
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:49,629
Wait for me, Tomoyo-chan.

218
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,359
I will keep on looking for you.

219
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,601
Right,

220
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,033
last time my shadow got caught was…

221
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,069
What’s wrong!?

222
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,676
Shao Lan-kun, Kero-chan!

223
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:06,605
Turn on the schools lights!

224
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,075
How come you’re saying that now?

225
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,212
– Please!
– Got ya!

226
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,595
O Key which hides the forces of darkness,

227
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,136
reveal thy true form before me

228
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:32,166
I, Sakura, command you…

229
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:34,937
Release!

230
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:49,121
O Card created by Clow,

231
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,824
discard thine old form and be reborn.

232
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,794
Under the name of Sakura, thy new Mistress.

233
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,691
Shadow!

234
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,176
Shadow, go and find that persons shadow.

235
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,368
The song is coming from in there!

236
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,197
It’s in there!

237
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,234
Tomoyo-chan!

238
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,482
Tomoyo-chan!

239
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:50,414
Sorry, you were here by yourself,
I bet you were scared!

240
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:55,655
No, Because I knew that
you would come and find me.

241
00:18:57,894 --> 00:18:58,952
Tomoyo-chan

242
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:15,774
What’s wrong?

243
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:19,509
I felt someone over there.

244
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:22,484
Clow’s presence has disappeared.

245
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,948
Everything is back to normal.

246
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,093
Whenever she changes a card

247
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,535
her power goes up

248
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,967
I should be more careful.

249
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,944
I heard your song.

250
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:52,173
I thought it would be easier to find me.

251
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,377
When I saw that you disappeared,

252
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:56,710
I really wanted to cry.

253
00:19:57,353 --> 00:20:00,789
But Shao Lan-kun said the crying won’t
do anything speech.

254
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,886
I would’ve cried really hard.

255
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,288
So I stopped crying

256
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,564
and thought about where are you

257
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,657
But I couldn’t.

258
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:14,928
But then I heard your song.

259
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:16,796
Once I heard it

260
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,471
I thought about where you were again.

261
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,741
Then I thought of the idea!

262
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:22,942
Thank you.

263
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,940
I should be thanking you.

264
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:27,146
Thank you for finding me.

265
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,151
But, still, I have this problem…

266
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,454
What?

267
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,386
Because we were separated,

268
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:39,284
I wasn’t able to videotape you!

269
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,563
Alright! Because you are so great,

270
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,392
I’ll let you videotape me

271
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,964
Thank you for offering!

272
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,466
That is no problem!
How should I pose?

273
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:53,874
Is this good?

274
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:56,504
How about this?

275
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,506
– Thank you, Shao Lan-kun.
– Why do you want to thank me?

276
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,847
Because you told me not to cry.

277
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,614
But it wasn’t just today.

278
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:07,721
So I really want to thank you.

279
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,389
– I…
– What?

280
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,525
No matter what you’re thinking,

281
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,101
if you don’t say it then you
won’t be able to transmit it.

282
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,207
Actually,

283
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,011
I…

284
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:30,738
To you…

285
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,247
You…

286
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:39,851
Sakura! Lets both go and be videotaped!

287
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,384
Now, I’ll give this to you.

288
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,453
Look I can pose this way.

289
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:46,922
This is my great pose.

290
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,663
This is really great!

291
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,334
Why don’t you put this on?

292
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:55,203
Then tomorrow at school I’ll
give you the tape for you.

293
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:57,837
Sakura, put your hand up a little more!
