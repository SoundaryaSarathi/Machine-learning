1
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,220
Granny, I've found him.

2
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,390
The person who's the most important to me.

3
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,770
Granny, I'm sure that my tears, through him...

4
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,760
What's wrong? Not turning on the lights...

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,650
Onii-chan,

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Shinichirou told me that he likes me.

7
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,530
And he wants me to go out with him.

8
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,450
I see, isn't that great?

9
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,070
Right now... I want to cry.

10
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,980
I wonder why that is...

11
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm not even sad, and yet...

12
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,760
I really, really want to cry.

13
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,070
It must be because I'm happy...

14
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,870
My birthday is later,

15
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,020
so Shinichirou-kun is my older brother.

16
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,210
I said it...

17
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,280
Look at me too...

18
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,780
Please...

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,550
Shinichirou...

20
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,840
It was soft...

21
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,450
What am I doing...

22
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,760
Thank you!

23
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,730
Why did I smile?

24
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,590
I'm sorry...

25
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,260
But I don't really have that kind of feelings towards Ai-chan.

26
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,010
To me you're a childhood friend, and Miyokichi's girlfriend.

27
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,490
I'll forget what happened just now.

28
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,250
Let's just pretend nothing's happened today.

29
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,890
Shinichirou, you going to Ai-chan's today?

30
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,650
Well, err... Today, I...

31
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,360
Come on, since all you do is slack around, let's go together!

32
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,010
Well, I...

33
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,170
Might be going on a date or something...

34
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,420
A date...?

35
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,970
With who?

36
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,730
Isurugi... Noe...

37
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,500
She's not around...

38
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,280
Well, it's not like I asked her in advance.

39
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,030
Noe...

40
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,120
What are you doing?

41
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,950
Ground looked like he was cold.

42
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,310
Huh? Are those two dating?

43
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,490
Seems like it...

44
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,680
Isurugi Noe, how surprising!

45
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,480
I've always thought that Nakagami-kun likes Hiromi.

46
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,190
Like that could happen.

47
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,530
Don't fall!

48
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,970
This feels great!

49
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,860
Shinichirou, you don't look very happy.

50
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,550
Sit down.

51
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,370
Crouch.

52
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,000
Wh- What?

53
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,500
Shinichirou looks like he's cold too.

54
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,840
Look.

55
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,480
What is it?

56
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,570
What do you see behind me?

57
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,500
The sky...

58
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,060
I want Shinichirou to always keep looking towards the sky.

59
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,360
I've never looked at the sky like this before.

60
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,720
"The first time Raigoumaru wanted to fly in the sky,"

61
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,700
"was after a stormy night."

62
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,940
"It was a breezy afternoon with a clear sky."

63
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,720
What's that?

64
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,220
A picture book I'm writing.

65
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,030
Eh?! Then what comes next?

66
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,670
What happens after that?!

67
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:34,370
"Because of the wind the day before, broken straws and grass are everywhere, scattering across the ground."

68
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,390
"Even those worms, delicious and usually hard-to-find,"

69
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,150
"Could be easily discovered."

70
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,300
What comes after that?

71
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,610
That's all I have now.

72
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,340
I want to hear what comes next!

73
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,160
Eh?

74
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,130
You'll continue writing it, right?

75
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,640
Hurry up and write it!

76
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,410
Y- Yes...

77
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,050
Here I go!

78
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,040
"Raigoumaru drifted into slumber, dreaming a dream where he decided upon the day of his first flight."

79
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,260
"Every single day,"

80
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,120
"Raigoumaru trained himself in order to fly,"

81
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,930
"To stand strong while facing the wind."

82
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,520
"Finally, the day comes when he'll fly in the sky..."

83
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,900
Let's stop here today.

84
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,440
I'm happy...

85
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,360
Because Shinichirou's writing about Raigoumaru,

86
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,780
And reviving Raigoumaru in the picture books!

87
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,790
I'm sure he'll be able to fly high!

88
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,840
Shinichirou could fly high as well.

89
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,650
This must be what's going to become the wings of Shinichirou!

90
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,950
Thank you.

91
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,690
Shinichirou's face is as red as a rooster's cockscomb.

92
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,960
Bu- But you suddenly...!

93
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,340
I will grow to like Shinichirou more and more!

94
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,300
Would you let me like you more?

95
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,480
Yeah.

96
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,180
Don't leave me alone...

97
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,730
Don't leave me alone...

98
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,470
Don't leave me alone...

99
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,240
I...

100
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,670
Master, your hair looks like a cockscomb!

101
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,390
This is... the shape of happiness!

102
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,280
Shape of happiness, huh?

103
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,350
Not like I could make it.

104
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,450
Good morning.

105
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,630
Good morning.

106
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,640
Seems you're getting along well.

107
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,410
Eh?

108
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,290
With Isurugi Noe.

109
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
Sure...

110
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,640
That's a weird hairstyle.

111
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,480
I'm going out.

112
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,910
Hiromi,

113
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,030
Is there anything troubling you at home?

114
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,800
If something happened, just tell me.

115
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,240
You're one of this family's children as well.

116
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,620
That stance...

117
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,280
Resembles your mother alot.

118
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,470
You're really the same, huh?

119
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,850
Acting all innocent,

120
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,560
And easily controlling men's hearts.

121
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,780
You even made the people in this house and Shinichirou your allies.

122
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,350
You're quite brilliant.

123
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,220
It's always snowing when we meet, huh?

124
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,880
Where do you want to go?

125
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,950
To a town where it doesn't snow.

126
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,790
There's a nice place.

127
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,620
The only thing that we have in common.

128
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,840
Let's play a game.

129
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,410
For every basket you score, the other must answer a question.

130
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,960
And you must tell the truth.

131
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,610
Three times each.

132
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,930
You can shoot here,

133
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,210
And I'll be shooting from here.

134
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,270
Nope.

135
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,010
You'll be shooting from here.

136
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,140
Didn't expect you to be this pushy.

137
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,490
It's fine if you don't want to.

138
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,930
Got it.

139
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,440
"When he woke up in the morning, he heard a cackling voice."

140
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,000
"Turns out that it was Ground, pecking feed off the ground."

141
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,120
"Raigoumaru wanted to say that it was his share, but he didn't."

142
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,590
"Because there was still a lot of food."

143
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,530
"Raigoumaru climbed up to the top of the hill."

144
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,270
"It was a huge embankment, reaching 10 meters tall."

145
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,720
"Looking from there, it seemed like the ground was the underworld."

146
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,210
"Now, let's fly!" {this is probably also part of the story}

147
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,200
It's wonderful...

148
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,120
I just got the urge to go see Ground.

149
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,600
You got two baskets in, and I got zero.

150
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,310
So what are they? Your questions.

151
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,370
How many boys has Isurugi Noe dated?

152
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
What for?

153
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,120
Don't mind that.

154
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,570
Zero.

155
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,440
Perhaps you misunderstood Noe.

156
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,960
Because she's different, a lot of things were said.

157
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,270
Rumors spread, but Noe didn't do anything about it.

158
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,220
She's strong.

159
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,920
Way back, she was always crying.

160
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,640
But, after a certain event,

161
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,480
she stopped crying.

162
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Since then, she grew strong.

163
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,300
But, in truth...

164
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,140
Siscon!

165
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:36,050
TL Note: Like "lolicon". Sister complex - somebody who is attracted to his sister in a more than familial way.

166
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,970
So even you can make that kind of face.

167
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,100
What's the next question?

168
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,040
Why are you going out with me?

169
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,730
It was Nakagami Shinichirou who asked me to go out with you.

170
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,480
As an exchange, he's going out with Noe.

171
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,790
What the hell's that?

172
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,510
That's how it is.

173
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,570
So that means,

174
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,880
If one side breaks up,

175
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,000
The other must break up as well, isn't that right?

176
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,580
That would be troublesome for me.

177
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,440
No matter what you ask for, I will hear you out, so...

178
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,150
It's my first time to come to school on a day off.

179
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,850
I like it.

180
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,990
To be at the school with Shinichirou when no one else's there.

181
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,590
Noe...

182
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,270
Onii-chan...

183
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,560
Looks like it's going well for you.

184
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,940
Same for you.

185
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,770
I've got a slightly better opinion of you now.

186
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,450
Since you are the first one who seriously got in a fight with me.

187
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,990
That's a cute smile.

188
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,160
You used that innocent face to grab a hold of Shinichirou's heart, right?

189
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,270
That's incredible.

190
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,880
I'm heading home.

191
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,930
Hey!

192
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,200
Do you think the words that slipped from my lips were my true feelings?

193
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,160
Eh?

194
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,720
I don't want to think that way, though...

195
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,870
Things like that happen often, don't they?

196
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,670
But if you could control your feelings freely,

197
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,320
I wonder how easy life would be.

198
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,260
I'm saying the exact same things...

199
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,720
What?

200
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,290
You surprised me, suddenly showing up there...

201
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,020
This was my mother, right?

202
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,990
Couldn't blame you.

203
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,200
I might have done the same thing if I were you.

204
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,800
But...

205
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,720
You know, that's actually...

206
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,350
Still, that was my mother!

207
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,560
Hiromi...

208
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,880
I shouldn't have come to this family.

209
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,790
It was a mistake coming here...

210
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,510
Sorry for being a bother till now!

211
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,750
Take me on a ride on your bike.

212
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,840
I've told you. No riding while there's snow.

213
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,430
I don't want to die just yet.

214
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,510
You told me you'd hear me out, no matter what it was, right?

215
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,630
Where do you want to go?

216
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,500
To a town where it doesn't snow.

217
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,640
During the festival, I'll be at the front row looking at Shinichirou dancing!

218
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,570
Well, despite all those expectations, my dancing isn't that nice.

219
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
Hey, promise me,

220
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,010
If you spot me in the crowd during the dance,

221
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
Fly high, like Raigoumaru!

222
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,740
I couldn't do that!

223
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,930
Besides, the choreography is already decided.

224
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,630
It's fine if you do something that only I would understand, right?

225
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,070
Well, sure...

226
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,210
Also, the picture book.

227
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,910
Finish it quickly.

228
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,510
Shinichirou in a dress as well as the picture book...

229
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,790
Before winter ends, I should be able to see it, right?

230
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,190
Yeah, I bet.

231
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,130
Riding a bike, even when there's snow...?

232
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,140
Hiromi!

233
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,170
Was that onii-chan?

234
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
No way...

235
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,820
I grew tired...

236
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,840
Could you stay here for a bit longer?

237
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,160
Mom, you're acting too strange.

238
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,540
All you've done is teaching Hiromi these strange ways of thinking.

239
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,960
Flying isn't easy...
