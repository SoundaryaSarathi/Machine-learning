1
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,584
This will be the last day
of your training.

2
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:27,919
Your joke studies might
have been a little lacking,

3
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,752
but I think I've taught
you the gist of it.

4
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:36,258
Let's review everything
up to now. Try it all out.

5
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,387
First up, Bubbles...

6
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:53,044
Ready!

7
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:53,840
Start!

8
00:00:56,715 --> 00:01:00,048
0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

9
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:06,558
Next up, Gregory...

10
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:07,718
Right!

11
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:18,459
Ready!

12
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:20,538
Start!

13
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,570
Here I go!

14
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:30,111
Huh?

15
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,184
1.2 seconds!

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,651
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

17
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:37,188
Okay, what's next?

18
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:40,859
All right! Last up,
the <i>Genki Dama</i> check.

19
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,349
I've been waiting for this!

20
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,838
All right, ready, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

21
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,181
Okay then, here goes!

22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,682
Try locking onto this
giant brick at super-speed.

23
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,042
Okay! Super-speed!

24
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,808
No trouble at all!

25
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,285
Nicely done, Son Goku.

26
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:52,524
I honestly didn't think you'd be able
to handle the <i>Genki Dama</i> as well as this.

27
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,889
I really worked hard at it!

28
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,695
I know it's tedious
hearing this so many times,

29
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,531
but the <i>Genki Dama</i>
is a technique that takes

30
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,367
all of the <i>Genki</i> energy
from grass and trees,

31
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,536
from people and animals,

32
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,539
and even things and the atmosphere,
and allocates a little bit

33
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,202
from each of their energies,
concentrates it, and shoots it.

34
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,548
Even a <i>Genki Dama</i>
from a planet as small as this

35
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,217
had that kind of destructive force.

36
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,052
The earth, where you'll be fighting,

37
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,385
is so much larger than this planet,
it doesn't even compare.

38
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,830
You can also harness the support
of the sun's enormous energy.

39
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,499
It will be a <i>Genki Dama</i>
of incredible power.

40
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,500
If you slip up,

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,493
it wouldn't be too hard to destroy
the very planet you're trying to protect.

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,510
If you can help it, don't use it at all,
although I will permit you

43
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,002
to use it one time, if there's
nothing else you can do. Got it?

44
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:54,185
Got it! I'm sure I can manage
using just the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique!

45
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:57,722
That's it! The day of
battle is nearly at hand.

46
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,691
The Saiyans will land
on Earth tomorrow.

47
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,865
Oh, hell!

48
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,868
W-what!? What's wrong!?

49
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:12,370
Well, it's just that- I didn't
figure the time it would take

50
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,874
for you to go down the Serpentine
Road again into my calculations.

51
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:22,213
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you mean you can't send me
whooshing back to the Lower Realm!?

52
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,548
No...

53
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:26,985
I- I have to travel back
down that road again!?

54
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:29,554
It took me all of half
a year just to come here!

55
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:32,490
Well, as you are now,
you can get there in two days.

56
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,160
I'll tell Earth's Kami
to come and pick you up.

57
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,164
That will still be a day too late!
Everyone will be killed!

58
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:44,498
Stop your griping!
Even I make mistakes sometimes!

59
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,173
Now, hurry and tell
your friends on Earth

60
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:53,007
to use those Dragonball things
to have you brought back to life!

61
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,848
Tell them!? How!?

62
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:00,518
Put one of your hands on my back,
and speak to them inside your mind.

63
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:02,186
That will get through to them.

64
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,177
R- really?

65
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:06,858
Like this?

66
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,018
Hurry and tell them!

67
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:18,200
<i>O</i>- <i>Old Timer! lt's Goku!</i>
<i>Can you hear me? Hey, Old Timer!</i>

68
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,646
<i>Nice! What a hot gal!</i>

69
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:35,980
G- Goku!? Goku, is that you!?
W- where are you!? Where are you!?

70
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:42,727
<i>He heard me! Old Timer,</i>
<i>l'm still in the Next World.</i>

71
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:45,890
<i>l'm talking to you</i>
<i>with my mind from here.</i>

72
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:51,362
The Next World?

73
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:55,173
<i>Have you gotten all</i>
<i>the Dragonballs together?</i>

74
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:59,577
Y- yeah. We've had them together
for a while now, just to save you.

75
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:01,738
We all searched for them like mad.

76
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:07,318
<i>Thanks! So, I hate to ask,</i>
<i>but could you summon Shen Long,</i>

77
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:10,253
<i>and get me brought back to life?</i>

78
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:14,192
<i>The Saiyans are going</i>
<i>to be on Earth tomorrow!</i>

79
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,682
W- what!?

80
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:22,200
T- tomorrow, already? That's a whole
month sooner than we thought.

81
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,534
<i>Hurry, Old Timer.</i>

82
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:27,937
<i>l'm going to be a little late,</i>
<i>but I promise you, l'll manage something!</i>

83
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,697
Hey, Goku!

84
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,105
Um, you're hurting me...

85
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:37,482
I'm sorry!

86
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:42,820
A- all right, you got it!
By the way, Goku, how did it go?

87
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,950
I heard you were training there
in the Next World. How did that turn out?

88
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:49,892
<i>Fantastic!</i>

89
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,297
That's a relief to hear.

90
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,236
Hey, is he all right?

91
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:02,507
Old Man Turtle Hermit is muttering
to himself in the bathroom.

92
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:04,737
I wonder if he's gone senile...

93
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,511
Hey! Get the Dragonballs ready, now!

94
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:23,918
That was amazing, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!
I got right through to him!

95
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:25,863
Well, sure you did.

96
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:27,865
I can finally come back to life.

97
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:31,536
All right. Now, while you're waiting
to be brought back to life,

98
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:35,097
let me do something about those
heavy, tattered clothes of yours.

99
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,196
Really?

100
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,214
Awesome! They've gotten lighter!

101
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:52,986
They're not just lighter; they're made
from a wonderfully hard-wearing fabric.

102
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,228
It will even deflect
your more minor attacks.

103
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,526
Thank you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

104
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:03,234
Terrific! The " turtle" mark
is still in its place!

105
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:08,228
I was worried that my clothes
would look ugly, like yours, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

106
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:11,534
Well, excuse me.

107
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,577
I hope they bring me
back to life soon!

108
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:22,076
The mark on your back is the most
stylish point on the outfit, right?

109
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:24,910
Yeah!

110
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,209
What's wrong with you!? You can't
defeat your enemy by just dodging him!

111
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,870
<i>Oh, no! I must have inadvertently</i>
<i>hit him a little too hard.</i>

112
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,920
That's not fair. You said
you wouldn't use your eyes.

113
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,584
Don't be presumptuous! You think that sort
of promise is valid when you're fighting!?

114
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:38,185
But Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you're not the enemy.

115
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:46,401
Okay... come forth, Shen Long!

116
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:20,302
It's the middle of the day,
yet suddenly it's gotten dark!

117
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,175
Don't touch me!

118
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:40,180
N- no matter how many times
you see it, it's still scary, huh?

119
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:01,409
Speak forth thy wish.
I shall grant thee any one wish.

120
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:10,588
S- say, um, asking for you to defeat
the Saiyans and save the earth...

121
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,318
would be useless for us
to wish for, huh?

122
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:18,229
What are you talking about!?
Do you mean to let Son-<i>kun</i> stay dead!?

123
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:19,730
I- it's not that!

124
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,901
It would be simpler this way, and we could
always wish Goku back the next time!

125
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:30,708
That wish is not possible.
I was created of Kami.

126
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:36,847
As such, I cannot grant a wish
that surpasses Kami's power.

127
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:40,518
Then, please bring
Son Goku back to life.

128
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:44,181
That will be an easy wish to grant.

129
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,844
<i>Son Goku is about to</i>
<i>come back to life, huh?</i>

130
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,816
<i>Which would mean that the Saiyans</i>
<i>are coming sooner than we expected!</i>

131
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,897
All right! The ring over your head
has vanished! You're alive again!

132
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,660
They did it!

133
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,503
--Move quickly!
--Right!

134
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:36,907
Remember, your foes are villains
who are more powerful than you can imagine.

135
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:39,577
They won't allow you to be
careless for even an instant.

136
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,513
You can't go thinking you can always
be brought back to life again!

137
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:46,517
That's okay. You can only be brought
back to life with the Dragonballs once.

138
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,213
I'm going to go at them
as hard as I can! Watch me!

139
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:57,290
Thanks for everything, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!
If I die, I'll come see you again.

140
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:58,851
Bubbles!

141
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,531
Gregory!

142
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:01,532
Take care!

143
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,521
Bye, now!

144
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,080
Bye!

145
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,169
That guy must have
bottomless strength!

146
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,006
And yet, his heart
is clearer than crystal.

147
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,998
To think that there's a guy
like that in the lower realm...

148
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,941
He has become even stronger
than you, hasn't he, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

149
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,186
Still, his sense of humor
was lacking somewhat.

150
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,349
Next time he comes here,
I'll train him more on that.

151
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,535
Whoo! So light, so light!

152
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,060
My body feels as light as downy fluff!

153
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,534
<i>That's right!</i>

154
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,240
<i>This ain't any time to be</i>
<i>impressed! l've got to hurry!</i>

155
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:32,389
<i>And so, the next day,</i>
<i>at 11:43 in the morning,</i>

156
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:38,328
<i>the earth at last yielded itself</i>
<i>to the two Saiyans' incursion.</i>

157
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,313
Papa, I'm hungry.

158
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,713
Is it that late already?

159
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:50,629
W- what was that?

160
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,325
What happened?

161
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,844
T- this is a surprise!

162
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,573
It looks like something fell down here!

163
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,190
T- that's it, all right!
That round thing fell down here!

164
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,623
There's one over here, too!

165
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,207
It's a person!

166
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,112
There's a person coming out of it!

00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,886
Over here, too!

168
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,086
It's a person!

169
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,490
W- what the-?

170
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:13,578
So, the Saiyans have finally come.

171
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:18,177
Their <i>Ki</i> is enormous, huh, Piccolo-<i>san</i>?

172
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,921
T- Ten-<i>san</i>...

173
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,993
They're here a lot sooner than we thought.

174
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:59,385
<i>At last, the dreaded day had arrived.</i>
