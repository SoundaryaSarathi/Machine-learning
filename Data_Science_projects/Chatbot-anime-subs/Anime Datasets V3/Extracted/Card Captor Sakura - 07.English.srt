1
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,474
[Sakura’s first trial as a thief]

2
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:02,321
Not done yet?

3
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:05,288
Just a little more.
Wait just a bit longer.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,159
My patience is about to snap.

5
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,088
Done!

6
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,830
Well, let me see

7
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:13,863
Here

8
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,033
Eh? Is that supposed to be me?

9
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,296
Yeah, I drew it pretty cute, huh?

10
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,436
I don’t have such a goofy face

11
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,171
Really? I think it looks pretty close

12
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:25,705
It doesn’t.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,947
Look closely.

14
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,381
Don’t you think
my brow brings out my eyes?

15
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:36,318
Or perhaps it should be more smooth

16
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:38,388
Sakura, time to eat

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,727
OK!

18
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,291
Hey!

19
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,925
Listen to what
somebody is saying until the end

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,498
Later, OK?

21
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,094
Really…

22
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,697
This is me?

23
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,904
I won’t allow it

24
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:00,909
It looks great

25
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,714
What were you doing upstairs?

26
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,308
I was drawing.

27
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,585
Tomorrow for a special lesson we’re going
to the museum to draw

28
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,113
So you were practicing?

29
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:10,253
Yeah

30
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,058
Even so, you seemed pretty lively

31
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:16,796
That’s because if I don’t talk,

32
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,326
I can’t draw well

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,891
If you make noise like that in the museum,

34
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,369
they’ll kick you out

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,032
No they wouldn’t

36
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,736
But, try not to interfere with
the people who came to see the paintings

37
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,074
Will they really kick me out?

38
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:32,076
I don’t think they would do that, but…

39
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:40,020
I am the head of this museum

40
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,619
What we would like you to draw

41
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,423
Are the things on this floor
and in the courtyard

42
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,284
Tomoyo-chan, it really is quiet in here

43
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:48,618
Yes, it is very peaceful

44
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:49,955
That’s right

45
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,896
Well then, those who want to draw
in the courtyard, come with me

46
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:56,069
Tomoyo-chan, where are you going?

47
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:58,970
I thought I would draw this sculpture here

48
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,675
If you like, we can both draw it

49
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:02,939
Yeah

50
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,710
Chiharu-chan and the others left

51
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,946
Would you
rather have gone to the courtyard?

52
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,421
No. So, shall we draw?

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,622
Yes

54
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,788
Geeze

55
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,093
Shuu…

56
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,891
I’m sorry

57
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:31,433
Why, that Kero-chan

58
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:41,276
I’m done, how about you Tomoyo-chan?

59
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,076
Incredible

60
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,157
Tomoyo-chan, why don’t we go look
at the courtyard for a bit?

61
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,050
I want to finish my picture

62
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,186
Well, I’ll be right back then

63
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,599
I wonder how you get to the courtyard

64
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,640
What are you doing?

65
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,806
Let go! Let go!

66
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:13,610
Why are you trying to damage the painting?

67
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:15,576
Why would I damage it?

68
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:17,378
Then what is this?

69
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,310
That is my papa’s painting

70
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,617
It’s a picture papa painted of me,

71
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,647
but somebody changed it

72
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,422
They drew that woman over it

73
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,755
That’s impossible

74
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,152
Wait!

75
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:31,760
Why you!

76
00:04:55,656 --> 00:05:00,389
Come quietly. So, come this way

77
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:10,701
Smile by Tenkai Tachibana

78
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:18,277
Sakura-chan

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,004
It’s already time for us to leave

80
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,643
Yes!

81
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,086
A picture in the museum moved?

82
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,025
Yeah, then all of a sudden
I couldn’t hear anything,

83
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:36,928
but only for an instant

84
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,190
It couldn’t be that, could it?

85
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,262
Something with a grudge

86
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,705
that goes beyond death

87
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:48,100
I’m sure that picture is cursed and

88
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:50,268
Was it that scary?

89
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,706
It wasn’t scary at all, at the time

90
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,280
Sakura!

91
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,244
You are sensitive to ghosts
or monsters aren’t you?

92
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,682
Which means, couldn’t it just be.

93
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,322
A Clow Card

94
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,793
Shall we go check together?

95
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,296
Yeah

96
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:21,906
Sakura-chan?

97
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:25,002
Good evening

98
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,003
Yukito-san

99
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,211
What’s going on? This late at night

100
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,943
Umm …Let’s see

101
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:38,254
I thought I would go look at the moon

102
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:43,391
There are a lot of stars out too

103
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,125
I wonder if Touya is home

104
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:47,696
Yes, he is home

105
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:52,001
Umm, about my brother

106
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:55,302
Sakura-chan is asleep upstairs.

107
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,574
I can’t see her tonight

108
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:01,745
Yukito-san

109
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,683
But, don’t stay out too late

110
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,009
Yeah

111
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,764
Swinging from depression to being happy.

112
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,629
What a busy person you are

113
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:22,192
I wonder if he thought I was rude

114
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,965
But, then he was looking out for me

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,865
But, then

116
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:29,904
How idiotic

117
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:31,971
Hurry up, Tomoyo is waiting for us

118
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,874
Yukito-san

119
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,607
Silent?

120
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,118
That means without sound, right?

121
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:40,881
Exactly,

122
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,223
It’s a card that hates loud things

123
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:47,021
That’s why we think
it’s in a quiet place like a museum

124
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,595
What is Silent’s power?

125
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,357
Today it only made the sound disappear

126
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,329
That’s not all.

127
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:58,065
When she goes shhh at the same
time as the sound goes away

128
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,901
At the same time, what?

129
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,433
I don’t really know

130
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,138
And you call yourself the beast of the seal?

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,041
She doesn’t really talk,

132
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,976
so I don’t know her personality

133
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,212
Sakura-chan

134
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,880
Come, let’s change

135
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,450
I thought so

136
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,092
These clothes are
more restrained than the usual

137
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,603
Yes, a cat burglar mustn’t stick out

138
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,171
I’m not really stealing anything though

139
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:39,177
But, you’re sneaking into a guarded museum,

140
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:41,808
so you have to dress appropriately

141
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,641
What’s that?

142
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:46,181
It’s the schedule chart for the museum guards

143
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,915
Wow! How did you get that?

144
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,085
I went back to the museum earlier

145
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:52,923
and picked it up.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,486
Umm…

147
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,187
According to this,

148
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,794
it’s about an hour from now

149
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,395
when the guard comes to
where the problem picture is

150
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,660
We don’t have much time

151
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,037
Yeah

152
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,505
To be safe,

153
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:07,806
I’ll set my alarm for five minutes before then

154
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,803
Well then, mission start

155
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:38,871
I wonder what they’re doing

156
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:40,969
It’s suspicious

157
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:42,934
We’re plenty suspicious ourselves

158
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:46,071
They must be here to steal works of art

159
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:47,742
So it’s a thief?

160
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:49,982
What should we do?
We can’t leave them alone

161
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:52,485
Let’s have them leave

162
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,215
What do you plan on doing?

163
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:55,979
With this

164
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,632
Who are you?

165
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:18,010
What are you doing there?

166
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,607
Hurry and get out

167
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,378
Who is there?

168
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:23,942
Are you over there?

169
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,112
They seem pretty perseverant,
they aren’t running

170
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,584
That voice just now

171
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:28,719
It sounded like a child

172
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:29,985
There is no choice, do it

173
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,216
OK

174
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:32,187
Come out!

175
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,660
Listen well,

176
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:38,565
I am the protective god of this place
Leave now!

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,699
What do you mean protective god?

178
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,129
You’re probably the one defacing the pictures

179
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,098
It seems they are coming over here

180
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:46,430
That was not expected

181
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:49,373
Don’t move from over there

182
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,442
Umm…

183
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,174
Um…

184
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:04,685
It was a child after all

185
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:06,715
Ah, this kid

186
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:08,353
Do you know him?

187
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,829
Today in here

188
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,193
Hurry and help me

189
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:22,902
It seems that he’s waking up

190
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:24,711
Owl…

191
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:25,936
Are you OK?

192
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:31,977
Don’t panic

193
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,586
This is just a stuffed animal

194
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,480
But, earlier

195
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,257
That was just ventriloquism

196
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,488
I thought you were a thief

197
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:42,987
What a weird face

198
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:44,657
I was all surprised for nothing

199
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,463
I’m not a thief,

200
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,302
but what are you people doing here?

201
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,004
If you are the criminal
who defaced the painting,

202
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,231
I won’t forgive you.

203
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:55,497
We didn’t do that

204
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,834
We’re wonderful cat burglars

205
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,179
We wouldn’t do that

206
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,013
Cat burglars? That means

207
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,849
That’s not it, we just came back
for something we forgot

208
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,618
Well then, what about those clothes?

209
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,080
This is

210
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,547
Umm

211
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,951
Our hobby

212
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,519
As long as you aren’t the ones
who defaced the painting.

213
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:17,228
I’m in a hurry

214
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,528
Wait a moment, Yuuki-kun

215
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,800
How did you know my name?

216
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,472
I see, at that time

217
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:32,005
Yuuki-kun, were you really
trying to damage the painting?

218
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,608
I wasn’t trying to damage it,

219
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,413
I was trying to return it to how it was

220
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:39,577
My papa drew that painting

221
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,451
My papa is the artist Tenkai Tachibana

222
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,587
I know of Tenkai-sensei,

223
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,184
he has painted many wonderful pieces

224
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,463
But last year didn’t he…

225
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,829
Autumn of last year,

226
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,894
he died of his illness.

227
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,975
That painting was made last summer,

228
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,868
on what was the last family trip with papa

229
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:10,376
It was a painting he wanted to paint his best

230
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:13,878
as a memory of coming to the sea with me

231
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:18,087
Mama says it was her favorite painting too

232
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:20,652
And then,

233
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,591
somebody drew on top of it

234
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:26,760
On top of my precious memory with papa

235
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,796
How terrible! I know how you feel,

236
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,307
when my picture was drawn over

237
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:35,938
I was really angry

238
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:39,412
Yuuki-kun, we will help too

239
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:40,937
I don’t need it.

240
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,509
I can do it alone

241
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,847
What? When we are going
through all the trouble of

242
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:47,845
It’s ventriloquism

243
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:51,319
Don’t say that, let’s go together

244
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:52,884
Do as you like,

245
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,588
just don’t get in the way

246
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,357
What an unlovable child

247
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,661
That took more time than we expected,

248
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,962
let’s hurry

249
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:01,996
Yeah

250
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,634
I can’t use magic in front of Yuuki-kun

251
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,411
And we can’t scare him off

252
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,380
I’ll talk to him, and at that time OK?

253
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:23,414
It’s this picture

254
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,215
This is definitely Silent

255
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:30,093
The graffiti is still new

256
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,894
It’s oil paint so I should be
able to get it off if

257
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:34,959
You really know your stuff

258
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,562
It’s because I want to be a painter like my papa

259
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,239
I am sure you can be

260
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:43,571
But Yuuki-kun,

261
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,305
repairing oil paints is difficult

262
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,678
Why don’t you
leave it to the museum people?

263
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:52,013
I can’t leave it to them

264
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:53,644
Can you do it?

265
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:56,315
I can. I will fix it myself

266
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:02,886
If you speak too loud, the guard will come

267
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,741
Huh?

268
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,443
The courtyard?

269
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,341
It happened again

270
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:25,945
When I get close to papa’s picture

271
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:27,843
I am suddenly outside

272
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:30,251
This must be Silent’s power

273
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,222
When you make noise,
it throws you outside huh?

274
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:36,455
Good thing it didn’t do that earlier today

275
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:38,931
Can you believe this?

276
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:42,697
I think it’ll be ok if I came during the day
since a monster won’t come

277
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,927
What can we do?

278
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,206
A monster?

279
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,002
Say, Yuuki-kun .

280
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:54,704
This happened because you spoke too loud
during the day and just now

281
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:58,176
So, if you stay quiet,

282
00:15:58,385 --> 00:15:59,784
Wouldn’t the monster not do anything?

283
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,212
So, we just have to stay quiet?

284
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:03,678
Yeah

285
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,583
But if it is a monster, I can’t get it off

286
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:06,948
Then are you going home?

287
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:08,956
No, we can get in from over here

288
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,460
Let’s go

289
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,937
If you use magic

290
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,629
you can blame it on the monster

291
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:29,105
It can’t be

292
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,373
At just that sound?

293
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:49,691
Quiet!

294
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,161
We don’t have much time

295
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:53,197
Ish…

296
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,104
Ish… Ish…

297
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:09,780
Damn it

298
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:11,957
It was just a sneeze

299
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,393
This means you can’t recite a spell

300
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:16,663
Isn’t there some way?

301
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:19,959
I’ll do it alone

302
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:21,392
Wait, Yuuki-kun!

303
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,269
The guard will be coming soon

304
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,068
If we get caught too

305
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,533
what will we do about Silent?

306
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:31,340
Who is there?

307
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:34,439
Don’t run! Wait right there!

308
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,044
He was caught

309
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:41,319
Here is bad too

310
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:42,486
Let’s hide

311
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,315
We have to help him

312
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,990
You’re the one from earlier today

313
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,226
Let go! Let go!

314
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:49,390
What should we do?

315
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:53,197
Oh yeah!

316
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,303
Shadow,

317
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,598
project me through the glass

318
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,209
Shadow!

319
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:21,392
It’s a ghost, let go of me!

320
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:22,390
Calm down

321
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:24,027
Here goes.

322
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,524
Hey, wait!

323
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:29,765
I did it!

324
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,430
Just what I would expect

325
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,235
That just leaves

326
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:36,132
Return to your rightful form

327
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:37,100
Here

328
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:38,138
Ah,

329
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,310
Thank you

330
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,448
Return to your rightful form

331
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,482
Clow Card!

332
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:03,698
That was a big success

333
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,538
Where are they hiding?

334
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,534
Yeah

335
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:13,544
Geeze

336
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,179
It’s terrible! The picture was changed!

337
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:27,185
It was no good after all. The guard saw me

338
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:30,319
That’s not true, look

339
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,476
It’s back to normal, papa

340
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:51,776
So you’re a girl

341
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:52,877
I’m sorry!

342
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:54,312
I call you Yuuki-kun.

343
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:56,849
No, I’m sorry too

344
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,153
The long hair is very cute

345
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:01,857
Yeah

346
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:05,765
Take care!

347
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:07,200
Take care!

348
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,264
Thank you, both of you

349
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,527
Thank you a lot!

350
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,537
Bye bye!

351
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,575
She was trying her best for her father

352
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:20,939
Yuuki-kun, I mean Yuuki-chan

353
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,450
The heart of a child thinking
of the parent

354
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:26,043
Pretty good story isn’t it?

355
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:27,113
Kero-chan,

356
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,315
that’s pretty cool

357
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:34,191
The mission is complete and our plan is over

358
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:37,321
By the way, that was a pretty good
way to think of using Shadow

359
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,561
I remembered your shadow

360
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,763
So it was all because of me

361
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,806
It’s the aura of a Clow Card
