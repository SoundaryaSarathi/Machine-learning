1
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,671
Every weekday's tightly packed.

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,219
Madly dashing around
again since morning.

3
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,518
"Rat race?" "Looks like fun."
But surprisingly death-defying.

4
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,785
What I'd like is a slow lifestyle.

5
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:34,196
My wish made on a shootin' star.

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,894
But there's no mercy, 100÷3.

7
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,539
Full of things you can't divide.

8
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,268
Full of things you can't divide.
Genshiken

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:47,040
That's why I've carried
this in my hands...

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,540
...a limitless dream!

11
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:57,213
I jam-packed the "rest" with it...

12
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,759
...or at least I've tried to!

13
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:09,291
A modest happiness.
A shared joy!

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:16,274
We're about to etch them now
right into our youth.

15
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,777
So lonely to just walk on by.

16
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,246
So sad to have this frustration!

17
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,513
Let's take a break from today...

18
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,789
...and break into song!

19
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,589
...and break into song!

20
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,993
Episode 13
My Name Is Ogiue and I Hate Otaku

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,637
A year sure does go by fast.

22
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,197
Huh?

23
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,606
I was thinking it's time for
the activities fair already.

24
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,306
Yeah, now that you mention it.
A whole year...

25
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,781
I wonder if any new members
will join this year.

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,751
I couldn't tell you.

27
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:03,983
I mean, you saw how Kasukabe
turned them all away last year.

28
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,081
Ahh... true.

29
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,796
It's like, I'd rather not
give my name out to otaku.

30
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,397
You should know that even
if this is a welcome party...

31
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,764
...I don't feel like welcoming anyone.

32
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,031
Well, I do have a feeling she's
a little more well-rounded now.

33
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,007
Really, you do?

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,404
Don't you think so?

35
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,048
Up and to the right a bit.

36
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:32,844
Okay.

37
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,653
So how about Kujiun: Second Term?

38
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,383
Heh.

39
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,656
I didn't think it would happen, so I guess
the fact that it did is pretty good.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,956
Maybe.

41
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,132
Just so long as they give us
a certain level of...

42
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,794
...quality this time
and don't muddle it up.

43
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,031
Anime turns people into adults.

44
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,868
What kind of adults?

45
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,971
Doesn't this belong to Kugayama?

46
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,806
Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure it does.

47
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,173
It'd be best to return it...

48
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,916
But he hasn't shown up here lately.

49
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,251
Isn't he busy with job hunting?

50
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,150
Looks like his parents
have some high hopes.

51
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,824
Tanaka said he and Ohno were in Nippori.

52
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,023
Ahh, excess.

53
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,399
You know, those two sure are close.

54
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,560
And they're both cosplayers.

55
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,400
So, speaking of job hunting?

56
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,235
Oh, me?

57
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,903
Hmmm...

58
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,678
Wait, what the?

59
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,406
Wait, what the?
Huh?

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,976
Hello.

61
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,619
H-hello.

62
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,017
You're... Kuchiki, right?

63
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,020
I heard you joined the anime club.
What's up?

64
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,356
Well, you see, I have been training.

65
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,555
Huh? Training? In what?

66
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,263
Fighting games, etc.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,434
Select your team member.

68
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,802
Hey, can you do this?

69
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,274
Well, it'll buy time
until Kohsaka gets here.

70
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,612
Then we'll have him pound him.

71
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,475
Ouch.

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,793
You don't... seem to
have gotten very good.

73
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,262
So what was this training?

74
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,594
It was a lie.

75
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,698
Wha?

76
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,171
Hey, it's Coochy. What brings him here?

77
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,974
Yes, yes!

78
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,140
Nobody in the anime club
would call me Coochy!

79
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,385
I feel so moved!

80
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,653
I feel so moved!
Oh really. Isn't that nice.

81
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,620
Oh really. Isn't that nice.

82
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,946
Nobody understands me!

83
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,088
Just tell me why he's here.

84
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, we haven't found
that out yet either.

85
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,924
Here's how it is, simple, concise,
plain, easily understandable, and basic!

86
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,935
I desire an unlimited transfer to the Society
for the Study of Modern Visual Culture...

87
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,973
...led by Miss Kasukabe,
the sole person who calls me Coochy...

88
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,376
...my self-endorsed second name!

89
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,775
...my self-endorsed second name!
You completely lost me.

90
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,312
Wow, what a great retort!

91
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,814
It's everything I'd hoped for!

92
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,684
So, the point is you want to join us.

93
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,523
Yes indee...

94
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,251
Yes indee...
No!

95
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,128
Done already? Aren't you pissed?

96
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,673
Come on, hit me. I'll throw you out.

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,342
I'm sorry. Please let me in Genshiken.

98
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,806
That's what you should've said first.

99
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,404
Fine.

100
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,138
Wha?

101
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,119
Yes!

102
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,084
Yahoo!

103
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,281
You sure?

104
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,051
Huh? About what?

105
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,920
Uh...

106
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,520
She really is more well-rounded?

107
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,497
Or maybe it just doesn't matter
to her anymore?

108
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,001
Khorosho! Khorosho!

109
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:09,968
Khorosho! Khorosho!
Shut up!

110
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,840
Come on!

111
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,607
Here we go!

112
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,347
Such nice weather.

113
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,780
S-so you like spring, huh?

114
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,420
Huh? Sure I like it... Why'd you ask?

115
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:33,926
Kasu/haru: Spring

116
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,728
kasu/haru: Spring
Kasukabe: Haru-hi-be, "a spring day."

117
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,559
Kasukabe: Haru-hi-be, "a spring day."

118
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,525
You think that move'll work against me?

119
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,100
Wh-what?

120
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,497
What?

121
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,437
What's wrong?

122
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,975
Well... there's some commotion.

123
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,533
I can't see it, but it's
the second floor, over there.

124
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,612
Let's see.

125
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,506
Oh, there?

126
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,783
That's the manga club...

127
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:58,711
Wha?

128
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,375
What the heck?

129
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,890
Whoa, she fell?

130
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,981
Huh, for real?

131
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,424
I mean, she jumped?

132
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,620
Wh-why?

133
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,532
Think she's okay?
Should we call an ambulance?

134
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,663
Uh, well... I think her clubmates
will take care of it.

135
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,608
Well...

136
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,573
I figure you've heard the rumor, but...

137
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,580
...a new member got into a little
trouble with one of our girls.

138
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,455
So this idea is both
embarrassing yet shameless...

139
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,256
...but I wondered if we could
leave her in Genshiken's care.

140
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,990
Hmmm.

141
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,026
I don't know.

142
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,499
Which of them was more
at fault for this trouble?

143
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,533
I guess 90% the new girl.

144
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,940
And you want to force her on us?

145
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:03,277
Well, she did say she wanted
to join your kind of circle.

146
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,452
Genshiken doesn't have many
members, and you get along well.

147
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,112
We too have our share of situations.

148
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,190
We do?

149
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,216
And besides...

150
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,226
...won't that mean we incur the
wrath of your manga-club girl?

151
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,820
I don't think that'll be a problem.

152
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,920
Why not?

153
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,361
A woman's wrath is a scary thing.

154
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,694
Let me be candid.

155
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,304
Our girls already can't stand any of
the girls in Genshiken, so I don't...

156
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,208
...suppose adding one more now
will make much of a difference.

157
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,872
No way! Saki...
I could understand, but...

158
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,279
Cut that out.

159
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,879
Why don't we at least
have a look at her?

160
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,951
Looks like this isn't easy
for Takayanagi, either.

161
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,423
You have no idea what a relief
it is to hear that!

162
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,721
It's tough being caught
between women, eh?

163
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,524
Damn straight!

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,301
Hmmm, well if Kasukabe says okay...

165
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,893
I'll go get her.

166
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,233
Huh? Now?

167
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,673
Bandage girl...

168
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,179
A sullen character?

169
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,715
Tailor-made, huh?

170
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,479
She's shorter than what I was expecting.

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,050
Okay, why not introduce yourself?

172
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:17,952
All right.

173
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,391
My name is Ogiue, and I hate otaku.

174
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,821
I especially hate female otaku.

175
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,127
W-well, this's how she is.

176
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,602
Why do they like gay men so much?

177
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,800
Look, I don't know what happened
at the manga club, but...

178
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,673
...you don't need to talk that way.

179
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,212
Aren't you otaku too?

180
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,412
Aren't you?

181
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,148
Kasukabe! Calm down! Calm down!

182
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,682
Yes, I should!
I'm more "well-rounded" now!

183
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,762
I've got a boyfriend, see?

184
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,854
I've got a boyfriend, see?
Huh?

185
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,961
Just coming here
doesn't make me an otaku!

186
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,035
Got it?

187
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,861
You're not one?

188
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,736
Hey, Ohno! You speak up, too!

189
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,738
Uh... o-okay.

190
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,042
No woman doesn't like gay men!

191
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,252
Am I included in that?

192
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,519
Naturally!

193
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,196
So Takayanagi,
this is how she ended up...

194
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,527
..."bailing out" of the manga club?

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,692
Uh... yeah, more or less...

196
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,701
Why'd you jump, anyway? To admit defeat?

197
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,510
You insinuate.

198
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,378
You insinuate.
That hit a nerve.

199
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:45,901
That hit a nerve.

200
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,643
Never mind tastes like
gay men and whatnot.

201
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,211
That pain of yours is pretty otaku-ish.

202
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,413
Joining a circle must mean
you want companions, right?

203
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,748
Work out that issue first.

204
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,827
Now, now! Upperclassmen, freshman girl...

205
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,828
...let's do this nice and civil,
Japan-style!

206
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,558
Let's just forget the petty things.
They're nothing.

207
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,500
Just bite your tongue.
Nothing! Nothing!

208
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,003
Hah! I kill me!

209
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,868
This guy's messed up.

210
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,141
There it is again!

211
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,470
Oh.

212
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,480
He's stopped.

213
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,277
Or did her glare freeze him?

214
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,908
Wow, that's gutl...

215
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:27,881
Ah.

216
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,854
What the hell's your problem?

217
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,619
Discipline him!

218
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,921
You don't go hitting women!

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,962
There, there.

220
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:42,268
Discipline?

221
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,428
Discipline?

222
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,333
How would we do that?

223
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,429
Looks like it's already done...

224
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,011
Genshiken

225
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,465
I keep wondering
if it looks too deliberate.

226
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,838
No! We can't expose her true nature
unless we go this far!

227
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,238
Uh-oh! She's looking outside!

228
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,970
See, told you it's suspicious.

229
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,884
She'll never know where we are.

230
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,419
She'll never know where we are.
Yes, well...

231
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,078
Yes, well...

232
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:38,882
Today Saki and Kohsaka are on a date,
and Kugayama is job hunting.

233
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,394
With Kuchiki away on business in
Akihabara, this is an excellent chance!

234
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,825
What do you think, Tanaka?

235
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,891
Uh, well...

236
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,764
This could be the advent of Dark Ohno.

237
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,567
Oh, she's straightening it up.

238
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,106
That's no surprise.

239
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,501
Hey, peoples.

240
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,472
Oh. Here alone, Ogiue?

241
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,569
Yes.

242
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,936
Wh-why's Saki there?

243
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,510
Huh? She is?

244
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,644
Yeah, it's true.

245
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,548
What happened to her date?
Things were just getting good!

246
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,183
Kohsaka's making
the rounds in Akihabara.

247
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,481
We're doing our own things.

248
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,026
Well, the meal was good.
That'll have to do.

249
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,994
It must be hard, dating an otaku.

250
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,196
Well, it's not a matter
of sharing the same tastes.

251
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,632
Hm? What're these?

252
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,099
Are they by any chance...

253
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,278
Yeah, that's what they are.
These yours?

254
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,513
No!

255
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,484
They were already here
when I arrived, all for show.

256
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,950
You don't say.

257
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,919
They're Ohno's, then.

258
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,959
I wonder why she brought so many.

259
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,424
Harassment, perhaps?

260
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,125
Ouch.

261
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,591
Want to find out for sure?

262
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,798
Huh?

263
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,097
What could they be talking about?

264
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,470
It's not like we can hear them.

265
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,266
Huh? Saki's dialing her cell...

266
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,584
Me? Me?

267
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,218
What should I do?

268
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,754
It's Saki, all right.

269
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,654
Hello.

270
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,382
Ah!

271
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,461
Hey, it's Kasukabe. Got a minute?

272
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:01,131
Uh, uh, uhh, I might.
I'm not real sure.

273
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,368
Where are you?
Near the club building?

274
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,100
Y-yes, well I wouldn't say
I'm not near the building...

275
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,776
Meaning what? Where are you?

276
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,538
In... in the bathroom.

277
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,546
Oh, whoops. Sorry.

278
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:19,910
S'okay...

279
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,915
Just one question, then.

280
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,579
I'm in the clubroom.

281
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,625
Are all these homo dojinshi
on the table yours?

282
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,756
Yes, they are...

283
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,653
Okay! Yeah, thanks, that was all.

284
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,558
Bye.

285
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,890
Uh-huh...

286
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,498
It will seem suspicious
if I don't hurry and go.

287
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,667
That goes without saying.

288
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,643
Here's what gets me...

289
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,183
See, this one's based on
a foreign movie.

290
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,987
A regular live-action one.
I've seen it, too.

291
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,751
But does that mean whoever drew this...

292
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,589
...thinks about this stuff
when they watch it?

293
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,827
It's strange. I know
it never crosses my mind...

294
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,035
That's why such people have
something wrong upstairs.

295
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,603
Oh, and also, when male otaku
buy porn dojinshi...

296
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,237
Isn't it so they can use them?

297
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,945
Does that mean that female otaku...

298
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,412
...look at this stuff
while they #$ &% $ &#%?

299
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,918
I have no idea!

300
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:34,125
I mean, I look at it, and it doesn't
put me in that kind of mood at all!

301
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:39,027
But if you hate it that much,
you must have at least read some.

302
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,557
Otherwise you couldn't complain.

303
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,591
You trying to lead me?

304
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,731
I'm right, though, huh?

305
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:52,266
I first did in fifth grade...
a friend's copy...

306
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,671
Damn, that's twisted!

307
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,412
So that ended up being traumatic?

308
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,041
Well... pretty much.

309
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,212
Yow, that's rough, all right.

310
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,258
What could they be talking about?

311
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,591
Who knows...

312
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,689
Can't we bug the room?

313
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,131
No, we cannot.

314
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,267
Then I have no choice.
I'm going over there.

315
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,432
Oh, you are?

316
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,403
The surprise is ruined now.
Watching them is meaningless.

317
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,281
Please wait a while, then come on over.

318
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,475
Ayup.

319
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,543
So, you still go for Ohno
when she's like that?

320
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,454
Well, if I had to say yes or no...

321
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,957
Then yeah... I suppose so.

322
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,194
Good luck, then.

323
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,095
If you don't like gay stuff,
what do you like?

324
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,298
Anime and such?

325
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,664
I guess... I also play games.

326
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:55,839
But aren't there not
many girls who play?

327
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,937
Guys play games even
if they're not otaku...

328
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,645
...but hardly any of
my friends ever did.

329
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,846
I wouldn't know.

330
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,742
Hello.

331
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,751
Hello, Ohno.

332
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,721
Took long enough. Bad constipation?

333
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,927
P-please don't talk like that
just because it's all girls here!

334
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,897
Oh, that was nothing!
I went to an all-girls' school.

335
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,044
S-so, I just found out
that Ogiue hates...

336
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,970
...gay stuff because
she had some kind of trauma.

337
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,947
Please don't ask.
I don't want to discuss it.

338
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,913
Please don't tell. I don't want to know.

339
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,552
Things went downhill fast.

340
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,290
Guess we should get over there, too?

341
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,866
As naturally as possible, you mean?

342
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,161
Dear me, a yaoi book in fifth grade?

343
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,397
That's all it took to traumatize you?

344
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,839
I find that hard to believe.

345
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,340
In America, some girls were already
@$&% &$@% & by that age.

346
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,482
Don't talk like that just
because it's all girls here.

347
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,650
And don't look at me when you say it!

348
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:18,052
Wouldn't it be more natural to take the
plunge and get into it at that point?

349
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,253
You're indecent, the way you try to
push your values on to other people.

350
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,823
Oh, looks like a bull's-eye.

351
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,725
Now you're desperate
to change the subject.

352
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,693
For all intents and purposes,
you're still an otaku, right?

353
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,398
It would never have
really been traumatic.

354
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,408
I told you, don't say it to me.

355
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,577
Isn't clinging to an obvious lie
the far more indecent thing to do?

356
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,578
Hey, Saki. When it comes
to people like her...

357
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,710
Which of us is indecent, huh?

358
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,050
I bet you all #$ &% $ &#&
while you look at this junk!

359
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,518
Hey. Just because it's all girls here...

360
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,858
This is the kind of thing
I @#$&% $&&#& to!

361
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,867
Somebody...

362
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,135
Somebody, save me...

363
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,137
Hello!

364
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,738
Huh? Is the meeting over already?

365
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,472
Ohh, Ogichin! You're here, good timing!

366
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
Ogichin?

367
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,976
You went to Tosanbo
last Sunday, didn't you?

368
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,745
Heh?

369
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,846
See, I happened to be there
for a different event.

370
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,391
Hn?

371
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:26,948
Hn?
Hmm?

372
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,485
Here's Ogichin entering the hall...

373
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,155
...for the all-Scram Dunk
Mitsui x Kogure book event.

374
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,126
Look, I even shot some video.

375
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,096
What's that, some otaku event?

376
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,296
Not only that, a yaoi-only event!

377
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:41,974
You were spying?

378
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,168
You were spying?
In effect, yes.

379
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,879
You ass!

380
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,985
The more convenience we have
in this world, the lower people get!

381
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,715
You're a prime example!

382
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,384
Um, remain calm, Ogichin.

383
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,460
A-ah, you see... my little brother...

384
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,928
Oh, you have a younger brother!

385
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,590
H-he...

386
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:09,864
He...

387
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,026
Go on!

388
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,337
...asked me... no, I mean...

389
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:13,995
Huh?

390
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,104
He plays basketball!

391
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,709
Aha, does he now!

392
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,874
This is the third floor!

393
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,850
Come on, Ohno! Help me out!

394
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,046
Oh no, emergency!

395
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,756
Wh... what did we miss?

396
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,860
Who cares what you missed?
Hold her down!

397
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,005
Wh-what did I miss?

398
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:06,350
We took no detours or shortcuts...

399
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:16,827
...and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...

400
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:25,238
...as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.

401
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:35,285
Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.

402
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:44,522
We were simple
when we were young...

403
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:57,607
...with our endlessly
glistening marbles.

404
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,303
The time we spied from there...

405
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:07,180
...sparkled, even if
nothing big happened.

406
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,552
What is seen from the marbles...

407
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:17,185
...in our hands now
is a little different...

408
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:26,033
...but they shine faintly nearby.

409
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,878
Our guest this time is our
newest member, Chika Ogiue.

410
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,676
Give her a hand!

411
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,983
Wh-what the heck?

412
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,487
While we're on the subject,
your "I hate otaku" admission...

413
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,790
...took all of us by storm.

414
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,779
...took all of us by storm.
I wouldn't know.

415
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,156
I expect we'll be hearing some
more famous lines from you?

416
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,285
Famous lines?

417
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,955
Famous lines are an
essential part of a character!

418
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,999
It's no exaggeration to say their
first spoken line determines everything!

419
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,471

some new life into our Genshiken.
