all this time.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm not going to take the entrance exam. I know exactly what I want to do.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
You are so spoiled and easy going.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
I want to get back to that time again.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
I want to be little again.

Why?

15
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,300
I became the One-Inch-Princess?

16

No way...

17
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,400
Can't be!

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please find her.

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I am counting on you, Sakaizawa-chan.

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, Chiyomi-chan is adolescent. You'd better not make too much of a fuss.

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,200
I will keep this a secret myself.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,400
- Thank you. <br> - It's fine.

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,500
Shunichi. Oh!

52
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,170
Our next-door neighbor Chiyomi-chan disappeared.

53
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,500
Disappeared?

54
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,400
She hasn't come home since she went out last night.

55
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,500
I heard that from a police officer outside.

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,100
<i>Why do you say such a thing? You're so mean.</i>

57

<i>I don't like you anymore.</i>

59
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
She doesn't pick up her cellphone either.

60
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,650
Last night, the police officer saw Chiyomi-chan around Misaki Park.

61
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,200
It was so stormy, you know.

62
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I am worried.

63
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,600
- Shunichi?<br>- I'm going out for a run.

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,700
Chiyomi...

65
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,500
Chiyomi? Chiyomi!

66
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,000
Chiyomi! Chiyomi! Chiyomi!

67
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,500
Minami-kun!

68
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Chiyomi?

69
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,710
Minami-kun!

70
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Chiyomi? Where are you, Chiyomi?

71
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Here, I'm here! Minami-kun!

72
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Over here!

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Minami-kun!

74

Chiyomi...

75
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,540
It's not a dream!

76
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,750
It's me, Chiyomi!

77
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,840
Minami-kun!

78
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,400
Minami-kun...

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Chiyomi...

80
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You are up early, as always.

81
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
- Good morning. <br>- Hi.

82
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Hey, hey. Have you heard about Chiyomi-chan?

83
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Yes... I heard a bit about it from Mom.

84
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,000
Right. She ran away from home.

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Chiyomi-chan seems to have suffered from domestic violence.

86
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,200
It's between you and me, but

87
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,550
I think she eloped with her boyfriend.

88
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
What?

89
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't tell anyone.

91
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,700
Chiyomi-chan is an adolescent after all.

92
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,580
It'll be a problem if a bad rumor spreads.

93
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,500
See you later.

94
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Elope?

95
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Things are getting serious.

96
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
<i>Domestic violence is bad.</i>

97
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
No, it's not DV --

98
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, you have to teach her a lesson when necessary.

99
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
But, she hasn't come home since last night.

100
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Hey, I told you not to make a ruckus.

101
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Gosh, people in this town are loose lipped.

102
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,000
When I think about it, it is your fault, Sakaizawa-chan...

103
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
What am I going to do?

104
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
What else can we do?

105
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,600
We have no choice but to explain what happend.

106
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
Wait, wait, Minami-kun!

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
What is it?

108
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,960
I can't go back like this!

109
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Eat it when you get hungry.

110
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Thanks!

111
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,000
Listen. Don't touch my stuff unnecessarily.

112
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,150
Also, don't ever let my mom and grandma see you.

113
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,200
My grandma's always at home.

114
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,700
I understand!

115
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,900
Um...

116
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,900
What is it? What's wrong?

117
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,500
I don't need this flower pot since the plant is dead.

118
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,400
What?

119
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,200
Shunichi, come eat your breakfast!

120
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm coming now.

121
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,800
That was close!

122
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,560
Ohno-sensei.

123
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,230
What is it?

124
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,290
Well, what happened to Horikiri-san?

125
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,540
I got a call from Chiyomi's mom last night. I am so worried.

126
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,960
Right, you are good friends of Horikiri-san.

127
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
She doesn't really have a cold, does she?

128
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,000
There's no need for you to worry.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,190
But, I know you can't help it.

130
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,160
The school talked with her parents and decided not to make a big deal out of this.

131
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,190
<i>Ohno sensei. Ohno sensei!</i>

132
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,520
Sasaki sensei.

133
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,550
I heard about it. Horikiri in your class

134
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,990
has disappeared, right?

135
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,440

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

137
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,930
So, this is Minami-kun's room, huh.

138
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,650
He is so perfect at school, but

139
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,080
he can't organize his room.

140
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,490
He still plays

141
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,590
with Kendama.

142
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,130
He is so funny.

143
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,350
Maybe not.

144
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,100
There is no telling how long it has been here.

145
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,800
He surely is a good student. His notebook is so organized.

146
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,090
What?

147
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,300
This is...

148
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,070
me?

149
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,960
One, two. One, two.

150
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,500
My goodness. This sure is a boy's room.

151
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,600
So, his grandma cleans his room.

152
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He shouldn't have left this out here.

153
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,030
Alright!

154
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,630
Really...

155
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,360
He left a window open.

156
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,130
<i>Okay.</i>

157
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,040
Okay, it's done.

158
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,180
It's cold!

159
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,400
Oh, it's cold! It's so cold!

160
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,800
I wonder what Chiyomi is doing now.

161
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,500
I wonder if she's eating properly.

162
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,950
Can I sit here?

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,950
Yeah.

164
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,170
As I thought, those two...

165
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,780
Nomura-san is aggressive.

166
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,380
Hey, Minami! Is Minami here?

167
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,080
Let's eat lunch together.

168
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,980
Why don't you eat in your classroom?

169
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,900
What are you saying? I came because I'm concerned about you.

170
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,780
If I didn't come, you would be eating lunch alone again...

171
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
Hello.

172
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,910
Waaah! Pheromone!

173
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,070
What is it? You're noisy.

174
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,790
When did you start dating Nomura-san. You didn't even tell me.

175
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,760
We just work as class reps together.

176
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,490
<i>Class reps.</i>

177
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,350

Well,

179
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,290
you came here to tell me to go back to Kendo Club, right?

180
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
It's not that.

181
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm not going back. It was my plan to quit the club at the end of winter in 11th grade.

182
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,680
Huh? You are so heartless.

183
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,100
Oh, by the way, I heard from Sasaki...

184
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,400
Sasaki?

185
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
You forgot already? He is the supervisor for Kendo Club.

186
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,320
Ah. That big guy with a big mouth.

187
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,500
And, he told me that your neighbor has disappeared.

188
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,350
It seems you didin't like her, but I have thought she was pretty nice.

189
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,980
Ah, of course you are also pretty, Nomura-san.

190
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,630
Thank you very much.

191
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,710
Huh. I see.

192
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,800
She acts pure, but there is no telling what she has been doing behind the scenes.

193
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,100
Pheromone...!!

194
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,900
What's the matter, Minami?

195
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,200
All of a sudden,

196
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,400
a person becomes small...

197
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,900
- Do you think that's possible?<br>- What?

198
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,900
What are you talking about?

199
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
Ah, no...

200
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,000
What? Minami-kun?

201
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Sorry, Nomura. Tell sensei that I am going home early.

202
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,420
<i>Going home early? You don't feel well?</i>

203
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,300
Right... I don't feel well.

204
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,900
Oh, hey.

205
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,550
Welcome home.

206
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,710
I'm home.

207
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,590
Why...

208
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,160
is he in such a hurry?

209
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,700
Chiyomi!

210
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,320
Chiyomi?

211
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,700
Grandma, did you clean my room?

212
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,060
<i>I did.</i>

213
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,980
Minami-kun! Minami-kun!

214
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Minami-kun! Here!

215
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm right here!

216
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,860
I'm saved!

217
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,200
Thanks!

218
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,720
What's going on?

219
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,030
No, it's nothing.

220
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay.

221
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,230
I was feeling helpless.

222
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,870
Thank you very much for coming back.

223
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,130
You know, people are making a big deal out of your disappearance at school.

224
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,430
What? Really?

225
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:19,300
Oh, right. Minami-kun, people in this town are forming a search party.

226
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,650
Search party?

227
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,790
I left my clothes and shoes over there, right?

228
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,820
It's going to be a problem if they find them.

229
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,220
They might think this is an abduction, rape and murder case.

230
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,350
Abuduction, rape and murder case? Gosh.

231
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Chiyomi-chan!

232
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,260
Well, I hope we won't find her here.

233
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,710
If she just ran away from home, she wouldn't come to this kind of place.

234
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,180
Chiyomi-chan!

235
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,140
- Chiyomi-chan!<br>- Chiyomi-chan!

236
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,530
<i>Chiyomi-chan.</i>

237
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,000
What am I doing here?

238
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh.

239
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
How dare she made me do this kind of thing.

240
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,130
<i>Oh? Minami-kun, what are you doing at this hour? What about school?</i>

241
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,620
Ah, ah...

242
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,190
I have an upset stomach.

243
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,030
Ah, I see.

244
00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:00,160
Chiyomi-chan hasn't come home yet. Did anything unusual happen at school?

245
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,300
No...

246
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,450
Not really.

247
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,210
What's that? Did you go shopping?

248
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,250
I got some medicine for my stomach

249
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,400
to stockpile it.

250
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,900
Ah, it hurts... Sorry, excuse me.

251
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,500
Hm...

252
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,340
<i>He was definitely suspicious of me.</i>

253
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,590
You are okay. That officer can be a bit dumb.

254
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,910
Why don't you go home?

255
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,630
Why aren't you going home?

256
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,610
Because...

257
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,160
Not sure about Dad, but Mom will...

258
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,520
You saw One-Inch-Princess?

259
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
Yeah, the One-Inch-Princess.

260
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,090
What are you saying? Of course that isn't true.

261
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,500
But she was really there. At the river, with Minami-kun...

262
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,660
Stop it. I'm busy.

263
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,330
No way.

264
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,350
It's OK, parents are like that.

265
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,990
Parents are...

266
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,470
Parents are not like that!

267
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,750
They will be in such a shock. I'm sure they will worry a lot.

268
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,900
Then what are you expecting me to do?

269
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,220
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

270
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,560
At least let them know that you are safe.

271
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,970
Withhold the number...

272
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,930
Here.

273
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,910
I don't know what to say.

274
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,950
Shunichi, Shunichi!

275
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,790
What's wrong?

276
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,320
They found items they think are Chiyomi-chan's at Misaki Park.

277
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,620
I asked her to go buy some soy sauce for me in that rain...

278
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,580
It's not your fault.

279
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,290
If I didn't say that.

280
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,560
Don't cry. It's not like anything happened.

281
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,940
Ri-chan...

282
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,520
Mi-chan, Oba-chan...

283
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,430
Ri-chan, we heard.

284
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,610
Sorry for causing so much trouble.

285
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,490
Emiko-san, thank you... Thank you.

286
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,330
Really...

287
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,700
Takagi... Mikimoto...

288
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,710
Minami...

289
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,820
We were worried about Chiyomi

290
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,850
so I went to Misaki Park with Riku.

291
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,440
This is the soy sauce that Chiyomi bought last...

292
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,440
the fingerprints...<br>-Ami-ppe. (Her Nickname)

293
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,360
Everyone, don't get too depressed.

294
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,840
We don't know anything yet.

295
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,380
But, now, we can't handle it on our own.

296
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,800
There is a possibility someone abducted her.

297
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,660
Actually, I think so, too.

298
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,080
After looking for her in a frenzy all day,

299
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,140
there is one thing I was concerned about.

300
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,400
There is one person that is really suspicious

301
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,140
in here.

302
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,360
A suspicious person...

303
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,650
that is...

304
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,480
a suspicious person... a suspicious person...

305
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,190
<i>a suspicious person... a suspicious person...</i>

306
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,660
<i>a suspicious person...</i>

307
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,990
That is...

308
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,790
You!

309
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
Huh?

310
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,020
Huh? Me?

311
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,830
No... why?

312
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,710
I've been worried about Horikiri-shi since yesterday...

313
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,190
worried about Chiyomi-san, so I went looking for her with Ami-ppe.

314
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,650
So, you let it slip.

315
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,870
You've been worried since yesterday?

316
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,100
The only people who knew Chiyomi-chan went missing yesterday were the family members and

317
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,130
just me.

318
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,010
Ah, I called Ami-chan yesterday...

319
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,580
Yes, Oba-san called me to ask if Choyomi was with me.

320
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,890
And then I called Riku immediately.

321
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,790
Why do you tell people so easily?

322
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,640
Especially to someone of opposite sex.

323
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,700
Of course... there is possibility of disappearance... or something greater than that.

324
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,780
But, that's because we were all friends.<br>-I...

325
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,990
It's because... I like Chiyomi-san.

326
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,420
It's the truth.

327
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,990
Yesterday, I told her how I feel.

328
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,350
See, just as I said.

329
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,540
You told her your feeling to Chiyomi-chan yesterday, and she rejected you.

330
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,810
-Because you resented her...<br>-What are you saying?

331
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,960
She did not reject me. I totally have a chance.

332
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,780
Oh, he was on a date with Onee-chan (older sister) day before yesterday.

333
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,410
- What? Is that true?<br>-Well... not really a date but...

334
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,800
So it's you!

335
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,660
<i>Bring Chiyomi back...</i>

336
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,540
<i>Where did you take her?</i>

337
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Sorry but they are busy right now...

338
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Are you Chiyomi-chan?

339
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,200
Hello, Chiyomi?

340
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,200
-Chiyomi! <br> -Let go! Is this Chiyomi?

341
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes.

342
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm sorry to make you worry.

343
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,890
I wanted to call you but my phone broke.

344
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,490
You idiot. Where are you calling from? Hurry back.

345
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,810
No one is mad at you anymore.

346
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,110
I'm sorry, that's impossible.

347
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,180
Impossible? Why is it impossible?

348
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,540
Right now... I'm in Tokyo.

349
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,970
In Tokyo?!

350
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,940
What are you thinking?

351
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,300
Chiyomi, do you know how worried we were?

352
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,150
I told you yesterday. The dance workshop.

353
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,880
Please, I really want to do this.

354
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,670
<i>Please believe me. I won't do anything that will make you worry.</i>

355
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,920
I will not approve. I will not approve, you idiot.

356
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,410
Chiyomi, Chiyomi?

357
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,830
<i>Anyway, I am fine.</i>

358
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,580
<i>I just wanted to tell you that for now. Bye.</i>

359
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,160
W, w, wait... Where are you in Tokyo? Where are you staying?

360
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,290
I'll call you again later. Bye.

361
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,360
Wait Chiyomi.

362
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,860
Chiyomi, Chiyomi, wait!

363
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,620
Hello Chiyomi? Hello, Hello Chiyomi?, Chiyo-

364
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,350
Ah, what a relief!

365
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,630
- Let us know when she's back.<br>-Sorry for the trouble.

366
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,120
-Sorry.<br>-See you tomorrow.

367
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,520
Sorry.

368
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,900
-I'm glad she is safe.<br>-Sorry.

369
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,750
-Thank you so much.<br>-It's fine.

370
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,940
I told you we would easily find her.

371
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,590
She just ran away.

372
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,720
<i>Minaki kun No Koibito <br> My Little Lover</i>

373
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,540
Welcome back.

374
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,200
What are you planning on doing?

375
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,350
What do you mean...

376
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,700
You told me to tell them I'm fine.

377
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,400
Why did you say Tokyo? You're not going home?

378
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm going home, of course.

379
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,040
I want to go home.

380
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,460
When I return to normal size.

381
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,300
"When I return to normal size", eh?

382
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:44,080
I can't go back like this.

383
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,260
Dad and Mom will be sad.

384
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,000
So...

385
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,570
It was better when they were mad at me.

386
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,840
I'm sure that's true, but...

387
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,970
And so...

388
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,110
I won't stay like this forever.

389
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,190
I should get back to normal soon.

390
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,580
So please!

391
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Until then, can I stay here...

392
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,270
Let me stay by your side.

393
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,840
Hey wait, what are you talking about?!

394
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,530
Please. I won't be too much of a trouble.

395
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,580
Just let me stay here.

396
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,720
What a good feeling!

397
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,990
This bath is just my size!

398
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,670
Are you some creature?

399
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,620
<i>Sorry, Minami-kun. I can't reach the soap.</i>

400
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,870
<i>Can you get it for me?<i></i></i>

401
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,390
I'm sorry, please.

402
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,540
-Don't look! <br> -I won't look!

403
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,580
What do you mean, just let me stay.

404
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,880
Sorry I made you wait!

405
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm going in now.

406
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,590
That scared me.

407
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,060
Minami-kun is muscular...

408
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,020
So comfy!

409
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,990
Excuse me,

410
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,510
Minami-kun?

411
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
What is it?

412
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,400
Thank you very much.

413
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,360
Thank you for taking care of me.

414
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,450
It's fine.

415
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,860
But...

416
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,420
It's okay.

417
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,000
This is the first time we're sleeping together.

418
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,620
Of course.

419
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,360
This is my first time in your room.

420
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,240
I got my own room when I went into Jr. High.

421
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,080
This is the first time I'm letting a girl in here.

422
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,510
I see.

423
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,840
About Nomura-san,

424
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,320
do you like her?

425
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,010
What?

426
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,010
Yesterday, you were with Nomura-san...

427
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,640
<i>Why don't you ask my father?</i>

428
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,980
<i>I'm sure you're find a good way.</i>

429
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,920
<i>A good way?</i>

430
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,340
<i>My father is well know at the Med School here.</i>

431
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,850
<i>He can give out scholarships too.</i>

432
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,940
<i>If you are interested in it.</i>

433
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,100
<i>Interested...</i>

434
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,320
<i>Don't you think it's a good idea?</i>

435
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,920
I have things to do.

436
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,900
Your eyelashes are long.

437
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,890
Minami-kun.
