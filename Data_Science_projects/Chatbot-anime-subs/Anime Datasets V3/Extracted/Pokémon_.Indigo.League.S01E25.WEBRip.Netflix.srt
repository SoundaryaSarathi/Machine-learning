00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,325
Mm. Pika!

16
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,327
[sniffs]

17
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,122
-Something smells heavenly.
-Perfume.

18
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,623
Hey, what's going on?

19
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,917
[sniffs] Eeh!

20
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,086
Wait, Brock! Where are you going?

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,799
[Ash] Pokémon Scent-Sation!

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,761
[chuckles]

23
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,889
Who are you making faces at, Brock?

24
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,393
My nose tells me
that this is my kind of town.

25
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,020
Huh?

26
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,523
So, then he says
maybe we can both go together.

27
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,984
I think we should stay here a while.

28
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,986
Well, if you want to waste your time.

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,196
Misty, Pikachu, let's get moving.

30
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,907
Misty? Pikachu?

31
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,411
Hm?

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,667
This scent is one of our most popular.
It's called Daffodil Dreams.

33
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,546
-[sniffs] It smells just like a garden.
-Pika!

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,506
We're having a fragrance sale.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,301
-How much does this one cost?
-Pikachu.

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,552
Don't buy it, Misty.

37
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,930
Perfume's just a waste of money,
and it stinks.

38
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,015
Go away.

39
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,683
[woman] I resent that remark.

40
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,976
[all] Huh?

41
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,979
[saleswoman] The manager.

42
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,316
Young man, are you accusing me
of overcharging my customers

43
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,068
for inferior perfume?

44
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,029
Uh, no, ma'am.
I meant all perfumes are a rip-off

45
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,491
because all they do is turn guys
into zombies, like this.

46
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,452
[chuckling]
Hi, what's your name?

47
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,954
Hmm. Mm!

48
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,333
P for pretty, E for elegant,
R for radiant,

49
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,628
F for fun, U for urbane,
M for mysterious, E for energy,

50
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,088
-and that spells?
-Perfume.

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,255
-Right!
-Pika!

52
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,093
I don't need that smelly junk to give me
energy. I'm full of it.

53
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,137
I got tons more energy
than I know what to do with.

54
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,681
Why don't you use some of it
to keep your mouth shut?

55
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,143
If you object to our products so much,
perhaps you should leave,

56
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,646
since we all sell perfume here,
you must find us offensive.

57
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,856
You should be ashamed of yourself.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,817
You insensitive little worm.

59
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,859
What did I say?

60
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,320
Get out and don't come back!

61
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,739
I don't want to come back!

62
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm on my way to the Celadon City Gym.

63
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,668
What do you mean I can't I come in?
I'm trying to become a Pokémon master.

64
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,296
I wouldn't let you in if you were the last
Pokémon trainer on earth.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,549
-Huh?
-This Gym doesn't allow anyone inside

66
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,634
who says that perfume is a stinky rip-off.

67
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,927
Why not?

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,389
We manufacture that stinky perfume
right here in this Gym.

69
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,348
Uh-oh.

70
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,601
So you see, young man...

71
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,937
-[Ash] Ah!
-You're the stinker!

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,147
[groans]

73
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,107
But don't you understand?

74
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,068
I got to challenge your Gym Master
so I can win a badge.

75
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,612
You've got to let me in!

76
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,990
Huh? [blows raspberry]

77
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,952
[groans]
Pretty please, with a cherry on top?

78
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,914
Huh. Looks like the coast is clear.

79
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:12,085
Once we break inside, we'll steal
the secret formula for their perfume.

80
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,046
Then I'll be as irresistible as Cleopatra.

81
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,049
I'll sell the formula
and make myself zillions of bucks.

82
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,343
That's enough money
to buy my own country,

83
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,720
or my own planet even.

84
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,055
Or nine lifetime supplies of cat grub.

85
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,729
That secret formula's got to be hidden
around here somewhere. Hmm.

86
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,314
Now, where could it be?

87
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,732
Hmm.

88
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,443
Huh.

89
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,820
Ah! [groaning]

90
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,113
What is it?

91
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,406
Hey, look.

92
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,367
[snores and grunts]

93
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,870
What's a Gloom doing here?

94
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,497
Taking a nap, I think.

95
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,625
[grunts]

96
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,751
Gloom.

97
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,085
[all gasp]

98
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,462
James, you've woken it up.

99
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,339
Go, Koffing.

100
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,800
Poison gas attack, now!

101
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,594
Koffing!

102
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,766
[trills]

103
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,064
That Gloom just sucked up
all of Koffing's gas.

104
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,649
I can't believe it.

105
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,609
Gloom?

106
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,277
[all yell]

107
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,323
Gloom, Gloom! Gloom!

108
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,034
[Team Rocket gagging]

109
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,162
It smells terrible!

110
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,414
It smells like old sneakers

111
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:36,378
mixed with some rotten eggs and dead fish
with just a hint of skunk fumes.

112
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,714
[both groan]

113
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,843
-[both whimper]
-My nose feels like it's on fire.

114
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,305
-Meowth, you don't have a nose.
-Huh?

115
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,182
My nose! What happened?

116
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,560
The stink dissolved it off my face.

117
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,771
Hm? Oh.
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

118
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:59,025
The cartoonist never gave me a nose.
Hey, why are you sleeping?

119
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,112
[Meowth groans]

120
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,738
That stopped them.

121
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,283
Gym rules, no thieves allowed.

122
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,497
Hey, get me down! Get me out of here!

123
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,292
You two clowns
better get me out of this tree!

124
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,460
Don't tell me what to do,
you little hairball!

125
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,129
I know what I'm doing.

126
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,923
-Are you three hanging out again?
-Huh? The pest.

127
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,343
Please, could you help us
get out of this tree?

128
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,428
-Traitor!
-Ugh!

129
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,222
-How dare you collaborate with the enemy?
-Whose side are you on?

130
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,724
[grunting]

131
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,435
Huh? Hmm.
Hey, kid.

132
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,313
Bet they wouldn't let you
in that Gym today.

133
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,772
That's none of your business.

134
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,399
They kicked you out.

135
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,818
Even though you're a pest,
I'll make a deal.

136
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,237
Untie us and we'll show you
how to get in that Gym.

137
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,448
Why should I trust you?

138
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,325
Face the facts, boy.

139
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,870
You can't get into the Pokémon League
without winning more badges.

140
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,249
[groaning]

141
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,046
-Bing...
-Bong...

142
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,005
Bing!

143
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,922
[all] Ta-da!

144
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,594
[all] Oh!

145
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,098
Great wig.

146
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,894
Not even your own mother
would recognize you in this outfit.

147
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,062
Think so?

148
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,650
Talk about dressing for success,
that getup will get you into the Gym easy.

149
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,946
Great! Then I'll show that Gym Leader
who's the boss around here.

150
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,406
Uh, that doesn't sound very ladylike.

151
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,201
-Huh?
-You'll give away your secret.

152
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,619
-Go on, try it.
-Try it.

153
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,663
Ahem!

154
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,081
[high-pitched] I'll show those meanies.

155
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,332
[both laugh]

156
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,382
Good evening.

157
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,009
We would like to enroll our daughter,
Ashley,

158
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,761
in your Pokémon training classes.

159
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,888
Nothing but the best
for our little princess.

160
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,973
[Meowth] That's right.

161
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,308
-[Meowth] Ow!
-Hm?

162
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,935
Do you like perfume?

163
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,019
[high-pitched] Oh, yes.

164
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,647
Well, then, I'm sure you'll be accepted.

165
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,357
Your parents should apply at the desk.

166
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,779
Way to scam them, Goldilocks!

167
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,114
[grunting]

168
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,157
[woman]
Are you applying to the Gym, little girl?

169
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,993
[deep voice] Uh, yeah. [gasps]

170
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,620
[thinks] <i>The girl in the perfume shop.</i>

171
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,414
[high-pitched] I mean, yes, ma'am.

172
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,500
We're so proud to have our little muffin
in your Gym.

173
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,335
-Yes, we sure are.
-Cut it out.

174
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,963
Ma'am, where is Erika, the Gym Master?

175
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,548
Oh, you'll meet her soon.

176
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:31,052
[thinks] <i>All right. Now all I got to do</i>
<i>is beat Erika, and I'll get another badge.</i>

177
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,554
-[Jessie] Bye-bye.
-Hmm?

178
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
Hugs and kisses, Ashley.

179
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,018
Mommy and Daddy are leaving you
to battle those cute little Pokémon.

180
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,812
-Bye, sweetie.
-See you soon.

181
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,232
Hmm. While that clueless little twerp
creates a distraction,

182
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,943
-we'll steal the secret perfume formula.
-Let's go.

183
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,945
Just one question,

184
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,531
what am I supposed to do
with this blaster ball?

185
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,410
Stick it someplace
where it'll make a nice, big kaboom.

186
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,621
[cackles] They'll get a bang out of this.

187
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,457
Jessie, what's the blaster ball for?

188
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,960
Sweet revenge for stamping an
on the most beautiful face in the world.

189
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,212
Talk about delusions.

190
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,338
What?

191
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,507
Uh, I mean, that'll teach those slobs.

192
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,633
[both laugh]

193
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,472
One, two, one, two, one, two...

194
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,309
[woman] Remember, a pretty Pokémon
is a strong Pokémon.

195
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,021
And so Omanyte bid farewell

196
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,398
and promised to one day return

197
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,027
to visit the friends who changed his life
on that faraway beach.

198
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,487
The end.

199
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,157
-Great story.
-Pika.

200
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,202
Uh-oh.
How'd Misty and Brock get here?

201
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,995
-[woman] Trainer Erika.
-Hm?

202
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:39,954
Erika.

203
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,664
[woman]
I'd like to introduce our new student.

204
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh, welcome.

205
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,004
Ah!

206
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,547
[thinks] <i>The store manager.</i>

207
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,548
Oh...

208
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,925
Nice to meet you.

209
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,051
[high-pitched]
Thank you, ma'am.

210
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,345
You sure are a shy young lady,
but don't worry.

211
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,014
All the girls want to make you feel
at home here at the Gym.

212
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,517
Let's all give her a warm welcome.

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,727
-Pikachu!
-Oh!

214
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,063
[thinks]
<i>Oh, great. Pikachu's here too.</i>

215
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,397
[Misty] May I ask you a question?

216
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,483
Of course you may, Misty.

217
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,152
I was wondering
why we can all sit with Gloom.

218
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,114
I always thought
that because of its terrible smell,

219
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,075
it was almost impossible
to get anywhere near Gloom.

220
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,619
So how come this Gloom
doesn't smell bad to me at all?

221
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,081
That's a very smart question, Misty.

222
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,126
Gloom doesn't have a bad smell
all the time.

223
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,587
Whenever Gloom is in danger,
it lets out the bad smell.

224
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,631
It's a natural defense mechanism.

225
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,009
But as long as Gloom doesn't feel
threatened, it smells just fine.

226
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,221
Just make sure Gloom feels safe
and show you want to be its friend.

227
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,267
-How do you know all that?
-I met Gloom a long time ago.

228
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,228
[sobs]

229
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,980
Grimer!

230
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:52,110
[Erika] <i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>I got lost one day and ran into a Grimer.</i>

231
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,529
<i>I'd never been so scared.</i>

232
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,114
<i>I couldn't even move.</i>

233
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,533
[whimpering]

234
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,994
Please, can you help me?

235
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,412
Please, help me.

236
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,331
[Erika] <i>Somehow that Gloom</i>
<i>understood how scared I felt</i>

237
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>and decided to come to my rescue.</i>

238
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,085
Gloom!

239
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,922
Grimer!

240
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,133
[giggles] I love you!

241
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,886
Gloom!

242
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,222
This is the same Gloom
that rescued me from Grimer that day.

243
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,349
We've been friends ever since.

244
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,310
It's all because of her friendship
with Gloom

245
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,354
that Erika decided to become
a grass Pokémon trainer.

246
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,899
I wish Ash could've heard that story.

247
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,067
-[Ash in normal voice] I heard it.
-[all gasp]

248
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,319
Ah! Uh...

249
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,030
[high voice] Please don't stare at me
like that. I'm a very shy little girl.

250
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,490
You look awfully familiar.

251
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,826
Haven't we met someplace before?

252
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,411
[high-pitched]
Maybe you met my sister.

253
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,455
-Pi?
-Ah!

254
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,915
Pika-pi!

255
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,958
[normal voice]
Hey, knock it off.

256
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,501
Pika!

257
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:55,632
-[all] Oh!
-[Ash screams]

258
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,425
[both] It's Ash!

259
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,801
Yeah, it's me.

260
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,136
You're that boy.

261
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,640
Erika, you wouldn't let me in,
so I wore this stupid disguise.

262
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,601
I had to sneak into your Gym
so I could battle you for a badge.

263
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,312
And now I want to challenge you.

264
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,025
[laughs]
At last we've found the perfume.

265
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,487
Now we'll unlock its secret formula.

266
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,698
I accept your challenge.

267
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,994
It's my duty under the league rules.
We'll each use three Pokémon.

268
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,414
Right. I'll use my own grass Pokémon
against yours.

269
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,422
Bulbasaur, I choose you!

270
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,757
Bulbasaur!

271
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,676
This ought to be easy.

272
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,387
Tangela, I choose you!

273
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,099
[squealing]

274
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
What's that?

275
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,602
[Pokédex]
<i>Tangela, a vine Pokémon.</i>

276
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,854
<i>Its body is wrapped in vines.</i>

277
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,233
<i>The rest of its form</i>
<i>is hidden beneath these vines.</i>

278
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,985
That doesn't tell me much.

279
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,112
All right, we'll attack from a distance.

280
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,489
Bulbasaur, vine whip!

281
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,201
Tangela, constrict!
Resist it from pulling you in.

282
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,327
Bulbasaur!

283
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,453
-Ah!
-Bulbasaur!

284
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,915
Tangela, now is the time to hit it
with your stun spore.

285
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,086
[grunts]

286
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,380
Return, Bulbasaur!

287
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,632
[squealing]

288
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,134
Poor Bulbasaur!

289
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,345
Later I'll give you some Paralyze Heal
to make your Pokémon better.

290
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,806
Thanks, but no thanks.
I don't need your help.

291
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,391
I choose Primeape.

292
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,442
Uh, maybe I better not.

293
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,820
Charmander, go!

294
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,073
Charman.

295
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,451
This should be easy.
Weepinbell, go!

296
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,956
-Bell.
-Weepinbell, razor leaf now!

297
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,207
[gibbers]

298
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,585
Charmander, flamethrower, full blast!

299
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,130
Char!

300
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,132
[gasps]

301
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,760
Yes, way to go.
Now let's just finish it up.

302
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,512
Skull bash, now!

303
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,936
Uh! Weepinbell, return now!

304
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,023
-Ash is doing well.
-He might actually win.

305
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah, he's a lot more impressive
than he looks.

306
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,529
Your battle skills are impressive, Ash.

307
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,116
But there's one thing you don't have:
empathy with your Pokémon.

308
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,328
Without it, you'll never become
a great Pokémon trainer like me.

309
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,706
Now I'm going to give you a lesson
in empathy.

310
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,501
Gloom, go!

311
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,213
Gloom.

312
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,214
[both gasp]

313
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,718
Gloom!

314
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,514
Char! Char!

315
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,265
[groans]

316
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,559
Oh! Charmander, return!

317
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,312
[laughs] Poor Ash.

318
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,648
Your Pokémon could use
some more training.

319
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,111
[thinks] <i>If Gloom beats Charmander,</i>
<i>what Pokémon can I use next?</i>

320
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:07,698
<i>Squirtle, Pidgeotto and Pikachu</i>
<i>couldn't take that terrible smell.</i>

321
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,825
Chu!

322
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,536
-Pikachu?
-Pika.

323
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,455
You're saying you want to battle?

324
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,498
Pikachu.

325
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,708
You know you're probably going to lose,

326
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,837
but you're still willing to battle Gloom
to help me out?

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,215
-Pika, pika!
-What? You say you're sure you'll win?

328
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,843
-Pikachu! Pika-pi.
-Oh, Pikachu.

329
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,762
Heartwarming, but what's that smell?

330
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,139
What?

331
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,101
Your Pokémon skills are stinking up
this Gym even worse than Gloom.

332
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
[Misty] It's Team Rocket!

333
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,981
To protect the world from devastation...

334
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,108
To unite all peoples within our nation...

335
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,696
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

336
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,906
To extend our reach to the stars above...

337
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,994
And last, but not least,
to blast this dump sky-high!

338
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,662
-Jessie!
-James!

339
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,080
[all screaming]

340
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,124
Where did you put that blast ball?

341
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,918
Near us so I wouldn't lose it. Ah!

342
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:05,047
At least we get this lovely parting gift,
their secret perfume formula.

343
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,090
What?

344
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,887
[both] Team Rocket's blasting off again!

345
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,849
Quick, girls, we've got to rescue
all the Pokémon fast!

346
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,646
Quick, now! Get into the Poké Ball
and I'll carry you to safety.

347
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,690
Hurry! Now!

348
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,400
-Hurry.
-[woman 1] There's some over here!

349
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,528
-[woman 2] There's a Pokémon!
-[woman 3] We've got to get them all.

350
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,908
-[woman 4] Keep looking. Look everywhere.
-[woman 5] Call the fire department!

351
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,118
[woman 6] They're on their way.

352
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,082
Pika, pika.

353
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,044
Cha.

354
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,756
[groans]

355
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,342
[thinks] <i>I should never have listened</i>
<i>to Team Rocket.</i>

356
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,219
-Don't just stand around, Ash!
-Huh?

357
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,722
Help us to put out the fire before
this whole Gym is burnt to the ground.

358
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,601
Yeah, all right.
Squirtle, water gun!

359
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,064
Staryu, Starmie, help us out now!

360
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,692
Squirtle!

361
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,155
[gibbers]

362
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,534
Geodude! Throw as much dirt
as you can on the flames!

363
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,952
Dude.

364
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,913
Geodude, Geodude, Geodude.

365
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,375
-Keep on spraying!
-We've almost got it!

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,293
[pants]

367
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,088
Erika, what's the matter?

368
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,924
I've looked and looked,
but I can't find Gloom anywhere.

369
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,217
-Did Gloom get out?
-Huh?

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,220
What if Gloom...?
What if Gloom's still inside?

371
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,766
-Ah!
-[Misty] You can't go in there, Erika!

372
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,434
[Erika]
But Gloom may be trapped inside.

373
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,979
-I'll go in and find Gloom!
-Don't, Ash!

374
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,278
Gloom?

375
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,904
Gloom!

376
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,948
Huh? Ah!

377
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,450
Gloom, Gloom!

378
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,621
Don't worry, Gloom.
I promise I'll get you out of here!

379
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,749
Argh! [grunts]

380
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,128
I can't get closer to that smell.

381
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,297
Gloom!

382
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,464
[gasps]

383
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,466
[grunts]

384
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,098
[groans]

385
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,810
It's okay, Gloom.
It's going to be okay.

386
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,813
[grunting]

387
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,318
[mumbles] It's too much!
I can't hold my breath any longer.

388
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,069
[exhales]

389
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,281
Huh? There's no smell.

390
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,741
[gasps]

391
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,995
As long as Gloom doesn't feel threatened,
it smells just fine.

392
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,206
Just make sure Gloom feels safe
and show you want to be its friend.

393
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,916
Hm.

394
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,668
Come on. Let's go, Gloom.

395
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,503
Gloom, Gloom!

396
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,258
-Pikachu.
-[gasping]

397
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,016
All right, hey!

398
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,144
-Ash!
-[Misty] That was great!

399
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,396
[Erika] Thank you, Ash.

400
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,696
With deep gratitude,
I present you with this rainbow badge.

401
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,700
-What's that for?
-I think you earned it.

402
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,036
-Don't you, Gloom?
-Gloom, Gloom.

403
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,288
Thanks a lot.

404
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,211
Take a look, Pikachu. A rainbow badge.

405
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,923
-Pi, Pikachu!
-Gloom, Gloom.

406
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,551
-Congratulations, Ash.
-Thanks.

407
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,679
Uh, but what about Team Rocket?

408
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,639
They got away
with your secret perfume formula.

409
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,600
[giggles] No, they didn't.

410
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:49,063
The bottle they stole has only one
of our perfume's secret ingredients:

411
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,981
essence of Gloom.

412
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:56,195
-Hm?
-[all yell]

413
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,490
It stinks!

414
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,325
Just like your plan.

415
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,910
You said it!

416
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:09,333
