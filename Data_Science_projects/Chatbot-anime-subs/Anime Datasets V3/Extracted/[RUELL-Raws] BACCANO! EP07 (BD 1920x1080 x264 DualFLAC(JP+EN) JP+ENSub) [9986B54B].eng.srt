1
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,573
Who's there?!

2
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,895
Gretto,

3
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:24,437
are you worried about your brother?

4
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,109
I'm scared. I'm scared.

5
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,655
Alchemists, summoning a devil?

6
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,325
Is something like that even allowed?

7
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,568
Eternal life, immortal youth...

8
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,249
does mankind really need that sort of thing?

9
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,336
I don't know about that.

10
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:53,368
But if it's a way to come near to
the secrets of the "grand panacea,"

11
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:56,010
then I don't think there's
anything we can do about--

12
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:03,712
I don't necessarily think that
eternal life would be a marvelous thing.

13
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:07,647
Even with just this limited life,
as long as I'm with you, Sylvie...

14
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:12,377
If I am granted eternal life,

15
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,822
then I won't be scared,
as long as I'm with you.

16
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,657
Sylvie...

17
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:21,285
You accept that man?!

18
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,148
Maiza-<i>dono</i> is outstanding.

19
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:27,698
It is patently heretical for
an alchemist to summon a devil!

20
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:32,091
This is unexpected,
for someone as inquisitive as you are.

21
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:36,467
The grand panacea is every alchemist's dream.

22
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,708
Even if it means devils,
if we are able to obtain it,

23
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,628
the history of mankind will be changed.

24
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,892
Obviously, it's a bunch of nonsense!

25
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,632
But what if it's true?

26
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:54,360
Maiza could be a great alchemist,
on the level of Synesius, or Zosimos.

27
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,182
Everyone, smile!

28
00:03:57,182 --> 00:03:58,698
Smiling faces, smiling faces!

29
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,045
There is nothing to be afraid of.

30
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,371
Huey...

31
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,238
"That which is below is
like that which is above,

32
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:12,408
and that which is above
is like that which is below

33
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:16,424
to do the miracles of one only thing."

34
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,918
"And as all things have
been and arose from one

35
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,168
by the meditation of one

36
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:27,758
so all things have their birth
from this one thing by adaptation."

37
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:29,437
That is correct.

38
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,377
Everything is linked in one,
and the circle is closed.

39
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:37,507
The devil that we think of
may not necessarily be, in fact, evil.

40
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:41,102
When an alchemist tries his hand in
the realm of the black magician,

41
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:43,352
everything becomes linked in one.

42
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:45,443
Huey, you aren't worried?

43
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:50,458
Worried? No, I am just very interested.

44
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,322
About devils, the grand panacea,

45
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:56,448
how people will be changed
by them, and how they will live.

46
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,578
I'm just very interested in it all.

47
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,343
I look forward to it.

48
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,230
Would you bring everyone here?

49
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,651
Only his clothes were lying there.

50
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,428
There was no sign of Pierre.

51
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,270
Or Italo.

52
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,612
Italo is gone, too.

53
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,698
What's going on?

54
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,167
I don't know if what I am about to perform

55
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:58,302
is the right thing for me,
or for all of us together.

56
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,138
The one who passed this on to me was a man

57
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,864
who once undertook
the same school of alchemy that I have.

58
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:09,412
The man had not aged a day
since my grandfather's time.

59
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,332
This is because 300 years ago,
he successfully summoned a devil,

60
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,336
and was successful in
obtaining the "grand panacea."

61
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:22,662
That man is probably
surviving even now, somewhere.

62
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:25,595
Without having aged a day.

63
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,958
But coming near unto the "grand panacea"

64
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,143
is the earnest desire of
those of us who are alchemists.

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,813
I will now perform the devilkin summoning.

66
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,722
Believe that there is greater
worth in that which is gained by gaining

67
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,573
than that which is gained by losing!

68
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,952
Brethren, I ask you to see this
through with me to the end.

69
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,293
Denkuro, Gretto...

70
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:07,265
I summon thee to this place!
Thou art the heavens and the earth!

71
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:09,764
The night, and the day!
The darkness, and the light!

72
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,768
The good, and the wicked!
The one who sees, and who is seen!

73
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,933
The one who brings about creation,
and brings about destruction!

74
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,111
The one who loves man,
and despises man! Thou art--

75
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,610
<i>Enough.</i>

76
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,614
What happened?

77
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,518
I don't know! It's a monster!
There's something in there!

78
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,162
It's the devil! I'm sure that
the devil is raging in there!

79
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,208
What about Gretto?
Do you know what happened to Gretto?!

80
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:48,094
<i>Your words of summoning</i>
<i>are nothing more than tedious.</i>

81
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:55,643
<i>I hear your words at all times,</i>
<i>and I know your thoughts, as well.</i>

82
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:01,218
<i>When you think about me,</i>
<i>I am already there in your midst.</i>

83
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,109
<i>Well, no matter.</i>

84
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,353
<i>There is no need to call me by name.</i>

85
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:10,491
<i>I am not at all content</i>
<i>with being called a devil.</i>

86
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,952
<i>But, no matter.</i>

87
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:17,778
<i>In any event, I know what you are thinking.</i>

88
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:20,698
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>all about immortal youth, right?</i>

89
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:27,158
<i>I will tell you, alone, how to make</i>
<i>what you call the "grand panacea."</i>

90
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,634
Why only me?

91
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,208
<i>Once you drink that,</i>
<i>you will become immortally young.</i>

92
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,780
<i>Now, drink.</i>

93
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,588
<i>If you wish to know all,</i>
<i>you must first drink.</i>

94
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:42,356
<i>Old man, you seem to not want an early death.</i>

95
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,986
I'm just trying to put
a quick end to this charade.

96
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,568
I knew it, it's a sham, all right!

97
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:02,418
<i>You won't believe unless I do this?</i>

98
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,529
<i>Well, old man? How does it</i>
<i>feel to be immortally ageless?</i>

99
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:48,078
<i>Calm down. Do not quarrel. I am generous.</i>

100
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,885
<i>There is enough "grand panacea"</i>
<i>for everyone here.</i>

101
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,769
Brother...

102
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,395
Gretto...

103
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,247
<i>There are a number of rules</i>
<i>we should establish.</i>

104
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>What if you grow tired of immortality,</i>
<i>and want to die?</i>

105
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,492
<i>Do not hesitate to go to</i>
<i>one of your friends,</i>

106
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,714
<i>and have them devour you.</i>

107
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,578
<i>And when I say "devour, "</i>
<i>I do not mean by mouth.</i>

108
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,345
By the right hand.

109
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:38,458
<i>Have them place their right hand on your head,</i>

110
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,418
<i>and when they think to themselves,</i>
<i>"I want to eat, "</i>

111
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:44,105
<i>you will be absorbed into their right hand.</i>

112
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,230
<i>Your life will end.</i>

113
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:50,678
<i>Also, by doing so, the devourer will inherit</i>

114
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:54,947
<i>all of the knowledge and</i>
<i>experiences of the one being devoured.</i>

115
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:01,648
<i>Contrarily, when giving knowledge,</i>
<i>place your right hand on the person's head.</i>

116
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:03,835
<i>That is all that is required.</i>

117
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,637
<i>One other thing.</i>

118
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:10,129
<i>I will make it such that those who drank</i>
<i>cannot use false names.</i>

119
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,828
<i>You can only converse with fellow</i>
<i>immortals by using your real names.</i>

120
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:21,117
<i>Otherwise, you would never</i>
<i>be able to seek out another, for eternity.</i>

121
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:25,048
<i>Whoops, I forgot the most important thing.</i>

122
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:28,342
<i>If you wish to know how to prepare this elixir,</i>

123
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:31,775
<i>then you may ask the man who summoned me.</i>

124
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:41,062
You want to contain this knowledge?
What are you thinking, Maiza?!

125
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:44,622
It's the conclusion I came to
after thinking about it overnight.

126
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,238
We had better keep everyone
but ourselves from drinking it.

127
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:50,502
It's too dangerous.

128
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,006
It's precisely because it's dangerous
that we need this information!

129
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:59,208
Szilard-<i>san</i>, I cannot trust mankind
as much as you do.

130
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,082
Are you being sarcastic?

131
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:03,349
No, that is my honest feeling.

132
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,327
Elderly sir, I kind of agree with Maiza.

133
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,798
Ultimately, I think that somehow
he's right about this.

134
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,440
What do you mean?

135
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,098
Here I am, having become
immortally young like this,

136
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:19,949
but I myself haven't changed at all.
I'm the same as I ever was.

137
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,705
I will go on living,
without ever dying or getting older,

138
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:27,915
but it seems to me that I'm no
different from those who won't.

139
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,448
On the one hand, I feel like
I'm going to become very sad,

140
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:34,004
and yet I feel that
I'm going to enjoy myself greatly.

141
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,288
Be that as it may,
it really does somehow seem like...

142
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:39,927
it somehow seems like he's right.

143
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,418
I think it's better for there not
to be too many people like us.

144
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,226
You're not making any sense!

145
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,062
I know. But elderly sir,

146
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:55,609
my intuition tells me that
what I'm saying isn't too far off the mark.

147
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:02,352
I stand with Elmer-<i>dono</i>. Hence,
I will abide by Maiza-<i>dono</i>'s decision.

148
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:03,867
What?!

149
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,621
I support my brother's decision.

150
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,582
I will also follow Maiza-<i>san.</i>

151
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,948
It is always possible
to share this knowledge later.

152
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:19,216
It won't be too late to decide
after we see what the future brings us.

153
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,636
I will abide by Maiza's decision.

154
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,042
If Fermet says so, then so do I.

155
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,516
I'm following Maiza.

156
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,768
I'm with Maiza, too.

157
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,272
I will defer.

158
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,552
This is not a question that we can come

159
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:40,018
to a conclusion on by discussing it here.

160
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:44,018
Moreover, it's not something that
should be decided by majority vote.

161
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:48,272
My thinking is generally
the same as Elmer's and Fermet's,

162
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:54,293
but I can't express my opinion
in terms of "it somehow seems."

163
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,267
So I will ask to withhold my decision.

164
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,288
When will you draw your conclusion?

165
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:03,093
Who can say? A century, or two?

166
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:08,640
Whatever happens, no decision
will be too late for us any longer.

167
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,644
Thank you, brethren.

168
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,850
So then, for the time being,
I will ask that all knowledge

169
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,612
concerning the "grand panacea"
remain with me.

170
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,867
Gretto?

171
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,158
Gretto, I am having regrets.

172
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:43,967
Indeed, there is knowledge
that mankind ought not have.

173
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,582
This is dangerous.

174
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,237
This will cause discord not only
among those who hate each other,

175
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,850
but among those who love each other, as well.

176
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,838
Brother, what do you mean?

177
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:57,523
The truth is, right now, I am conflicted.

178
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,859
About whether or not
I should "devour" Szilard.

179
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,728
That man and I are not all that different.

180
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,098
Brother...

181
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:07,241
Still, Gretto...

182
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,938
if those who become
immortal are outstanding people,

183
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:14,331
people who will bring about
miracles and happiness in this world,

184
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,668
then this knowledge will be invaluable.

185
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,383
And so, Gretto, I'm thinking of
sharing half of this knowledge with you.

186
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,872
If you ever encounter anyone like that,

187
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:30,753
do not hesitate to come to me.

188
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:34,393
If I am no longer among you at the time,

189
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,798
then use this half of the knowledge
and your own ability

190
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:41,108
to seek out the secret of the elixir.

191
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,768
No... That responsibility
is too much for me to bear...

192
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:50,797
Gretto, you are the only one
aboard this ship that I sincerely trust.

193
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:53,745
You are the only one who
possesses true purity of heart.

194
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,206
I want you to accept this.

195
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,902
This is our fate.

196
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,085
Brother...

197
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,642
Thank you.

198
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,769
Brother...

199
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,703
Don't do it, Maiza!

200
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,499
Elmer!

201
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,960
You can't. You can't do that.

202
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,868
In time, Szilard is going to do harm.

203
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:48,288
Before long, someone is
going to start the devouring.

204
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,511
But you can't be the one who starts it!

205
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,095
Elmer...

206
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,348
Smile, Maiza.

207
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,143
Even that old man might change.

208
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,968
What is this?

209
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:05,512
Who would have thought that I would end up

210
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,888
devouring a young girl in a place like this?

211
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,321
It was you.

212
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,268
My lust should have disappeared long ago,

213
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:17,496
but I hear a voice inside me that seeks you.

214
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:23,322
I see. That young man seemed to be
quite taken with you, huh?

215
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:25,961
What do you mean by that?

216
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,672
Stop!

217
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,452
Please, stop! I beg you!

218
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:32,122
Gretto, this is your punishment.

219
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:38,475
That man was wrong in trying to monopolize
such grand knowledge in the first place.

220
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,021
Help!

221
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,588
Sylvie, I'm so happy.

222
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:45,638
Everyone's own experiences,
everyone's own knowledge,

223
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,638
everyone's own desires...

224
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:52,478
There is no end to the useful
things one ought to know in life!

225
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:55,602
I still want to know more!

226
00:17:55,602 --> 00:18:00,192
I still haven't eaten enough, Sylvie!

227
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,417
You're the one... You ate him, didn't you?

228
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,992
You can curse your fate for being born
that man's younger brother.

229
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:13,208
Do not worry. I will make
you one with me, inside me.

230
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,386
You ate him, didn't you?!

231
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,814
S-Sylvie!

232
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,739
Maiza, I...

233
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,312
Let's find Szilard.

234
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:40,203
Sylvie! You didn't drink!

235
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,318
Nile, why, you!

236
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,908
I am extremely angry with you
right now, but I'll go ahead

237
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:51,527
and put my feelings into words anyhow.

238
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:52,674
I'll kill you!

239
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:01,808
Maiza-<i>san...</i>

240
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,814
Sylvie, are you okay?

241
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,442
Come on, let's smile together.

242
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,455
I guess not. Well, I'm going to
go try to convince old man Szilard.

243
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,995
Convince him?

244
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:21,653
What can you convince that man of?

245
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,705
The possibility isn't zero.

246
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,250
Elmer-<i>san</i>!

247
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,216
Give up, Szilard-<i>dono</i>!

248
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,594
I have no reservations
any longer, Szilard-<i>san.</i>

249
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,764
Hey! Old man Szilard!

250
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,849
Listen to what I have to say!

251
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,474
Yow!

252
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,394
Elmer!

253
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,187
Maiza!

254
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,780
Elmer!

255
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:06,573
<i>To think that you would try a stunt</i>
<i>like that to get the old man's attention...</i>

256
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:11,147
<i>You're an unusual man. Fascinating.</i>

257
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:14,381
<i>I will grant you one wish.</i>

258
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,182
<i>Almost like an Arabian genie.</i>

259
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:23,056
<i>Yes, but you only get one wish, not three.</i>

260
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,977
<i>All right, I've decided, devil.</i>

261
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,732
Elmer-<i>san</i>!

262
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,098
Are you all right, Elmer-<i>san</i>?!

263
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,018
Where's old man Szilard?

264
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:41,443
He fell into the sea. I doubt he'll be
returning to the ship, in his condition.

265
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:45,328
I see. I thought
I had a chance at convincing him.

266
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:46,747
Sylvie...

267
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,750
I know you don't want to right now,

268
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,170
but you have to keep
a happy face. Smile, Sylvie.

269
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,547
Elmer-<i>san...</i>

270
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,678
I <i>did</i> believe that the possibility was zero.

271
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,684
So that's why...

272
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,229
I haven't given up yet, though.

273
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:25,952
Gretto...

274
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,858
<i>I never imagined that it would start so soon.</i>

275
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,068
<i>It bothers me that it looks like I incited this,</i>

276
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:34,961
<i>but the human race is</i>
<i>thoroughly steeped in avarice.</i>

277
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,464
Why are you speaking to me?

278
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,748
<i>Because you were there.</i>
<i>As fellow onlookers, not getting involved,</i>

279
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:45,180
<i>let's try to get along with each other.</i>

280
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,974
I'm just interested, that's all.

281
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:52,548
<i>Birds of a feather. Well, all right.</i>

282
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:54,981
<i>I thought this was the time, for sure.</i>

283
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,655
What do you mean?

284
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:58,985
<i>Nothing much.</i>

285
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,478
<i>It was just a mild sentiment, you might say.</i>

286
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,492
It almost sounds like you are
expecting something from us.

287
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,522
<i>Don't be so hasty.</i>

288
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:12,415
<i>After all, we're going to</i>
<i>be together for a long time.</i>

289
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,919
<i>We'll have opportunity to</i>
<i>meet each other again, as well.</i>

290
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,277
It's risky turning the Runoratas against us,

291
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:26,832
but you might say that
this man Gustavo is less than fearsome.

292
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:31,212
I see. Then, other than brushing
away the sparks that come at us,

293
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:33,382
you want us to not get involved, right?

294
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:35,522
I don't think there will be any problems.

295
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:48,637
Maiza, I can sense
the presence of Szilard right nearby.

296
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,371
Don't you sense anything?

297
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,915
Oh, well.

298
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:07,459
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

299
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:21,765
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

300
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:33,318
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

301
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:40,322
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

302
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:47,458
<i>I believe so</i>

303
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:54,502
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

304
00:23:54,502 --> 00:24:02,012
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

305
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:08,717
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

306
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:18,781
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

307
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:29,261
<i>Miria, it says "Isaac and Miria</i>
<i>Unintentionally Spread Happiness Around Them</i>!"

308
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,554
<i>That's incredible, Isaac</i>!

309
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,431
<i>They've got the same names that we do</i>!

310
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,724
<i>Same first, same last</i>!

311
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:37,224
<i>We'll have to spread happiness, so we're not</i>
<i>shown up by this Isaac-san and Miria-san</i>!

312
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:39,980
<i>I'm not sure I get it, but it's incredible</i>!
