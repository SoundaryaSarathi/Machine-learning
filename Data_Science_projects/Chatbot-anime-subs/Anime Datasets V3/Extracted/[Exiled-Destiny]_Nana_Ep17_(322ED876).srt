1
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:07,831
I felt like such a fool
for not noticing until now.

2
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,941
For example, the number of piercings
they each had, and the way they talked.

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,711
Nana and Ren were so much alike.

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,691
It gave me a sense of
the deep history they had together.

5
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,811
When I was darkness at that time

6
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,651
With trembling lips

7
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,741
In a corner of a room I cry

8
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,831
The more I struggle

9
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,661
The more this wound deepens

10
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,821
The broken promise hurt me

11
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,561
Nobody can save me

12
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,741
God, I have only one request

13
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:13,371
Stop tearing apart my love

14
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,711
I need your love

15
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,941
I'm a broken rose

16
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,891
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

17
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,051
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

18
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,821
I need your love

19
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,131
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:34,061
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

21
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:38,021
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

22
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,001
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,231
I'm a broken rose

24
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,571
I wanna need your love

25
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,591
"What is that padlock
you're always wearing?"

26
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,761
"I can't take it off because
I lost the key", he says.

27
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:16,931
I'm wondering, maybe Nana
has the key to Ren's padlock.

28
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,481
Ever since I found out that Ren
of Trapnest is Nana's ex-boyfriend,

29
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,581
I took out all the music magazines
and fan-club notices I had kept

30
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,681
and read them thoroughly,
over and over.

31
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,351
I was stunned to realize
how I had just been

32
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,151
skimming through the articles
until now.

33
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:40,551
I'm clearly the type who only cares
to read what I'm interested in.

34
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:49,201
In fact, right now, my mind is
full of Nana and Ren,

35
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,141
and I can barely think of anything else.

36
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,411
Although I'm also purposely making
an effort not to think of anything else.

37
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,391
The other thing is,
if I should find a new boyfriend,

38
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,911
I'm sure I'll stop thinking about Shoji.

39
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,181
It would be nice
for such a day to come soon.

40
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:13,991
Hey, are you ready?

41
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,371
Shall we get going?

42
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:21,841
Mhm.

43
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,211
Hey... hey, Nana.

44
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,111
Aren't you getting changed?

45
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,181
Why?

46
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,171
Are you going to the live concert
dressed like that?

47
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,771
It's part of our overnight journey.

48
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,511
The more comfortable the outfit,
the better, right?

49
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,241
Say, aren't these nice?

50
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,161
Y-Yes, but we've been
looking forward to this concert

51
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,151
so shouldn't we dress up a bit?

52
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:45,221
You're meeting Ren
for the first time in two years!

53
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,661
You're the one who's been
looking forward to this.

54
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,531
Why should I also hafta dress up?

55
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,831
It's only a Trapnest concert.

56
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,771
First of all,
if she wears those sunglasses,

57
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,141
Ren might not recognize her.

58
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,171
Is she doing this on purpose?

59
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:06,281
Damn, there are a ton of things
I want to ask and say to her.

60
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,421
Is this ok?

61
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:12,451
However, right now my top priority
is getting Nana to the concert.

62
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,991
I should be careful
not to be too demanding.

63
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,701
Want another sugar for yours?

64
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,211
I won't be using any.

65
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,001
- N-No, I'm fine.
- Okay.

66
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,911
The distance between Nana and Ren
is getting shorter and shorter.

67
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,951
- I can't wait to see them.
- Huh?!

68
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,721
Your family.

69
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,331
Especially Natsuko.
I'm a big fan of hers.

70
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:58,331
I'm not too comfortable about
having you meet them.

71
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,771
My parents are no more than your
typical countryside man and woman.

72
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,341
My younger sister still
wears that dark makeup...

73
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,901
And my elder sister...

74
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,381
Nana!

75
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:13,101
She's gained even more weight.

76
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:16,921
They're identical.

77
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,591
Sorry for making you go through
the trouble of picking us up.

78
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,631
"Go through the trouble"?

79
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:27,251
Don't mention it. My workplace is
closed today, so I was available.

80
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:31,091
In this area you cannot
get anywhere without a car.

81
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,641
By the way, Nao, could you
drive us to the concert?

82
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,071
Sure. Where is it?

83
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:39,271
At the Idea Hall. I wanna
be there around six.

84
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,871
Then we should leave at around 5:30.

85
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,981
Yes! Thank you!
I love you, Nao!

86
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,791
Nana, look!

87
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,161
It's my old specialty college!

88
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,561
That brings back memories.

89
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,391
Brings back memories?

90
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,601
But you commuted there
until only a year ago, right?

91
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,771
Oh right. But it seems like
ten years ago.

92
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,141
What are you saying?

93
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:14,071
Art school, right? Was it fun?

94
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:17,711
Mhm. I knew I didn't have
much talent in that area,

95
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,741
but everyday was so much fun.
With Jun-chan and Kyosuke and...

96
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:28,851
We hung out together, everyday.

97
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:35,191
Oh, Nana. You know,
Nami was telling me...

98
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,291
Are you really
living with your boyfriend?

99
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,801
It's that guy, right?

100
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:42,701
The guy who often came by the house
while you were in art school... Shoji.

101
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,601
- No!
- I believe you're misunderstanding.

102
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,301
I am Nana's roommate.

103
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,781
Oh? Really?

104
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,851
You know, why don't you all come
and visit us sometime?

105
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,071
If you see, you'll understand.

106
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,621
What? That Nami, going around
spreading rumors again.

107
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,621
She's gotta be more careful.

108
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,851
I'm glad Nana's with me.

109
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:07,791
This place has too many memories
for me to visit alone.

110
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,971
We're back! Mom! Nana's here!

111
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:18,671
Wow, what a grand house!
You're quite the princess.

112
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,671
Not really. This is normal.
Land is really cheap around here.

113
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,951
Welcome home, Nana!

114
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,181
- Black!
- Did you get me a gift? A present?

115
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,181
Like a Louis Vuitton bag?

116
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,891
Tokyo is not a foreign country,
you know!

117
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,481
Hey! Nami, behave yourself
in front of our guest.

118
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,961
Hello, I'm Nana's mother.

119
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,161
You may find it hard to relax here,
but please make yourself at home.

120
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:48,061
Pleased to meet you. I'm Nana Osaki.
Thank you for the hospitality.

121
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,101
Nana?

122
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:51,741
That's right. We have the same name.

123
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,271
But Nana's name is written
in katakana characters.

124
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,811
Isn't she totally pretty?

125
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:58,181
It's amazing how different two people
with the same name can be.

126
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,041
Mom!

127
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,081
She's such an annoying girl!

128
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,191
Way to go, Natsuko!

129
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,411
You're laughing too much, Nami!

130
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,781
Nami, I found out you're
talking nonsense again.

131
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,661
Apparently Nana lives with Nana.

132
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:11,951
- What?
- What?

133
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,861
Why? What about your boyfriend?

134
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,701
Again, you're misunderstanding!

135
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,721
You serious? That's so boring!

136
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:21,041
Then why didn't you tell us
in the first place?

137
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,771
You're a source of constant worry.

138
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:23,771
I told you

139
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,811
- but you wouldn't listen, mom.
- So you're living with my daughter.

140
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,331
I can only imagine how much trouble
she's causing. I'm really sorry.

141
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:34,211
No, Nana is honest,
cheerful and kind.

142
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,311
Living with her
gives me encouragement.

143
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,021
As I imagined,

144
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,491
I can see she's been brought up in
a very warm family environment.

145
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,261
You certainly know
the right things to say.

146
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:43,931
Ouch!

147
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,031
You still have some time, right?

148
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,291
- Why don't I make some tea?
- Nana...

149
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:47,891
Oh, I have some Japanese sweets.

150
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,861
Nana, you're such a good actress.

151
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,001
Huh?

152
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,831
"Nana is honest, cheerful and kind"?

153
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,541
I really believe that.

154
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,971
, ., gives me encouragement.

155
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,771
By the way, where's your dad?
Does he work Saturdays too?

156
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,321
Ah, yeah. He'll be back in the evening.

157
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,281
Then I'll be able to meet him.
I'm looking forward to it.

158
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:15,151
He's not a father worth
getting your hopes up for.

159
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:19,291
Or rather, I'm really sorry. My family
can be so noisy. I'm embarrassed.

160
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,691
No, I'm really enjoying it.

161
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,901
Natsuko's even better than I imagined.

162
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:24,971
Meeting her was such a thrill.

163
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:28,141
What's so great about her?
She's just a normal lady.

164
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,701
No, that's a quality
you don't see much.

165
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,441
She is the ideal mother.

166
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,911
Really? Then what about
your mom, Nana?

167
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:35,881
What kinda person is she?

168
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,941
I bet she's pretty and cool.

169
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,551
I wonder. I can barely remember.

170
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,771
What do you mean?

171
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:46,781
You've only been away from your
hometown for less than half a year.

172
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,691
No, I haven't seen her
since I was four.

173
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,591
Huh? Why not?

174
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,021
She ran off with a guy.

175
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,991
She could even be dead now.

176
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,221
Not that I care.

177
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:04,101
Then, Nana, it was just
you and your father?

178
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,041
Do you have any siblings?

179
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,041
No.

180
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,411
Actually I never had a father
to start with.

181
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:18,381
I was raised by my mother's mother.
But grandma died when I was 15.

182
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,711
That's why I find this so attractive.

183
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,161
The atmosphere of belonging
to a loving family like yours.

184
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:28,151
Since I never had one, this is fun.

185
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:31,201
Attractive? But Nana...

186
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,901
To me, this is normal.

187
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,441
Sorry, here I am talking about
a gloomy subject.

188
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,081
I was just a bit surprised.

189
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,351
I'm sorry for asking all these questions
without really giving it much thought.

190
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,741
But I'm glad.

191
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,851
Oh, no, that came out wrong! Sorry.
I'm not glad about what you explained!

192
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,621
That part shocked me!

193
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,661
Calm down.

194
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:09,201
Nana. You've never talked to me
about yourself until now,

195
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,401
so I would wonder why that is.

196
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:14,341
It would make me sad
thinking about it.

197
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,941
So I'm glad you shared that with me.

198
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,781
I see. Sorry.

199
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,251
It never occurred to me
that you might be feeling like that.

200
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:34,131
I never had a close female friend
until now,

201
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:36,791
so I don't know how to
spend time together.

202
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:40,701
I'm not good at
talking about myself.

203
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,401
So I end up not talking about things.

204
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:53,481
But just ask me, and I'll tell you
anything you want, okay?

205
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,711
So stop feeling sad.

206
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,161
What's so funny?

207
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,461
Because Nana, why are you
always like that cool guy?

208
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:10,021
You're more like a boyfriend to me
than a female friend.

209
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:12,271
You just took my breath away
right now.

210
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,831
No, I can't have you
feel that way about me.

211
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,701
You'll really tell me anything
I want, right?

212
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,141
Yeah.

213
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,631
And promise to be frank with me.

214
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:24,351
Yeah.

215
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,341
Do you still love Ren?

216
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,191
You knew.

217
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,431
I'm sorry. Acting as if
I didn't know. But...

218
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,331
You brought me here knowing, right?

219
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,101
Thank you.

220
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,141
Nana.

221
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,601
Nana, I wanna buy a pamphlet
and stuff. What about you?

222
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,471
I'll have a smoke
and then go to my seat.

223
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,041
Show me your pamphlet later.

224
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,011
Do you still love Ren?

225
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,021
Nana ended up
not answering that question.

226
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:50,431
However, I could tell
even without her telling me.

227
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,301
The word love...

228
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,811
If you were able to
say that word with ease,

229
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,401
you would've already
gone to see him long ago.

230
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,321
We're smack in front of the guitarist.

231
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,531
You have the best seat
in the house, Nana!

232
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,671
The stage is much closer
to the seats than I expected.

233
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,211
What'll I do? I'm already
on the verge of crying.

234
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,571
Though there's no reason
for me to cry.

235
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,231
But rather than choose
happiness as a woman,

236
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,091
she chose to protect her pride.

237
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,061
Nana.

238
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:04,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
the event is about to begin.

239
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,181
If you are yet to be seated,

240
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,301
please promptly make your way
to your seats.

241
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,791
Now that we have our band members,
all we need is a band name.

242
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,261
What will it be?

243
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,621
Why don't we keep the band name
we had before?

244
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,161
There's nothing wrong with Brute.

245
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,151
That's so lame. Sounds too barbaric.

246
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,561
You're the one who
came up with the name.

247
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,931
Yes, but I want to start fresh.

248
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,111
We finally have a pretty girl on vocals,

249
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,571
so we can't have
anything barbaric, can we?

250
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,231
Right.

251
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,371
Then what about Olive? Popeye's girl.

252
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,551
Does Olive match your image?
I think not.

253
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:50,881
Same goes for you. And me.

254
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,051
Nana, stop laughing and help us think.

255
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,761
Anything you come up with
is fine with me.

256
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,061
Hey, are you serious about
being the vocalist of the band?

257
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:04,701
"Anything is fine with me."

258
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,531
Can you say you're enjoying life,

259
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,871
the way you take on everything
with that slanted attitude?

260
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,801
I never said "Anything is fine with me."

261
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,841
Then give it some thought.
Give some input into the band.

262
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,641
This coming from the most
self-centered member of the band.

263
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:23,581
What about this? This is nice.
"Black Stone".

264
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:26,141
Don't just pick the first thing you see.

265
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:29,191
But it's cool. I've never
seen anything like it.

266
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,721
Are those any good?
They have a strong scent.

267
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,761
Yeah, they're good.
They're actually cigars.

268
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,391
I made a trade with
a tobacco shop owner for them.

269
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,731
- A trade?!
- A trade?!

270
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,801
Yuck! What's this? Such a weird taste!

271
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:42,771
Really?

272
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:47,301
But not bad. Black Stone.
BLAST for short. That's easy to say.

273
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:49,401
Yeah, that's nice. "BLAST".

274
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,001
He took my cigarette.

275
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,871
- Yuck!
- What the!

276
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:56,171
You know, BLAST also
means a strong gust of wind.

277
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,321
Really?

278
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:00,021
That's great! That's kinda cool that
we shorten the name

279
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,321
and it also means something!

280
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,581
Should we go with that then?

281
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,521
We're a band of four,
so let's go with "Black Stones".

282
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:07,991
It's an odd name, but we're
an odd band so it kinda fits.

283
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,301
Agreed! Hurray for BLAST!

284
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:14,001
Okay, it's decided. So, leader,
how about a celebration speech?

285
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,541
They really went with it.

286
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:20,501
Well then, band members,
an order from your leader.

287
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:23,671
From this day on, we'll all
smoke this brand of cigarettes.

288
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,411
- Smoke it yourself!
- Smoke it yourself!

289
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,581
Why... am I crying?

290
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,251
But my heart's filled with emotion.

291
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,231
Nana...

292
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:38,111
That night, I had repeatedly prayed
so hard that the destiny waiting

293
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,271
for Nana after this would be
that of happiness.

294
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:51,521
That time, I wanted to continue
holding that hand

295
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,451
that I unknowingly was holding.

296
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,321
Always, forever.

297
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:04,251
I reached into the sky

298
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:10,771
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

299
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:16,141
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

300
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:22,141
Like colorful balloons

301
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,251
I'm alone

302
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:27,981
My hand had no place to go

303
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:34,621
And gently you took it

304
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:35,801
Starless night

305
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:40,001
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

306
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:45,801
I want to feel your warmth

307
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:47,681
Tears are falling down

308
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,771
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

309
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:58,271
Of your hand holding mine
