4
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:39,695
Master. Master.

5
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:45,425
Master! Master! Master!

6
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:51,235
Zhe Yan, when will Master wake up?

7
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:56,075
Fifth Sister,
Mo Yuan's soul has scattered.

8
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:08,526
Don't you have the best medical skills
of everyone in all the realms?

9
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:11,575
Aren't you his brother?
Why won't you save him?

10
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:15,716
Zhe Yan, why won't you save him?

11
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,776
Fifth Sister.

12
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:20,475
Your master sacrificed his soul to
destroy the Bell of the East Emperor.

13
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,586
No one can save him.

14
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:28,355
Master told me before...

15
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:32,885
that you need to sacrifice a soul to
destroy the Bell of the East Emperor.

16
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:37,036
But he also told me

17
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:40,756
that he was the one who created
the Bell of the East Emperor.

18
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:43,395
That he would find
a way to get around it.

19
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:45,566
I believed him.

20
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:51,955
Because Master protected me
from three bolts of lightning

21
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:55,545
his injuries weren't completely healed.

22
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,895
It's all my fault.

23
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,575
Fourth Brother, it's all my fault.

24
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:08,306
Fifth Sister, do you remember what
your master told you before he left?

25
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,225
"Wait for me."

26
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,975
He did say that.

27
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,276
What kind of person is Mo Yuan?

28
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:20,435
Since he said that,
he will definitely come back.

29
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:23,555
Really?

30
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,675
You know your master better than I do.

31
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:38,596
That's right.

32
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:46,125
Since Master asked us to wait,
he will definitely come back.

33
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,706
What I need to do now

34
00:04:53,576 --> 00:05:00,206
is preserve his body well
and wait for him to come back.

35
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,435
Fifth Sister, you're seriously injured.

36
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:10,295
Why don't you come with me
to the Fox Clan?

37
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,786
I'm not going anywhere.

38
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:25,235
I'll stay here with Master.

39
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,636
<i>If you're going to stay here</i>

40
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,276
<i>then I'll stay here with you.</i>

41
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:48,355
<i>I'll protect Mo Yuan with you.</i>

42
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:54,196
Just now, I said that Mo Yuan would
come back to comfort Fifth Sister.

43
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,915
But I don't think it's possible.

44
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,826
Mo Yuan's soul is scattered.
How could he come back?

45
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:07,425
Zhen Zhen, it seems you don't
know Mo Yuan very well.

46
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,565
I've known him since childhood.

47
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,446
If he wasn't going to come back

48
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:15,396
he absolutely wouldn't torment
Fifth Sister with those thoughts.

49
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,935
You mean...

50
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:21,076
He might actually come back.

51
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,115
<i>A-Yin!</i>

52
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:54,675
<i>Stop!</i>

53
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,295
<i>What are you doing?</i>

54
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,216
Master.

55
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:40,775
You only knew that I was a fox, right?

56
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:47,385
You didn't know that
I was a nine-tailed white fox.

57
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:53,936
If someone is fed the blood from
the heart of a nine-tailed white fox

58
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,865
their body will be preserved.

59
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:08,885
In the past, I thought that
besides having good looks

60
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,865
there was nothing great about
being a nine-tailed white fox.

61
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,135
But today

62
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:18,755
I'm especially grateful that
Father and Mother gave me this life.

63
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,816
Master.

64
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:28,995
Drink this blood from my heart.

65
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:33,655
Worst comes to worst,
I'll follow you in death.

66
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,686
I would be happy too.

67
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,956
Ghost Lord.

68
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,535
You may all rise, my trusted lieutenants.

69
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,275
Yes.

70
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:30,515
When I go back,
we will reorganize the army.

71
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:34,966
In 10,000 years,
we'll avenge the late ghost lord.

72
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,416
The Celestial Palace
will be a bloodbath!

73
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:40,066
Revenge!
Bloodbath in the Celestial Palace!

74
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,066
What?

75
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:49,086
You covet the Ghost Lord position?

76
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,145
I wouldn't dare.

77
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,426
Wouldn't dare?

78
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:57,135
I already have the blue cape on.

79
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,546
I've succeeded the
late Ghost Lord's position.

80
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,586
Why aren't you kneeling?

81
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,926
Father's body isn't cold yet.

82
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,755
No.

83
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:09,875
Father's body isn't even found yet.

84
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,625
He might not be dead yet.

85
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:17,905
Why are you so anxious, Li Yuan?

86
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,755
I've already said that
when I became Ghost Lord one day

87
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:27,056
I would take your life!

88
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,895
Thanks for thinking of me that way.

89
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:37,235
Father killed my mother
because of your mother.

90
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:41,466
I will never forget this hatred!

91
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:48,216
Yes. My mother also died by your hands.

92
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:54,426
I won't hide it from you now.

93
00:11:54,426 --> 00:12:00,995
That's right.
I killed that bitch with my own hands.

94
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:07,066
I strangled her like this,
little by little!

95
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,975
How could you have such power?

96
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:20,066
In the past,
it was just for self-defense.

97
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,785
I didn't expect it to be so useful.

98
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,176
Not bad, right?

99
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,515
How could this happen?

100
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,816
Your powers aren't even 30 percent
of the late Ghost Lord's.

101
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,466
You would dare to
attack the Celestial Palace?

102
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,115
Are you trying to
sacrifice all our lives?

103
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,855
There are only 30,000 left
of an army of 200,000.

104
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,375
You've never even thought of pacifying
the army officers who are still alive

105
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,125
or the soldiers who died.

106
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:49,025
You aren't even heartbroken
the way a ruler should be!

107
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:52,255
You only care about getting the blue cape
for yourself and becoming ghost lord!

108
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,855
You're cold and ruthless.

109
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,135
How could you be our ghost lord?

110
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:59,035
As the crown prince of the Ghost Tribe

111
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,836
how is it wrong for me to
become the ghost lord?

112
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:05,066
You guys on the other hand...

113
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:09,265
When you go back,
the royal guards will kill you!

114
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:11,875
We've never thought to
betray the royal family.

115
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,875
We just want to support
Second Prince to the throne.

116
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,895
As long as Second Prince
is our Ghost Lord

117
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,916
the Heavenly Lord will
accept our surrender

118
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,625
and pardon our Ghost Tribe!

119
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,556
You had the cheek to collude
with the Celestial Tribe?

120
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:28,076
Imprison him in the coldest
pole of the Ghost Realm.

121
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,135
Have people watch him day and night.

122
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:33,125
That Golden Tiger was Li Yuan's partner.

123
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,796
Arrest him quickly
and imprison him with Li Yuan.

124
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:42,576
And you're not allowed to
tell the princess of this matter.

125
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:46,135
Anyone who does will be killed.

126
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:47,495
Yes.

127
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,956
- Let's go!
- Let me go!

128
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,405
Li Jing!
I won't let you get away with this!

129
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,125
I will definitely come back and kill you!

130
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,645
Let me go, Li Jing!

131
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,145
Let me go!

132
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:00,005
Li Jing,
I will come back and kill you!

133
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,865
Li Jing!

134
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,676
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

135
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:39,346
Congratulations, Ghost Lord,
on eradicating the dissident.

136
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:49,015
If I had failed today,
would you have run away from this place?

137
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:54,015
I am loyal to you, my lord.

138
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,826
The sun and moon could
prove my heart to you.

139
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,235
My dear.

140
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,826
My lord.

141
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:13,895
You really are an incredible woman.

142
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,306
Whether it was when you were
pleading with my father back then

143
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,816
or when you injured yourself
in a scheme to go to

144
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:21,716
Kunlun Mountain to steal
the tactical formation strategy...

145
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:25,796
you've made me see you
in a new light every time.

146
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,676
I did everything for you.

147
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:38,285
For me?

148
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,995
That's true.

149
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,596
I'm not a great person or anything.

150
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:47,525
For you and me to become a couple...

151
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,666
it's fate.

152
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:09,176
Mo Yuan has been dead
for over two months.

153
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,426
I've sent 18 high immortals there
to make funeral arrangements

154
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:16,716
but they've been sent back by
some little high immortal.

155
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:20,186
Why is that little high immortal
being so domineering like this?

156
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:22,586
Here in the Celestial Palace,
we're all immortals.

157
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:26,255
There are ones who like to joke,
and ones who don't like to joke.

158
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:29,365
Mo Yuan has 17 disciples.

159
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,005
There are bound to be ones with good
tempers and ones with bad tempers.

160
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,365
Why take it to heart?

161
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:38,966
Dijun rarely speaks up for others.

162
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:43,355
Since that's the case,
I won't pursue this matter any further.

163
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,796
Yang Cuo.

164
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:48,275
Go to Kunlun Mountain
to give him a warning

165
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,985
so that the little high immortal won't

166
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:54,005
mess up an alliance
between two tribes for revenge.

167
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,326
Yes.

168
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,506
Go kneel before Heavenly Lord.

169
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:16,796
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

170
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:20,115
Don't stand on ceremony.

171
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:21,836
Come here.

172
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,855
Have your parents given you a name?

173
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,586
I'm only 500 years old.

174
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:40,566
In my clan, I only get
a name after I turn 1,000.

175
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,476
Oh.

176
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:47,536
The entire Su Jin Clan was wiped out.

177
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:51,746
I'll give you the name Su Jin, okay?

178
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:53,125
Okay.

179
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:59,965
Su Jin, your entire clan was wiped
out because of the Celestial Tribe

180
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,915
so why don't you stay
in the Celestial Palace?

181
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,145
I'll bestow you the title
Princes Zhao Ren, okay?

182
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,996
Hurry and thank Heavenly Lord.

183
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,935
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

184
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,976
You may rise.

185
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:23,385
Yang Cuo.

186
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:28,405
You'll raise Su Jin as your daughter.

187
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,306
Don't let her suffer.

188
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,155
I will obey your command.

189
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,776
Father, don't worry.

190
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:42,596
I will definitely treat Su Jin
as my own daughter.

191
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,135
Let's go, Su Jin.

192
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,776
Does Father want me to raise Su Jin

193
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,465
because he blames me for
not having any children?

194
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:04,766
Don't overthink things.

195
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,945
Among us three brothers,
I'm the only one who's married.

196
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,026
My two brothers don't
even have concubines.

197
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,935
There are no other females in the family.

198
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,996
Naturally, we are the ones
who will raise Su Jin.

199
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,806
We've already been
married for 30,000 years.

200
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:23,415
I wonder when we'll have children.

201
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:27,465
What you're worried about...

202
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:32,435
if you go to Kunlun Mountain yourself,
perhaps you'll find your answer.

203
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,006
Kunlun Mountain?

204
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,405
Senior.

205
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,945
This is the eldest prince of the
Celestial Palace and Consort Le Xu.

206
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,276
This is my seventeenth fellow disciple.

207
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:11,256
Your highnesses.

208
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:15,056
We met during the war.

209
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,536
His Highness came to discuss
the Celestial Tribe and Ghost Tribe...

210
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,615
Allow me to say it.

211
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:25,586
Si Yin, not long after Heavenly Lord
accepted their surrender

212
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,586
there were changes
in Grand Ziming Palace.

213
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:29,826
The elder prince Li Yuan was banished.

214
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:33,766
The second prince Li Jing donned the
blue cape and became the ruler.

215
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,215
On the day that he succeeded the throne

216
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:38,046
Li Jing presented
Ghost Tribe's sacred item

217
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:39,875
the winter lotus,
to Heavenly Lord as tribute.

218
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,175
Heavenly Lord has accepted it.

219
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,145
What Your Highness means is that

220
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:48,036
the Celestial Tribe and the Ghost Tribe
are now in a good relationship

221
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:51,715
and you won't allow Kunlun Mountain
to seek revenge, right?

222
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,976
The new ghost lord has already
declared himself Heavenly Lords' vassal.

223
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,066
For the peace of all the realms

224
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,566
it is inappropriate
to have any conflicts.

225
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:03,316
As Mo Yuan's proudest disciple

226
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:07,625
you wouldn't want our world
in extreme distress, right?

227
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:12,625
Before I came to Kunlun Mountain,
I was just a fox.

228
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,316
While at Kunlun Mountain
for the past 20,000 years

229
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,826
Master has never suppressed
my innate tendencies.

230
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:22,036
Pretenses at complying and swallowing
my anger are not in my nature.

231
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:29,286
Si Yin, I've been patient again and again
since we were once comrades.

232
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,556
I never would have thought
that you were this stubborn.

233
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,435
Should I teach Mo Yun's
disciples for him?

234
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:37,836
Your Highness!
To protect the Celestial Tribe

235
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,076
my master used his soul to
destroy the bell of the East Emperor.

236
00:21:40,076 --> 00:21:43,506
Why aren't the disciples of Kunlun
Mountain allowed to seek revenge?

237
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:47,276
If there is nothing else,
I will take my leave.

238
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,846
Seventeenth!

239
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:53,766
Your Highness, don't worry.

240
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,056
Seventeenth understands Master the most.

241
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,905
Right now, he still hasn't
recovered from the pain yet.

242
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:00,865
That's why he's speaking out to you.

243
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,086
Please don't take it to heart,
Your Highness.

244
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:07,736
Please report to Heavenly Lord that
since Qing Cang has been sealed away

245
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,076
Kunlun Mountain will
definitely not seek revenge.

246
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,556
<i>Who has touched the golden lotus?</i>

247
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:43,965
Master.

248
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:48,385
A-Yin, someone has touched the
golden lotus without permission.

249
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,965
I can't stay
on Kunlun Mountain with you.

250
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,675
After I've recovered my human form

251
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:58,596
I won't remember this place, or you.

252
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:18,355
A-Yin.

253
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,086
Master.

254
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:30,096
Master?

255
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,455
Master.

256
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,316
Was that you just now, Master?

257
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,836
The golden lotus just withered
all of a sudden! It's an omen!

258
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,806
Senior, what should we do?

259
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,465
Your Highnesses.

260
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:06,395
Because Master's favorite
golden lotus withered

261
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:08,125
Second Disciple didn't
follow proper etiquette.

262
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,566
Please don't take it to heart.

263
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,405
It's okay.

264
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:18,465
Could it be that even you have
followed Master in death?

265
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:58,306
Your Highness, no need to panic.

266
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,766
Master once said that

267
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,955
this golden lotus has been
waiting for its master.

268
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,076
It was just staying at
Kunlun Mountain temporarily.

269
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:05,605
Now that Your Highness is here

270
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,306
the golden lotus first withered

271
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,016
and then transformed
and dissipates golden rays

272
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:13,875
I think Your Highness is the
master it was waiting for.

273
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:16,296
Me?

274
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,826
Why would it be me?

275
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:22,355
All things in the world
have a special fate.

276
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,715
Ever since Heavenly Father
returned to nothingness

277
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:27,355
Master has been maintaining this golden
lotus for tens of thousands of years.

278
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:30,516
Now that Master is gone

279
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:35,115
it's a fortunate thing that this golden
lotus has a special fate with you.

280
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:48,046
Seventeenth.

281
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,586
Watching you leave so
anxiously made me really worried.

282
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:55,135
You must not have thoughts of going
to Ghost Realm to seek revenge.

283
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:57,175
Revenge?

284
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:01,165
This is peace that
Master sacrificed his life for.

285
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,256
Why would I go seek revenge?

286
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:06,006
Yes.

287
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:08,306
You are Master's favorite disciple.

288
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,855
How could you not
know Master's intentions?

289
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:20,266
Seventeenth is no longer the
same Seventeenth of the past.

290
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:23,195
Master's spirit must be at peace now.

291
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:29,046
Master has already been
dead for so many days.

292
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,796
Why hasn't there been
any changes to his body?

293
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:33,945
Could there be special
powers in this cave?

294
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,796
It might be Heavenly Father's protection.

295
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,776
When Heavenly Father returned to
nothingness, his body dissipated.

296
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:45,746
Seeing Master like this
made me remember a rumor.

297
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:48,435
What rumor?

298
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:51,215
Ghost Tribe's sacred item, the soul jade.

299
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:53,625
Soul jade?

300
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,215
The ancient books have records
about Ghost Tribe's soul jade.

301
00:26:56,215 --> 00:27:00,165
If a corpse keeps it in his mouth,
it will never rot.

302
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,306
Is that rumor true?

303
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:07,955
It was recorded in the ancient books,
so it should be true.

304
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:10,675
But now, Kunlun Mountain and Ghost
Tribe have irreconcilable differences.

305
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:12,155
Even though it's not bad enough
to the point of getting revenge

306
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,986
it's not good enough to
have dealings with each other.

307
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:17,605
Seventeenth, don't get any thoughts
about trying to take it by force.

308
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:37,875
Who has come here?

309
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,455
Kunlun Mountain's
seventeenth disciple, Si Yin.

310
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:44,675
I have to see Ghost Lord
about an important matter.

311
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,945
You want the soul jade?

312
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:58,096
On account of our past friendship

313
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,816
please lend me the soul jade.

314
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,796
Get up first.

315
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:09,476
I thought you were here to seek revenge.

316
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:13,596
There's no right or wrong
on the battlefield.

317
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:19,715
Besides, Ghost Tribe and
Celestial Tribe are now allies.

318
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:22,915
You are also the ghost lord
that Heavenly Lord respects.

319
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,766
I wouldn't dare to seek revenge.

320
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:28,115
I just want to borrow the soul jade.

321
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,786
Even though the soul jade is
the Ghost Tribe's sacred item

322
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:39,605
besides being able to preserve
a corpse from rotting

323
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:41,945
it's not useful in any other way.

324
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:48,425
Do you want it for Mo Yuan?

325
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,205
I have my use for it.

326
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,776
Even though you won't tell me
your use for the soul jade

327
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:05,096
I would still lend it to you
on account of our relationship.

328
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,986
But because of the huge
changes in the palace

329
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,715
the soul jade has
disappeared for a while now.

330
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,756
I'm really sorry.

331
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:15,865
You lost it?

332
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,635
Yes.

333
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:20,016
Why would it be lost?

334
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,036
I just told you.

335
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,756
We don't even know where
the former lord or my brother is.

336
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:28,125
Why would we know where a mere jade is?

337
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,486
Thank you for telling me.

338
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,655
High Immortal Si Yin.

339
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:00,286
You came such a long way.

340
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:01,865
Why don't you rest a bit before leaving?

341
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:06,736
If you leave like this, it will seem like
Grand Ziming Palace is not hospitable.

342
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,826
Did you come all this way
for this soul jade?

343
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:22,236
Ghost Lord gave this to me the day
before yesterday to heal the scars on me.

344
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:24,836
The whipping from Qing Cang wasn't light.

345
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:28,276
I still have a lot of
injuries on my body.

346
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:35,286
You know that it's not good for
women to have scars on their bodes.

347
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:43,816
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

348
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:02,195
What are you doing?

349
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:15,026
This is the item you lost?

350
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:24,455
The one thing I regret most in life

351
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:27,695
is coming to Grand Ziming Palace
and meeting you, Li Jing.

352
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:31,486
You two are really
cruel and unscrupulous.

353
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:33,326
You are such a perfect match
for each other.

354
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:38,326
From now on, we are
absolutely irreconcilable!

355
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,855
A-Yin!

356
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,885
My lord!

357
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,685
A-Yin!

358
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:45,715
My lord!

359
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:48,046
Go away!

360
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:03,246
Tell me, what exactly are you up to?

361
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,685
You were the one who lied to her first

362
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:08,276
and told her you lost the soul jade.

363
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:12,605
I just added more fuel
to the fire for you.

364
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:21,256
Who are you to interfere
between me and her?

365
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:27,105
You and her?

366
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,855
When you were at the
bottom of Kunlun Mountain

367
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:33,286
listening to Si Yin only having
her master Mo Yuan on her mind

368
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:36,256
you wanted to kill
Mo Yuan out of jealousy.

369
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:39,536
But Si Yin has never liked you.

370
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:41,955
She is from the Celestial Tribe

371
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,905
so that's why you're with me.

372
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:46,836
I know that.

373
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:48,786
But do you?

374
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,875
She's never had you in her heart.

375
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,026
Do you know that?

376
00:32:55,395 --> 00:32:57,175
Don't say anymore.

377
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,556
She has so much pride.

378
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,925
She came here today
to beg for this favor.

379
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:11,165
It was all for Mo Yuan.

380
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:13,605
You know that very well.

381
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,036
You wouldn't give her the soul jade.

382
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,615
It's out of jealousy, isn't it?

383
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,965
You're so jealous,
you're going mad and crazy, aren't you?

384
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,566
Don't say anymore.

385
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,665
I'm also jealous.

386
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:30,096
I'm so jealous I'm going crazy.

387
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:34,006
I've done so much for you.

388
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:36,635
But you've never cared about me.

389
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,796
Today, because of her...

390
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,056
Because of her,
you're treating me like this!

391
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:50,056
But I gave you the Ghost Queen position.

392
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:52,596
Isn't that enough?

393
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:58,155
Ever since our wedding,
you've never even touched me.

394
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:02,705
So what if I'm queen?

395
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:06,945
So what if I'm more powerful
than everyone but you?

396
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:13,936
It's not better than our short time
at the bottom of Kunlun Mountain.

397
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,905
Don't bring up Kunlun Mountain anymore.

398
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,606
If I don't bring it up

399
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,516
will you be able to forget about it?

400
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:04,036
It's been a long time since we've
all come together for a meal like this.

401
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,956
- Yes.
- Yes.

402
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:11,286
Ever since Ninth and Master died,
it hasn't been this lively.

403
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:13,266
Let's not talk about those sad things.

404
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,096
Come on.

405
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:18,135
Let's live in the moment!

406
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:21,556
A toast to Master.

407
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:52,056
A toast to Ninth.

408
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:20,925
Senior, Ninth never drank wine.

409
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:23,135
You're trying to get him drunk?

410
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,516
That's right.

411
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,945
Ninth doesn't have
good alcohol tolerance.

412
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,945
It's completely different when
compared to Seventeenth.

413
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:36,615
All right, let's eat.

414
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,525
I spent four hours making all this.

415
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:40,746
You all must eat everything.

416
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,056
My fellow disciples.

417
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:58,396
Ever since I came to Kunlun Mountain

418
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,956
Master and you all have
shown such care for me.

419
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:08,646
But I've been causing so much trouble

420
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,876
and haven't been training properly.

421
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:19,675
I've made trouble for you all and Master.

422
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:24,485
I will drink first.

423
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,715
That was delightful.

424
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:36,505
It was really delightful.

425
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,286
Seventeenth, come here.

426
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:44,795
Come on.

427
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,275
Sit here.

428
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:53,715
Just now, it was like going
back to the past for a bit.

429
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:55,565
The days of riding horses,
admiring peach blossoms

430
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,106
and drinking in the Spring Palace.

431
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:03,246
At that time, all of us would only bring
you to the mortal world to play around.

432
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,945
Only Ninth would watch
after you as you studied.

433
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:12,175
Ninth... what a pity.

434
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,496
I remember one time

435
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:20,795
when we drank too much.

436
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:22,896
We were soaring on clouds.

437
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:27,695
We went to Mount Junji of the
Far East to see the sunrise.

438
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:30,356
Yes, good thing it was
very late at night.

439
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:33,335
No mortals saw us soaring on clouds.

440
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:37,076
Otherwise Master would've
given us a good lecture.

441
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:39,666
Okay.

442
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,396
When we're done making funeral
arrangements for Master

443
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:43,246
let's go to Mount Junji of the Far East

444
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:44,516
and watch the sunrise again.

445
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:46,856
- Okay!
- Okay!

446
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,485
Cheers!

447
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,016
Come on.

448
00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:02,025
Come on. Eat! Eat!

449
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,826
Okay.

450
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:30,766
My fellow disciples.

451
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,686
Goodbye.

452
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:04,076
Master, I'm useless.

453
00:40:04,076 --> 00:40:06,056
I couldn't get the soul jade.

454
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:09,715
To preserve your body

455
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:12,425
I have no choice
but to bring you to Qing Qiu.

456
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:17,425
Please forgive me.

457
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,476
So despicable!
You're the most despicable!

458
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,315
You always steal our food!

459
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,916
Despicable!

460
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,425
You're so ugly, yet you keep
appearing before our eyes.

461
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,755
Go away! Go away!

462
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,295
You're not allowed to follow us!

463
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:48,056
Go away!

464
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:15,576
