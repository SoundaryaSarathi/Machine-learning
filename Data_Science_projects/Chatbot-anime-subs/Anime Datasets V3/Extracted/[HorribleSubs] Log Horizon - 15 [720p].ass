Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.13,0:05:01.82,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,Those techniques are taunts,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.82,0:05:04.91,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,so they don't actually damage the enemy,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.38,0:05:08.84,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,but the enemy will think they've \Ntaken a ton of damage.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.59,0:05:16.68,Default,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,The samurai has a high defense, so my job is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.68,0:05:19.92,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,to keep the enemy focused on \Nme rather than all of you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.93,0:05:23.70,Default,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}Samurai's Challenge{\i0} takes two seconds to land.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.70,0:05:25.38,Default,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,Just like {\i1}Orb of Lava{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.04,0:05:29.88,Default,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,But its range is no farther than \Nthe reach of my katana.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.40,0:05:43.10,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,My attempt to taunt them will be wasted.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.83,0:05:46.33,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,That's why all the enemies go after you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.33,0:05:49.09,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,Then, should I not use {\i1}Orb of Lava{\i0}?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.09,0:05:50.83,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,Just wait two seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.22,0:05:54.70,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,In a glorious, elegant battle, \Na loss of two seconds can prove fatal.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.58,0:05:57.46,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,So then...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.96,0:06:01.61,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,Is that where {\i1}Coward's Fugue{\i0} can be useful?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.07,0:06:02.96,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,What's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.22,0:06:05.62,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,Sounds cowardly, judging by the name.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.01,0:06:08.09,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,Is that a skill of yours, Miss Isuzu?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.09,0:06:11.55,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}Coward's Fugue{\i0} is a skill I just learned.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.55,0:06:14.10,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,It's a continuous support song.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.10,0:06:15.42,Default,Se,0000,0000,0000,,Continuous?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.42,0:06:18.48,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,Basically, I can leave it running.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.71,0:06:24.18,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,It seems to make the damage \Ndealt by any non-warrior class
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.18,0:06:27.24,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,appear to be lower as long as it's in effect.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.47,0:06:28.73,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,You have a skill like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.73,0:06:29.53,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.53,0:06:32.66,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,I d-do... Really.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.66,0:06:35.40,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,But it isn't that amazing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.40,0:06:37.56,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, doesn't it sound kind of useless?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.56,0:06:41.42,Default,I,0000,0000,0000,,It doesn't deal damage or heal...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.69,0:06:42.62,Default,T,0000,0000,0000,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.66,0:06:45.23,Default,R,0000,0000,0000,,Depending how you use it...
