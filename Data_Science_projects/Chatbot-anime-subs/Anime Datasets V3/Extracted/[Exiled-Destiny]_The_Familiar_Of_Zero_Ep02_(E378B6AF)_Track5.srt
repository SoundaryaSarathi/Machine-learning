1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,566
That will be 8500 yen for repairs.

2
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:08,102
Gotta get a part-time job.

3
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,355
Hold on! Someone!

4
00:00:45,274 --> 00:00:47,606
...answer my guidance!

5
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,226
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

6
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:11,565
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

7
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:22,106
The sky where two moons
never fade away

8
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:28,141
That's an impossibility, right?

9
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:34,924
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

10
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:40,696
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

11
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:47,192
Even if you trip and
become depressed

12
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:54,639
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

13
00:01:55,445 --> 00:02:01,517
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

14
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:07,824
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

15
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:13,796
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

16
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:22,295
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

17
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:30,568
Peasant Familiar

18
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,650
Earth?

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,781
Yeah, up until a few moments ago,
I was in Tokyo, Japan, on Earth.

20
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,917
I don't believe it.

21
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,191
For such a different world to exist...

22
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,497
I don't want to believe it either!

23
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:50,700
Anyway, take me back
to where I used to be!

24
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,634
Impossible.

25
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:53,465
Don't just say that so simply!

26
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:58,465
No matter who it's with
or where they're from,

27
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:00,935
the contract is absolute!

28
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,779
What are you doing?

29
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,716
I'm changing for bed.

30
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:16,626
Don't do that when I'm here!

31
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:17,660
Why?

32
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,458
You're fine with a guy
watching you do that stuff?

33
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,233
A guy?

34
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,736
You're nothing more than a familiar.

35
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:27,794
What?!

36
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,571
Okay, wash those for me.

37
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,209
Wait...

38
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,319
Why do I have to wash your lingerie...

39
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,653
I don't know whether to be
happy or upset about this...

40
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,295
No, this is where I'm
supposed to be upset!

41
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:53,284
Yeah!

42
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:58,301
Hey, I'm never going
to do your laundry...

43
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,963
And just who do you think
will be taking care of you?

44
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:04,707
You're my familiar, right?

45
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:08,844
Cleaning, laundry, errands...
those are to be expected.

46
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:11,506
Make sure to have my clothes
ready by morning.

47
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,643
Don't worry.

48
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:18,651
If you do your work right,
you'll get fed.

49
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,320
Fed? Are you treating me
like a dog or something?!

50
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:35,296
Well, for now, I guess
whatever happens, happens.

51
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:39,734
So cold...

52
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:50,453
Who are you?

53
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,284
Here's your clothes.

54
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:56,022
You're the one who told me to
have it ready in the morning!

55
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:59,462
Oh... The familiar...

56
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,487
That's right, I summoned
one yesterday.

57
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:03,699
And the underwear?

58
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,929
You can get those
for yourself, at least!

59
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:08,433
You can go without a meal.

60
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,006
In the bottom drawer.

61
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,108
Dammit!

62
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,944
Why me...

63
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:18,873
Here!

64
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,720
Hey, can you take this
thing off already?

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,489
No.

66
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:27,623
I won't run away!

67
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,989
I've been brought to this place
that makes no sense whatsoever,

68
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:33,362
so where do you think
I'm going to run off to?!

69
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:36,354
Shut up! Fine!

70
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:37,933
What?!

71
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:38,934
Dress me.

72
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,697
You can put your own clothes on.

73
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,676
Nobles that have servants
never dress themselves!

74
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,444
What do you mean, nobles?

75
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:48,744
Don't go acting all...

76
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:49,712
I see!
Don't go acting all...

77
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:51,814
I guess you won't be
needing a meal then.

78
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:53,839
And you want to keep
that chain on too?

79
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:58,954
It's a promise.

80
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,423
Now take this thing off!

81
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,981
I guess I have no choice.

82
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:10,499
She'd be pretty if she
kept her trap shut.

83
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:11,634
What?

84
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:12,862
No, nothing.

85
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:17,597
Let's go.

86
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,465
Where to?

87
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,676
To breakfast, of course.

88
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:30,783
They're here.

89
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:35,550
The much-rumored runaway
familiar, and his master...

90
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:41,997
Man! What a feast!

91
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:45,694
Hurry up and pull the chair back.
You really are inconsiderate.

92
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,896
Yeah, sure, sure.

93
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,905
Is today some kind of anniversary?

94
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,500
This is a feast, for so early
in the morning!

95
00:06:56,212 --> 00:07:00,148
Oh, I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday, so...

96
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:03,552
What?

97
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,622
It's... a plate?

98
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,458
Only nobles can sit here.

99
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,660
You, peasant, sit down here.

100
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,888
No way!

101
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,669
O great founder Bremir
and Her Royal Highness,

102
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,538
we are once again grateful

103
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,904
for the humble meal that you
have brought us this morning.

104
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,102
The humble meal's right here.

105
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,054
Normally, familiars wait
outside during a meal.

106
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:41,857
I specially let you stay with me.

107
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:44,587
If that's the case,
I'd rather eat elsewhere!

108
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:46,990
What's everyone doing?

109
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:51,000
All second-year students
have the day off today.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,735
We're all supposed to communicate

111
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,104
with all our freshly-
summoned familiars.

112
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,173
I'd just as soon pass.

113
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,640
Oh?

114
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,577
It's some red thing!

115
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,715
Is this the first time you've
seen a salamander?

116
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:09,118
Keep it on a leash!
That was dangerous!

117
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:12,188
It's all right. Familiars under contract

118
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:14,790
faithfully obey every order
from their master,

119
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,951
and they never run away.

120
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,525
Isn't that right, Flame?

121
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,924
Don't give me that!

122
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,835
You know, didn't you just sneak in

123
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,963
a peasant that was
walking around the area?

124
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:32,208
You covered it up well
with that explosion.

125
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,244
That's not true! I made
the summons properly.

126
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,680
This guy just happened to show up!

127
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,615
Well, he's very befitting
of Louise the Zero.

128
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,089
What's up with that wench?!

129
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,614
Don't just stand there!
Bring me some tea, at least!

130
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,037
Oh, I'm sorry!

131
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:04,767
No, it's all right.

132
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:07,910
Excuse me.

133
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,605
No, please excuse me.

134
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:18,954
Could you be the one that became
Miss Vallière's familiar?

135
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,789
You know about me?

136
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,592
It's all over the rumor mill
that a peasant

137
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,287
has been summoned as a familiar.

138
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,591
Well, I don't understand much of
this noble and peasant business.

139
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:35,704
Those that can use magic are nobles,

140
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,695
and those that can't are
the peasants, right?

141
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:41,040
Oh, I see. That's how it works.

142
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,045
So are you a sorcerer too?

143
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,647
Quite the contrary!

144
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,684
I am Siesta, and I have
the honor of serving here.

145
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,819
I am a peasant, just like you.

146
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:53,989
I'm Hiraga Saito. Call me Saito.

147
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,752
Mr. Saito?

148
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,127
That is a strange name.

149
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,862
Hey!

150
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,659
Isn't the cake ready?

151
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,697
Coming right up!

152
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,936
I'll take it to him.

153
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,704
But that's...

154
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:09,762
It's fine.

155
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:22,151
This is good enough for that snob.

156
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:26,388
I talked all night with Verdande here.

157
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:30,292
I see... All night...

158
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,727
Yes...

159
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:34,797
These intelligent eyes...
This sensual texture...

160
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:37,994
Truly, it was destined
to become my familiar.

161
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:42,428
In any case, keep it buried
when you're with me.

162
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,473
Order's up!

163
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:47,101
Oh, and bring some more tea as well.

164
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:51,736
Your familiar is so cute, just like you.

165
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,717
You're always such a flatterer.

166
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:58,187
I won't lie to your eyes.

167
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:02,749
But I heard rumors that you're
dating a first-year recently.

168
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,760
Such nonsense!

169
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,961
There is nothing hidden...

170
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:08,794
...behind my feelings for you...
Wasn't it?

171
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,736
What are you...

172
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,270
Oh, I get it!

173
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,474
The color of the cape is different
for different grades.

174
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,875
Black is for second-years.

175
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,977
So the girl with the brown one
last night was a first-year.

176
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,846
I see, I see...

177
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,143
What's he talking about?

178
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,984
Hurry up and go back to
your business, waiter!

179
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:31,286
Wrong! I'm not a waiter.

180
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:33,422
You're the one that Louise the Zero...

181
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,324
Thanks for everything last night.

182
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,291
See ya.

183
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,794
Now, Guiche, what
was that all about?!

184
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,929
Oh, yes... You know,
I told you, right?

185
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:45,127
I had that peasant familiar to
deal with last night, that's all.

186
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,171
Montmorency, it's far too rowdy here.

187
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,765
We should talk under
that tree over there.

188
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:52,441
Hurry now... Come now, come now...

189
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,705
Wait! What is it all of a sudden?
Hurry now... Come now, come now...

190
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:59,746
Lord Guiche, where are you?

191
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,085
Oh, if you mean Lord Guiche,

192
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,713
it just so happens that
he's right over there!

193
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:07,812
Lord Guiche!

194
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:09,747
Ketty!

195
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,462
Hi...

196
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:15,396
I have been looking
for you, Lord Guiche!

197
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,801
I thought I'd bring my
handmade soufflé,

198
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:21,003
that I was talking about last night,
to the tea party today.

199
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:24,039
Oh, that is very...

200
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,028
Last night?

201
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,476
Well, that is...

202
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,311
Good for you!

203
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,281
You were saying that you would
love to have some of it.

204
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,949
You!

205
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,440
It's nothing.
Just telling the truth, right?

206
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,554
What is the meaning of this, Guiche?!

207
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:41,090
What is it that you're going on about?

208
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,827
You're going to found needless
misunderstandings with these ladies!

209
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:46,328
What's going on?

210
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:49,297
Guiche is picking a fight
with that peasant familiar.

211
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,068
What part of it is a misunderstanding?

212
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:55,332
You're the one at fault for two-timing.

213
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,473
Two-timing?!

214
00:12:57,473 --> 00:13:00,465
So there really was something
going on with this first-year!

215
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,179
Please, Montmorency the Perfume...

216
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:08,217
Do not contort your face, one as
beautiful as a rose, from anger!

217
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,918
This is all a misunder...

218
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,053
How horrible!

219
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,355
You said that I was the only one!

220
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,891
In any case, both of you, calm down.

221
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,085
Liar!

222
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,899
You just got dumped, Guiche!

223
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,094
Well, you deserved what you just got.

224
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:35,077
It seems that you do not know
how to pay respect to nobility.

225
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:38,947
Unfortunately, I come from a world
that has nothing to do with that.

226
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:39,879
Very well, then.

227
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:51,160
A duel?

228
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,863
That's right.
I challenge you to a duel!

229
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:58,033
You are nothing but a peasant,
and a familiar to boot.

230
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,868
Yet you have mocked me,

231
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:03,405
and on top of that, you have
made two ladies cry!

232
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:06,374
Cry? They were both hopping mad.

233
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,878
Prepare yourself!

234
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,903
I will be waiting at Vestori Square!

235
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,952
You! What are you doing?!

236
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:18,214
What?

237
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,656
What do you mean, what?

238
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,557
Why are you promising to fight
a duel without permission?!

239
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,394
Where are we going?

240
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,196
We're going to apologize to Guiche.

241
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,596
Right now, he still might forgive you.

242
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:31,058
I refuse.

243
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,970
Why do I have to apologize?

244
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,539
You really don't understand anything.

245
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,575
Peasants can never win
against nobles.

246
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,066
You'll be lucky if you get away
with just minor wounds!

247
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,582
Hey, where is Vestori Square?

248
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,117
Oh, over there. That way.

249
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:50,419
Malicorne!

250
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,408
Thanks!

251
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:53,922
Wait!

252
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,425
Oh, this will be a sight!

253
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,993
Oh, geez!

254
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:01,053
He's only a familiar, yet he's
always going off on his own!

255
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:09,037
No previous case exists
of a peasant familiar.

256
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,335
That is not the problem at hand.

257
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:16,311
I didn't recognize the familiar's
rune that appeared on him,

258
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,080
so I looked it up,

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
and it was strikingly similar to this.

260
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,053
Miss Longueville, I apologize, but...

261
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,315
Understood.

262
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,724
He really amuses me.

263
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,004
I praise you for actually
showing up and not running off.

264
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:43,372
Who would run away?

265
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:44,464
Wait!

266
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,145
That's enough, Guiche!
Duels are forbidden!

267
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:53,348
Only duels between two
nobles are forbidden.

268
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:56,084
He is a peasant.
There are no problems.

269
00:15:56,084 --> 00:16:00,020
That's because nothing like this
has ever happened...

270
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:07,120
Louise, can it be that you are
attracted to this peasant?

271
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,666
Who is? Knock it off!

272
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,302
Nobody would just sit and watch

273
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,998
as their familiar gets beaten
to a tattered heap!

274
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:18,040
A tattered heap...

275
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,669
No matter what you say,
the duel has already started!

276
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,151
I am named Guiche the Brass.

277
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:33,019
Therefore, a brass golem, a Valkyrie,
will be your opponent.

278
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:42,064
That's playing dirty!

279
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,099
It's nothing but natural
for a noble, a mage,

280
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:47,091
to use magic to fight a duel, no?

281
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,074
Do you get it now? Peasants
can never win against mages.

282
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,006
Out of the way!

283
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:58,213
Oh? Did I go too easy on you?

284
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,716
I was just caught off guard
by the sudden attack.

285
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:03,116
Why are you getting up, you idiot?!

286
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,110
Because he irritates me.

287
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,657
Mages, nobles, whatever...

288
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:11,226
It makes you all act
needlessly snobbish.

289
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:13,395
What nonsense are you talking?!

290
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,798
Well, I would feel bad about
breaking something Louise owns,

291
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,101
so I'll forgive you if
you apologize right here.

292
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:24,266
Fool! That didn't get me at all.
Your doll is way too weak.

293
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,105
Is that so?

294
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:32,347
This is a familiar's rune
that exists only in legend.

295
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,883
Furthermore, considering
that he was summoned

296
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,817
by that third girl of
the Vallière family...

297
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:42,086
This has something to do with
one corner of the lost Pentagon.

298
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:44,159
It can't be.

299
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,161
Whatever the truth behind this is,

300
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:49,164
you must not speak one word
about this to anyone!

301
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,132
I understand that.

302
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,875
Why are you getting up?!

303
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,245
Oh, he's still gonna get up?

304
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,375
I'm going home.

305
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,115
But this is where it gets interesting.

306
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:18,693
Please! Stop it already!

307
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:21,229
Step aside, Louise.

308
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:24,399
That's enough. You did well.

309
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,731
I've never seen a peasant
like this before!

310
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,895
It's all right. Get out of the way.

311
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:36,144
Of course it hurts!

312
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:39,238
That's common sense!
What are you thinking?!

313
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:41,516
Are you crying?

314
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:42,751
There's no way I'd cry!

315
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,740
That hurts!

316
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:47,815
I'm telling you, that hurts!

317
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,658
You still want to go on?

318
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,428
If you have the will to go on,
take up that sword!

319
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,776
If you don't, then you can
tell me that you're sorry.

320
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,511
You've got to be kidding!

321
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,705
Who would?!

322
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,248
No! You can't!

323
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:16,551
If you pick it up, Guiche
won't show you any mercy.

324
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,351
All right? This is an order
from me, your master!

325
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,860
I can't go back to the world
where I came from,

326
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,329
which means I have
to live here, right?

327
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:28,591
So what?!

328
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:31,165
I don't mind if I sleep on the floor.

329
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,735
I don't care if my meals taste awful.

330
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:36,329
It can't be helped, so I'll keep going.

331
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:39,574
But if I don't want to bow
my head down to someone,

332
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:41,371
I can't bow down to him!

333
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,236
Idiot!

334
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,679
The pain...

335
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:04,894
What's going on?!

336
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,701
I don't know.

337
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:10,899
But I do know that I feel like I can
keep fighting a little more.

338
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:27,249
I yield...

339
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,790
To think that a noble would
lose against a peasant...

340
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,233
What?

341
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,536
Are you all right?

342
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah...

343
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,603
This is nothing...

344
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:53,843
Hold on!

345
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:57,652
He's asleep...

346
00:20:57,652 --> 00:20:59,588
Hey, you're heavy!

347
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:01,323
Come on, get off of me!

348
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:02,950
Get off already!

349
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,737
Ouch...

350
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:17,505
Have you awakened?

351
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:18,940
Thank goodness.

352
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,306
You've been asleep for three days
and three nights now.

353
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,079
Why are you here?

354
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,709
Miss Vallière instructed me
to bring you a meal.

355
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:33,287
She must be tired now.

356
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,927
She's been watching over you all
this time without sleep, Mr. Saito.

357
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,053
Louise was?

358
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,492
She's so cute when she's like this.

359
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,402
What a waste.

360
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:48,370
Yes?

361
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,928
Oh... Nothing.

362
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:53,467
Nothing at all...

363
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:11,826
As if I were under a real magic spell

364
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:22,860
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

365
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:34,549
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

366
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:45,653
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

367
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:57,633
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

368
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:08,505
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

369
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:14,746
For the day to start from zero

370
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,002
You stupid dog!

371
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,171
Why are you looking
so damn spacey?!

372
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,206
On top of that,

373
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:34,442
you're staring at that horny
nothing-but-boobs Kirche!

374
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:37,178
I'll never forgive you for this!
