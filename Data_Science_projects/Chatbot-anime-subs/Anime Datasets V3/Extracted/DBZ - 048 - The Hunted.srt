00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,876
Elder!

2
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:20,208
Dodoria-<i>san</i>! Wait!

3
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:24,205
Begin by killing
these three younger ones!

4
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,380
Dammit!

5
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:53,245
I'll dispose of all three
of you within ten seconds.

6
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:56,581
Don't be ridiculous! You think
you're a match for all three of us!?

7
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:02,187
Huh? Do <i>l</i> think I'm a match
for you? What an amusing joke.

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,916
What!?

9
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,859
Come on!

10
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:15,527
What!?

11
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:19,361
It's hopeless! He can't defeat
that guy with that kind of attack!

12
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:55,567
You now understand that it is useless
to try to defy us or run away, I trust.

13
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,229
In any case, come back
down here, please.

14
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:08,074
So you have finally grown
cooperative, I see. That will do.

15
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:13,184
You have destroyed
my precious Scouters.

16
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:17,848
May I have you produce your
Dragon Ball, by way of apology?

17
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:27,866
I have no choice. But promise
me that no matter what,

18
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:31,029
you will not lay a hand
on the children!

19
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:43,548
Yes, yes, we ought to have done it
this way right from the beginning.

20
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:47,886
W- what monsters
these guys are! How awful!

21
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,888
Why, those-!

22
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,225
H- hey, Gohan! Don't go
getting any funny ideas.

23
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:58,719
T- there's simply no way we can
stand up to those guys, okay?

24
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:38,860
Yow-ow-ow... With twenty times the gravity,
you get twenty times the pain!

25
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:05,830
Now, take this, and get
out of here at once.

26
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,060
Well done.

27
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,338
While I am at it, let me also
have you tell me the locations

28
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:16,174
of the two remaining Dragon Balls.

29
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,675
Don't be ridiculous!

30
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:23,671
We Namekians don't sell each other out,
even if it means our own lives!

31
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:31,523
Now, we had an agreement!
Leave here at once!

32
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,526
Oh dear, not you, too.

33
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:39,531
There is absolutely no one on this planet
who will speak about their friends.

34
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:43,868
I guess I will have to have you die...
along with the children!

35
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:48,532
W- what did you say!?
Why, you-!

36
00:05:56,548 --> 00:06:01,212
Elder! Elder!

37
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,557
This isn't what we agreed to!

38
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:09,160
You promised you wouldn't do anything
else if I handed over the Dragon Ball!

39
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,832
But unless I have all seven Dragon
Balls, it is meaningless, correct?

40
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:19,237
You have destroyed our Scouters,
so we will need to have you tell us

41
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:21,906
where the remaining two are.

42
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:27,071
I told you, I'll tell you about
the others over my dead body!

43
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,519
Is that how badly you want to die?
In that case, I will do as you wish.

44
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,853
What!?

45
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:41,416
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, will we possibly be able to
search for the Dragon Balls without Scouters?

46
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,863
Kill all three of them.

47
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,532
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,868
T- that's dirty!

49
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,205
You guys run! Run away!

50
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,263
Right!

51
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,436
I'll show you the pride
of the Namekian people!

52
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,890
C- Cargot!

53
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,221
Control yourself, Gohan!

54
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:28,840
Control yourself.
There's nothing we can do! Hey!

55
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,402
Cargot! Cargot! Cargot!

56
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:40,401
You didn't even have a chance
to show us this " pride" of yours, huh?

57
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,930
It won't even be any fun
to smash a little kid like this.

58
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:08,104
Well, all the same, die!

59
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,039
Stop!!

60
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,379
Gohan!

61
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,223
What? Your buddies? Where?

62
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:57,915
Does that teach you?

63
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:05,860
W- who the hell are you!?

64
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,867
That idiot!

65
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:13,871
I am going to take you down!!

66
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,032
What did you say?

67
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,878
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

68
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:25,216
You dumbass! Run! Hurry!

69
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,884
Hurry!

70
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,215
Right!

71
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:36,394
They do not appear
to be Namekians, do they?

72
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:38,055
No, sir.

73
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,236
Damn it!

74
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:49,900
After them!
Dodoria-<i>san</i>, catch them!

75
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:21,539
Gohan, fly as fast as you can!
If he catches us, we're finished!

76
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,870
Right!

77
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:31,045
Fools! Do you think you can escape?

78
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,224
It's no good! He's faster
than us! He'll overtake us!

79
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,909
They are quite fast,
aren't they, Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

80
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,412
They also seem to have more
battle power than the Namekians.

81
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:05,182
Who in the world could they be?

82
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:11,519
In the way, to be sure. That
mountain is in the way, you see?

83
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:35,702
Now our visibility has become
much clearer, has it not?

84
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,225
Huh?

85
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,202
Gohan!

86
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:09,230
Oh, crap!

87
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,173
Damn!

88
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:29,849
Dammit, let go of me!
Let go of me, you!

89
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,533
I'm not going to make it in time!

90
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:57,217
Gohan! Get out of here!
Hurry! He's coming!

91
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,834
Damn, these sure are
nimble little guys!

92
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:29,186
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, let's land and fight him!

93
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:32,690
We can't! He isn't the sort of foe
we can do anything against by fighting!

94
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,181
Just fly as hard as you can!

95
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:50,541
Damn, if this keeps up, we've had it!
I've got to do something!

96
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,543
That's it! Gohan!

97
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:56,547
Gohan, from here on, don't look
in my direction! Close your eyes!

98
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,816
I have an idea. Got that!?

99
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,044
Right!

100
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,824
Take this!

101
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:10,055
<i>Taiyo-ken!!</i>

102
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:24,175
My eyes! My eyes!

103
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,844
My eyes!

104
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,870
I did it! It worked!

105
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:35,186
Why, you-! My eyes!

106
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:38,087
Gohan! Hide now, while we can!

107
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,418
Right!

108
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:55,539
W- why, you rotten-!

109
00:16:55,539 --> 00:17:00,272
W- where did you go, dammit!?

110
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,610
Where are you!?
Where the hell did you go!?

111
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,385
Come on out, dammit!

112
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,173
W- what did you do, Kuririn-<i>san</i>?

113
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,906
Oh, I just blinded him a little bit.

114
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,604
It's okay. He doesn't have his
Scouter anymore, after all.

115
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:19,050
<i>However, will they indeed be able to escape</i>
<i>the hands of this brutal pursuer?</i>
