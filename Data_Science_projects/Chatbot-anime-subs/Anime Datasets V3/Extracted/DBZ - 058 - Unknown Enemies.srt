1
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:18,043
K- Kuririn, you handed it over
pretty easily, considering, huh?

2
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:22,047
You had to work so hard to
get that Dragon Ball, too.

3
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:27,144
He said that was the last
Dragon Ball, so it's all over now.

4
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:32,057
If I hadn't handed it over,
we definitely would have gotten killed.

5
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:35,060
The fact that the two of us
are even alive like this...

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,994
...is nearly a miracle.

7
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:44,402
Besides, we're probably still
okay handing over that Dragon Ball.

8
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:47,072
I'm sure that the Dragon Ball
that Gohan went looking for...

9
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:49,841
...is the one that Vegeta hid
to keep that Freeza bastard

10
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:54,079
from gathering all seven of them.

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,183
That's right! Gohan-<i>kun</i> must have
found that Dragon Ball already,

12
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,685
and now he's heading back!

13
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,689
That means things aren't going
the way Vegeta had hoped, are they?

14
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,183
Mm-hmm. As long as Vegeta
doesn't find Gohan, they are.

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,719
He is late, is he not?

16
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,311
Y- yes, sir!

17
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,157
It has been four hours.

18
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:43,395
What could Zarbon-<i>san</i> be doing?

19
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:47,432
Seeing as how he has not returned,

20
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:49,067
he has either fled,

21
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,331
or he has been killed.

22
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,506
If I had known this would happen,

23
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:58,076
I should have brought the Ginyu
Special Corps from the start, huh?

24
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,679
Yes, sir! C- concerning that,

25
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,015
according to a message we just
received from Planet Freeza,

26
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:08,687
preparations for the Ginyu Special
Corps' departure are complete.

27
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:12,453
Is that so?
I look forward to it.

28
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,285
Now then...

29
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:21,466
I have no need of cowardly
men, like yourself.

30
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,627
Be gone.

31
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:42,638
Ginyu Special Corps, launch!

32
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:03,834
What exactly is happening
on Planet Namek!?

33
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,291
W- what's this!?

34
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:41,964
There's an enormous power
headed for Planet Namek.

35
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:47,712
Is it Goku?

36
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:51,716
There are five of them. Is this...

37
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,378
...t- the Ginyu Special Corps!?

38
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,723
The Ginyu Special Corps?

39
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:04,161
Mm-hmm. They are the evil overlord
Freeza's special private squad.

40
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:16,107
The Ginyu Special Corps
have always operated

41
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:21,602
in the shadows of Freeza's
rule over the universe.

42
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:29,621
I don't know about " Ginyu," or whatever,

43
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:34,359
but we'll put those guys down
"g-iny-ood" and hard!

44
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,122
That was funny, that was funny!

45
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,963
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, how was that pun-?

46
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,810
Kaio-<i>sama</i>...

47
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,321
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps</i>-
<i>a fearsome squad of evil.</i>

48
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:08,493
<i>Each one of their powers might</i>
<i>be higher than even Goku's.</i>

49
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,927
<i>And there are five of them.</i>

50
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,112
For some reason, it feels like
my body has suddenly become lighter.

51
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,945
All right, one more burst!

52
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,706
Something's coming from straight ahead!

53
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,799
It's a very strong <i>Ki</i>...

54
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,812
Vegeta!

55
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:11,979
All of a sudden, there's a strong
battle power in front of me...

56
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:20,328
<i>l have to mask my Ki...</i>

57
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,493
The presence just disappeared.
Impossible...

58
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,501
I'm sure it was around here.

59
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:43,677
<i>Vegeta! Hurry and get out of here!</i>

60
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,359
Who's there!?
Come on out!

61
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,695
I know you're there!

62
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,864
If you don't show yourself at once,

63
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm going to blow this whole area away!

64
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,861
<i>H</i>- <i>he wouldn't!</i>

65
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:02,640
What's the matter!? Huh!?

66
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,646
<i>All right, I wonder if I had better</i>
<i>jump out and fight Vegeta. But then...</i>

67
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:12,984
<i>Gohan, there's no way we can</i>
<i>match up against Vegeta now.</i>

68
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:17,318
<i>l have to protect this precious</i>
<i>Dragon Ball at this point.</i>

69
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,328
You don't intend to come out, huh?

70
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:38,009
All right... as you wish,
I'll blow you away!

71
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,499
<i>Rats!</i>

72
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,013
W-

73
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,174
Wait!

74
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:50,176
<i>Please, don't let him find this...</i>

75
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,349
I- it's me!

76
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:02,693
Kakarrot's son, huh?

77
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:44,830
Kakarrot's son, huh? I thought
that perhaps it might be you.

78
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,348
There were other Earthlings here.

79
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:53,511
You being here isn't all that surprising.

80
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,088
A Dragon Ball!

81
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:59,522
D- don't tell me that's!

82
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:07,365
This? I got it as a present from
that bald-headed friend of yours.

83
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:13,037
Y- you... killed Kuririn-<i>san</i>...
didn't you!?

84
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,972
If you'd like me to,

85
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:19,710
I wouldn't mind going back now
and killing him for you.

86
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,045
Be grateful.

87
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:26,813
To celebrate me getting all of the
Dragon Balls together, I let him live.

88
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:32,147
A- all of the Dragon Balls?

89
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,663
Hey, what's that you're
holding in your hand?

90
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,405
T- this is a clock!

91
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,173
Heh, a clock?

92
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:52,076
With science that can only make
a clock as huge as that one,

93
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:55,079
I'm impressed that you could
make it to this planet.

94
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,081
N- nobody asked you!

95
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:01,352
By the way, is that
Kakarrot bastard here, too?

96
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,687
No, he's not!

97
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:06,851
We didn't know there would be
bad guys like you here!

98
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:10,957
Is that so?

99
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:20,037
That's too bad, huh?

100
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,707
The three of us...

101
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,141
...are the last of the Saiyans.

102
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:33,480
When you get back to Earth,
tell him something for me.

103
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,068
Tell him I said that I will
come to Earth before long,

104
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:57,007
and this time, I will blow
both you and the Earth away.

105
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:03,681
It's around time for you to be
missing your mother's milk, isn't it?

106
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,844
Hurry back to Earth, now.

107
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,702
That hurt!

108
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,794
But still...

109
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,307
...the Dragon Ball is safe!

110
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,987
Dammit! Isn't he back yet!?

111
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:57,068
Kuririn, I've taken down the house,
and returned it to its Capsule.

112
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,736
Isn't Gohan-<i>kun</i> back yet?

113
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,838
I- I don't see him yet.

114
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:05,002
I sure hope he wasn't
discovered by Vegeta.

115
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:10,014
Vegeta has found out
about this place.

116
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,683
We have to change
locations, fast.

117
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:17,620
What is Gohan doing!?
Hurry! Hurry!

118
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,035
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

119
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,370
He's here!

120
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,374
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, I found this!

121
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,709
You did it! We've been
waiting for this!

122
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,472
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, way to go!

123
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,717
Gohan, I'll fill you in
on the details later,

124
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,319
but we have to hurry
and get away from here,

125
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,321
or things are going
to get dicey.

126
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:54,155
I know most of it already.
Vegeta found me, too.

127
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:58,162
But I managed to hide
the Dragon Ball somehow,

128
00:13:58,162 --> 00:13:59,997
so I got away without
him finding it.

129
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:03,334
Y- you were lucky, too, huh?

130
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:06,670
Kuririn, Gohan-<i>kun</i>,
let's just get moving.

131
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,898
--Right.
--Yeah.

132
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,295
This is the lake.

133
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,697
The Dragon Ball is submerged in here.

134
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,961
Once I pull it out...

135
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,309
<i>...l will have all seven</i>
<i>Dragon Balls together.</i>

136
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,378
<i>Take that, Freeza!</i>

137
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:51,337
<i>As of right now,</i>
<i>the universe belongs to me.</i>

138
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:03,652
<i>That's strange. lt was definitely</i>
<i>submerged in this area.</i>

139
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:14,930
<i>lt's gone!</i>
<i>lmpossible!</i>

140
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:17,769
<i>lt was him!</i>

141
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,012
<i>The place where I ran into that kid...</i>

142
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:26,016
<i>...was exactly halfway between here and</i>
<i>the cave where those Earthlings were!</i>

143
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:29,019
<i>Why, that miserable brat!</i>

144
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,115
<i>But how did he search</i>
<i>for the Dragon Ball?</i>

145
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,361
This is a clock!

146
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:42,032
<i>That was no clock!</i>
<i>lt was radar!</i>

147
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:44,626
<i>Damn it!</i>

148
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,013
You Earthling punks!

149
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:59,312
Play me for a fool, will you!?
You'll pay for this!

150
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:05,315
Damn it all!

151
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:10,589
Damn it all! Damn it all!

152
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:27,945
Where are you, you punk kids!?

153
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,778
Come on out, or you'll be sorry!

154
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:54,796
Dammit, they've disappeared, have they!?

155
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:00,311
Damn it all, I can't sense
their presence, either.

156
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,475
Those brats are able to control their
presence all the way down to zero.

157
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,653
I can't find them like this.

158
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,987
Those rotten Earthlings!
That was an insolent stunt to pull!

159
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:22,666
But they are sure to come after the six
Dragon Balls that I have at some point.

160
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,328
And when they do...

161
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,356
It's okay.

162
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,018
He won't find us here.

163
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
Hold on a minute.

164
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,032
I can't even set up the house
in a place as tight as this, can I?

165
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,867
Please don't ask the impossible.

166
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,638
There aren't too many caves
like that last one, after all.

167
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,974
We just have to put up with it
until Father arrives, Bulma-<i>san</i>.

168
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:07,811
Huh? You mean, until Son-<i>kun</i>
gets here, a lady such as myself

169
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,714
is going to have to stay here, in a place
that doesn't even have a bathroom,

170
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,182
together with you guys?

171
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,987
Oh, you don't have
to worry on that point.

172
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:18,489
I'll be taking Gohan with me,

173
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:22,326
and we'll be going to
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>'s place again.

174
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:25,329
Huh? How come?

175
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:26,330
What is this!?

176
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,999
You mean you're going to be
leaving me here all by myself!?

177
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:33,003
Please bear with us. Once Gohan
meets Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>,

178
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:38,669
there's a chance that he will gain
enough strength to rival even Vegeta.

179
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:56,527
<i>Freeza's secret weapon,</i>
<i>the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>

180
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,189
<i>had at last gone into action.</i>

181
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:11,141
<i>Goku was also headed</i>
<i>for Planet Namek</i>

182
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:15,475
<i>while continuing to train</i>
<i>under 100-times gravity.</i>

183
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,976
<i>Vegeta was seething with anger.</i>

184
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:27,649
<i>And Kuririn and Gohan had taken</i>
<i>off to see the Grand Elder.</i>

185
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:35,658
<i>A grand three-way battle intertwining</i>
<i>good and evil was about to begin.</i>
