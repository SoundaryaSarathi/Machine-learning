1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,266
Trying to get energy from
lovers is unfair!

2
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:11,002
What about the poor girls who
don't have boyfriends?!

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,682
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen

6
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,621
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

7
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:14,753
Datte junjou dou shiyou

8
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

9

Nando mo meguriau

00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:36,115
Seiza no matataki kazoe

00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta

12
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:49,152
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,969
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

14
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,307
I'm clumsier than others

15
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,275
and a bit of a crybaby.
That's about it.

16
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,413
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

17
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,415
and gave me a peculiar
transforming brooch

18
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,280
and made me a sailor warrior.

19
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:14,315
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

20
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,781
That makes me really nervous.

21
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:20,357
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

22
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:31,961
I Want a Boyfriend, Too!
A Trap on a Luxury Cruise Ship

23
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:36,469
Moon Tiara Action!

24
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,276
Darn that detestable girl!

25
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,886
I had no idea the great
Master Jadeite

26
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:50,286
was having such a hard time
with a little girl.

27
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,048
Tetis...

28
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,595
I'm so glad that you remember me,
Master Jadeite.

29
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:01,367
You serve directly under Queen Beryl.

30
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,130
What brings you here?

31
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,197
You have not changed a bit.

32
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,935
I adore you, but you always give me
the cold shoulder.

33
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:15,312
I don't have time for your games.
Get out of here!

34
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,616
Now, don't be so cross.

35
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:24,456
I, Tetis, have developed a very
efficient way to collect energy.

36
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,048
What did you say?!

37
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,987
Do I finally have your attention now?

38
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:36,266
I call it Operation Romantic Cruise!

39
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,070
In the middle of the night
on the ocean...

40
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:47,839
It is a world for just the two of you.

41
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:51,908
On a night like this, you'll feel like
you could talk about anything.

42
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,353
Romantic Cruise for lovers.

43
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:59,518
Finally, leaving on its maiden
voyage tomorrow!

44
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,060
It must be so nice.

45
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,023
Tokyo - Yokohama
Departure 18:00 ~ 22:00
Romantic Cruise
Passenger Capacity 666
Total Weight: 28,717 ton

46
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,633
Wouldn't you love to sail on a ship
like this just once in your life?

47
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,740
But they say it's booked for a
month in advance already.

48
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,677
Oh, that Romantic Cruise?
It's nice, isn't it?

49
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,782
A luxurious passenger ship with a
maximum passenger capacity of 666.

50
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:28,086
If you spend a night gazing at the
scenery from Tokyo to Yokohama

51
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:31,214
on a ship like this, any couple would
fall in love. Don't you think so?

52
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,992
If I were with you, that would
never happen. I'm sure of it.

53
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,922
Miss Usagi, did you want to
get on this ship?

54
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:43,263
Oh, I wish I knew...

55
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,370
Umino, are you saying...

56
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,031
You had tickets?!

57
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:51,675
Yes, but I gave the invitational tickets
to the lady next door.

58
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,739
Why did you just give them away?!

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,711
Well, we are still in junior
high school after all.

60
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:02,554
Tokyo <=> Yokohama
Sailing 18:00 ~ 22:00
We can't do anything delinquent
like going out so late at night.

61
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:02,918
We can't do anything delinquent
like going out so late at night.

62
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:07,653
He's got a weird sense of ethics.

63
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,897
Come to think of it, I think the raffle
going on in the shopping district

64
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,127
is giving these tickets away as prizes...

Hey, listen, listen!

76
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:40,891
I tried ten whole times
to win this prize!

77
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,560
"Invitation for two."
You actually want this stuff?

78
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,660
You're not interested, Rei?

79
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,267
Of course not!

80
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:52,294
We don't have time to waste
on this kind of stuff!

81
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,074
I'd like a turn, please.

82
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,342
Go right ahead!

83
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:58,400
What?!

84
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:09,646
She's so serious!

Congratulations!

88
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:30,764
You won the first prize!
Tickets for the Romantic Cruise!

89
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,770
Wow, I did it!

90
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:38,411
Rei, you are such a hypocrite!

91
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:47,124
Hey, Rei, you said you
weren't interested!

92
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,224
It doesn't mean I have to
give the tickets to you.

93
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:54,700
Then, why don't we go together?

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,602
I bet it'll be nice and romantic.

95
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:58,729
This is a cruise you're supposed
to go on with your boyfriend!

96
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,039
I know you don't have any!

97
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,307
Shut up!

98
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,605
See? I'm right!
You don't have anybody!

99
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:07,641
I'm not you, you know.
I have one or two...

100
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:10,746
Stop it, both of you!

101
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,380
What's going on?

102
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,883
Their usual comedy routine.

103
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:19,224
Ami, Rei's being really mean to me!

104
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,827
Ami, I'm glad you're here!
Do you have a minute?

105
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,055
What is it?

106
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,091
Never mind, just hurry over here!

107
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:33,071
I know it! I just know she doesn't
have any boyfriends!

108
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:35,374
I'm not finished talking to you! Hey!

109
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,103
You're finished, you're finished.

110
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:41,836
What? You and me?

111
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,376
Here they are!

112
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,685
What about Usagi? It seemed like
she really wanted to go.

113
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:52,357
No way! This romantic cruise
is not for someone like her.

114
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:53,825
But...

115
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,784
Observing different things will broaden
your horizons. So, let's go!

116
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:02,022
I'm looking for a wonderful boyfriend
like Tuxedo Mask.

117
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:05,364
I thought so.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

118
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,900
So, Ami, let's go together!
Please, please, please!

119
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,403
Okay.

120
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,109
They're planning on leaving me
out of all the fun!

121
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,747
I am never giving up!

122
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:23,053
Oh, I wish she would be this
proactive in other areas.

123
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,471
Okay, it's time to sneak in!

124
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,639
How are we going to sneak in?

125
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,416
Don't be silly! This is exactly what

126
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,815
I've got this for!

127
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:55,287
Don't do it, Usagi!

128
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,090
You're only supposed to
use that for justice!

129
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,955
Oh, don't be so uptight!

130
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:06,487
Moon Power! Turn me into a
beautiful camera woman!

131
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,213
Okay, Luna, in you go.

132
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,647
No! No! I don't want to go!
Okay, Luna, in you go.

133
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,909
No! No! I don't want to go!

134
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,957
Come on!

135
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:50,035
Captain Jadeite, our young prey
just keep coming.

136
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:51,943
You're amazing, Tetis!

137
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,780
Nobody will suspect this is
actually a wrecked ship

138
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,975
that is built out of your
evil seawater powers.

139
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,708
With my evil powers,
this is easy to do.

140
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,423
Well, I wish you all find love,

141
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,118
you fools!

142
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,991
We are ready to leave port now.

143
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,064
All right, cast off.

144
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,292
Aye, Sir!

145
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:37,048
This ship is so shaky! How come
everyone looks so happy?

146
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:42,550
Hey, it seems like we're the only
girls who came together.

147
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,663
I know!

148
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:47,427
Sure, they said it was
a ship for lovers,

149
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,394
but I never expected that everyone
here would be a couple.

150
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:53,263
Looks like we won't be finding
any boyfriends.

151
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:06,384
Where are we?

152
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,752
I think it's the engine room.

153
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:11,745
No way! Engine rooms
aren't this quiet.

154
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,893
Then maybe it's stopped.

155
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:18,296
Something is wrong.
It's moving at full speed.

156
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:19,865
You worry so much.

157
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,601
They probably have some new
state-of-the-art engine.

158
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,469
Never mind that.

159
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:26,767
I wonder where Rei and Ami are?

160
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:29,965
What are you doing there?!

161
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,193
Are you a reporter?

162
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,700
You are not allowed in these areas.

163
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,508
Oh, he's so handsome!

164
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:05,841
What is this incredibly evil aura?!

165
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,114
It's not safe here.

166
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:12,312
Oh, I just got separated from
the rest of my staff.

167
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,585
I see, that is a problem.

168
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:19,422
Would you help me find them?

169
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:21,726
Certainly...

170
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,363
Something about her bothers me.

171
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:27,890
I'm so lucky! I've already found
a gorgeous guy!

172
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,236
Oh, I just came up with a great idea!

173
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,838
What is it?

174
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,812
Since there are so many
couples on this ship,

175
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:43,009
there should be some that'll break up!

176
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:44,283
So?

177
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,686
That's where we'll come in

178
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,554
and catch those single guys!

179
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:49,851
What do you think?

180
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,525
I should have stayed at home
and studied instead.

181
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:53,457
Engine Room
Do Not Enter

182
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:58,593
I would love to announce it
over the ship's intercom,

183
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:03,500
but I do not want to break the
passengers' romantic mood.

184
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,768
I totally understand.

185
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,101
But this is already good
enough for me.

186
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:12,069
What is this? I have a
strange premonition.

187
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:15,904
Why do I feel so wary of
this slip of a girl?

188
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:20,047
Oh, why is he looking at me
so intensely?

189
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:22,946
Captain.

190
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:25,553
It is almost time.

191
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:29,428
All right. Please excuse me,
I must go now.

192
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,861
Okay.

193
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,066
Man! It was just getting good!

194
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,804
Usagi, we need to investigate!

195
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:41,273
This ship is full of monster aura!

196
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,331
What?!

197
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:44,139
Captain's Cabin

198
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,476
At last.

199
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:55,447
Yes, the energy generated by love
has almost reached its peak.

200
00:13:56,622 --> 00:14:01,059
When it does, I shall collect
the energy from all 600
passengers at once.

201
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,893
So, what do you think of my plan?

202
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:08,831
I will congratulate you when you
have succeeded.

203
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:13,429
I am 99% sure this will be a success.

204
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:18,065
Once I succeed, I hope you will
notice me a little more.

205
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,975
I will think about it.

206
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,874
What are they talking about?

207
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:25,551
They have got to be monsters!

208
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,178
But he's so handsome.

209
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,712
I can't believe you, Usagi!

210
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:31,114
Oh!

211
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,649
They're gone!

212
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:37,191
They're probably really going
to do something now!

213
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,727
Shouldn't you eat a little more quietly?

214
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,070
Nonsense! If I can't find a boyfriend,
I'm going to eat all I want!

215
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,244
I'm going to eat everything in sight!

216
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:57,541
Ladies and gentlemen, please
gather in the reception hall.

217
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:01,452
We will be putting on a
special show for you.

218
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,324
Maybe we should go!

219
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,384
Sure! It'll probably be better
than staying here.

220
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,796
It said the reception hall!

221
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,565
Those monsters must be there also.

222
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,691
Yeah.

223
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,181
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!

224
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:29,482
Reception Hall
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!

225
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,814
Reception Hall

226
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:38,219
We will now show you the most
romantic show you have ever seen!

227
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,534
Wow, this is something!

228
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:49,034
This is a pretty elaborate show!
Wow, this is something!

229
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,262
This is a pretty elaborate show!

230
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,238
Rei...

231
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,899
That's definitely a monster.

232
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:58,539
I don't know where the
reception hall is!

233
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:04,745
You shall keep dreaming even
after you go to Hell!

234
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:20,863
Jadeite...

235
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,591
You two!

236
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:25,302
A terrible miscalculation, Tetis.

237
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,036
You only stole the energy of love.

238
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:32,340
Your trick does not work on these
girls who are not in love.

239
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:36,314
You two, why didn't you
come here with boys?

240
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:40,546
Shut up! It's none of your business!

241
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,787
Pesky girls. Get rid of them!

242
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:51,957
How about that?!

243
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,663
It'll be endless at this rate.

244
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:00,398
We can't transform now because
they'll find out who we are.

245
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,437
We're in trouble.

246
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,568
They are only delaying the inevitable.

247
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,106
Master Jadeite,

248
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,905
I miscalculated slightly,

249
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:13,310
but I have collected a large
amount of energy.

250
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:16,647
I believe Queen Beryl will be pleased.

251
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,485
That's true.

252
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:21,227
There it is, Usagi!

253
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:21,727
There it is, Usagi!

254
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:22,695
I know!

255
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,093
I know!

256
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:26,759
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

257
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,966
Stop right there!

258
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,732
Sailor Moon!

259
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,511
I'm the sailor warrior of
love and justice!

260
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:21,483
Sailor Moon!

261
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:23,821
Impertinent girl!

262
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,494
How dare you only steal
energy from lovers?!

263
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:32,331
What about those poor girls who
don't have boyfriends?!

264
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:32,665
What?!
What about those poor girls who
don't have boyfriends?!

265
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:33,332
What?!

266
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:35,960
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

267
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,704
Finally, you show yourself,
Sailor Moon!

268
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,001
I am your opponent!

269
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,048
You're kidding me!

270
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,582
Be careful, Sailor Moon!

271
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,517
That monster can control seawater!

272
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,347
Take this!

273
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,393
Good, Tetis!

274
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:03,054
Fire Soul!

275
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,302
Let's hurry, Sailor Mars!

276
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:14,295
Yeah! I have to pay her back a
hundredfold for humiliating us!

277
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:19,239
Die!

278
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:21,803
Bubble

279
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:27,949
Spray!

280
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:32,583
Shoot!

281
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,653
Fire

282
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:40,257
Soul!

283
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:43,802
Now, Sailor Moon!

284
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:44,996
Okay!

285
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:02,417
Moon Tiara Action!

286
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,083
I underestimated you because
you were just girls,

287
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,052
but you seem to have become
more powerful than before.

288
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,355
Jadeite, prepare yourself!

289
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:38,050
I am so mad!

290
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:40,214
Both of you, don't let
your guard down!

291
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,426
You cannot beat me!
This will be the end of you!

292
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:48,233
Huh? Where did he go?

293
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,168
Did he run away?

294
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:49,835
No way!
Did he run away?

295
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:50,426
No way!

296
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,863
Queen Beryl...

297
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,646
You used my precious subordinate,

298
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,948
the monster Tetis,
without my permission

299
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,616
and allowed her to die.

300
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:06,351
No, it's a misunderstanding!

301
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:08,945
This was all Tetis's idea to begin with.

302
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:11,757
I will listen to your excuses
at the palace.

303
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:15,284
But depending on the situation,
I will see to it that you pay for this.

304
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:18,422
Yes, my lady.

305
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:21,695
Damn you, Sailor Moon,
just you remember this!

306
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,943
The romantic cruise is all ruined!

307
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:45,384
I'm not giving up!

308
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:49,528
If I ever have another chance, I'm
definitely coming with a boyfriend!

309
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,797
Oh, me, too!

310
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:53,198
That would be impossible for you!

311
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:53,932
Urg
That would be impossible for you!

312
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,456
What did you say?!

313
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:58,195
Geez, those two never quit, do they?

314
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:00,566
I'm going to study.

315
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:01,931
Oh, dear.

316
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:13,041
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne
