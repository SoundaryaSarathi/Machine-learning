00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,865
[all gasp]

15
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,117
What’s going on down there?

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,619
[people chattering]

17
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,084
I wonder what everybody’s doing
with those picks and shovels.

18
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,003
-[Gary] Don’t you know anything?
-Huh?

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,218
Ash, not only late as usual,
but clueless too.

20
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:38,015
Hey, it’s Gary.
Uh, why are you dressed like that?

21
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,727
Huh. Don’t tell me you never heard
about the Pokémon discovery.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,314
Even a nerd like you should have heard
about the great fossil rush.

23
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,024
[all] The great fossil rush?

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,028
[all] Gary, Gary he’s our man!
If he can’t find them, no one can!

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,323
Thank you. Thank you to all my loyal fans.

26
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,410
I got to go. I got to find all the fossils
quick before anyone else does.

27
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,080
Can’t waste my precious time
hanging around with a loser like you.

28
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,081
-Loser?
-Easy.

29
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,959
-Ash?
-That know-it-all. Ah!

30
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,921
I’m going to find a Pokémon fossil
before Gary even starts digging.

31
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,840
That’ll show him who the real loser is.

32
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,260
I don’t feel right about digging up
old Pokémon fossils,

33
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,181
especially after they’ve been resting
in the earth for such a long time.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,767
If they’ve been lying underground
for thousands of years,

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,810
maybe they’d like a little fresh air, heh.

36
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,438
I think it’s your brain
that needs fresh air.

37
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,732
-Who asked you?
-Jigglypuff.

38
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,192

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237

Puff, puff.

45
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,518
Success. My first Pokémon fossil.

46
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,398
[all] Yay. Gary, Gary, he’s the best.
Found a fossil before the rest.

47
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,649
Go, Gary.

48
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,610
Hmm.

49
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,114
Impressive, isn’t it?
Found it on my first try.

50
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,158
Looks like a brain
from an extinct Pokémon.

51
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,576
-[man] This is--
-A brain?

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,414
-It’s fossilized Pokémon manure.
-Huh?

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,376

[Ash] Wow. Look at all the people digging.

00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,505
Pika.

57
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,299
[Misty] We'd better hurry
before all the fossils are dug up.

58
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,636
All these people digging
but nobody’s found any fossils yet.

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,265
I wonder if this great fossil rush
is really for real.

60
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,725
Sure it is.

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,811
-[Meowth] What’s taking those two so long?
-[all] Huh?

62
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,858
Humans. The only thing you can depend on
is that they’re always undependable.

63
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,359
[both] Ta-da.

64
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,822
-Prepare for trouble.
-Yes, and make it double.

65
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,824
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,493
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

67
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,746
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

68
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,540
To extend our reach to the stars above.

69
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,792
-Jessie.
-James.

70
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,795
Team Rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

71
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,672
Surrender now or prepare to...

72
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,965
-Oh!
-[all grunting]

73
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,926
Cut the poetry. I bet you two clowns
didn’t even plant the dynamite

74
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,929
-like you were supposed to.
-Wrong again, fur ball.

[groaning]

76
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,977
Of course we planted the dynamite.

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,605
Once we blast Grandpa Canyon
to smithereens,

78
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,274
we’ll be able to scoop up
all those Poké fossils.

79
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,778
[yells]
Next time, I’ll make fossils out of you.

80
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,739
Did you hear that? They’re going
to blow up this whole canyon.

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,034
All the people who are digging here
are going to get caught in the blast.

82
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,496
Pikachu and I will stop them.
You two, spread the word to run for it.

83
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,748
-There’s no time to lose.
-Let’s go.

84
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,166
[laughs]

85
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,461
Pretty soon, we’ll have
all the Pokémon fossils to ourselves.

86
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,712
[pants]

87
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,548
-Hold it right there.
-Oh, it’s that pest again.

88
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,260
-Always messing up our plans.
-But this time, you’re too late.

89
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,012
The fuse is already lit.

90
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,476
Whoa. I got to stop 'em!
Squirtle, I choose you.

91
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:12,979
Squirtle, squirt.

92
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,066
There’s no time to lose.
Squirtle, squirt out that fuse.

93
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,776
Squirtle!

94
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,194
Squirtle!

95
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,156
Squirtle, after it.

-[all grunting]
-Pika!

97
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,706
-Arbok, go.
-Go, Weezing. Keep that fuse lit.

98
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,168
Weezing!

99
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,219
-You can do it, Squirtle.
-Ah, stop that twerp.

100
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,305
Keep squirting.

101
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,975
-[James] Quickly.
-[Meowth] Don’t let it hit the fuse.

102
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,602
-[James] Come on. They’re getting away.
-[Jessie] Hurry, you slowpokes.

103
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,106
-[Ash] We got to put it out somehow.
-[Meowth] You’re running like slugs.

104
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,776
-Faster, Arbok. There’s not much time.
-Hurry up, Weezing.

105
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,320
Weezing, sludge attack now.

-Pikachu.

-Squirtle. Squirtle.
-What a disaster.

122
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,902
-[sighs] We’ve got to get them out.
-Hmm, let’s go.

123
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,862

131
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,106
Where are we?

132
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,441
Looks like we got blown
all the way to the moon.

133
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,360
Or down to the center of the earth.

134
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,319
[all gasp]

135
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,991
This is a cave. The dynamite must have
blown a hole in the roof and we fell in.

136
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,785
We must be buried deep
under the earth’s crust.

137
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
[both] Buried?

138
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,330
This is all your fault, you twerp.

139
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,042
If you hadn’t tried to put out that fuse,
we never would have fallen down here.

140
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,754
Hey, you’re the crooks who planted all
that dynamite up there in the first place.

141
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,755
Pikachu.

142
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,383
What difference does it make
who got us down here?

143
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,594
All that matters is getting out of here
in one piece. Look up there.

144
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,887
[all gasp]

145
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,181
[all yell]

146
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,350
[Ash]
The roof of the cave is blocked.

147
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,602
Hmm, heh.

148
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,397
James, it sounds like
you have an answer to our problem.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,483
-Hmm? We’re all doomed.
-Huh?

150
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,485
-That’s not the answer I wanted to hear.
-Ugh.

151
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,156
-There must be some way out.
-Chu.

152
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,491
-Pi?
-What’s up, Pikachu?

153
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,201
-Pika, pika.
-Huh?

154
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,332
-[both scream]
-I don’t think we’re in here alone.

155
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,464
What are they?

156
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,731
[all quivering]

157
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,982
Let’s see.

158
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:31,237
[Pokédex] <i>Omanyte and Omastar.</i>
<i>Kabuto and Kabutops.</i>

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>It is believed that these Pokémon became</i>
<i>extinct tens of thousands of years ago.</i>

160
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,912
<i>The details of their behavior</i>
<i>is shrouded in mystery.</i>

161
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,706
<i>Though some have speculated</i>
<i>that they may still exist,</i>

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,751
<i>none of these Pokémon</i>
<i>have ever been seen alive.</i>

163
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,961
We’re going to be rich.

164
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,965
We’ll open a prehistoric Pokémon park
that’ll be bigger than Pokéworld.

165
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,093
Even the boss will be impressed with us.

166
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,805
Ah, I could get my own talk show
or even my own cartoon.

167
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,725
Those Pokémon don’t seem as happy
about this as you guys do.

168
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,768
Chu.

169
