1
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:15,108
Oh, we're finally back!

2
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,535
Hey! Don't touch me in weird places!

3
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,614
Don't worry about it.
It's flat, anyway.

4
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:24,152
In any case, it's really quiet.

5
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:27,689
We're in the summer
holiday right now!

6
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,216
Lots of people went home for
the holidays, or traveled abroad.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,058
I see, summer vacation.

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,534
Oh, Louise.

9
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:43,163
I haven't seen you around, so I
thought you'd already gone home.

10
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,264
I was just running errands for a bit.

11
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:48,543
You guys are going home?

12
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:50,445
Oh! Darling!

13
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,247
I finally got the chance
to see you again,

14
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:54,116
only to be torn apart
yet again for a while!

15
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,277
Please forgive me for all of this!

16
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:02,257
I'm going to go visit
Tabitha's home now.

17
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:03,451
Tabitha's?

18
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:07,459
See you, darling!
Have a wonderful vacation!

19
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,293
A wonderful vacation...

20
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,566
What wonderful vacation?!

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,216
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

22
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:36,555
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

23
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:47,232
The sky where two moons
never fade away

24
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:53,165
That's an impossibility, right?

25
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:59,915
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

26
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:05,687
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

27
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:12,183
Even if you trip and
become depressed

28
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:19,597
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

29
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:26,508
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

30
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:32,814
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

31
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:38,753
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

32
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:47,286
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,602
Tabitha's Secret

34
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,476
How to put it...

35
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,171
Serene?

36
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,449
Hey, Tabitha.

37
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,384
We're taking the effort
to go see your folks,

38
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:11,682
so why can't you look
a bit happier about it?

39
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,223
I didn't know you were
studying abroad like me.

40
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,435
Why did you decide to study
in another country?

41
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:35,240
In my case, it was something more
like doing away with their troubles.

42
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,813
I caused all sorts of trouble,

43
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:41,407
and I was forced to quit
my previous school.

44
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,785
They started saying
that their daughter

45
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:45,820
loitering around wasn't good
for their image,

46
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,690
so they tried to force me
into a marriage.

47
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,559
To an old man, no less. An old man!

48
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,550
I mean, you have got to be kidding!

49
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:57,487
Hm? What is it?

50
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,470
Lake Lagdorian up ahead
is overflowing.

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,707
Use the detour up on
the high road, please.

52
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,833
See you.

53
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,279
Was there heavy rain or something?

54
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:14,248
And we're so close to Galia, too.

55
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,953
When you're done with the laundry,
clean my room!

56
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:20,319
If you aren't quick about it,
you're not getting fed!

57
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:24,552
Yeah, yeah...

58
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,658
He's always wooing anyone and
everyone, with no standards!

59
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:40,008
Why should I be getting
upset about such a thing?

60
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:43,409
Oh, geez, it irritates me!

61
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:49,084
Louise yelling, unreasonable
amounts of labor...

62
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,553
Oh, but for some reason, all
of this really puts me at ease.

63
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:54,784
What are you saying?
It's all a misunderstanding.

64
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,655
I've heard that line too many times!

65
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,362
Do you understand, Guiche?

66
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:03,865
I don't really feel
anything at all for you.

67
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:07,028
I'm only taking the time to see you
because you were begging so much.

68
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,437
Montmorency...

69
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:11,905
In any case, calm down
and hear what I have to say.

70
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:17,610
Just you watch... if that's the case...

71
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:22,450
Didn't Louise go home
for the holidays?

72
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,351
She's here.

73
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,153
Please, wait!

74
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:26,620
Don't follow me!

75
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,489
Wait!

76
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,359
Montmorency!

77
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,429
Listen to what I have
to say, Montmorency!

78
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:36,531
Wait for me, Montmorency!

79
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,398
They don't change at all, either.

80
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:46,439
I got it!

81
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,744
I had put it here with plans
of throwing it out.

82
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:51,379
Then can I have it?

83
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,850
Yeah, take it without hesitation,
Our Sword!

84
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,954
Can't you do something
about that nickname

85
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,354
and these spectacular gestures?

86
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,995
Heave! Heave! And...

87
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:08,730
I guess this should be a good place.

88
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,565
If you had a noble help you,

89
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:13,363
you could have brought it here
in no time with magic.

90
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,837
It's all right. This is
something personal.

91
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,104
What are you going to do
with such a giant pot?

92
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,872
Just wait till night.

93
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:34,022
He's right, we couldn't have
gotten across down there.

94
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:35,990
There are houses sunken
underwater, too.

95
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,455
How much further is
your house, Tabitha?

96
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:41,154
Almost there.

97
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:46,966
That was...

98
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,934
Just as I thought!

99
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,542
That emblem... It's the one
for the Galia royal family.

100
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,648
Tabitha, are you actually

101
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,445
from the royal family of Galia?

102
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,787
Just as I thought!

103
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:25,573
Welcome back. We have
been waiting for you,

104
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,200
Lady Charlotte.

105
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,976
First, I'd like to say
hello to your father.

106
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,550
Wait here.

107
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,222
Sure.

108
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,696
Excuse me.

109
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:03,642
My name is Peruculan, and I am
the butler for the Orleans family.

110
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:08,149
I am a member of the von Zerbst
family from Germania.

111
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,616
I hope to be under your good care.

112
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,554
I had not imagined
that Mistress Charlotte

113
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:15,284
would bring a friend back with her.

114
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,484
So Charlotte is that girl's real name?

115
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:37,610
Who is it?

116
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:50,758
I have just returned, Mother.

117
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:53,158
Stand back! How impolite!

118
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:57,028
Our mistress calls herself Tabitha?

119
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,069
Why did she come studying abroad,
using a fake name?

120
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,572
She never says anything
about herself.

121
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:08,743
Studying in another country was
ordered by her uncle, the King.

122
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:13,203
Uncle? Just as I thought, she's
a member of the royal family.

123
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:18,786
Lady Charlotte's father,
the late Count Orleans,

124
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:22,023
was the younger brother
of the current king.

125
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:26,687
I see. So her father has
already passed away.

126
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:28,892
He was murdered.

127
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:34,168
If the mistress trusts her heart
with you, I am sure it is all right.

128
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:37,626
I will trust you, Lady Zerbst,
in telling you this.

129
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,742
You're someone from the
royal family, aren't you?!

130
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:44,610
Are you going to kill my Charlotte,
just like you did my husband?!

131
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:48,283
Count Orleans, despite being the
second son of the royal family,

132
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:51,786
was more adept as a mage than
his older brother Lord Joseph.

133
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:55,690
Furthermore, he was quite full
of charisma and talent.

134
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,693
Five years ago, when the
previous king passed away,

135
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,429
the palace was split in two over

136
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,762
which son was more worthy
of taking the throne.

137
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,393
A battle for the heir, huh?

138
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,329
In the midst of that filthy battle,

139
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,875
Count Orleans was
murdered by conspiracy.

140
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:19,647
Those that put Lord Joseph
to the throne,

141
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,449
to rid themselves of
hassles in the future,

142
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,714
next went after the daughter...

143
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:37,993
One evening, our Lady and our
Mistress were invited to a banquet.

144
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:59,452
It was laced with water-magic
poison that induces insanity.

145
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,823
That became public knowledge,

146
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,053
and the noble responsible
for the act was convicted.

147
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:09,229
The Lady sacrificed herself
to save our mistress.

148
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,767
Ever since... our Lady...

149
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,901
How horrible...

150
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,768
To think that this girl might
someday go after the throne...

151
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:20,775
We just want to live in peace.

152
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,243
Get back!

153
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:23,745
Nobody...

154
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,713
Nobody can take her away from me!

155
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:30,777
This girl... Charlotte
is my dear daughter.

156
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:33,812
I will come see you again.

157
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,754
Mother...

158
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,160
Tabitha is the name of
the doll that the Lady

159
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,254
once gave our mistress as a present.

160
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:46,834
From that day, the active
and bright Lady Charlotte

161
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,504
behaved as if she was someone else.

162
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:54,703
As if she had sealed words and
expressions all within herself.

163
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:57,145
Since the incident with the Lady,

164
00:11:57,145 --> 00:12:02,016
nobody has dared try to take
the life of the mistress.

165
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:07,522
In return, the Palace used the
mistress' high magical powers

166
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:10,558
as reason to force her
into difficult tasks,

167
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:13,425
of which many said the chances
for survival were slim.

168
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:33,381
However, our mistress
was able to complete

169
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,817
each and every unjust mission.

170
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,911
In order to protect herself
and the Lady,

171
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,412
putting her own life at risk.

172
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,760
And the reason why she
started studying in Tristein?

173
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:49,931
The Palace, seeing that things
weren't going according to plan,

174
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,934
gave her only the title of Chevalier,
though her merits

175
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:56,804
proved her worthy of being given
ample property to govern,

176
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:59,898
and sent her to a foreign country,
as if to do away with trouble.

177
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,467
Doing away with troubles?

178
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,280
Geez, you're late, Tabitha.

179
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,117
I want to rid myself of the sweat
from this long journey.

180
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,898
It's done.

181
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:34,132
I've come back to life!

182
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:40,077
Man, in the end, Japanese people
need a good bathtub.

183
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,075
Japanese people?

184
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,820
Oh? What is that?

185
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,870
Siesta?

186
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,462
Mr. Saito?

187
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,533
Um, uh, this is...

188
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,840
Oh, I did it again...

189
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,971
I'm going to get scolded.

190
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,946
Oh, my, my clothes are soaked...

191
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:18,052
Are you all right?

192
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:19,387
Yes.

193
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,356
What are you doing in there?

194
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:26,027
Oh, this? This is how you
take baths in my country,

195
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:28,518
though this is a very
old-fashioned way of doing so.

196
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,963
Is it a bath?

197
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:36,404
I found it being thrown out,
so I made it myself.

198
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,539
I see. How wonderful!

199
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,374
I'd like to try it!

200
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,342
Then, care to join me?

201
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,904
Just kidding.

202
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:45,643
Is it all right?

203
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,611
Wait, this won't be good, Siesta!

204
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:58,025
Nobody will be here, and
it's dark, so it's all right.

205
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:02,029
Um, Miss Siesta, you know,
I am a guy...

206
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,133
I know that you wouldn't do
anything strange, Mr. Saito.

207
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:09,899
It's kinda complicated to
be told that so easily...

208
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:18,238
Hi. Been waiting?

209
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:23,150
I'm sorry I called you out here.

210
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,710
But the moon was just so beautiful.

211
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,093
I can dry my clothes out too,
so it was just perfect.

212
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,922
Really?

213
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:40,334
Please don't be so shy.

214
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:42,598
You're making me embarrassed too.

215
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:46,407
Well... You can look over here...

216
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:48,341
It's dark so you can't really see.

217
00:15:57,018 --> 00:16:00,317
Your country's baths
feel nice, Mr. Saito.

218
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,691
You know how the baths here
are all steam, right?

219
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:06,023
I just have to have it like this.

220
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:11,065
What kind of place is
your country, Mr. Saito?

221
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:12,099
My country?

222
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,769
Yes, please let me hear about it.

223
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,603
Let's see... There's only one moon,
and there are no mages,

224
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:23,377
but you can do most things
with electricity.

225
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:24,578
And...

226
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:25,704
Mr. Saito!

227
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:29,817
One moon and no mages?

228
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:33,218
You're making fun of me because
I'm from a rural village, aren't you?!

229
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,251
I'm not making fun of you!

230
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,293
Before you,

231
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:43,197
even those two moons would
run away from embarrassment.

232
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,466
Montmorency the Perfume...

233
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,993
I'm sure you say the same thing
to all the girls.

234
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:54,264
Wait, let's have a toast first.

235
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:56,632
Let's.

236
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:58,703
Hm?

237
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,182
What?

238
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:03,116
Isn't that Louise?

239
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,220
What is she doing this late at night?

240
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,312
Who knows?

241
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,627
Sheesh! How late does that dog
intend on strolling around for?

242
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,077
It's like a story that my
great-grandfather once told.

243
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:31,645
Your great-grandfather?

244
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:35,116
He passed away before I was born.

245
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:39,387
But I hear he always said that he
was from a different world far away,

246
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:41,480
and that he fell from the sky.

247
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,519
A different world? From the sky?

248
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,454
Siesta, that's...

249
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,232
I have to get back soon.

250
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,859
That's right...

251
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:56,130
Thank you very much.

252
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:02,604
It was very fun, and
the bath was lovely.

253
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,212
That's great.

254
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:10,243
Um, but...

255
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,221
What was most lovely about it

256
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:15,586
might be you.

257
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,552
Good night!

258
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,562
Am I a bit flushed?

259
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,505
What is that?

260
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,508
A secret tryst, all naked?!

261
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,710
He's a familiar, only a familiar!

262
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,905
There are limits as to
how lewd one can be!

263
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:44,185
In the first place, why do I
have to sneak about like this?!

264
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:46,847
Oh, geez! It irritates me!

265
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:50,123
My Montmorency...

266
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,256
Don't be impatient. The toast is first.

267
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:58,225
In front of you, I even forget
how to be a gentleman.

268
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,502
A naked woman is flying in the skies!

269
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,163
Where? Where, where?

270
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,905
Where? Where, where, where?
Where is she?

271
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,204
Hey, where, where?

272
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:10,878
If it isn't Louise.

273
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:12,980
What have you been doing?

274
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,847
Leave me alone. And I'll take this!

275
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:20,483
She drank it!

276
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,379
Thanks!

277
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,189
Oh, no...

278
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:29,493
I'm back!

279
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,534
You were out rather late.

280
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:36,804
I took a proper bath for
the first time in a while,

281
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:38,606
so I took a good long soak.

282
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:40,508
Oh, it felt nice.

283
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:43,677
I'll just bet that it felt nice.

284
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,279
What do you mean?

285
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,180
You think you can fool your master?

286
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,918
What are you talking...

287
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:54,217
Hey, what's wrong?
Your face is all red!

288
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:56,817
My face doesn't matter!

289
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,522
Hey, Louise, are you all right?

290
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,270
Saito... Saito...

291
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,004
What?

292
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,232
Saito!

293
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:18,045
Idiot, idiot, idiot!
Saito, you're an idiot!

294
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:22,716
Why did you leave me alone
to be with a girl like that?!

295
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,877
Saito, you idiot! Idiot!

296
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:27,321
What kind of a joke is this?

297
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:29,423
A joke? You're so cruel.

298
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:32,017
I love you so much!

299
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:37,731
Coming!

300
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:42,536
Oh no, just as I thought...

301
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,730
Just as you thought?

302
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,879
It is an order from the King.

303
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,047
Order?

304
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,342
How soon will you start it?

305
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,824
Tomorrow evening.

306
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,793
I wish you the best of luck.

307
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:13,367
Then, you came home for this?

308
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:14,629
Wait here.

309
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,406
I'm sorry. I heard everything
from that guy.

310
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,475
So I'm going to go with you.

311
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:22,376
Danger...

312
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,310
That's why I'm coming with you.

313
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:31,842
I accepted the challenge lightly,
but this is one big affair.

314
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,622
Mother...

315
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:38,422
No, don't drink that, Mother!

316
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:46,400
My fever will warm it up
and melt it away.

317
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,563
So rest assured, and sleep tight,

318
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,103
Charlotte.

319
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:11,792
As if I were under a real magic spell

320
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:22,826
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

321
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:34,548
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

322
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:45,618
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

323
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:57,599
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

324
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:08,471
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

325
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:14,711
For the day to start from zero

326
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,801
I... You know, I...

327
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:31,138
I love you so, so, so much, Saito!

328
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:34,241
But why are you making that face?

329
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:37,945
Sheesh! Idiot, idiot, idiot!
Saito, you're an idiot!
