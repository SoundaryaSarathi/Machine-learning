00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:33,185
Big Brother...

2
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:41,967
Mm-hmm, this one's dead.

3
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:42,968
Really?

4
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:45,637
You can tell if he's dead
or not by doing that?

5
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:50,939
Of course you can! You're five already,
and you don't even know that?

6
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:55,313
I did so know!

7
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:58,180
It doesn't look like he's carrying
anything worth any money.

8
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,476
Big Brother, over there!

9
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,952
All right, we will reap something!

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,685
Awesome!

11
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,063
That's mine...

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,501
Did he die again?

13
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:27,345
He doesn't look injured, huh?

14
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:28,744
You're right.

15
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,379
He's coming around.

16
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:37,155
--Um...
--I'm Rom.

17
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:37,956
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,292
I'm his sister, Chiko.
Who are you?

19
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,627
I'm Son Gohan.

20
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:43,628
How old are you?

21
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:44,296
Four.

22
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:47,966
Hooray! You're younger than me!

23
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:49,433
Where are we?

24
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,305
This is our cottage.

25
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:57,309
Not bad, huh?
Where did you come from?

26
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:00,938
I don't know. I think it
was a desert somewhere.

27
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:08,987
Well, no matter. In any case,
as of today, you're one of us.

28
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,923
It might be rough, but don't cry,
the way Chiko does.

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,326
" Mom! Where have you gone!?"

30
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,328
I don't cry anymore!

31
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,996
Um, I...

32
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:22,000
Listen, from now on,
you have to call me Big Sister.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,536
There's no need to be shy.

34
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:27,437
Without any parents,
we all have to help each other.

35
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,943
What's the matter? If you want
to tell us something, speak up.

36
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,014
I'm sorry. It's been a long time
since I talked to anyone.

37
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,743
I can't speak that well.

38
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,977
About two years ago,
there was this gigantic tsunami.

39
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,810
It swallowed up the whole city!

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,181
It was scary!

41
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,018
This place is packed with
kids like us that don't have homes.

42
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:34,803
Um, but I...

43
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,612
Uh-oh, they're making
their regular stop.

44
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,280
Regular stop?

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Uh-huh! Hurry!

46
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,620
Hurry! They'll catch you!

47
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:17,436
Wait here. Once I take Chiko across,
I'll be right back for you.

48
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,840
Come on...

49
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:16,307
Take that! You guys can't catch us!

50
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,604
Dammit!

51
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,982
They make sure to come here
once every day.

52
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,316
Who are they?

53
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,651
The guys from the institution.

54
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,321
They're trying to catch us
and toss us in the pokey.

55
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:31,589
Is that a scary place?

56
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,492
According to the folks
who escaped from there,

57
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,263
they were picked on every day,
and got smacked with slippers.

58
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:42,290
You can't come out of there for the
rest of your life, that's for sure.

59
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,736
On top of that, they cut
your nails every night!

60
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:49,274
Let go of me! No! Oww!

61
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:53,540
Stop it! You're hurting me,
I tell you!

62
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,289
Piegero!

63
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,959
She doesn't want to go. Cut it out!

64
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,952
You again!? Come on, now!

65
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,411
Why, you-!

66
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,427
Stop that!

67
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,870
You children up in the tree,
come on down here!

68
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,609
If you do, you'll get new clothes,
a clean room, and a hot meal!

69
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,276
Really?

70
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:00,278
Dummy! Don't be fooled!

71
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:02,614
We don't want any of that!
Get out of here!

72
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:07,619
So then, do you plan to go on
living in a place like this forever?

73
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,288
You think we're about to
put ourselves in your care!?

74
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:12,957
We'll go on living
by ourselves just fine!

75
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:17,629
Yeah! Yeah! Get out of here!
Get out of here!

76
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,359
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

77
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:30,934
Yay! And don't come back!

78
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,911
We have a new kid?

79
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,914
Apparently, he got shipwrecked
out at sea, and washed up here.

80
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,916
I'm Son Gohan.
Nice to meet you.

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,920
Hey, this boy is still little,
so give him a comparable share of food.

82
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,590
Look who's talking. The same
goes for you, doesn't it?

83
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,057
I guess so.

84
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,465
Well, anyhow, as a fellow person without
any family, let's stick together.

85
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:52,924
Come on over, come on over!
Delicious stuff!

86
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,392
Welcome by, son.
I'll let you have them cheap.

87
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,936
Yow!

88
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,270
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

89
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,605
What's the matter, son?

90
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:10,942
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

91
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,944
--All right, now!
--Okay.

92
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:14,612
It hurts! It hurts!

93
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,614
What's the matter?

94
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:19,617
It hurts! It hurts!

95
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,618
It hurts!

96
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,287
Where does it hurt?

97
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,956
It hurts!

98
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:28,292
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

99
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,961
So, it's you guys! Hold it!

100
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:30,962
It hurts!

101
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,725
You bastards!

102
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,288
Hold it!

103
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,201
You hold it!

104
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,001
Dammit!

105
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:47,133
Thieves!

106
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:57,883
Hey, you!

107
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:05,761
Hold it!

108
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,722
Take that!

109
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,964
Why, you-! Hey!

110
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:41,966
See? That was pretty fun, wasn't it?

111
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,301
Uh-huh!

112
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:45,636
Even without parents,
children still grow up!

113
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:46,637
Yeah, yeah!

114
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,640
Well said!
We're growing up fine, huh?

115
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,641
What's the matter?

116
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,871
Hmm? Nothing.

117
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,980
What's the matter? Need to pee?

118
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,649
What are you doing?

119
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,319
Standing watch. We've been causing
trouble all over, after all.

120
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,989
Sometimes there are people
that come after us at night here.

121
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:14,014
What is it, if you didn't
come out here to pee?

122
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:25,002
I'm not an orphan. I have a mother,
and I was actually on my way home to her.

123
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:28,165
Oh, so the little boy has a home, huh?

124
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:34,946
I'm sorry, I just couldn't say anything.

125
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,614
There's nothing you
have to apologize for.

126
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,617
I guess I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

127
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,285
Where is your home?

128
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,621
In a bamboo grove on Mount Paozu.

129
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:46,290
Mount Paozu? That's pretty far, huh?

130
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,959
--You know it?
--Yeah.

131
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,628
Please tell me the way, if you would!

132
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:53,631
You got it. I'll show you tomorrow.

133
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,632
Thanks!

134
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:58,302
Say, is your mom nice?

135
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,503
I wouldn't say that.

136
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:02,306
Everyday, she tells me to study,
study, and it gets annoying.

137
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,308
Being annoying is okay,
as long as she's around.

138
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,643
Yeah, yeah!

139
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:07,311
Do you go to school?

140
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,312
I go to a cram school.

141
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:09,981
Do you like to study?

142
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,650
There's stuff I like,
and stuff I don't like.

143
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,990
Yeah, yeah, that's right, huh? I hate
gym and math, but art is my best subject!

144
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,991
For me, it's science.

145
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:22,994
--What about you, Ena?
--I've never been to school.

146
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:27,999
Oh, that's right. The tsunami
happened before Ena started school.

147
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:31,602
Do you guys... want to go to school?

148
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,604
Not especially. Who needs studying?

149
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,539
If you go to the institution,
you can do all you like.

150
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,944
No way, that place smells like medicine!

151
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,279
Yeah, that goes for me, too. No way.

152
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,146
And someone who's escaped
from there ought to know!

153
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,621
I know! How about we all drive
to Gohan's house tomorrow?

154
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,288
Cool!

155
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,586
That will be fun! Let's go, let's go!

156
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,632
Not yet?

157
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,633
Not yet.

158
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,969
They're late today.

159
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,164
Maybe they've given up.

160
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,040
They're coming, they're coming!
Here they come!

161
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,280
Hey, wait!

162
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,282
Hurry up!

163
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:53,951
O- oh, no!

164
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,441
Hey, get out!

165
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,939
Ow! Ow!

166
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,312
Chiko!

167
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,314
Come quietly!

168
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,338
Damn!

169
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:56,947
Gohan, this way!

170
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:57,948
But everyone else is-!

171
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,142
Just come on!

172
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,952
--Piegero!
--Gohan!

173
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:02,620
Piegero!

174
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,247
What are you doing!?

175
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,923
Hey, you!

176
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,993
Piegero!

177
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,941
Why!? Huh?

178
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:59,276
Why!? Why did you do that!?

179
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,766
Why!?

180
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:05,013
It's for the best!
They're still...

181
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:10,287
...just little kids...
and already they're delinquents.

182
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,847
They're too young for that!

183
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:19,630
You're no ordinary kid, huh?
You're incredibly strong.

184
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,965
Are you going back there?

185
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:27,165
No. There's nobody there, even if I
did go back. See ya. Respect your mom.

186
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,432
Thanks, Piegero-<i>san</i>.

187
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>Say, is your mom nice?</i>

188
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,113
<i>l've never been to school.</i>

189
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,613
<i>Respect your mom.</i>

190
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,334
What is your mission!?

191
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,973
Say it!

192
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,874
To defeat the Saiyans, and to save...

193
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,877
...the earth!

194
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,012
We're going back!
