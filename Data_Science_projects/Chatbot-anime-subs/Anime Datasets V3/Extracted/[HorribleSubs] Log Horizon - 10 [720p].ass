Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.02,0:03:42.40,Default - flashback,M,0000,0000,0000,,The trick is that there is no trick.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.80,0:03:46.97,Default - flashback,Guys,0000,0000,0000,,So you just cook it yourself, \Ninstead of using the command menu?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.71,0:04:12.16,Default - flashback,Ro,0000,0000,0000,,A prototype, to be precise.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.57,0:04:14.30,Default - flashback,K,0000,0000,0000,,It still has many flaws,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.30,0:04:16.81,Default - flashback,K,0000,0000,0000,,but it's a proof of concept.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.10,0:04:19.32,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,It's amazing you did that in \Nfewer than twelve hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.56,0:04:23.82,Default - flashback,I,0000,0000,0000,,Wait... What does that mean, exactly?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.30,0:04:29.83,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,It means the secret you've just learned about \Ncooking is not, in fact, limited to cooking.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.65,0:04:33.98,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,When it was a game, {\i1}Elder Tale{\i0} \Nhad no steam engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.35,0:04:35.08,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,However,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.74,0:04:38.90,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,a player with sufficient crafting skill

Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.72,0:04:54.11,Default - flashback,Ro,0000,0000,0000,,So now, there'll be a rush to invent things.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.46,0:04:57.47,Default - flashback,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,And that means a demand for new products.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.47,0:05:01.11,Default - flashback,K,0000,0000,0000,,And purchasing them will require earning money.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.48,0:05:03.58,Default - flashback,K,0000,0000,0000,,That will get the economy running...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.22,0:05:06.70,Default - flashback,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,In light of this,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.70,0:05:09.12,Default - flashback,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,we, the three major crafting guilds,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.80,0:05:21.14,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Part of the reason the town feels \Nso dead is simple despair,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.14,0:05:23.84,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,but another problem is that \Npeople have nothing to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.72,0:05:28.89,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Surviving in this world costs too little money.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.51,0:05:31.50,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Wouldn't it be better to use some money,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.50,0:05:34.60,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,then go earn more, \Nso you can then spend that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.44,0:05:39.43,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,To get money and crafting materials,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.43,0:05:41.47,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,activities such as hunting become necessary.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.16,0:05:46.10,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,That would give the combat \Nguilds more work, as bodyguards.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.44,0:05:49.20,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,The next problem is safety.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.94,0:05:53.13,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,The laws don't have to be that strict.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.09,0:05:56.41,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,If you consider fights over \Nterritory and hunting grounds
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.74,0:05:58.67,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,to be simply another form of competition,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.12,0:06:02.20,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,there isn't any need to ban them outright.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.20,0:06:03.52,Default - flashback,I,0000,0000,0000,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.52,0:06:04.33,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,However,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.15,0:06:08.34,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,certain things go too far, and will need banning.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.34,0:06:09.68,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,PKing, for instance.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.60,0:06:15.00,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Why don't we forbid player killing within \Nthe lower level zones around Akihabara?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.53,0:06:20.19,Default - flashback,Ai,0000,0000,0000,,Certainly, there's no point in fighting \Nplayers who are below level 50.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.54,0:06:22.22,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Our next issue is one of human rights.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.01,0:06:25.46,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,I believe that, with death no longer an absolute,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.95,0:06:27.42,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,kidnapping and imprisonment
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.42,0:06:30.20,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,are far more serious crimes than they \Nwould have been in the old world.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.08,0:06:35.37,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,And leaving or joining a guild \Nshould be up to the individual.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.37,0:06:36.38,Default - flashback,Mi,0000,0000,0000,,I agree.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.81,0:06:38.58,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,My final suggestion is this...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.15,0:06:42.63,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,That these human rights apply \Nnot only to us adventurers,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.63,0:06:44.59,Default - flashback,,0000,0000,0000,,but also to the People of the Land.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.68,0:06:53.15,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,This isn't the {\i1}Elder Tale{\i0} that we knew.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.95,0:06:56.78,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,The cooking and inventions prove that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.27,0:06:58.85,Default - flashback,Ro,0000,0000,0000,,That's true, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.18,0:07:01.60,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,It's certainly influenced by {\i1}Elder Tale{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.09,0:07:05.78,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,But this is a different world than \Nthe one we used to know.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.37,0:07:08.61,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,We must keep that in mind at all times.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.91,0:07:12.49,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,And the People of the Land are \Nthis world's original residents.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.23,0:07:19.25,Default - flashback,Guy,0000,0000,0000,,So they aren't simply non-player characters?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.78,0:07:20.62,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Correct.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.13,0:07:25.27,Default - flashback,S,0000,0000,0000,,Each has their own personality, \Nconcerns, and dreams...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.76,0:07:27.60,Default - flashback,I,0000,0000,0000,,That's idiocy.
