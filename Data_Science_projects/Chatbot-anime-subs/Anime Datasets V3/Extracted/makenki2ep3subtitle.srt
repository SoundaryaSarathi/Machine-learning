Monzon, or whatever you're called!</font></font>

I want to give a child life, Nia!</font></font>

186
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,550
Takeshi, Nia!</font></font>

187
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,610
Taکro medal!</font></font>

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,290
I know very Hyfh,</font></font>

191
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,180
But this is wrong!</font></font>

192
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,150
Shane up!</font></font>

193
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,630
I was what?</font></font>

194
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,360
Embarrassing!</font></font>

195
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,520
I can not believe I lost my instinct!</font></font>

196
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,450
Thanked God.</font></font>

197
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,130
All back to normal!</font></font>

198
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,430
But this... Yet...</font></font>

199
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,650
Let's create a couple of kids!</font></font>

200
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,360
All stimulation!</font></font>

201
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,820
Kind of thing.</font></font>

202
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,870
Right now we have the instincts of a cat!</font></font>

203
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,710
Should the owner of this element, the mowing, the draw here!</font></font>

204
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,250
Aynahv Chan, sorry, but you must bring it back and the cat...</font></font>

205
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,420
Well, yesterday Have not seen him!</font></font>

206
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,000
Gone somewhere.</font></font>

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
What</font></font>

208
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,510
Bkhatrh the Gondi who fled might be raised?</font></font>

209
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,410
No way.</font></font>

210
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,150
Mowing can not...</font></font>

211
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,190
I'm going to look after him.</font></font>

212
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,310
Aynahv chan!</font></font>

213
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,230
Currently, mowing and Aynahv Chan Mysprm to you, so that Tarzan!</font></font>

214
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,410
I thought Hymgamy to mark the rest of the match.</font></font>

215
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,200
Nia.</font></font>

216
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,170
Okay.</font></font>

217
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,550
Takeshi, granddad, take it.</font></font>

218
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,430
Aynahv Chan.</font></font>

219
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,460
It did not work.</font></font>

220
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,300
Mowing...</font></font>

221
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,300
It's possible that...</font></font>

222
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,000
Damn, why Come sit down!</font></font>

223
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,860
What's going on here?</font></font>

224
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,240
And while I do!</font></font>

225
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,610
Of Cat Thief!</font></font>

226
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,990
Pull your hand from my mates.</font></font>

227
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,790
I have no regrets!</font></font>

228
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,540
Stop're kids, Nia!</font></font>

229
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,040
Harvkv Senpai!</font></font>

230
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,860
I got all my best to give your kids life Senpai.</font></font>

231
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,090
I'm sure that all of them were cute.</font></font>

232
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,050
Orochi, Nia!</font></font>

233
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,180
Bsprsh to me.</font></font>

234
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,600
To control all the loss and they behave like cats.</font></font>

235
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Hymgamy, with Ghryzsh with him.</font></font>

236
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,290
Mowing.</font></font>

237
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,340
Mowing!</font></font>

238
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,590
Are you there?</font></font>

239
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,240
Hey mowing!</font></font>

240
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,590
Aynjayh really?</font></font>

241
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,420
It was a guess,</font></font>

242
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,030
I thought Aynjarv love mowing.</font></font>

243
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,740
Mowing.</font></font>

244
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,040
There!</font></font>

245
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,400
Mowing.</font></font>

246
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,850
Thanked God.</font></font>

247
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,620
Come now all back to normal.</font></font>

248
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
But, how are you going to be back to normal Brgrdvnymshvn, Takrv SAMA, Nia!</font></font>

249
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,170
Oh, right!</font></font>

250
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,060
Even if Qdrtshm understand, but still do not know how the rest of the bringing back to normal.</font></font>

251
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,790
So find Krdnshm Byfaydst!</font></font>

252
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,130
In any case, should Bgyrymsh.</font></font>

253
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,000
Not move, mowing.</font></font>

254
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,000
Hold it right there, Wait!</font></font>

255
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,270
Wait, come!</font></font>

256
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,770
Mowing.</font></font>

257
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,790
So like that, mowing?</font></font>

258
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,610
I'm sorry, Tarzan!</font></font>

259
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,670
Mowing.</font></font>

260
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,860
Elemental powers that cat!</font></font>

261
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,450
It was like a dream!</font></font>

262
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,890
I slept good.</font></font>

263
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,850
He said he was feeling lonely.</font></font>

264
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,060
If you thought all cats jump him into the game.</font></font>

265
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,380
I'm sorry mowing.</font></font>

266
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,230
After Myfhmysh.</font></font>

267
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,940
Huh? </font>Yeah.</font></font>

268
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,800
So it is've noticed, eh?</font></font>

269
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,640
Mowing the Manvhara loves you?</font></font>

270
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,040
The first time we saw each other was Avjayy.</font></font>

271
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,200
Hrdvmvn mark the memory of Angyzyh.</font></font>

272
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,010
Always a wave Bahatm.</font></font>

273
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,730
So it went like this.</font></font>

274
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,560
Enough of my other cats.</font></font>

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,900
Talk less and work more.</font></font>

276
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,030
What do I got?</font></font>

277
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,270
Create cards do, so that Tarzan!</font></font>

278
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,160
Miriam.</font></font>

279
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,710
It was funny.</font></font>

280
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,710
Pooh! Crazy.</font></font>

281
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,810
You were really funny, Hmygamy Senpai.</font></font>

282
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,190
Hey!</font></font>

283
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,070
Just delete it now!</font></font>

284
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,320
Bgyrsh rice.</font></font>

285
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,830
But, the reason that girls become only the cat...</font></font>

286
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,430
After mowing a cat forget!</font></font>

I'm in love with manga!</font></font>

288
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,620
