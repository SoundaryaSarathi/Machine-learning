1
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:05,364
Holy cow! A seminar on how
to become a princess?!

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:08,301
That's practically like a seminar
made just for me!

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,369
Sophisticated conversation,
elegant manners

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:12,338
and a brilliant grand ball!

5
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:16,209
But an evil shadow appears in this
beautiful garden of flowers!

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,542
On behalf of the ladies,
I shall punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

8
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

10
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,327
Guided by the light of the moon

12
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

13
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

16
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:03,142
Aim to be a Princess?
Usagi's Weird Training

17
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,341
I'm late! I'm late!

18
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,880
It's the same, every single morning.

19
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,129
Oh, Naru, good morning!

20
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,562
Good morning!

21
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,700
You overslept, too, didn't you?

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,837
Come on, I'm not you. I was
doing my homework.

23
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,505
We had homework?!

24
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:34,243
Homework, nothing! Science, math,
English, social studies...

25
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,541
Also, a report for Japanese class.

26
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,750
And the last one was embroidery
for home economics.

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,479
I don't care anymore.

28
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:49,151
Wow, a cool-Iooking guy!

29
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,233
Who are they?

30
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,935
What? Don't you know?

31
00:02:58,935 --> 00:02:59,902
No.

32
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:04,173
Those girls are attending the "Princess
Seminar" at Rose Mansion.

33
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:07,610
Rose Mansion is where Countess
Rose lives, right?

34
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,746
The lady who moved here
from England recently?

35
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:15,851
Yes, I hear Countess Rose is a famous
aristocrat back in England.

36
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,754
And some well-off parents
have asked her

37
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:21,416
to provide their daughters with
a princess's education.

38
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,260
A princess's education?!

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,423
It's supposed to turn you into a
sophisticated lady with grace.

40
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,026
We're late!

41
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:37,139
Let's see. Your homework yesterday

42
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:37,473
was to translate page 53 of
your textbook, correct?

43
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,907
Princess...
was to translate page 53 of
your textbook, correct?

44
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:50,876
Princess Serenity!

45
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,155
Oh, how beautiful she is!

46
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,857
Not only that, she is also graceful
and refined.

47
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,018
She is truly a princess
among princesses.

48
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:02,829
Princess, may I ask you for a dance?

49
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,192
Yes.

50
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,252
Did you do your homework?!

51
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:26,622
Quiet! How dare you address
a princess so?!

52
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:30,149
Oh, pardon me! Princess,
please forgive me!

53
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,350
It feels so good!

54
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,155
Wake up.

55
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,522
Miss Tsukino!

56
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:43,862
How dare you address a princess so?

57
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,511
Are you still half-asleep?

58
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,411
So, you forgot your homework?

59
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:54,316
Well, that is, how should I say this?

60
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:55,840
Get out!

61
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,955
I need to stop acting like this.

62
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:06,796
I need to be more aware
of myself as a princess!

63
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,765
That's my girl! Good of you
to have noticed that!

64
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:14,170
Because otherwise, Tuxedo Mask
won't dance with me at the ball!

65
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,467
What is that about?

66
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,072
Endymion,

67
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:24,613
you will assist Kunzite,
defeat Sailor Moon,

68
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,808
and steal back the Silver Crystal.

69
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,386
I refuse! I will not join forces
with anybody.

70
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:32,388
I will do things my way.

71
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,549
I will also do things my own way.

72
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,719
That will be fine, too.

73
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,567
Bring me Sailor Moon's corpse
and the Silver Crystal

74
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,502
as soon as possible.

75
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:49,335
Yes, my lady. I already have
a plan in motion.

76
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,209
Good.

77
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,817
Code name 0091. This is Luna.

78
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:04,587
My secret password is "The rabbit
on the moon makes rice cakes."

79
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,155
Please respond.

80
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:08,589
"The moon rice cakes are sticky."

81
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,752
"When I grilled them, they puffed up."

82
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,063
What is wrong, Luna?

83
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:18,134
Yes, well, Usagi seems to lack
awareness as a princess,

84
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:20,369
so I am at a loss of what to do.

85
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:24,863
That is a difficult question. Oh, shoot...

86
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,040
Oh, Artemis...

87
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,150
You've found out, huh?

88
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,119
Well, the communication device
isn't working well today.

89
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,024
So, you were the one giving me
orders all this time?!

90
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,125
Yeah, kind of.

91
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,760
Why didn't you ever tell me?!

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,194
Well, you never asked until now.

93
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:48,631
So, I just sort of kept on going.

94
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:49,893
Unbelievable.

95
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:05,604
Now, let us read aloud some of
Frances Hineck's poems today.

96
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:08,350
I am sunken in darkness

97
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,320
and the golden arrow that reaches me

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,056
is a letter from someone dear to me.

99
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:17,226
A kind poison tips the arrow

100
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:20,252
and I am a prisoner of love
who does not know what to do.

101
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:23,094
That's a pretty good poem.

102
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,068
What's wrong?!

103
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,338
Those are cheesecakes from Chalbon!
They're so lucky!

104
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,566
Usagi...

105
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:35,411
Miss, if you have business here,

106
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,246
please come in through the front gate.

107
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:39,271
Um, well, uh, that is...

108
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,819
May I help you?

109
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,489
Well, I want to attend the
Princess Seminar, too,

110
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,979
is sort of what I was thinking...

111
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:53,554
I am sorry, but you must have an
introduction from a member.

112
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:59,868
Introduction... Well, I was
introduced to this by her!

113
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,837
I do not think we can accept
an introduction from a cat.

114
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,709
You are a funny young lady.

115
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,678
Why not? Even if it is through
an introduction from a cat.

116
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:10,379
But...

117
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:10,879
You talk sense!
But...

118
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,868
You talk sense!

119
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:15,684
It would be fun to have at least
one unique person.

120
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,753
However, I have one condition.

121
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:21,257
Condition? But I'm no good at

122
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:23,726
tea ceremonies, flower
arrangements, cooking,

123
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:26,629
sewing, cleaning and even
dressing in a kimono.

124
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,157
On the top of that, I'm not good
at school, either! So...

125
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:36,329
It is quite impressive when there is
so much you cannot do.

126
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,674
Edward, if you please.

127
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,109
Yes, Ma'am.

128
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,337
Here you are.

129
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:45,447
The Countess's hobby is throwing
a frisbee around.

130
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,650
So, anyone who wants to take
the Princess Seminar

131
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,351
must be good with one.

132
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:52,149
Yes! I'm really good with these things!

133
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,651
Here it goes!

134
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:58,957
Oh, my.

135
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,533
Oh, my!

136
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,734
Good!

137
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:09,397
That was brilliant! Please join
the Princess Seminar.

138
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,403
I did it!

139
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,011
Wow, so Usagi went to Rose Mansion

140
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:18,309
in order to become a princess.

141
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:21,250
She'll come running back soon enough.

142
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,354
But I admire her for actively trying
to become a princess.

143
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,448
I just hope she turns into
a proper princess.

144
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,661
But what does it mean to be
"a proper princess"?

145
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:33,829
Huh?

146
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,398
Can't Usagi just stay the way
she is right now?

147
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:37,833
Of course not!

148
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,369
She has to be recognizable
as a princess

149
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,737
no matter who looks at her!

150
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,005
Why's that?

151
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:47,142
Listen, unless she becomes
a proper princess,

152
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:50,270
the Silver Crystal won't activate
its true powers!

153
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:54,176
Say, why don't we keep
Usagi company?

154
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,149
Good idea!

155
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,420
They are such impulsive girls.

156
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,149
Here, it is! Okay!

157
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,191
Oh, pardon me.

158
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,421
Oh, you are so good.

159
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,690
Everyone's so refined.

160
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,763
Here!

161
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:14,466
If doing this can turn me into a
princess, it's a piece of cake!

162
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,730
Is this what you wanted,

163
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,636
Master Kunzite?

164
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:25,515
Sailor Moon's specialty,
"Moon Tiara Action",

165
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,709
is similar to that game.

166
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,644
And she is a certified klutz.

167
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,590
In other words, the girl who
is good at that game,

168
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,126
but too clumsy to graduate from
the Princess Seminar

169
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:38,560
is Sailor Moon, correct?

170
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:41,698
But will such a Sailor Moon

171
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,895
actually fall for our trap, I wonder?

172
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,904
She will. That is exactly the kind
of person Sailor Moon is.

173
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,499
Here!

174
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,935
This dress is so tight!

175
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,875
I've gotta admire them.

176
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:32,282
Yes!

177
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,584
Now, ladies, let us all eat.

178
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,484
I'm so hungry!

179
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,193
No, you must not slurp.

180
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,558
Oh, okay.

181
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,898
No! Try one more time!

182
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,029
Again! Without slurping!

183
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:57,964
I didn't know eating would be
this hard!

184
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,136
A princess's speech is more
important than anything else.

185
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:06,206
In particular, speaking formally
is extremely important.

186
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,451
Let us make sure to speak
elegantly, courteously,

187
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:09,748
appropriately and with refinement.

188
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:10,720
Then, let me ask somebody
to demonstrate.

189
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,022
This is the same as school.
Then, let me ask somebody
to demonstrate.

190
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:13,356
This is the same as school.
How about you, Miss?

191
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:14,390
How about you, Miss?

192
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,592
Yes?!

193
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:19,028
What do you say when you
offer coffee to your guest?

194
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,265
What? Well, um, that is...

195
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:26,302
Would you please care to have
some coffee, if you would...

196
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,236
please... if you will?

197
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:38,615
You do not need to add such frills
to your speech.

198
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:43,416
In this case, "Please, have some
coffee," would do fine.

199
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,448
How would I know?!

200
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:58,227
Gracefully. Gracefully, now.
Un, deux, trios.

201
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,638
In synch with the music, now.
In synch.

202
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:04,937
This will be the last class for
the Princess Seminar.

203
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:08,875
If I pat you on your shoulder,
you have graduated.

204
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,250
You're on my foot!

205
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,081
Oops, sorry!

206
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,659
Oh, this is Hell!

207
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,786
You certainly never change.

208
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:27,564
You're all here?!

209
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,898
It's not fair to go off on
your own like that.

210
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:30,166
That's right.
It's not fair to go off on
your own like that.

211
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,690
We're here to keep you company.

212
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:44,643
Well, I guess everyone has
at least one good point.

213
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:52,152
Everybody has something
they're not good at.

214
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:01,698
I can do anything but dance.

215
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,292
I'm not good at doing anything.

216
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:07,397
Maybe I can't be a princess
at this rate.

217
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,337
You have passed.

218
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,370
You have passed.

219
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:21,484
Okay.

220
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,287
All ladies who have graduated,
please come to another room.

221
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:26,812
I shall give you your certificate
of graduation.

222
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,825
See you.

223
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,428
We failed.

224
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,531
This is rather eerie.

225
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,914
It's hard to believe they're not real.

226
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,506
You are correct.

227
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:59,314
The wax figures here all
used to be real ladies.

228
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,653
What?!

229
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,736
A monster!

230
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,333
I am the monster, Shakoukai!

231
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:22,934
Hello. I am very pleased to meet you!

232
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,697
Hey, did you just hear something?

233
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,099
Something must have happened
to Ami and Mako.

234
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,464
Let's go and check!

235
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:47,904
A monster!

236
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,105
It's a monster!

237
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,265
Run!

238
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,313
Gross!

239
00:15:57,313 --> 00:16:00,942
I am so sorry; you failed
the Princess Seminar!

240
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:05,455
One of you three should be
Sailor Moon,

241
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:06,889
but I wonder which one?

242
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:06,989
Uh-oh!

243
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,786
Why?

244
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,194
Because it would be impossible

245
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:14,831
for the clumsy, stupid, scatterbrained,
common Sailor Moon

246
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,095
to graduate from the Princess Seminar.

247
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,001
I see!

248
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,104
She's pretty shrewd!

249
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,198
Hey, this is no time to be impressed!

250
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,501
I shall turn you into wax figures!

251
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,907
Watch out!

252
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:36,584
I cannot see anything!

253
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,213
Now!

254
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:42,916
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

255
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:00,733
Mars Power Makeup!

256
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:15,854
Venus Power Makeup!

257
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:28,604
Would you please get out of my way?!

258
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:31,240
Where have those three ladies gone?!

259
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,539
I'll never forgive you for
failing Sailor Moon!

260
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:44,887
I'm a sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

261
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:47,515
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

262
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,158
Sailor Venus!

263
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,426
In the name of the moon,

264
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,030
we will punish you!

265
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:59,435
So, as I thought, one of those three
ladies was Sailor Moon.

266
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:00,834
Then, please take this!

267
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,706
I'll just burn that!

268
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:06,174
Fire

269
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:09,406
Soul!

270
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:21,179
Crescent Beam!

271
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:29,427
Neither the Crescent Beam
nor the Fire Soul works!

272
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:33,393
It doesn't look like my Moon
Tiara Action will work either!

273
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,307
I believe you will make
excellent wax figures!

274
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:43,006
Oh, no! I like figurines, but I don't
want to become one!

275
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,551
This rose!

276
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,449
Could it be...

277
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,690
Good work, Shakoukai.

278
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,425
Master Endymion.

279
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:59,861
Tuxedo Mask, you came to
rescue us, didn't you?!

280
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:02,558
Tuxedo Mask...

281
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:06,569
Sailor Moon, give me
the Silver Crystal.

282
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:09,037
If you do, I will let you live.

283
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:12,108
Those were not Master
Kunzite's orders...

284
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,133
What will it be, Sailor Moon?

285
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:19,740
Tuxedo Mask? This can't be happening.

286
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,022
Wake up, Sailor Moon!

287
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:29,958
This Tuxedo Mask is different from
the Tuxedo Mask we know!

288
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:34,594
Come, now!

289
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:44,502
Endymion, do not meddle
in affairs not your own!

290
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,904
What might you be talking about?

291
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,046
I have been running this operation.

292
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:52,276
I will kindly ask you to stay out of it.

293
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,949
The important thing is to obtain
the Silver Crystal. That is all.

294
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:00,317
What?

295
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,926
Excuse me, what should I...

296
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,094
Kill Sailor Moon!

297
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:06,729
Wait! The Silver Crystal comes first!

298
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,230
No! Sailor Moon comes first!

299
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,365
No, it's the Silver Crystal.

300
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:10,166
No, Sailor Moon!

301
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:10,733
No, the Silver Crystal!
No, Sailor Moon!

302
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:11,067
No, the Silver Crystal!

303
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:11,534
No, the Silver Crystal!
No, you're wrong!

304
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:12,262
No, you're wrong!

305
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:18,708
Whose order should I follow?

306
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,943
Ta-da! You must be so tired.

307
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,980
Would you please care to have
some coffee, if you would?

308
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,643
You do not need to add such frills
to your speech.

309
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:29,584
This is my chance!

310
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,394
Moon Healing Escalation!

311
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,466
Refresh!

312
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,176
So, she was Countess Rose!

313
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:57,947
I will restore Tuxedo Mask
with my power!

314
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:59,574
Moon Healing...

315
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:05,388
Sailor Moon, I will leave the
Silver Crystal in your keeping

316
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,980
until we meet again.

317
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:09,789
Good-bye.

318
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:15,025
Tuxedo Mask...

319
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,167
Where is the monster?

320
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,666
Oh, what were we...

321
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,315
Tuxedo Mask...

322
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,193
I'm late! I'm late!

323
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:46,058
You're still doing the same thing!

324
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:48,264
Because, I made up my mind!

325
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:50,332
Huh? About what?

326
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:54,470
I'm going to aim to be my
own kind of princess!

327
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,437
See ya!

328
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:59,436
She's talking complete nonsense again.

329
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:14,612
During the day, the
fragrance of flowers

330
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,228
During the night, the
twinkle of the stars

331
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:25,964
It's a world no one knows about

332
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,867
With white shoes clicking

333
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:33,677
Cross the white moon bridge

334
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:41,777
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

335
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:48,420
Offer a prayer to the moon

336
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:57,161
It will surely bring you happiness

337
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:04,369
Go round and round, the
moon's merry-go-round

338
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:12,644
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

339
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:20,190
She's always watching over us

340
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,686
Moon, moon princess
