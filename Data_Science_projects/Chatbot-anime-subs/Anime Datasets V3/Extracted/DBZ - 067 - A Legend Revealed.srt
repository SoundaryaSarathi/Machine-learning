00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,981
What are you guys going to do!?

2
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,178
Are you going to go back
to your own planet now!?

3
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:04,980
Or would you rather be
knocked flat, like this guy!?

4
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,198
Did you hear that, Butta?

5
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:18,103
That manly-man is spouting
that drivel again.

6
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:21,473
Yeah, he seems to be under
the mistaken impression

7
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,775
that he defeated ReaCoom by force.

8
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:25,877
It was just a strange coincidence,

9
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:30,115
overlapping with ReaCoom
letting his guard down. Right?

10
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:33,618
Yeah, of course it
was just by chance.

11
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:37,789
His battle power rating
barely changed at all.

12
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:42,460
W- what's going on with Goku
being so self-possessed?

13
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,190
F- Father...

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,241
The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

15
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,760
Jheese!

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,092
And the Blue Hurricane...

17
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,596
Butta!

18
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,498
So you ain't leaving, then?

19
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,435
Kakarrot has them beat.

20
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,118
Here we go!

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,779
Yeah!

22
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,761
This is getting boring!

23
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:25,096
He's not playing with
us at all, is he?

24
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:28,767
Are you sure he's not
just too scared to move?

25
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:32,601
Well, well, it turns out he's just
a big idiot, full of hot air!

26
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:41,611
I- it must be that their speed
is so great that Goku can't move.

27
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:45,450
Hey, Jheese!

28
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,611
You're playing around too much!

29
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:54,452
What about you? You could stand
to take a shot at him yourself!

30
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,006
Gohan, get out of the way!

31
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,578
I- it can't be!

32
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:34,425
He's a sassy bastard!
We're the Ginyu Special Corps!

33
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:40,097
You can't go on mocking us forever-

34
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:59,617
W- why, you!

35
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,594
Whatever you say,

36
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,121
but are you sure you guys ain't
leaving yourselves open too much?

37
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,796
What did you say!?

38
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:19,410
W-

39
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,071
Why, you!

40
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:49,565
W- what was that!?

41
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:53,505
What the hell did you just do!?

42
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:02,511
A <i>kiai</i> shout... He sent them flying
with just a <i>kiai</i> shout.

43
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,403
I have finally gotten all
seven Dragon Balls together.

44
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,740
Now I will be able
to obtain eternal life.

45
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,411
How silly of me.

46
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:31,474
Who would have thought that I would need
a passcode to have my wish granted?

47
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:37,755
Be that as it may, we will see whether
or not the surviving Namekians...

48
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:42,488
...will be accommodating enough
to tell me what the passcode is.

49
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,140
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>...

50
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,498
Wrong!

51
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,106
How many times do I have
to tell you!? Huh!?

52
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:06,042
Your right leg goes like this!

53
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,714
Remember, I'm thinking up
an ultra fighting pose

54
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:12,116
that's far cooler than
anything else up until now.

55
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:16,120
Freeza-<i>sama</i> will be seeing this,
so be dependable practice dummies.

56
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,459
I know! If you can pull this
off well, I'll give you this.

57
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,462
I'm so nice, aren't I?

58
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,953
All right, let's go!

59
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,801
R- ReaCoom!

60
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,469
B- Butta!

61
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,804
J- Jheese!

62
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,472
G- Ghurd!

63
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,140
Ginyu!

64
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,804
Together we are
the Ginyu Special Corps!

65
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,819
" Smack"

66
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,500
Don't touch the Dragon Balls!

67
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:13,444
Those are the precious Dragon Balls
that Freeza-<i>sama</i> has entrusted to me.

68
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,780
Why did you touch them!?

69
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,115
W- well... I, uh...

70
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:19,777
Why!?

71
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,978
I see.

72
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:33,120
If you want to touch them so badly,
then maybe I'll let you.

73
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:48,206
Go on, try to touch them.

74
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,417
If you are able to touch them,
even a little bit,

75
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:58,047
I will give you all
two caramels each.

76
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,110
Come on, come on,
what's the matter with you!?

77
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,511
You won't become stronger
warriors like this,

78
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,947
no matter how long
you work at it!

79
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,802
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>, do you get the feeling
those two aren't as strong as we thought?

80
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,138
They can't lay a hand on Father.

81
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,301
T- that can't be right.

82
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:27,104
They have about the same
amount of <i>Ki</i> as ReaCoom,

83
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:31,442
and not even Vegeta could do
anything against him.

84
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:35,146
Maybe Goku is just so overly
strong that those guys

85
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,782
don't look all that
tough compared to him.

86
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:42,947
I'm not so sure. Father's <i>Ki</i> seems
so much more smaller than theirs.

87
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,692
W- what's going on here!?

88
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:52,129
His battle power is only 5000,
no question about it!

89
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,466
But my attacks aren't even grazing him.

90
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:59,637
Kakarrot is sharply raising his battle
power for the briefest instant,

91
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:02,740
right when they attack.

92
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,643
Probably to avoid consuming
any unnecessary energy.

93
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:16,087
It's such a brief moment that the
Scouters probably can't pick it up.

94
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,256
H- he has an incredible battle power.

95
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:24,095
How does he have that kind of power?

96
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,364
This is pissing me off!

97
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:30,101
I'm not about to let that
little fart make a fool of me!

98
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,769
Hey, Jheese!

99
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,439
Let's do the Purple Comet Crush!

100
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:40,111
The Purple Comet Crush, huh?
That sounds good!

101
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,446
All right, let's do it, Butta!

102
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,107
Yeah!

103
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,406
What!? What's going on!?

104
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,151
Geez!

105
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:32,096
What could they all be doing,
abandoning a fragile lady here like this!?

106
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:36,434
That goes for Son-<i>kun</i>, too! Just saying
he fell behind schedule isn't good enough!

107
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:41,105
As soon as he gets here, I'll have
to have him take me straight home.

108
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,240
If I have to stay here too long,

109
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,267
my skin will be damaged,
and my good looks will be ruined!

110
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,950
I want to go home to Earth.

111
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,737
What in the world is this!?

112
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,492
That bastard!

113
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,495
<i>Jheese!</i>

114
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:44,101
Huh? What, Butta?

115
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:47,104
At this point, you should
launch your Crusher Ball.

116
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:52,109
Knowing his speed, he'll
probably dodge it and run away.

117
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,777
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

118
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:57,014
<i>lsn't it obvious?</i>
<i>l'm going to smash him</i>

119
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:59,049
<i>from the back as he's frantically</i>
<i>getting out of the way.</i>

120
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,721
<i>However fast he might be,</i>
<i>l'm still the fastest in the universe.</i>

121
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,723
All right.

122
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:09,059
Although, why should we
have to, against that scum?

123
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,395
Dammit!

124
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:16,066
<i>Crusher...</i>

125
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,626
<i>...Ball!!</i>

126
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,801
Come on, now...

127
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,011
What's wrong!?
Why isn't he dodging it!?

128
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,987
He deflected it!

129
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,323
D- damn it!

130
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:54,665
Huh?

131
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:07,080
Dammit, where did he go!?

132
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,452
Behind you, Butta!

133
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:26,470
Yo.

134
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,141
<i>Goku's power far exceeds that</i>
<i>of the Ginyu Special Corps.</i>

135
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:38,309
<i>Has Goku become that legendary warrior,</i>
<i>a Super Saiyan, after all?</i>
