00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,243
<i>Genshiken</i>

2
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:23,983
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

3
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:30,013
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

4
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:34,753
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:39,623
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,423
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:46,033
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:53,043
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

9
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:59,303
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:04,683
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

11
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:09,953
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

12
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:15,193
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

13
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,923
<i>At this tempo!</i>

14
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:28,743
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

15
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,303
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

16
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:42,353
<i>Episode 4: The Sublimated Process of Mental Blocks
Regarding the Dissimilation Between Dress and Costume</i>

17
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:05,173
Hey, Kasukabe.

18
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:08,583
Why don't you try cosplaying
at the next school festival?

19
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:09,653
What?

20
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:19,993
For starters, I recommend
Parn and Deedlit.

21
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,863
I can't stand this guy.

22
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:22,693
Well?

23
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,193
What the heck is a Parn?

24
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,893
Parn is a knight, and Deedlit is an elf.

25
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,233
Oh! An elf?

26
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,593
Like in Lord of the Rings!

27
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,843
What should I do?

28
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,913
I love Lord of the Rings!

29
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,683
To be precise, she's a high elf.

30
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:42,113
But she's not thin
enough to be an elf...

31
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:47,343
Yeah, I figured it might work if
he's Deedlit and she's Parn.

32
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,193
What a maniac!

33
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:52,413
Well why not?

34
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:57,223
All we do is set up and show
the same stuff every year.

35
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:59,663
This might liven things up.

36
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:02,203
Ow!

37
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,243
Full recovery in two months, huh?

38
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,933
Want it to take a little longer?

39
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:09,413
I get the point, let go!

40
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:13,543
Hey, I just know you
two would look great.

41
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:16,113
Not on your life!

42
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:18,413
Then how about Bridget and Ino?

43
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,453
I don't even know them, but no!

44
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,353
Well then...

45
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,153
Come in.

46
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,133
Uh, excuse me...

47
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:35,933
Um, um, is this Genshiken?

48
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:38,203
Yeah, it is...

49
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,473
I want to find out more about it.

50
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:42,233
You do?

51
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,343
Aren't you making some mistake?

52
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:47,313
This is the Society for the
Study of Modern Visual Culture.

53
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:48,613
I know.

54
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,073
It's a haven for otaku.

55
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,483
A chair, Sasahara.

56
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:54,523
R-Right.

57
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:55,643
Have a seat.

58
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,283
Oh, all right...

59
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:58,453
Here you go.

60
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,023
T-Thank you.

61
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,463
For the record, I'm not one of them.

62
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,703
This is my boyfriend, and he's a
member.

63
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,213
My name's Kohsaka and I'm a freshman.

64
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:21,413
I'm Kanako Ohno, also a freshman...

65
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:27,043
Um, I've just returned from living in
America, and I'll enroll next semester...

66
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:29,213
You lived abroad, huh?

67
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:30,193
Yes...

68
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:35,783
This Genshiken crew would
joke, saying it's just "so-so."

69
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,803
I'm Saki Kasukabe.

70
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,263
I'm a freshman too.
Nice to meet you.

71
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,193
It's nice to meet you too.

72
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,943
Take my word for it, forget this club.

73
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,973
You'd have to cosplay and whatnot.

74
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,213
What?

75
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,273
No normal person would ever do that.

76
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:58,343
Uh, I've done it before.

77
00:04:58,553 --> 00:04:59,853
You see?

78
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:02,183
What?

79
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,723
Wait a second, seriously?

80
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,793
T-Then why don't I
make you some costumes?

81
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,753
Oh, that would be nice.

82
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:12,133
All mine so far have been pre-made.

83
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:14,733
For real?

84
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,103
You've done it before?

85
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:18,603
Uh, yes...

86
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,233
like Queen Amida from Waremono
Chuiki...

87
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,313
That's kind of on the old side.

88
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:29,673
Wow, if she j-joins, it'll be the
b-birth of Genshiken's female cosplayer.

89
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,473
Tanaka is crying.

90
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,113
You look like you'd be cute if
you took care of yourself, so why?

91
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:36,793
They'll find out your sizes!

92
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,363
They'll measure you!

93
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,393
Uh, um, um...

94
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:46,233
When it comes time to measure,
I'll let you do it, and...

95
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,463
...I swear not to divulge the numbers.

96
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,733
That's even creepier.

97
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:54,363
What's the big deal?
This is something she wants to do.

98
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:55,503
What?

99
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:59,413
When someone knows the fun of
cosplaying, you can't talk them out of it!

100
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:00,513
That said it all.

101
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:03,973
Mr. Chairman, let's do this
for the Culture Festival.

102
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:07,553
But she hasn't said she's
joining the club yet.

103
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,523
What character would you like, then?

104
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,613
I'll get to it on the double.

105
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:14,723
I don't know much about the
latest things in Japan...

106
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:16,863
She really is into this.

107
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,263
That's fine.

108
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,863
Choosing a character you
like is most important.

109
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:24,703
Um, then, a character
I can do with my hair.

110
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:27,433
In that case, I think the
Vice-President from Kujiun or...

111
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,943
...Jam Kuradoberi from
Guilty Gear would work.

112
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,813
Are we really measuring at my place?

113
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:37,373
It still hasn't been put away.

114
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:38,723
That's fine.

115
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:43,753
I don't want to go to their pads,
and I don't want to let them in mine.

116
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:46,153
So yours is the only one left.

117
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,893
That was mean.

118
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,623
I-Is that so?

119
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,463
Come on, let's just go.

120
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:58,503
A female otaku's place...

121
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:00,333
I have to see this...

122
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,213
Um, would you mind
waiting here a minute?

123
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:16,053
I'll clean up a little.

124
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,123
Oh, then I'll help you.

125
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:20,153
It won't take long.

126
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:22,793
Damn!

127
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:23,863
Damn?

128
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,493
She didn't lock the door just now.

129
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,173
You shouldn't do that.

130
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,363
Oh no?

131
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:32,533
I won't go.

132
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:33,303
Fine.

133
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,633
I will.

134
00:07:54,493 --> 00:08:00,363
<i>Bamboo poles for laundry!
Bamboo poles for laundry!</i>

135
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:02,693
Baldies?

136
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,403
Uh, um...

137
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,703
This is what you had to clean up?

138
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:13,013
Is this a gag?

139
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,473
No.

140
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,283
Oh, you're serious.

141
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:18,613
Yes...

142
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,213
Tanaka!

143
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,693
Come and see!

144
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,323
Ow!

145
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,553
Wait a minute! Wait!

146
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,223
Tana...

147
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:39,403
Am I weird?
Am I weird after all?

148
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,303
Wait wait!

149
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:42,373
I give up...

150
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,413
Tana-

151
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,923
I knew you would act like this!

152
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,293
Beautiful characters
are what's popular at the...

153
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,423
...Manga Club and
Anime Research Society.

154
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:06,363
I got laughed at a lot by
my friends overseas too.

155
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:07,503
Am I weird?

156
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,733
What's wrong with it?

157
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:14,303
The world's full of
people into older guys.

158
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,903
It's a more dangerous thing to...

159
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:21,173
...hide yourself and be distant
from other people because of it.

160
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:27,743
If it's really a secret you have to hide,
remember it's just your preference.

161
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:30,493
You really just want friends.

162
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,223
I'll bet that's why you
didn't lock the door...

163
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:35,853
You all really are some lonely people...

164
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,593
But still, bald guys
with sunglasses is weird!

165
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,833
You're right, it's weird.

166
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,533
But, they're cool.

167
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:57,143
I really thought I
was gonna die, though.

168
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,413
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:02,923
That was a big step for
me to take all at once.

170
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:05,283
Am I starting to understand otaku?

171
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:06,863
No way.

172
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:11,223
I don't know anime, but it's
definitely pretty boys for me.

173
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,673
Oh, your boyfriend is one.

174
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:16,673
I guess I don't really go for that.

175
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:20,143
That makes me happy and
annoyed at the same time.

176
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:25,003
I'm surprised they sell
this kind of poster.

177
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,273
No, these were never on the market.

178
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:32,223
Members of a Japanese group I met on
the Net made them and gave me some.

179
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,923
She does have friends,
and they make her stuff...

180
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,563
But what do tastes like
that have to do with cosplay?

181
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,933
They're totally separate.

182
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:46,603
Cosplay is cosplay, tastes are tastes.

183
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,273
Maybe she's stronger than I thought...

184
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,273
No facial hair?

185
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:02,373
Ah, no, that's part of it too.

186
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:03,613
What's with you?

187
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:12,153
<i>Suioh University</i>

188
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:43,653
The customer is either out of their
calling area or their phone is turned off.

189
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:48,663
<i>Genshiken Comprehensive Exhibition</i>

190
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:49,863
Hey.

191
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,433
Oh, an outsider.

192
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,933
You seen Kohsaka?

193
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,833
I knew you'd make a
good "Jam Kuradoberi."

194
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:00,303
Cranberry jam?

195
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:03,813
Jam Kuradoberi. She's a
fighting game character.

196
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,173
Huh...

197
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:10,013
You look kind of like an alien.

198
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,853
Um, um...

199
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,143
Don't say "Um, um."

200
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:17,193
Ah, right...

201
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,593
People who don't know the
character won't understand.

202
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,663
It's a type of symbol.

203
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:23,563
Huh?

204
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:26,863
Conversely, people who
don't know the character but...

205
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:29,463
...still say things like "how
cute" won't personally grasp it.

206
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:33,173
You'll understand if you try it!

207
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:34,933
You won't if you don't!

208
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:38,673
She's right, it's a kind of fun you have
to experience through your body.

209
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:42,943
Actually, I brought
this along with me today.

210
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,523
If you put this beauty on...

211
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:48,313
...suddenly you'll be cosplaying
even in your regular clothes.

212
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,283
It's surely the strongest of...

213
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,193
I shouldn't have come here.

214
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,993
Oh wow, do they sell those?

215
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,123
Well, they do sell them but...

216
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,173
...this one is a handmade
gem I picked up at an event.

217
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,373
Kohsaka's not with you?

218
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:05,373
He won't answer his cell.

219
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,603
Maybe he's seeing some
woman from his past?

220
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:08,933
What?

221
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:10,743
I doubt it.

222
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:13,543
If his phone's turned off, that would
make it seem all the more suspicious.

223
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:17,413
But, it's probable that some
girl might go after him...

224
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:26,723
Hello?

225
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,863
Hi, yeah...

226
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,493
No way, you're here?

227
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,063
Okay, got it, be right there...

228
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,863
A man from her past?

229
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,033
You could at least say "ex-boyfriend."

230
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,303
All right! Let's make
sure Kohsaka sees this!

231
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,603
Tail her, Sasahara.

232
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:44,573
No, thank you.

233
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,413
If you want Kohsaka...

234
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,843
T-There's a Guilty Gear
tournament at the Anime Club...

235
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,323
...so don't you think he'd go there?

236
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,353
If you thought that,
you should have told her sooner.

237
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:59,023
Well, I c-couldn't find
a chance to say it...

238
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,793
Then let's go to the Anime Club.

239
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,443
Is it all right for her
to walk around like that?

240
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:14,903
Why not? It's a festival.

241
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,543
She can just put a coat on.

242
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,583
But, s-someone has to stay behind.

243
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:23,083
This is the dokutsurutake, loaded
with alpha amanitin and beta amanitin.

244
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:26,383
Also called the "Angel of Death,"
just one is enough to kill an adult.

245
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:30,983
Mureohfuusentake, nicknamed
kurodaikoku.

246
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:33,953
Porcini yamabushitake...

247
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:46,603
Yeah, this place sure
is up in the mountains.

248
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,233
Why are you here?

249
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:51,903
I mentioned in my message the
other day that I might come by.

250
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,073
You did?

251
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,843
Geez, that's cold.

252
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:57,273
So, want to go have drinks or
something?

253
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:59,543
You can't have much to do around here.

254
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:01,623
It may not look it, but I do.

255
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,283
Really, in a drag place like this?

256
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:07,523
You must've found a new man.

257
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:08,093
What?

258
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,233
I mean, you were always complaining.

259
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,423
Now you've got things to do?

260
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:22,843
No way, I'm too late!

261
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,813
I wish you wouldn't put it that way.

262
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,443
You had no chance
even if you were early.

263
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,413
But I thought I had a
chance, judging by your email.

264
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:34,983
You shouldn't read into
email that deep, you know.

265
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:36,353
Gotcha.

266
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:38,493
So, what's he like?

267
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:44,863
Um...

268
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,663
C-Cute's a good word...

269
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,333
Isn't it better for
you not to know much?

270
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,803
Yeah, I guess so...

271
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,443
For the sake of mental hygiene, eh?

272
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:56,803
They saw me...

273
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,343
I've got to go.

274
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,773
You do?

275
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,723
And also, let's stop emailing.

276
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:07,643
What?

277
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:10,983
I don't think it's a bad thing...

278
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:13,993
...but I'm really into my boyfriend...

279
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,323
...so I'm going to keep away
from anything remotely dangerous.

280
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,263
Right...

281
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:20,193
Bye!

282
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,013
Darn it...

283
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,943
Don't tell Kohsaka.

284
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,943
I broke up with that
guy a long time ago.

285
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:40,643
He came here today on his own,
without even telling me first.

286
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:43,583
Well, well! He really
was an ex-boyfriend.

287
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:46,123
You looked compatible
enough... Just right, actually.

288
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,393
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,893
Why'd you break up?

290
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,463
I guess a lot happened?

291
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:51,923
Don't tell him!

292
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:55,033
Yes, I swear.

293
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:55,903
We swear.

294
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:56,663
Good.

295
00:16:56,773 --> 00:17:01,263
<i>Anime Club: Repertoire, Day 1
Inter-Circle Game Tournament</i>

296
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:03,703
Oh my, he got behind him!

297
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,373
There he is.

298
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:08,113
I should have known he'd be here.

299
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:13,543
Crap, crap, crap.

300
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,553
Another chain!

301
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,063
Whoa, this is amazing!

302
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,803
Kohsaka's really in a
dimension all his own.

303
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,063
He always plays at the
highest form you can imagine.

304
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,673
He's probably on a national level.

305
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,673
Kohsaka is amazing.

306
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,213
<i>So that's all you've got?</i>

307
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,323
Congratulations.

308
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:54,723
Your prize, 25 years
worth of game software.

309
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,863
Thanks a lot.

310
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,493
You all came by.

311
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:03,773
25 years worth of crap
games, what the hell?

312
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,373
Some of the ones we
provided are mixed in too.

313
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,733
It's not a big deal, let's
all play them together.

314
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:13,173
Well, crap games are
good for a laugh at least.

315
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,613
You could say that.

316
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:17,613
Leave that in the club room
so you and I can go out.

317
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,513
Uh, but I've got
reception duty after this.

318
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:21,853
Skip it!

319
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,683
Easy for you to say.

320
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:25,723
You wanna know what she was just...

321
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,553
What?

322
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:31,923
Nothing.

323
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,003
Huh?

324
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,463
Yeah, nothing.

325
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,183
Jam, please look this way.

326
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:48,543
Okay.

327
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:51,813
This way too, please.

328
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:52,843
Okay.

329
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:54,323
Ah, very nice.

330
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:58,253
Excuse me, please look this way next.

331
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,463
Okay.

332
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,433
Hey, Tanaka.

333
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:13,273
Yeah, I have permission
from the Anime Club.

334
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:16,363
No, I mean we could
charge money for this.

335
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:19,603
You can't have cosplayers
charging money for photography.

336
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,383
But, for free...

337
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:26,743
If you try it too, we could at
least collect enough to cover costs.

338
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,553
I told you I won't.

339
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:30,993
I thought so.

340
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,283
It's just the...

341
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:36,663
...cat ears!

342
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:47,203
Uh, no sweat.

343
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,233
I mean, you already broke up with him...

344
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,343
You look cute, Saki.

345
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,053
Yes, Saki, you look great.

346
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,943
They work so well on you.

347
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,613
Who would've thought...

348
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,723
C-Can I take your picture?

349
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:21,103
Saki?

350
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:37,803
That's a pretty complicated display of
anger.

351
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:39,683
Especially with those on...

352
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:11,183
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

353
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:20,553
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

354
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:29,893
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

355
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:39,233
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

356
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:50,053
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

357
00:22:51,123 --> 00:23:01,433
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

358
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:10,973
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

359
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:20,953
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

360
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:29,793
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

361
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:39,203
The allure of cosplay?

362
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:41,843
I haven't given much
thought to it, but...

363
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:46,743
Um, um, if anything it's like
floating 3mm off the ground...

364
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:49,673
...or your body temperature
going up about 3 degrees...

365
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:52,813
That's the kind of feeling it gives you.

366
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,423
You could say it lets you
be a little more daring.

367
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,693
Say, Kohsaka, what was
your first time like?

368
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,793
Um, it's okay if you don't want to say.

369
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:49,503
Hmm, I'd have to say it was MS
Gundam.

370
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:53,473
From there I moved to magical girls
shows, Momo, Mami, Persia, Emi.

371
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:54,103
Uh, wait...

372
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:56,873
For RPGs I guess it
was Ultima, on the PC.

373
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,953
Oh, yeah, do you know
the game Life & Death?

374
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,883
I don't even know how many
people I killed in that.

375
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,923
Then Manhole and whatnot.

376
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:08,423
Umm, what were we talking about?
