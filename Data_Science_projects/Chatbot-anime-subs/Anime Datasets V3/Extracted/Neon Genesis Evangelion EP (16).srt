Standing there smiling serenely.

<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>

<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18

<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>

So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,410
Hey, Shinji, did you change
the soup stock?

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,680
Yeah, to dried fish flavor.
It's a gift from Ritsuko.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,390
Too hot!

25
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,460
You're always apologizing! Do you
always think you're to blame?

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
You're always apologizing! Do you
always think you're to blame?

28
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,630
Shinji, apologies are your
conditioned reflex

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,770
to any kind of confrontation!

30
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,270
Exactly like that. You're
too self-deprecating!

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,070
Exactly like that. You're
too self-deprecating!

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,940
Now, now, that's just his way.

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,080
It's so easy to just accept his
pathetic habits, isn't it?!

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,820
But haven't you been a little
too easy on Shinji lately?

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,790
Have I?

37
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,320
Maybe you and Kaji have
hooked up again,

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,950
Maybe you and Kaji have
hooked up again,

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,620
but the fact that you're happy
doesn't mean you can ignore us.

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,920
There's nothing between
Kaji and me.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,500
Hey, Katsuragi, I've found a bar
that serves a decent drink.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,230
How about tonight? Bye!

43
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,370
I've never seen anyone involved in
such an indecent relationship!

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,410
You're supposed to be our
guardian! You hypocrite!

45
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,900
It's disgusting!

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,400
Episode 16
Deadly Illness, then...

47
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,550
<i>B-type harmonics test, all green.</i>

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,190
<i>Projected adjustment values</i>
<i>have been cleared.</i>

49
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,690
You look tired, Misato.

50
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,990
Yeah, for a lot of private reasons.

51
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,930
Kaji?

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,490
Shut up!
Kaji?

53
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,660
Shut up!
<i> </i>

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,130
Well, how's the Third Child doing?

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,200
Take a look.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,630
Let me see.
Take a look.

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,690
Let me see.
<i> </i>

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,370
I hope that knowing this will
boost his confidence.

59
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,860
<i>Can you hear me, Shinji?</i>

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,930
Misato, how were my test scores?

61
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,970
<i>Yes! You are Number One!</i>

62
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,120
I lost! He beat us easily.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
He beat us so easily that
it's pissing me off!

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,410
He's great, wonderful, awesome,
too awesome!

65
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,160
The invincible Shinji!

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,330
So that makes our job a
little easier, right?

67
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,570
But it also means we'll have to do
our best to not be left behind.

68
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,790
Goodbye.

69
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,390
<i>Next stop is Seisho Kabuse.</i>
<i>Next stop, Seisho Kabuse.</i>

70
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,850
<i>Convenient to the Bashar, used</i>
<i>books and video game stores...</i>

71
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,220
Good.

72
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,760

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
You're late.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm sorry.
You're late.

76
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm sorry.
<i> </i>

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,100
What's going on? The observation
center in Fuji...

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,870
Didn't detect it. It just suddenly
appeared directly above us.

79
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,510
Pattern Orange. No
AT Field detected.

80
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,440
What is this?

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,010
A new kind of Angel?
What is this?

82
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,780
A new kind of Angel?
<i> </i>

83
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,210
The MAGI are withholding
judgment.

84
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,670
Damn! A situation like this and
Commander Ikari's not here.

85
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,990
<i>Can you all hear me?</i>

86
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,390
I've sent you all of the
target's data.

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,950
<i>This is all we know right now.</i>

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,270
<i>Approach it carefully and</i>
<i>observe its reactions,</i>

89
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,900
<i>and, if possible, lure it outside</i>
<i>of the city limits.</i>

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,110
<i>Two of you will back up</i>
<i>the other, got that?</i>

91
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,130
All right, Ma'am, but I think Shinji
ought to take the point.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,750
Well, this is a job for the
highest rated, bravest,

93
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,320
Number One synchro-ratio
holder, right?

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,980
<i>Or don't you feel up to it, Shinji?</i>

95
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,750
<i>No, I can do it.</i>

96
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,030
<i>I'll show you how it ought</i>
<i>to be done, Asuka.</i>

97
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,590
<i>What was that?!</i>

98
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,160
Hey, you two cut it out.

99
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,870
<i>Isn't that what you said, Misato?</i>
<i>"You are Number One!"</i>

100
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,700
Well, that was...

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,740
<i>Combat is a man's job, after all.</i>

102
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,640
<i>Talk about out of date!</i>

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
<i>Unit 02 will back him up.</i>

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,370
<i>Unit 00 will back him up as well.</i>

105
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,110
I can't believe those kids are doing
this without my orders.

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,680
Shinji's getting more manly,
isn't he?

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,450
No, I'm going to have to chew
him out when he gets back.

108
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,040
You might just be a good teacher.

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,070
Ayanami, Asuka, are you
in position yet?

110
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,370
Not yet.

111
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,110
You know an Eva can't
move that fast.

112
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,230
You know an Eva can't
move that fast.

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,050
Not there yet?

114
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,320
I'll have to stop it myself.

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,410
It disappeared!

116
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,210
What?!

117
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:10,910
Pattern Blue! Angel confirmed!
Directly beneath Unit 01!

118
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,970
Pattern Blue! Angel confirmed!
Directly beneath Unit 01!

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,970
A shadow?!

120
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,280
What is this?! I can't believe it!

121
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,680
<i>Shinji, get out of there! Shinji?!</i>

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,920
Ikari?

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,690
You idiot, what are you doing?!
Ikari?

124
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,550
You idiot, what are you doing?!
<i> </i>

125
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,730
<i>Misato, what's going on?!</i>

126
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,760
<i>Misato? Asuka! Ayanami! Help me!</i>

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,270
<i>Misato?! Can you hear me, Misato?! Misato!</i>

128
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,200
Eject the plug! Send the signal!
<i>Misato?! Can you hear me, Misato?! Misato!</i>

129
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,040
No response! It's not working!

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,270
<i>Misato! Misato!</i>

131
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,410
Shinji!

132
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,740
<i>Asuka! Rei! Rescue Unit 01! Hurry!</i>

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,300
That idiot. He can get an A on a
test but not in the real world.

134
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,050
It disappeared again.

135
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,650
Asuka, be careful.
It disappeared again.

136
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,290
Asuka, be careful.
<i> </i>

137
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,780
A shadow?

138
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
The city is sinking!

139
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
<i>Asuka, Rei, pull back.</i>
The city is sinking!

140
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,210
<i>Asuka, Rei, pull back.</i>

141
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:23,980
Bu...

142
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,350
<i>Wait!</i>
Bu...

143
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,210
<i>Unit 01 and Ikari are</i>
<i>still in there.</i>

144
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,410
This is an order. Retreat.

145
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,090
Major Katsuragi must feel awful.

146
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,800
They reeled the umbilical
cable back in,

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,570
but the other end was missing.

148
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,340
Without power...

149
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,080
There's not much energy in the
internal batteries.

150
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,180
If Shinji doesn't waste it groping
blindly in the dark,

151
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,380
if he stays in the most minimal
life-support mode,

152
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,370
then he can survive for
sixteen hours.

153
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,120
<i>Second Tank Battalion deployed.</i>

159
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,200
It hasn't moved.
Shadow status?

It hasn't moved.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,500
It stopped spreading once it
reached a diameter of 600 meters.

162
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,570
By the way, is there a use for
those ground troops?

163
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,740
They're supposed to allow
us to apply pressure.

164
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,310
Oh, well.

165
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,380
Taking matters into his own hands,
defying Operations.

166
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,980
He got what he was asking for.

167
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,850
Just because he got a little
better score than mine,

168
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,750
he had to go and show me
how it ought to be done.

169
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,280
What a dumpkoff!

170
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,220
What? Are my comments about
Shinji pissing you off?

171
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,230
Do you pilot Eva just for the
praise of others?

172
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,300
No, I don't need anybody's
approval but my own!

173
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,000
Cut it out, you two!

174
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,440
Yes, he acted arbitrarily and
without consultation.

175
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,610
So, I'll just have to punish him
when he comes back.

176
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,400
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

177
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,960
I never thought sleeping could
be this exhausting.

178
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
Still nothing but white noise.

179
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,110
No radar or sonar reflections at
all. This space must be too big.

180
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,880
It's been twelve hours since I
switched to life-support mode.

181
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,320
My life will end in four
or five hours.

182
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,290
I'm hungry.

183
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,200
So, that shadow is actually
the Angel's body?

184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,130
Correct. It's six hundred eighty
meters in diameter

185
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,030
with a thickness of three
nanometers.

186
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,910
Sustained within that ultra-thin
space is an inverted AT Field.

187
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,910
Abstract mathematics defines the
region within as a Sea of Dirac.

188
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,750
It could be connected
to another universe.

189
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,380
What about the sphere?

190
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,010
It disappears when the imaginary
circuit of the body closes.

191
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,110
The object in the sky is
only a shadow.

192
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,110
So the black shadow that
swallowed Unit 01 is the target.

193
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,160
Then there's no way that
we can fight it.

194
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,770
The water is getting cloudy!

195
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,760
The purification system
is breaking down.

196
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,710
It smells in here.

197
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,780
Blood! This place smells
like blood!

198
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,850
No, I hate this place!

199
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,250
Why can't I open this lock?

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,620
Open up! Let me out!

201
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,320
Misato, tell me what's going on!

202
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,220
Misato! Asuka! Ayanami!

203
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,280
Dr. Ritsuko!

204
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,310
Father...

205
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,630
Please, someone help me.

206
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,570
A forced Eva salvage?

207
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,260
It's the only possibility
that might work.

208
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,010
We would drop all 992 existing
N2 mines into its center,

209
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,810
while simultaneously activating
the AT Fields of the other Evas

210
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,180
disrupting the circuit enclosing
the Angel's pocket interior.

211
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,550
If we concentrate enough power
into the same microsecond,

212
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,190
we might destroy the Angel and
the Dirac Sea that makes it up.

213
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,090
But the damage to the Eva would
be... Shinji wouldn't...

214
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,860
What kind of rescue
operation is this?

215
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,200
This operation's priority is
to recover the Eva itself.

216
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,570
That the body may be damaged or
destroyed has no bearing.

217
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,900
Now wait a second!

218
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,530
The pilot's life is not our concern.

219
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,800
If Shinji's lost, it's your fault.
Just remember that!

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,850
Why are you and Commander Ikari
so worried about Unit 01?

221
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,190
What in the hell is an Eva?

222
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,420
I've given you all the information.

223
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,910
You're lying!

224
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,860
Misato, trust me.

225
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,730
I'm taking command of
this entire operation.

226
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,640
Forward all flights to Kansai
International Airport.

227
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,610
Contact Air Traffic Control and the
JADF's Air Transport divisions.

228
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,820
<i>The Second Impact, the</i>
<i>Instrumentality Project, Adam...</i>

229
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,980
<i>There are so many secrets that</i>
<i>I'm in the dark about.</i>

230
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,420
Who's that?

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,690
Who?

232
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,570
Shinji Ikari.

233
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,110
That's me.

234
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,440
I am you. This self incorporates
another self.

235
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,570
The self has always been
composed of two selves.

236
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Two?

237
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,820
Yes, the self which is observed
and the self which observes itself.

238
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,890
To expound, the Shinji Ikari
that exists in your mind

239
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,230
is only one Shinji Ikari.

240
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,160
There's also the Shinji Ikari in
Misato Katsuragi's mind,

241
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,930
the Shinji Ikari in
Asuka Sohryu's mind,

242
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,430
the Shinji Ikari in
Rei Ayanami's mind,

243
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,400
and the Shinji Ikari in
Gendou Ikari's mind.

244
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,670
All are different Shinji Ikari's,

245
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,970
but each of them is a
true Shinji Ikari.

246
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,440
Your fear is of the Shinji Ikari's
who exist in the minds of others.

247
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,780
I'm just afraid of being hated.

248
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,010
You're afraid of being hurt.

249
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,050
Who is bad?

250
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,750
Father is.

251
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,790
The father who deserted us.

252
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,950
No, I'm the one who's bad.

253
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,060
You're always apologizing! Do you
always think you're to blame?

254
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm worthless.

255
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,490
No, you just believe that
you're worthless.

256
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,990
Don't you trust your father?

257
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,670
I thought I hated my father,
but now I'm not sure.

258
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,110
Good work, Shinji.

259
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,810
My father called me by my name.
I was praised by my father!

260
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,410
Will you spend your life
regurgitating

261
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,220
and re-digesting those few
pleasant memories?

262
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,590
If I trust their words, it's enough
to keep me alive.

263
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,290
Even though you know you're
deceiving yourself?

264
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,390
Everybody does it! That's how
everyone survives.

265
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,030
If you will not believe that you
can change yourself,

266
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,130
you will be unable to continue.

267
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,300
This world is filled with too much
pain and suffering to keep going.

268
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,830
For example, you can't swim?

269
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,900
Humans aren't made to float!

270
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,040
That is self-deception.

271
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,770
I don't care what you
want to call it!

272
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,640
You've been shutting your eyes to
that which you wished to avoid.

273
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,980
His sister was injured
during the incident.

274
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,780
Who cares what the others say?!

275
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,180
Go away!

276
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,950
No, I don't want
to hear this!

277
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,450
See? You're running
from reality again.

278
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,730
No one can justify life by linking
happy moments into a rosary.

279
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,800
In particular, I cannot.

280
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,070
I've found something I can do to
feel good. Something I want to do!

281
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,730
What's wrong with that?!

282
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,740
In theory, the entry plug's
energy reserves

283
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,680
should be reaching their
expiration point.

284
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,910
The plug suit's life support system
will be getting close to redline.

285
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,750
Advance the schedule
by twelve minutes.

286
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,810
Let's do it while there's a chance
that Shinji's still alive.

287
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,770
Father, am I unwanted?

288
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,210
Father!

289
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,510
It was really yourself that
you ran away from.

290
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,450
That's right! He may be guilty
of killing his own wife.

291
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,120
He killed his own wife.

292
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,150
No! Mother was...

293
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,020
Smiling...

294
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,750
You did a good job.

295
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,750
Shinji, you must not run away.

296
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,220
Do your best.

297
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,520
I hate this place.

298
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,960
I hate this loneliness.

299
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,730
No...

300
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,010
The heating and the oxygen
circulation are already out.

301
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm cold.

302
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,280
It's useless, the suit is
giving out too.

303
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,780
This is the end.

304
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,690
I'm tired of...

305
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,620
Everything.

306
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,550
Mother?

307
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,830
Is this enough?

308
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,010
Well, that's good for you.

309
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,120
<i>Evas are in position</i>
<i>and standing by.</i>

But we haven't done anything yet.

No way, Shinji?!

321
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,410
It's impossible!

323

I... Am I piloting a
thing like that?

325
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,510

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,410
I just wanted to see them again.

332
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,450
Didn't you say you were
going to punish him?

333
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,390
I've never seen the Eva looking
as horrible as it did today.

334
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,290
Are the Evas really on our side?

335
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,170
They may hate us.

336
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,800
I think that Major Katsuragi may
have noticed something.

337
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,740
I see. Let her be for now.

338
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,540
If Rei or Shinji were to find
out the Eva's secrets,
