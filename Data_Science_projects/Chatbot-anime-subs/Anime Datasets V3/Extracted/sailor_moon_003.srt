1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,769
Even if we're preoccupied
by the spring weather,

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,638
playing with girls' dreams of love is
abominable! Abominable snowman!

3
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:17,311
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

6
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

8
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

9
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

10
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
I believe in it, miracle romance

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,483
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,348
I'm a Cancer. My blood type is O and
my birthstone is the pearl.

15
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:05,185
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

16
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,197
One day, a strange black cat
named Luna appeared

17
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,495
and made me into a sailor warrior.

18
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:15,796
But she wants me to fight bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:20,434
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:31,718
Mysterious Sleeping Illness, Protect
The Girls' Hearts In Love

21
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:39,825
Jadeite, what of the energy that
we are to give our great ruler?

22
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:44,328
Queen Beryl, please give us
a little more time.

23
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,467
Everything is going as planned.

24
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,570
Is that so? It had better
work this time.

25
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,968
Yes. We had some interruptions before,
but this time I am working

26
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:59,045
secretly with my minion Flowa.

27
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:05,685
Very well, it is all on your shoulders.

28
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:08,383
Keep that in mind.

29
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:09,955
Yes, my lady.

30
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:18,798
My old diary was full of you.

31
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:23,699
And my diary now is full of the past.

32
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:28,809
I want to see you. I want to
see you one more time.

33
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:33,213
I want to tell you my true feelings.

34
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,713
This was sent to us from Haruna
the Dreamer from Juubangai.

35
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:43,151
Haruna!

36
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,962
That's our teacher's name.

37
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:50,227
Nah. Can't be her.

38
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,829
We're sharing everyone's
love letters on this show.

39
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:56,305
For those whose letters are read,

40
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:59,934
we will send you a flower brooch
that makes love come true.

41
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,947
I want a flower brooch.

42
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:05,915
#10 Midnight Zero.
I want a flower brooch.

43
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:06,182
#10 Midnight Zero.

44
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,376
#10 Midnight Zero.
Usagi!

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,743
I want your love to blossom.

46
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,810
I'll be back tomorrow.

47
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,119
This is J-Dite.

48
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,758
Usagi!

49
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,627
I've never written a love letter before.

50
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,962
Usagi!

51
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:22,064
And there's the problem of
whom to write it to.

52
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,395
Usagi!

53
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,998
Oh! What?

54
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,869
You should probably go to bed.
You'll oversleep again.

55
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:36,042
Besides, you don't have time to
listen to late night radio.

56
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:40,349
You're a chosen warrior.
You have a very important mission.

57
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,374
Yeah, yeah! I know that!

58
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,616
I'm going to bed!

59
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:51,560
Is it a new modern disease?!
Mysterious sleeping
illness going around!

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,662
Is it a new modern disease?!
Mysterious sleeping
illness going around!

61
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:54,697
Is it a new modern disease?!
Mysterious sleeping
illness going around!
Once you've fallen asleep.

62
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,730
I want to get that and rest for a while.

63
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,870
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,065
We need you to work hard!

65
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,041
I'm just kidding.

66
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,545
If I were asleep I'd miss your
delicious cooking.

67
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,070
You're such a flatterer, Dear.

68
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,578
Oh, I'm totally late!

69
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,424
What?! Usagi's still here?

70
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:23,721
I forget.

71
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,123
Good morning! Good-bye!

72
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,865
What am I going to do?! The teacher's
going to yell at me again!

73
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,379
Naru, where's Ms. Haruna?

74
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,481
She doesn't seem to be here yet.

75
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,675
Lucky me!

76
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,716
It's unusual for Ms. Haruna to be late.

77
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,696
Let's see, I'll take roll call now.

78
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,472
Actually, today will be self study.

79
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:22,146
Just study whatever you want.

80
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,488
Today, I'm just...

81
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,625
So, so sleepy.

82
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:50,546
Usagi, what could be wrong
with Ms. Haruna?

83
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,673
Don't ask me. How would I know?

84
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,913
But I guess it's really lucky for me!

85
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:03,047
I hate it. Usagi never listens
to what I say.

86
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,028
She's probably being scolded
by the teacher right now.

87
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,427
Serves her right!

88
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,090
Hey!

89
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,094
We meet again, kitty.

90
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,868
I hope he didn't hear me talking.

91
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:18,263
You're not with Usagi today?

92
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,072
Oh, she's probably at school right now.

93
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,475
Looks like it was okay.

94
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,907
There, there, I'll get you some milk.
Wait just a minute.

95
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,716
I wish Usagi would treat me like this.

96
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,522
Oh, I wonder what it is?

97
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:49,727
I wonder what's wrong?

98
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,907
She won't wake up
no matter what we do.

99
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,744
Is it that exhausting to be a teacher?

100
00:07:55,744 --> 00:08:00,683
You know, I heard there's a disease
going around just like this,

101
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,514
where you don't ever wake up.

102
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:08,624
So you get to sleep forever! How nice.

103
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:08,957
Why?

104
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:09,992
Why?
Why?

105
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,391
Because...

106
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:14,228
You get to stay in your
dreams forever.

107
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:18,161
I bet that's a lot of fun.

108
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,399
Huh?!

109
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:23,331
You think so?

110
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:31,242
Mr. President, we got more letters
addressed to Midnight Zero.

111
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:36,118
Again? Why do we get so many
responses for a show that
doesn't even exist?

112
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,553
What should we do?

113
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,621
Never mind, just put it
away somewhere.

114
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,849
Good grief.

115
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,226
I'll take care of those.

116
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,694
Oh really? Thank you.

117
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,257
No problem.

118
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:59,435
Oh Naru, you listen to
Midnight Zero too?

119
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:04,145
Of course. I've sent them
many love letters.

120
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,671
Really? Written to whom?

121
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,784
It doesn't matter.

122
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,809
You can just write it to your
future boyfriend.

123
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,819
That's a good idea. I didn't think
of that. My future boyfriend.

124
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,887
Ouch!

125
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,164
I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention.

126
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,426
Usagi!

127
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:30,230
That's good. Apologizing
to the telephone pole.

128
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:37,238
But it may be a problem if the warm
weather is affecting your head.

129
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,082
What did you say?

130
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:44,319
Hey, do you know that guy?
He's gorgeous.

131
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,219
He is not!

132
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,390
He ticks me off.

133
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,090
All right.

134
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:55,297
Okay, I'm going to really get
this letter written.

135
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,533
Usagi, a love letter doesn't
really mean much

136
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,802
if you don't give it to
the person yourself.

137
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,870
Don't talk to me right now.

138
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,894
Okay. Okay.

139
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:05,899
Future boyfriend. Future boyfriend.

140
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,219
It's no use. I can't think of
anything to write.

141
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:24,193
I failed Japanese too.

142
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,295
That has nothing to do with it.

143
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,489
I know.

144
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:30,632
I'm going to go see Mr. J-Dite
from Midnight Zero

145
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:34,227
and ask him how I should write it!

146
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,104
What?

147
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,040
I've decided. Let's go, Luna!

148
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,337
Hey, wait!

149
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,532
What?

150
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,646
But this is FM 10 right?

151
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:49,384
Yes it is. But we don't have a show
called Midnight Zero.

152
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:49,785
What?

153
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:50,519
What?
Now go home.

154
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,253
Now go home.

155
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,584
That's weird.

156
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:56,918
That's strange.

157
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,995
Good evening, it's time
for Midnight Zero.

158
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,832
See. They do have it.

159
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,801
That guard lied.

160
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,876
It's still strange.

161
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:19,610
It says that it should be a different
program on FM 10 right now.

162
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:23,816
That must be wrong because it's on.

163
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,956
The first love letter we will read is
from Naru who lives in Jubangai.

164
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:30,851
Naru!

165
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,459
It's nice to believe in fate.

166
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,836
Good morning.

167
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:14,604
Good morning.
Good morning.

168
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:15,434
Good morning.

169
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,367
Wow!

170
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:20,843
That's the flower brooch?

171
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,743
Yeah, it arrived this morning.

172
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,281
Naru, hurry up and open it!

173
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:26,441
Okay!

174
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:28,751
Wow. It's so pretty.

175
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:32,455
Hey, that's the same as Ms. Haruna's.

176
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:33,717
Really?

177
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:36,255
So the letter that was from
the Haruna in love was...

178
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,454
The teacher's.

179
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,620
That's kind of strange.

180
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,890
Wow! How cute.

181
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,769
I'm...

182
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:53,898
awfully...

183
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,206
sleepy.

184
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,208
Naru!

185
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,151
Hey, what happened?

186
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:02,785
Naru! Naru!
Hey, what happened?

187
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:03,843
Naru! Naru!

188
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:16,232
Not Usagi too!

189
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:16,632
What's wrong with you, Usagi?
Not Usagi too!

190
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:17,133
What's wrong with you, Usagi?

191
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,201
What's wrong with you, Usagi?
Get a hold of yourself, Usagi!

192
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,031
Get a hold of yourself, Usagi!

193
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,536
Oh, that's...

194
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,218
Tuxedo Mask.

195
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:42,716
Tuxedo Mask, could it be that you're...

196
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:47,619
my future boyfriend?

197
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,989
I can't believe I said it.

198
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,599
It seems that way.

199
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,630
Oh my God! Yay! I'm so happy!

200
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,242
Oh, Tuxedo Mask, if you are my
boyfriend, show me your face.

201
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,542
With pleasure.

202
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,121
Usagi!

203
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,588
Oh good, you're awake!

204
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,065
Naru!

205
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,158
Usagi, this is a case.

206
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:28,771
There must be something going on
at that radio station.

207
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,965
Yeah!

208
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,039
We've gathered quite a bit now.

209
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,708
It seems the experiment
was a success.

210
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:45,688
Flowa, I never thought
that young women

211
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:48,782
with dreams of love would have
so much energy.

212
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:55,428
The flower brooch puts girls to sleep
and absorbs their dreams of love.

213
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,967
This brooch that you created
is very useful.

214
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,431
It's about time for Midnight Zero.

215
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,134
Hey Luna. How are we
going to sneak in?

216
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,810
The guard is going to stop us again.

217
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,512
Don't worry.

218
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,543
What's this?

219
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,549
Use this pen.

220
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:28,231
Huh? What's this pretty pen?

221
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,256
This is your new item.

222
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:34,127
If you use that, you can disguise
yourself as different people.

223
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:37,673
Really? How does it work?

224
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:40,801
Just yell, "Moon Power!"

225
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,977
"Moon Power." Right, okay.

226
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,612
Moon Power, make me into
a beautiful newscaster!

227
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,532
Yay, I've transformed!

228
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:11,266
Did you have to add the
"beautiful" part?

229
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,707
Okay, Luna, we're going.

230
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:21,449
Got the attitude down.

231
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,822
I knew it!

232
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:30,053
Good evening, it's time
for Midnight Zero.

233
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,796
So that's Mr. J-Dite? He's so cool!

234
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:38,768
What are you saying? He's the enemy!

235
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,133
Are you sure?

236
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:43,539
Oh! He's been taking over
the program.

237
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,336
You're right! All right!

238
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,681
Wait a minute!

239
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,148
Our first letter today...

240
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:59,418
Sorry to interrupt your program but
this is an emergency news flash.

241
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,525
We have learned that the
flower brooches

242
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:05,695
that have been sent from this
show are very dangerous.

243
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:06,729
What?!

244
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,498
Do not touch them if they
are sent to you!

245
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:10,600
What are you saying?

246
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,900
Everyone, think about it.
What are you saying?

247
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,835
Everyone, think about it.

248
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:17,006
A love letter means nothing if you
don't give it to the person yourself.

249
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:18,303
Wake up from your dreams.

250
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,368
Hey, that's my line.

251
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:24,012
Who are you?!

252
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,445
Usagi!

253
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,594
Don't think you'll get away with this!

254
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:40,560
It's a monster!

255
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:42,359
You're kidding me!

256
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,069
Usagi, now's the time.

257
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,304
Okay!

258
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:51,740
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

259
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:26,640
Sailor warrior of love and justice,
Sailor Moon!

260
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:36,719
Trying to ruin girls' dreams of love is
abominable! Abominable snowman!

261
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,754
Did you need to tack on
"abominable snowman"?

262
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,122
Oh yeah!

263
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,316
Anyway!

264
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:45,559
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

265
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:49,362
You're the one who keeps
interfering with us.

266
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,723
Then you must be their boss.

267
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,037
My name is Jadeite.

268
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,831
Sailor Moon! En guard!

269
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,313
You won't get away!

270
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,821
This is where you die!

271
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,424
Go away!

272
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:21,960
Die!

273
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,103
Sailor Moon, use the
Moon Tiara Action!

274
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,197
Moon Tiara Action!

275
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,376
Where are you aiming?

276
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:49,886
Jadeite!

277
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,160
What? You want to fight me now?

278
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:56,590
Moon Tiara Action!

279
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:03,801
No! You're kidding me!

280
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,311
Take that!

281
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,717
Watch out!

282
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,754
That hurts!

283
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,894
This is Tuxedo Mask.

284
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,197
Good-bye. We'll meet again.

285
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,766
Tuxedo Mask.

286
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,276
Huh?!

287
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:25,276
My dear Tuxedo Mask,

288
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:30,091
from the first day I met you, I've...

289
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,784
Are you still doing that?

290
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,257
Midnight Zero is over.

291
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,598
It doesn't matter, I'm giving this
to him myself. Give it back!

292
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,238
Really? Then I'll read it for you.

293
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:43,739
Ahh! Don't!

294
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:48,611
Good morning. I'm sorry to have
worried you, but I'm much better now.

295
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,180
I'm refreshed. Let's all study hard.

296
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,114
Give me back my love letter.
I'm refreshed. Let's all study hard.

297
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,082
Give me back my love letter.

298
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:53,816
Give me back my love letter.
Love letter?

299
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:54,583
Love letter?

300
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,653
Wait a second...
Let me read it too.

301
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,018
Miss Tsukino.

302
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,212
No!

303
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:12,724
In my dream, you and I were together

304
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:19,636
Protected by the stars

305
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:34,854
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

306
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:41,924
And we casually talked to each other

307
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:50,703
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

308
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:57,740
I want to become prettier
right here and now

309
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:05,276
Something changes when
you fall in love

310
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:11,822
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

311
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:25,741
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
