1
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:15,346
Since I was little, I was always the center of attention in class.
I was good at studying and sports.
I was confident.

2
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:18,683
I was usually first at everything.

3
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,182
Amazing, Miyazawa!
You're the best in the class!

4
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:23,459
You're really something!

5
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:25,158
And you're so good at studying too...

6
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:29,321
Miyazawa Yukino, whom I met
in high school, easily surpassed me...

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,099
...and immediately captured the other girls' attention.

8
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:38,039
The girls in class hate me...

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,872
Shibahime hates me...

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,870
The Ostracization Index has really taken off lately.

11
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:57,587
But I stuck it out.

12
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:01,725
Iwata... Ishida... Ezumi...

13
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,095
What?  You can't even solve this problem?

14
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,563
Come on now.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,000
Splendid, as always.

16
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,570
Try to learn from Miyazawa's example, everyone.

17
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,378
Luckily, my past daily efforts have made
me strong enough to stand on my own...

18
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,644
...instead of having to become
servile for need of their friendship.

19
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:19,805
Miyazawa...

20
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:20,715
Yes?

21
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:23,548
Well...there's something that's been bothering me.

22
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:27,388
It felt like the atmosphere in the classroom
just now was somehow strange.

23
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:32,992
If it's not just my imagination,
is something going on?

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,796
Has my calling you to the Student Guidance Room...

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,324
...somehow made things uncomfortable for you?

26
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:40,393
I'm fine.

27
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:43,362
Things actually aren't going as smoothly
with the other girls as they could be...

29
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,899
...but it's not because of that.

30
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,400
But isn't that rather difficult for you?  I could...

31
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:51,142
I'll be all right. If I can't deal
with something like this myself...

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,107
...I won't be able to succeed out in the real world.

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,413
I'm fine.

34
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,147
She's strong.

35
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:01,088
Although it saddens me as a teacher
that I'm not depended upon...

37
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:02,715
To be sure...

38
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,727
...I don't plan on resigning myself
to the present state of things.

39
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:11,133
First of all, I don't like the idea of hurting
people through ignoring them as a group.

41
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,031
I don't like it at all.

42
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:16,498
If I don't like it, I would never give in...
...and that's why I don't want to ask anyone for help.

45
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:21,841
Oh, Arima, you surprised me. What's up?

47
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:23,775
Something seemed wrong, just now.

48
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:26,577
Miyazawa, are you having a
problem with the other girls?

49
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:29,311
What?  Um, well...

50
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:36,659
Well, maybe the girls
are ignoring me a little.

52
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,863
What?!  What's this all about?

54
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,695
Well...
you know...

55
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,359
Why didn't you tell me?!

56
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,101
I haven't heard a thing about it!

57
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:48,000
Where are you going ?

58
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:51,097
I'm going to have a word with
the girls and make them stop.

60
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:52,634
Hey, that's none of your business!

61
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:53,803
None of my business?!

62
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:54,801
There's no point in that.

63
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,838
One of the reasons they don't
like me is because we're friends.

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,214
You would only make things worse.

65
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:00,310
What?

66
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:01,548
This is my problem.

67
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,676
Butt out.

68
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:03,710
That's ridiculous.

69
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:08,500
It's not ridiculous!
Anyways, you don't have to do anything.

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,050
Just stay out of it.

71
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,820
This is unusual.

72
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:13,421
You guys fighting or something?

73
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,324
He's seriously pissed.

74
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,725
He's hopeless.

75
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,066
Of course, I probably shouldn't
have put it that way either...

76
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:26,404
Oh, I know!  Miyazawa,
I'll show you something cool.

78
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:27,298
It's my treasure!

79
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,008
What?

80
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,638
This is SO cute!
Check it out.

81
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,477
Hey, you moron!

82
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:33,076
Ooohh...

83
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,144
Cute, isn't it?

84
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,175
Hideaki!

85
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,176
I gave it to you because you said
you'd treasure it and never show anyone!

86
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm never trusting you again!

87
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:45,792
Men...

88
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,362
I want this.

89
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,433
No, you can't!

90
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:55,427
No no no no!  That's MY treasure! Gross!

92
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,470
That's disgusting!

94
00:03:57,940  --> 00:04:00,105
How can you use a dirty trick like that?

95
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,268
My treasure...

96
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:04,711
Hey, what's wrong with that?

97
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:05,842
She put it there...

98
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,605
Where any guy dumb enough to reach for
it would get kicked out of school.

100
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,418
In return, I'll give you an adorable
picture of me when I was little.

102
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,948
Oh yeah?

103
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,257
Well, I've got one, too!

105
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:28,025
Say, are you still mad about that?

107
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,366
It's not that I don't count on you.

108
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:33,166
I just want to solve this one myself.

110
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:35,540
I think it's something I have to do myself.

111
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,104
No, I was wrong.

112
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,442
I shouldn't have gotten mad.

113
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:43,952
After all, you're the one who's having trouble.

114
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,388
Do whatever you feel is right.

115
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,019
I'll always be on your side.

116
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,290
And I'm not going anywhere, no matter what.

117
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:55,795
Thanks. By the way, are you doing okay?

118
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:58,092
Yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,669
The captain of the kendo club looks after me...

121
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:04,768
...and he has a lot of pull with
the other sports club captains.

123
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,569
So with a backbone like that,

124
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:08,940
none of the other guys would do anything to me.

125
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,838
Guys are weird...

126
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,115
Hiiyyyyaa!

127
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,083
Nice kick.

128
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:23,321
But you can't take me down yet.

129
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:24,351
Shut up!

130
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,694
Mind your own business!

131
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,864
Their street fight just keeps going and going.

133
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,394
Yeah. Tsubasa's moves are getting
more sophisticated every day.

134
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:38,105
But Miyazawa must also have some hidden
talent if she can consistently dodge like that.

135
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,465
Hey, you two, we're thirsty!

136
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,376
Let's go get some juice at the cafeteria!

137
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:44,112
Miyazawa, come with us.

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,740
What?  Me?

139
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,143
Sure, come on.

140
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,876
Hey, what do you think you're doing ?

142
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,019
I hope you haven't forgotten why we're fighting!

144
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,257
You're street fighting, right?

145
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,089
To see who comes out on top.

146
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,784
Right?

147
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:02,453
I thought you'd be harder to approach, Miyazawa.

149
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:05,729
But once I actually started talking
to you, I felt more at ease.

150
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:06,693
Yeah.

151
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:08,797
This is how I really am.

152
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:10,737
I was making myself up that way.

153
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,672
I wanted to make myself look good...

154
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:14,699
Or maybe to be seen as being good.

156
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:19,439
Do you know... I get a thrill when someone praises me.

158
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,375
R...really ?

159
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:24,309
So I was just making myself up the whole time.

161
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:29,158
But a lifestyle where you worry about
what other people think of you is pretty stupid.

163
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:30,455
In fact, I didn't have a single friend.

164
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:32,651
I realized that when I met Arima.

165
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,263
So I decided to stop that kind of thing.

166
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:36,728
No friends...?

167
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,094
I've noticed that you're always alone lately, 

169
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:41,333
but could it be...

170
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,759
Yeah, stuff happened.

171
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,733
That must be pretty tough.

172
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,937
It can't be helped. I'm reaping what I sowed.

173
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,875
The least I can do is take responsibility.

174
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,612
Augh!  I hate that kind of thing!

175
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:54,640
Group harassment gets on my nerves!

176
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,950
There goes the straightforward
mentality stereotypical of athletic types.

177
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,377
I gotcha. From now on you're "Yukinon."

178
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:00,546
Huh ?

179
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:04,120
As of today, you're our friend,
part of our group. Okay, Yukinon?

181
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:06,722
Well um..."Yukinon..."

182
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:07,892
I'm Sakura Tsubaki,

183
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,288
the hope of the girls' volleyball club.

184
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,499
This is Sena Rika. She's really dexterous

185
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:12,459
and very feminine.

186
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:14,130
And this is Sawada Aya. She's very artsy and

187
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,969
can dispassionately hit people's weak spots.

188
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,372
Nice to meet you.

189
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,570
Thanks. But...um...

190
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,572
Do whatever you want.

191
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:23,969
I'll fight by myself.

192
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,238
So she'll act on her own.

193
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,546
Now we've got a powerful ally
when it comes to test-time!

195
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:29,781
Hooray!

196
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:33,985
Hey, Yukinon.

197
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:35,423
Come on, can't it just be "Yukino."

198
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,554
Was Miyazawa friends with girls from 1-D?

199
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,362
Isn't that Sakura Tsubaki?

200
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:41,795
Their class is in a different building,
so I don't know her too well...

201
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,061
...but she's pretty popular
among the girls over there.

203
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,695
Miyazawa really does stand out...

204
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:48,967
I told you that's how she does it!

205
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,201
Don't you get it yet?!

206
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:57,001
Every time...
It's always Miyazawa who gets it all.

208
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,845
Why?! She's such a lying bitch...

209
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,249
But there's something...

210
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:03,480
What is it, Sawada?

211
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:07,088
They're making such a unified front
you can't do a single thing about it, right?

213
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,022
To be that organized, there's got to be a ringleader.

214
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:12,252
Someone smart, who's good at manipulating the class.

216
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:13,926
A ringleader...

217
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,772
What? Now that this class has
nothing to do with you...

218
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:30,938
...you're hanging out with girls from other classes?

219
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,040
You're always so good at it.

220
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,049
It's easy for you to deceive people, isn't it?

222
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,611
I'd like to know how you did it this time.

223
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,118
The ringleader.

224
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,955
I haven't done anything, really.

225
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,587
Really?  That's a switch. You're
not going to play innocent anymore?

226
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,654
This is the ringleader. If I lose here,

227
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,358
nothing's ever going to get solved.

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,262
What a waste!

229
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,033
You were so good at deceiving people.

230
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,561
You were having a great time, weren't you?

231
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,428
You don't have to hold back just because we all know.

232
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,636
You should keep it up.

233
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,703
M...Maho...

234
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:01,737
Come on.

235
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,445
I can see why you don't like me.

236
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,709
It's true that I'd been cheating like that.

237
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,115
It was inexcusable.

238
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,184
I can't blame you.

239
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:12,478
But then,

240
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:16,724
why do you try to become superior
by getting people on your side?

242
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,925
I may have used a dirty trick, but so are you.

243
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:21,954
If you don't like me,
you should just say it to my face.

244
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,431
Can't you even express your opinions face to face?

245
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,433
I was at fault, 

246
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:28,301
but I'm not a big enough sucker
to let things go this far.

247
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:33,403
You feel confident, don't you?
With the whole class on your side,
I bet you think you've won.

250
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,333
Well, good for you. Happy now ?

251
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,745
You should have done that in the first place.

252
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,113
Maho!

253
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,057
I couldn't win either with academics or running...

254
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,256
Maho, you're all subdued these days.

255
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:54,356
It's not like you.

256
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,560
Yeah, you gotta do things with style.

257
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,532
No. It's no use anymore.

258
00:09:58,934 --> 00:09:59,958
No matter what I do, I can't win.

259
00:10:00,836 --> 00:10:02,360
This hopeless feeling of defeat...

260
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:13,610
I'm the only one allowed

261
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:14,845
to pick on Miyazawa.

262
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:16,443
Stay the hell out of my way.

264
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:19,646
I can't be totally ruthless if I feel I have to hold back.

265
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:29,395
No one could understand.

266
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,824
Nobody can understand a goddamn thing!

267
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,229
It's so boring these days.

268
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,035
I never thought I'd be using the
ignoring treatment in high school.

269
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,932
Yeah...

270
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:43,869
After seeing that faceoff between
Miyazawa and Maho yesterday...

271
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:47,983
It makes me not want to be
caught up in this mess anymore.

272
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:48,972
It's all just because

273
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:50,409
Maho doesn't like Miyazawa.

274
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,081
Say, don't you think something's weird?

275
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,078
What?

276
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,313
I mean, with that faceoff yesterday.

277
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,780
It's true that Miyazawa

278
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:58,784
had been playing innocent and fooling us...

279
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,028
...but I can't see her as someone
making herself look elegant...

280
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,458
...just to hit on guys, Like Maho said.

282
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:06,832
What?

283
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:08,066
But her attitude changed...

284
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,164
...after she got to know Arima and Asaba.

285
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,439
That's true. But think about it...

286
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:17,471
...Maho said that we started seeing cracks
because she hooked up with a hunk.

289
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:19,307
But I wonder,

290
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:21,046
would someone as smart as

291
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,144
she is really make such a careless mistake?

292
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:24,986
Now that you mention it...

293
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,285
That may be true.

294
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,319
Miyazawa WAS smart;

295
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,922
she was really thorough in her act.

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,323
Losing it just because of a guy...

299
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,688
Doesn't make much sense.

300
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,894
Come to think of it...

301
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:40,666
...didn't she admit that she had been
playing innocent in yesterday's argument?

303
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:44,298
Could it be that she had quit the acting on her own?

305
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,401
Then what was that "hitting on guys" about, then?

306
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,567
Why would Maho lie like that?

307
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,272
You could think of it this way.

308
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,508
Maho wanted to crush Miyazawa.

309
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:56,712
There's only one way to trap her
and exclude her from class.

312
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:01,147
All the girls in class are jealous
of how Miyazawa is friends
with Arima and Asaba.

314
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,320
If she used that...

315
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,983
Ah...

316
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:07,186
Maho, we don't know why you

317
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:08,930
want to crush Miyazawa so badly...

318
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,956
...but we can't forgive how you used us.

319
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,196
We can't trust you anymore.

321
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:16,165
We don't want things to get any more stupid,
so we're not going to ignore you or anything.

322
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:17,400
But

323
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,501
nobody's going to do what you say anymore.

324
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,569
If you want it that badly, do it yourself.

325
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:23,374
That's our opinion.

326
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:26,940
M...Maho!

327
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,907
You three better get going, too.

329
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:33,077
This is it for me. Nothing good
will come of being with me anymore.

330
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:35,580
Um, well then...

331
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,255
Sorry.

332
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:40,886
I never thought any of it would work.

333
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,260
I knew this would happen from the start.

334
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,397
There was a time when I was the center of attention...

335
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,358
...and I could believe

336
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:48,997
I was better than others.

337
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,439
But that was nothing but
the conceited thoughts of someone

338
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,068
Living in a small world.

339
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,670
I found out for the first time that there
are any number of people better than me...

340
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:57,910
...after I met Miyazawa.

341
00:12:58,247 --> 00:12:59,043

342
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:04,182
There's nothing more miserable
than having someone better than you occupy
the position where you used to stand.

345
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,985
I didn't even want to look at her.

346
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:07,754
But my mind was always occupied
with thoughts of Miyazawa...

347
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:10,455
My eyes would unconsciously
follow wherever she went.

348
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,919
My obsession with Miyazawa

349
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,624
was almost like intense love.

350
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,155
That's why I think I was the only one who noticed it.

351
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,025
It was all an act!

352
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,662
How could any of them
understand my mortification?

353
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,763
She took everything from me.

354
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:25,334
She even obtains love, and now
she tries to become honest?

356
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:29,440
I'll crush you, too
just like I'm being crushed!

358
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,973
But that's all over now.

359
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:39,146
I have to stop being
so foolishly obstinate.

361
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:45,923
Ah, what nice weather.

362
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,387
The summer sun sure is bright.

363
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,926
Yesterday was a big mistake.

364
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,458
I let my full fighting instincts take control.

365
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,627
Oh well, it made me feel better.

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,639
He's so cute!

367
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,439
Besides, I've got this now.

368
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:02,809
As long as I've got this,

369
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,076
my heart will be as clear as the blue skies of May.

370
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,477
Where'd you come from ?!

371
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,574
*Stare.*

372
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,545
No, you can't have this.

373
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:15,351
Besides, I put it in my mouth
and in my bra once already.

374
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,000
Damn.

375
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:20,859
What's with her?

376
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,994
Well, I don't hate her.

377
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,997
I hope we can be friends.

378
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:28,331
Hey, Shibahime.

379
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:29,294
Arima.

380
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:30,868
You doing okay?

381
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:38,210
You haven't done anything mean to
Miyazawa since then, have you?

383
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:39,441
Try to get along with her.

384
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,074
She's the girl I love.

385
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,453
Huh?

386
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,593
What's wrong?

387
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,487
My train pass holder's gone. It's not in my bag.

388
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,327
Did I leave it in class ?

389
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,630
Maybe you dropped it?

390
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:01,266
WHAT'LL I DO?!

391
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:02,362
W...what?

392
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,564
So what's the matter?

393
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,865
I have your picture in there.

394
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:10,407
Man, I was determined never to lose
it because it would be so embarassing.

396
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,278
I don't have time to be doing this.

397
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,613
I'll go look for it.

398
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,480
This is weird, I just had it. Maybe in the hall...?

399
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,249
Maybe when I was talking to Shibahime...

400
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,022
It couldn't be...

401
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,325
Over there is...

402
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,095
...the incinerator.

403
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,630
She wouldn't, even if she hates me.

404
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,285
Got it?  When we see Miyazawa,

405
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,312
we're all going to say we're sorry as a group.

406
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,551
She'll forgive us if we apologize, won't she?

407
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,649
Oh, Miyazawa.

408
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,700
HOLD IT!

409
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,307
Ow!

410
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,141
You made me mad!

411
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,846
You really pissed me off!

412
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:29,552
I'll show you just how scary
it can be when I'm mad!

414
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,186
Even if I don't have friends anymore, 

415
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:33,618
I feel all the more free.

416
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:44,463
Quit scurrying around!
YELL!  SCREAM!  CRY OUT IN TERROR!

417
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:53,513
Tsubaki!  Rika, Aya, s...save me!

418
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,017
Save you ? From what ?

419
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,821
I don't want to be involved...

420
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:05,819
You did something stupid again, didn't you?

422
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,220
Maybe it'll be good for you
to seriously get it for once.

423
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,023
You traitors!

424
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,594
There's no help for the wicked.

425
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:29,378
How foolish.
Think you can get away?

426
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,121
That doesn't make it alright!

427
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,619
What's all the racket down there?

428
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:39,957
My train pass isn't here...

429
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,091
Hey, isn't that Miyazawa?

430
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,004
That was a pretty vicious thing to do.

431
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,633
You always picked a fight with me one on one.

432
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,144
I thought you were different from the others.

433
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:59,011
But I guess I was wrong. You're the worst.

434
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:00,576
Miyazawa...

435
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,075
I know you like Arima,

436
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,745
so I thought you couldn't help hating me.

437
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:04,641
Huh?

438
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:05,985
But if you would go this far,

439
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:07,286
why don't you just tell him already?!

440
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:08,688
You can't even do that!

441
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,489
You're just a coward!

442
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,121
I did try to tell him!

443
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:15,257
But he never even noticed!

445
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:20,299
The first time was in seventh
grade on Valentine's Day. Arima!

446
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,859
Oh, Shibahime.

447
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,699
Shibahime, you like sweet stuff.

448
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,931
I don't like chocolate, so you can have it all.

450
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,739
In eighth grade, at the Athletics Festival...

451
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,472
*I'll be waiting at the front gate. Tsubasa.*

452
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,076
Shibahime, great timing!  Come with me!

453
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:36,884
Thanks goodness.

454
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,286
The beanbags from the beanbag toss got scattered...

455
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,380
...and I needed extra hands to clean up.

456
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:41,652
So, what did you want?

457
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,317
So insensitive...

458
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,693
I really had no idea about those things...

459
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,559
On our ninth grade field trip, too.

460
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,395
Arima...

461
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,359
Shibahime, get the barf bag quick!

462
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,360
Get some newspaper!

463
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:59,400
But even so, he never accepted anyone's love,
so I thought he just didn't want to date!

465
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:03,906
So I didn't mind not being noticed
as long as I could be special,
even if I were treated as a little sister!

469
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:09,106
I studied 13 hours a day to get into this school
so I could be with him as much as possible!

470
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:10,740
So why?!

472
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,685
Why'd he have to get a girlfriend
right after starting high school?!

473
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:14,851
It was so frustrating!

474
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,621
I can't help hating you 

475
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,921
I wanted to be you.

476
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:23,495
To be noticed, to be cared about,
to be the most important person
in the world to him!

479
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:24,856
I envied you!

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,292
I couldn't help being jealous!

481
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:29,762
He never notices me...

482
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,030
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,435
From that day onward,
things took a turn for the better.

484
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:39,602
We're sorry.

485
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,373
For some reason the girls in class all apologized,
*Don't make such a big deal, I'm fine...*

487
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:44,443
and I was accepted back into the class.

488
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,620
But I wonder why they seemed kind of afraid of me.

490
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:48,953
She's scary when she snaps.

491
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,416
Thank God she didn't get mad at us.

493
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,654
Better yet, I made my first real friends.

494
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,124
Hey, Tsubasa...

495
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes!

496
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,656
You...
You actually like Miyazawa a lot, don't you?

498
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,463
Not a chance!

499
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,576
What, are you going to pity me?

500
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,781
If you don't mind your own business,
I'll punch you out.

501
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:22,183
Well, I was going to pity you.

502
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,385
Your tactics need some work.

503
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,724
You couldn't hide the fact
that you were the ringleader.

504
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,795
When you entrap someone,
you have to be more devious about it.

505
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,292
I'm sure I could do a much better job.

506
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,828
You're a REAL pain!

507
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,575
Before we knew it,

508
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,945
summer vacation was almost upon us.

509
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,439
That long first semester

510
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,179
was about to be over.

511
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,714
What'll happen next!

512
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:14,315
The girls stopped ignoring Sis and

513
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:15,885
she made up with everyone in class.

514
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,123
And the really long,

515
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:18,255
Roller-coaster first semester was finally coming to a close

516
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:21,330
The time for her debut
into the world of friends has come at last!

518
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,288
Next time on KareKano:

519
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,591
"At the Beginning of Summer Vacation."
