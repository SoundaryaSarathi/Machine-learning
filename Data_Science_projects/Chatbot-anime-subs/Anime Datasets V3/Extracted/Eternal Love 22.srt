<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,960
The report says
the Scarlet Flame Golden Lion

4
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,743
appeared in
the Far North rebel army camp.

5
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,639
The Scarlet Flame Golden Lion?

6
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,599
Ye Hua, I am very disappointed in you.

7
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,719
I asked Lord Yuan Shi
of the Realm of Supreme Purity

8
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,840
in the Great Overarching Heaven

9
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
to take you as his last disciple.

10
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
The Lord had enlightened only one other
disciple, the Lord of Numinous Treasures.

11
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,479
He has stringent requirements
for accepting a disciple.

12
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,960
Yet, he did not say a word,
and accepted you as his last disciple.

13
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,120
How happy I was.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,360
Later on, you ascended to high immortal
in less than 20,000 years

15
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,439
showing all the people of the world
that you are not Mo Yuan's substitute.

16
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,080
You finally earned the respect.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,439
Crown Prince Ye Hua
surpassed High God Mo Yuan.

18
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,840
But ever since you went to the
Mortal Realm to subdue the Golden Lion...

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,759
everything you have done
has disappointed me again and again!

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,039
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

21
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,800
Please give me a chance to redeem myself.

22
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,240
Allow me to lead the army
to the Far North rebellion.

23
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,879
Ye Hua, do not concern yourself
with love affairs.

24
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
In the war with the Mermaid Clan,
you were no match for the Mermaid King

25
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,639
and you failed to subdue the Golden Lion.

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,199
The Far North rebellion
is your last chance.

27
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,599
And although you are the heir apparent

28
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,159
and are usually addressed by others
as the Crown Prince

29
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,719
you have yet to be granted
the Crown Prince seal

30
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,520
and have not yet received the allegiance
of the vassals of the four seas.

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,759
I understand.

32
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,919
I will return victorious.

33
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,279
Should there be any more mishaps

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,480
not only you, but the entire Xiwu Palace

35
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,600
will suffer punishment.

36
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,079
Yes.

37
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,800
Your Highness, wait here.

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,480
I sent someone to fetch
a bowl of tonic from the kitchen.

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,600
When it gets here, you can
personally deliver it to Zichen Hall.

40
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,879
His Highness will surely be pleased.

41
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,480
But...

42
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,000
Didn't Ye Hua previously

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,399
forbid everyone in the
Hall of Beautiful Youth from going out?

44
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,240
Would it not be bad for me
to walk around?

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
The Crown Prince said not
to step foot outside of Xiwu Palace.

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,199
Your Highness would just be
delivering the tonic within the palace.

47
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,639
His Highness will not scold you.

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,000
All right then. Thank you, Nai Nai.

49
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,720
I was brought here by the Crown Prince
to serve Your Highness.

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,399
There is no need to thank me.

51
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,399
I'll be going now.

52
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,439
You will go as well.

53
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,519
Me?

54
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,839
Father, I am not one to lead an army.

55
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,279
When pacifying the Mermaid Clan,
didn't you take over for Ye Hua

56
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,160
and thoroughly eliminated the rebel army?

57
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
That is correct, Father.

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,158
However, it was because
Ye Hua tempered justice with mercy

59
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:50,305
and won the support of
the various clan leaders.

60
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:53,439
He had also set military tactics.
That's why I could defeat the rebel army.

61
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,040
Do you want to defy my order?

62
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,680
I dare not.

63
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,360
And also...

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,439
The lady in your palace
says someone framed her.

65
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,800
Tell me. Should I give her a response?

66
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,399
She does not know any better.

67
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,399
I have already ordered that she
be confined in Xiwu Palace

68
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,879
as a form of discipline.

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,439
I actually think this matter
ought to be thoroughly investigated.

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Tonight, I will change out
all the palace maids of Xiwu Palace

71
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,480
and send them to Lord Pu Hua
for interrogation.

72
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Change out the palace maids?

73
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,120
Father is thinking of your safety.

74
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,399
If anything happens in the palace...

75
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,240
Today, it is an attack on someone
in your Hall of Beautiful Youth

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,879
but tomorrow, it could be
poison in your tea.

77
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,800
It is best to
investigate this thoroughly.

78
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,439
All right, it is decided.

79
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,519
The two of you will wait here.

80
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,800
In a little while, the clan leaders
and Ghost Lord Li Jing will be here

81
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,079
to discuss military affairs
regarding the Far North rebellion.

82
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,399
- Yes.
- Yes.

83
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,079
Father is using this incident

84
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,879
to remove all your loyal palace maids
from Xiwu Palace.

85
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,839
You must be even more
careful now, Ye Hua.

86
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,639
Greetings to Crown Prince
and Third Prince.

87
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
Where is the Heavenly Lord?

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,800
The Heavenly Lord has ordered me to lead
the troops to the Far North rebellion.

89
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,120
Since it is my brother
who caused this upheaval

90
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,439
I am willing to lead my troops and
follow Your Highness to the rebellion.

91
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,120
You?

92
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,759
What is the matter?
Does Your Highness doubt my loyalty?

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,759
Although you are from the Ghost Realm

94
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,079
you have a vested interest in
the Celestial Tribe's affairs.

95
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,439
I am not afraid you will be disloyal.

96
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,199
However, are the men under you

97
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,319
truly willing to come with us to
eliminate their Eldest Prince, Li Yuan?

98
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,720
It is only reasonable for Your Highness
to have such apprehensions.

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,879
I have already been
the Ghost Lord for 70,000 years.

100
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,600
The soldiers who used to view
the Celestial Tribe as their enemy

101
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,959
have already been removed.

102
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,079
Moreover, I have selfish reasons
for leading my troops.

103
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,360
Selfish reasons?

104
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,759
Your Highness was injured
by the Mermaid Clan.

105
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,600
No matter what, the Mermaid Clan
was a part of the Ghost Tribe.

106
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,600
I want to use this chance to assist
Your Highness in pacifying the Far North

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,559
so that Your Highness can pardon me
for the battle at Chang Sea.

108
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,279
Since the Mermaid Clan
has been annihilated

109
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,639
I hope they will not further implicate
the Ghost Realm.

110
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,159
That is my selfish motive.

111
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,879
All right. I give you my promise.

112
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,600
As long as you provide outstanding
military service in the Far North

113
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,039
then I will no longer pursue

114
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,423
the Ghost Realm's relationship
to the Mermaid Clan.

115
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,240
- That's settled then.
- That's settled then.

116
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,559
I just asked the maids of Zichen Hall.

117
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,879
The Crown Prince is
currently at Zichen Hall.

118
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,634
I heard he's leaving
the palace tonight.

119
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:37,759
Go quickly, Your Highness.
If you delay, it will get cold.

120
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,360
<i>Ye Hua.</i>

121
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,720
<i>This voice is Consort Su Jin.</i>

122
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,159
I plead for leniency on her behalf.

123
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,159
Why do you still not understand?

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,559
If not because she is carrying your child

125
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,480
why would your mother barge into
the Grand Hall to beg for forgiveness?

126
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,919
And why would I risk my life
to protect her?

127
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,159
<i>I know you married a mortal...</i>

128
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,120
<i>to get back at me</i>

129
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
<i>for betraying you by
marrying the Heavenly Lord.</i>

130
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,360
But what could I do?

131
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,600
What could I do?

132
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,279
Of all the women in the world

133
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,879
who can ward off
the Heavenly Lord's favor?

134
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,600
<i>Tell me, Ye Hua.</i>

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
<i>You still love me, don't you?</i>

136
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,360
<i>You call her Su Su</i>

137
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,240
only because... because there is
also a "Su" in my name, right?

138
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,919
<i>Ye Hua, how come you can't understand?</i>

139
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,639
<i>My affections for you
far surpass those of the mortal's.</i>

140
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,039
Your Highness is back so soon?

141
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,000
Why are you crying?

142
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,519
I'm fine now.

143
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,679
I am a bit tired. I'd like to rest.

144
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,399
You may go.

145
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,080
Ye Hua, why are you here?

146
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,320
What is it? Is something the matter?

147
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Give me the copper mirror.

148
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,240
Copper mirror? What copper mirror?

149
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,120
I remember.

150
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,120
You must be speaking of
the copper mirror you dropped

151
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,303
during the war against the Mermaid Clan.

152
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,360
I have been keeping it for you
but I had forgotten about it.

153
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

154
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,279
<i>Tonight, I will change out
all the palace maids of Xiwu Palace</i>

155
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,720
<i>and send them to Lord Pu Hua
for interrogation.</i>

156
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
<i>Father is using this incident</i>

157
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,720
<i>to remove all your loyal palace maids
from Xiwu Palace.</i>

158
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,159
<i>You must be
even more careful now, Ye Hua.</i>

159
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,559
<i>You call her Su Su</i>

160
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:21,120
<i>only because... because there is
also a "Su" in my name, right?</i>

161
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,440
What is wrong?

162
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,840
Did something happen? You can tell me.

163
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,519
What did you come here for?

164
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,039
I have to go defend
the Far North for half a year.

165
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,080
You'll be gone again for half a year?

166
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,320
At least half a year.

167
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,159
But we can do what we did before

168
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,159
and use the copper mirror to communicate.

169
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,559
If anything happens
or if you want to talk to me

170
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,679
you can tell me
through the copper mirror.

171
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,240
Take care of yourself.

172
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
I feel a bit unwell. I won't be
getting out of bed to see you out.

173
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
You feel unwell?

174
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
What are you thinking of doing?

175
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,639
I... I just want to take a look.

176
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,639
There is nothing to see.
You should go.

177
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,880
I will be personally leading troops
to the Far North.

178
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,039
Who is willing to follow me

179
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,839
to capture the rebel, Li Yuan?

180
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,960
What is the matter?

181
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,839
I have so many strong men
in the Ghost Realm.

182
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,480
Is nobody willing to go to the Far North?

183
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,279
Your Majesty.

184
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,880
We are not afraid of going to war.

185
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,839
It is just that it is the Ghost Realm's
Eldest Prince rebelling in the Far North

186
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,119
and he is rebelling in the name of
vengeance for the former Ghost Lord.

187
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:23,319
If... If we send our troops to help
the Celestial Tribe suppress them

188
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm afraid it will be
against popular sentiment.

189
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,599
Yes, Your Majesty. The former
Ghost Lord had much support.

190
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,000
Later on, when the Ghost Lord
was sealed away

191
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,640
many clans of the Ghost Realm
wanted to take revenge.

192
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,519
They were all suppressed by Your Majesty.

193
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,359
Those who harbored great resentment,
like the Mermaid Clan

194
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,799
retreated to the Chang Sea
and stopped offering tributes.

195
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,839
The ones who held
less resentment didn't say much

196
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,640
but they must not have been content.

197
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,799
If we send our troops,
those clans may very well protest.

198
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,480
Enough!

199
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,119
I know those clans

200
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,519
comment behind my back that
I am too close with the Celestial Tribe

201
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,440
and have forgotten about avenging Father.

202
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,720
But how could they understand that
only with peace in the world

203
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
can the people live well?

204
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,759
Yes, the Ghost Tribe is aggressive

205
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,039
but we could also die!

206
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
And we would also bleed.

207
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,200
As long as I am the Ghost Lord...

208
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,759
I do not want to see...

209
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
a war like the one 70,000 years ago
in which hundreds of thousands died.

210
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,359
- But, Your Majesty--
- No more discussion!

211
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,519
I will gather the troops
and head out today.

212
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,640
- I accept your command.
- I accept your command.

213
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,079
Has His Majesty left
Grand Ziming Palace already?

214
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,400
Your Highness,
His Majesty left an hour ago.

215
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,519
- You may go.
- Yes.

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,119
As long as you protect this child

217
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,759
I certainly will not forget
your devotion.

218
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,039
I...

219
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,599
I absolutely cannot lie to His Majesty.

220
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,480
Please... Please forgive me,
Your Highness.

221
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,960
You must allow me to be able to
give birth to this child.

222
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Your Highness, that is
an act that defies nature.

223
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
You must not do it!

224
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,079
When I was in Qing Qiu

225
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,920
I heard about a medicinal herb
that exists in the Ghost Realm

226
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,359
that can induce labor
for a diseased child

227
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,519
and a spell to heal the diseased child.

228
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,000
You have served
three generations of Ghost Lords.

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
Don't tell me you don't know this spell.

230
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
There is such a spell,
but it is extremely dangerous.

231
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,920
Those who have used
this spell in the Ghost Realm

232
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,920
have all received retribution
due to defying nature.

233
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,240
Your Highness, you must
consider this carefully.

234
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't believe in retribution.

235
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
I only believe in myself.

236
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,559
Please listen to my advice,
Your Highness.

237
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,480
Even if this child is born,
it will be an unhealthy child.

238
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,759
Why are you so obsessed
with this child, Your Highness?

239
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,519
Shut up. Get out.

240
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,900
Yes.

241
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,039
If I don't give birth to it,
will I have another chance?

242
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,920
His Majesty wouldn't touch me even on
our wedding night 70,000 years ago.

243
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,720
I had to do everything I could
just to conceive this one child.

244
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,359
This is my only chance.

245
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,240
My only chance to keep him by my side.

246
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,319
If this child is taken away from me...

247
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,759
then he will no longer care about me.

248
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
He wouldn't even feel a twinge of guilt.

249
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,599
Even if it is a sick child

250
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,240
he will take pity on me...

251
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,519
and come to see me once in a while.

252
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,079
That would still be better than for him
to get drunk in the arms of other women.

253
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,480
My child.

254
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,880
I will definitely give birth to you.

255
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
The Far North relies mainly on
numerous waterways.

256
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,640
It would be too easy for the rebel army
to disperse and hide themselves.

257
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,160
Yes, Your Highness.
This isn't the Chang Sea.

258
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,000
Of the four seas, the Chang Sea has
the most level seabed.

259
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,960
It is easy for the two armies
to cross swords.

260
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,799
But here, the waterways linked to
the lake lead in all directions.

261
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,359
It is truly troublesome.

262
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,680
Moreover, there has never been
a battle in the Far North.

263
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,400
We have never been here before.

264
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,279
If we are to contend with them

265
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,720
it will be even more difficult.

266
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,400
Your Highness.

267
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,279
I have a solution that can allow us

268
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,093
to familiarize ourselves
with the Far North terrain quickly.

269
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,039
Please speak.

270
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,799
I heard Your Highness is engaged
to Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

271
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,119
That is correct. I have
a marriage arrangement with Bai Qian.

272
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,000
From what I know, Qing Qiu's Fox King
has four sons and one daughter.

273
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,240
Aside from the daughter who has
never stepped foot outside of Qing Qiu

274
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,160
the four sons have left Qing Qiu
and established their own residences.

275
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
The fourth son, Bai Zhen

276
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
resides long term in
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods

277
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
but his own manor is located in
the Xia periphery of the Far North.

278
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,559
I think High God Bai Zhen
should be able to help Your Highness.

279
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,519
High God Bai Zhen?

280
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,680
Yes!

281
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
It is a good idea!

282
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,240
His younger sister will be married to
our Crown Prince sooner or later.

283
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,640
It is only right that he helps us.

284
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,700
It's lucky that
the Water King of the North Sea

285
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,359
canceled the engagement for a snake

286
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,480
giving the engagement
to the Crown Prince.

287
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
Look, it has become useful now.

288
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,160
Wonderful!

289
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,160
The Crown Prince is
my Fifth Sister's future husband.

290
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Naturally, I will help you.

291
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
However, I have not
resided here for long.

292
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,680
After so much time has passed,
the terrain has also changed drastically.

293
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,759
It is a difficult task,
even for High God Bai Zhen?

294
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,200
Don't rush. Let me finish.

295
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Young people should not be so hurried.
There is no benefit to it.

296
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,519
I do not have a very good temper.

297
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,240
If it were anyone else, I would
already have kicked them out the door.

298
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,119
However, if it is
my future brother-in-law asking for help

299
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,359
then in at most three months

300
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,480
I will have a topographic map of
the Far North delivered to your army tent

301
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,720
to help Your Highness
pacify the rebellion.

302
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,279
Thank you, Bai Zhen.

303
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,759
No need to be polite.

304
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,400
You just have to remember

305
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,279
I am helping you because you are
the future son-in-law of Qing Qiu

306
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,640
not because you are
the Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe.

307
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,319
I am able to assist you today.

308
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,119
In the future, I also
will be able to punish you.

309
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,559
If you wrong my Fifth Sister
in any way in the future

310
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,759
I absolutely will not
let you off lightly.

311
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,319
High God Zhe Yan.

312
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,240
I shall take my leave now.

313
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,480
Farewell, Crown Prince.
I will not be seeing you out.

314
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,720
You sure can pretend
to be a serious person.

315
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,319
If Qian Qian saw
her Fourth Brother like this

316
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,119
would she laugh so hard that
she couldn't tell which way is north?

317
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,279
Try this new thing I brought.

318
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,039
I just copy your usual
old but playful look.

319
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,960
What do you think? Do I look the part?

320
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,599
It is quite useful in scaring
my future brother-in-law.

321
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,480
These nuts are good.
They're crunchy and savory.

322
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
Have another.

323
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,039
You keep saying, "brother-in-law."

324
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,440
I do have some regrets about agreeing
to this engagement for Qian Qian.

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,839
It's said this Crown Prince has been
very popular with the ladies these years.

326
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,599
Qian Qian may not be happy marrying him.

327
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,200
That isn't a big problem.

328
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,119
With Qian Qian's personality,
who could bully her?

329
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,200
I just hate the Celestial Tribe's harem.
What's wrong with monogamy?

330
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,240
But these all come later.

331
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,039
The Celestial Tribe still thinks
Qian Qian is still in Qing Qiu

332
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,920
and is ready for marriage at any moment.

333
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,200
Yet, we still don't know
Qian Qian's whereabouts.

334
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,680
Last night, Bi Fang came to see me.

335
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,480
He said he searched the entire Far East
but hasn't seen Qian Qian.

336
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,920
I also searched the Far North
for a few days but haven't found her.

337
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,039
Where has she gone?

338
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,839
I was also quite worried last night.

339
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,200
I looked up and searched the stars.

340
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,400
I immediately discovered
you've been worrying too much.

341
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,599
Worrying too much?

342
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,599
- Guess what I saw.
- What?

343
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,000
She is not only worry-free in life

344
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,119
but from the stars,
the Hong Luan Star is ascendant.

345
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,880
The Hong Luan Star is ascendant?

346
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,000
Don't tell me she isn't returning to
Qing Qiu because she eloped with someone.

347
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,240
I do not know if she eloped

348
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,279
but the Hong Luan Star truly is present.

349
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,359
She has an engagement with
the Crown Prince

350
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,519
but she is in love with
someone elsewhere.

351
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,279
Would that not be so good?

352
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,839
That isn't a problem.

353
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,920
If she finds someone else she likes,
then just cancel the engagement.

354
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,599
Yes! You are right.

355
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,559
They canceled the engagement once.
We can do the same to them.

356
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,000
The Celestial Tribe wouldn't be able
to do anything about it.

357
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,599
Hearing you say that, I can rest assured.

358
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,759
However, this task for Ye Hua
must be done properly.

359
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,460
It could be considered compensation for
canceling the engagement in the future.

360
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,119
Why are you outside, Your Highness?

361
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,359
It is boring to be
sitting inside all day.

362
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,359
I wanted to come out to take a look.

363
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,359
It is breezy here.
Your Highness should go back inside.

364
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,839
All right.

365
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
<i>I can't bear to leave.</i>

366
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,279
<i>But I feel guilty staying.</i>

367
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,000
<i>If Dijun sees that I am deceiving him,
will he be angry?</i>

368
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,079
The view here is nice.

369
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>Who is Dijun speaking to?</i>

370
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,799
Little fox, do you want a drink?

371
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,400
Dijun?

372
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,839
Are you drunk?

373
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,079
Dijun.

374
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,839
You must think

375
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,344
the troublesome Bai Feng Jiu
of Qing Qiu has already left.

376
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,359
You must think I am one who
doesn't know how to repay a kindness.

377
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,799
It's not that I don't want to.

378
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,799
But...

379
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,519
I don't know how to repay you.

380
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,839
Goodness!

381
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,960
You kissed him? You really kissed him?

382
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,799
He gave no response?

383
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,200
Was he pretending to be asleep?

384
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,720
No.

385
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,599
Dijun drank a lot of wine

386
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,319
and was in deep sleep.

387
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,319
I don't believe it.

388
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,400
Dong Hua Dijun used to
lead soldiers and kill enemies.

389
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,640
How could he let his guard down and
be kissed by someone without knowing?

390
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,680
In my opinion, he has
also developed feelings for you

391
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,519
and wanted it to happen.

392
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,640
Don't be ridiculous.

393
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,400
<i>Was Dijun pretending to be drunk, or...</i>

394
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,519
You have been with Jia Yun assisting
His Highness for the past few months.

395
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,519
That puts me at ease.

396
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,280
By the way, are you returning today?

397
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,519
Your Highness, the war is at
a critical point. I must return now.

398
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,199
Didn't you just return from
seeing the Heavenly Lord?

399
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,199
You are leaving so quickly?

400
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,119
Does His Highness have a letter for the
mortal in the Hall of Beautiful Youth?

401
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,519
Your Highness, there is no letter
for the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

402
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,360
All right, I understand.

403
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,000
Your Highness, when I was on
Deity Mountain in the lower realm

404
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,960
I saw mortals hanging lanterns
on the 15th day of the first month.

405
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,639
I learned to make a few.
Why don't we hang them up later?

406
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,039
Nai Nai.

407
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:46,679
Has the Crown Prince delivered
any letters here?

408
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,920
No.

409
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,800
I asked the maids
of Zichen Hall this afternoon.

410
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,039
They said the situation in
the Far North is critical.

411
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,400
His Highness probably
could not attend to it.

412
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,599
Do not think too much of it.

413
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,679
Now that a few months have passed,
you finally stopped crying.

414
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,860
I'll go bring you some delicious food.

415
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,000
Little fox, you're here again?

416
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
<i>If it weren't for the fact that you
bear such a resemblance to my aunt</i>

417
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,079
<i>I wouldn't spend time with you.</i>

418
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,639
Little fox, I've finally figured it out
in the past few months.

419
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,320
Don't you think it's strange?

420
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,280
<i>What did you figure out?</i>

421
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,760
Although Ye Hua does not speak much
and does not like to smile much

422
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,840
if he kept me company
in a place like Mount Junji

423
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,199
then that means
he does like me a little bit.

424
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,159
As long as he likes me a little bit

425
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,400
I am willing to continue
staying by his side.

426
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,239
<i>What is good about the Crown Prince?</i>

427
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,599
<i>He's attracted to Consort Su Jin
and got you pregnant.</i>

428
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,480
<i>He even has to marry my aunt.</i>

429
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,280
<i>Won't three women be so much trouble?</i>

430
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,480
No matter what, I am the one he married.

431
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,639
We made an oath in front of
the Lakes of the Far East.

432
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,880
I am his wife.

433
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,039
I am also carrying his child now.

434
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,920
I love him so much.

435
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,199
I believe I will one day
be able to move his heart

436
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,960
and make him fall in love with me too.

437
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,400
You are a fox in Heaven. You must
know how to practice cultivation.

438
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,519
If I could cultivate my path
from a mortal into an immortal

439
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,159
would he treat me better?

440
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,840
<i>I am not sure about that.</i>

441
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,842
<i>When I get the chance,
I'll ask Si Ming and Cheng Yu.</i>

442
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,559
You two still haven't told me
how to become an immortal.

443
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,480
Become immortal?

444
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,800
Becoming immortal is a long journey.

445
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,239
Very long.

446
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,639
What are you two doing in my study?

447
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:27,880
We were playing with the fox.
It's so cute.

448
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,199
I've suddenly remembered something
I have to do.

449
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,000
Dijun, farewell.

450
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,519
It seems you quite like this little fox.

451
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,239
Do you want to take it?

452
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,639
No, no.

453
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,280
I've always been afraid of
things that have claws.

454
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,599
Farewell.

455
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,119
Just now, Si Ming was talking about
becoming immortal.

456
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,760
<i>Dijun, don't misunderstand!</i>

457
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,519
<i>I am just a little fox.</i>

458
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,199
<i>I just want to stay by your side
every day, for all of my lifetimes.</i>

459
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,320
For an immortal,
there are no lifetimes.

460
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,079
This life...

461
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,000
is already long enough.

462
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,760
<i>Di... Dijun doesn't know
how to read minds, does he?</i>

463
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:08,280
The Fourth Prince of Qing Qiu
does indeed keep his word.

464
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,280
The Qing Qiu Fox Clan has safeguarded
the five lands for generations.

465
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,239
As expected, only they could
deliver such a map.

466
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,840
My lord says

467
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,000
the Nine-tailed Fox Clan is not skilled
at fighting and does not keep an army.

468
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,679
This is as much as
he can help Your Highness.

469
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,880
Help me thank your lord.

470
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,960
His Highness has also said this map
is yours to keep, Crown Prince.

471
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,079
If our Qing Qiu princess suffers wrongs
in the Celestial Tribe in the future

472
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,639
he will personally come
to reason with you.

473
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,440
The Qing Qiu Fox Clan sure is
frank and straightforward.

474
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,239
They are much bolder with words
than our Celestial Tribe.

475
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,239
Your Highness.

476
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,880
The 100,000 troops I brought
are most familiar with the waterways.

477
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
We are willing to be your vanguard.

478
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,840
In three months

479
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,800
I will have the Far North rebels
forced to the end of their ropes.

480
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,199
Your Highness need only guard
the four main land routes

481
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,280
and immediately intercept
the routed troops.

482
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Are you that confident, Ghost Lord?

483
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,880
I am willing to take a military order.
I have only a small request.

484
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,039
After Your Highness intercepts
Li Yuan's routed troops

485
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,039
please let me have Li Yuan.

486
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,199
I want to settle this with him myself.

487
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,760
All right, I give you my promise.

488
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,880
<i>Three months after three months.</i>

489
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,000
<i>Su Su.</i>

490
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,440
<i>I cannot believe that
even back in the Celestial Palace</i>

491
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,639
<i>I am still making you
wait for me day after day.</i>

492
