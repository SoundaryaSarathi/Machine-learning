1
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,980
I shot down Dodoria!

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,916
I easily beat Dodoria, who took
such pride in his own power!

3
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:31,289
Even <i>l'm</i> surprised
by how much I've improved.

4
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,927
It truly seems that my battle
on Earth was not in vain.

5
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,599
Be that as it may, Dodoria
did say something curious...

6
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:45,263
I see now. Those runts I was chasing
earlier were Earthlings, weren't they!?

7
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:50,609
I do indeed sense two large
powers getting farther away.

8
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,279
Of course they couldn't be Earthlings,
but it's still disturbing.

9
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,948
Maybe I should go
look into it, just to see.

10
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:01,885
Whatever the case, I have to get rid of
even the small fries that stand in my way.

11
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:18,303
The cave that Bulma-<i>san</i>
is hiding in is right over there.

12
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:22,239
For this being a planet you've never been to
before, I'm surprised you remember so well.

13
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:27,411
What's that!? Something is coming!
It's incredibly fast!

14
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,983
Hide! Quickly!

15
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,075
Right!

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,257
We'll be found if we stay here, won't we?

17
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:41,426
Never mind, just hurry up
and suppress your <i>Ki</i>!

18
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:43,917
All we can do now is leave
our fate up to heaven.

19
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:48,933
Will it be someone like
that monster from earlier?

20
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,199
Dammit, how did they know where we were?

21
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:02,947
Both of the power readings have
disappeared. What's going on?

22
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:05,211
Over in that area,
all of a sudden...

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,555
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>! O- over there!

24
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:36,410
<i>V</i>- <i>Vegeta! T</i>- <i>then he</i> is
<i>on this planet, after all!</i>

25
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:46,087
<i>How can he be here!? This is the</i>
<i>absolute worst thing that could happen!</i>

26
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,605
He's still looking.

27
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:04,876
He wasn't wearing
one of those Scouter devices.

28
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,868
And yet, how is it that
he can tell where we are?

29
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:14,953
D- don't tell me he has
the ability to sense <i>Ki</i>!

30
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,222
If that's the case,
then this is bad.

31
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,885
We might be able to extinguish our <i>Ki</i>,
but this kid still has a faint one.

32
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,234
Damn. Was I mistaken?

33
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,637
Is it because I'm not yet used to using
this power sensing technique?

34
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:36,073
Maybe I shouldn't have
destroyed that Scouter.

35
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:40,245
I'm sensing a small power.

36
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:44,079
It's no mistake this time.
Let's check it out.

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,343
He's coming this way!

38
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:51,521
<i>lt's hopeless!</i>
<i>He's going to find us!</i>

39
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,025
It's near that rock over there.

40
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,932
At this point, all we can do is fight.

41
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,799
Even though we know we'll get killed.

42
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:19,951
Let's go!

43
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,213
Right!

44
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,883
Now!

45
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,013
Tch! It was a fish?

46
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,697
Oh, well. Right now, the first order
of business is to get the two-

47
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:09,934
no, even just one of
the remaining Dragon Balls.

48
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,203
Once I've hidden it,

49
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:16,196
Freeza and the others will no longer
be able to get all seven together.

50
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,379
Then I'll find the chance
to take the five

51
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,212
that Freeza and company
have away from them.

52
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,053
Their having lost
their Scouters means

53
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:32,545
that luck has shifted
in Vegeta-<i>sama</i>'s favor!

54
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,333
W- we're saved!

55
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,342
I thought it was completely hopeless there.

56
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:56,177
Lucky for us, huh? We have
that guy in the water to thank.

57
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:00,351
Anyhow, let's get back
to where Bulma-<i>san</i> is,

58
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,587
while keeping our presence
as masked as we can.

59
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,255
You said it was right close by, right?

60
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,256
Yes.

61
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:09,852
We didn't even fight, and I'm already
exhausted. I'd like to get some rest.

62
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,874
I, uh...

63
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:30,949
To be honest, I'm starting to think
we shouldn't have come to this planet.

64
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,619
It might not be fair to the late
Yamucha-<i>san</i> and the others,

65
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:37,221
but far from bringing
everyone back to life,

66
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,224
it looks like we're just going
to be adding to the deceased.

67
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,057
You mean, us?

68
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,906
Look! Kuririn-<i>san</i>, over there!

69
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,397
Yeah, right, right.

70
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,066
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

71
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:04,582
Huh? She's not here.

72
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:07,915
I'm sure she's hiding
deeper inside the cave.

73
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,589
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

74
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:17,084
It's us! Where are you!? Bulma-<i>san</i>!

75
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,760
A Capsule house!

76
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,438
What were you guys
taking it so easy for!?

77
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,941
While leaving a young girl like me
alone in a place like this!?

78
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,449
Taking it easy, she says...

79
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:48,559
W- what's with the small-size
Piccolo-looking kid there?

80
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,221
By any chance,
is that a Namekian?

81
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,554
It's okay.

82
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,534
Has something happened?

83
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:03,908
For now, just let us in, please.
We'll fill you in on the details.

84
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,244
Oh, right!

85
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:09,914
I just got some delightful
news from my dad!

86
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:13,918
He said that Son-<i>kun</i> had
blasted off for Planet Namek here!

87
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,910
And that he would arrive
in just six days!

88
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:23,094
You see, apparently, my dad
rebuilt the Saiyan spaceship

89
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,263
that Son-<i>kun</i> came in as a baby!

90
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:29,267
What's more, he said that Son-<i>kun</i> was
doing some incredible training inside it

91
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,258
along the way.

92
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,094
F- Father?

93
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,611
Yahoo!!

94
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:45,105
Yay! Hooray! Hooray!

95
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,622
Incredible training along the way?

96
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:54,887
All right! All right!
We've found some hope!

97
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:23,749
Next up, I'll do this for 30 minutes!

98
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:17,074
Huh? Is it already time
for the next item on the schedule?

99
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:29,411
That's strange...

100
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,081
What's going on here?

101
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,423
W- what's that?

102
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,605
<i>Goku, can you hear me?</i>

103
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,609
Ah, it's Bulma's daddy!
What on earth is going on?

104
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,946
<i>Part of the exterior of the</i>
<i>spaceship has been damaged.</i>

105
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,712
<i>A meteor or something must have hit it.</i>

106
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>lf you keep going like this,</i>
<i>you'll slip off course.</i>

107
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,625
W- what's going to happen!?

108
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,630
<i>You won't be able to go to Planet Namek.</i>
<i>You'll become lost in space.</i>

109
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,298
I can't have that!

110
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,300
<i>Go outside and repair it.</i>

111
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,301
Repair it!?

112
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,070
<i>Mm-hmm, it will be easy.</i>

113
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,905
<i>lnside the repair box, there should be</i>
<i>some material and a powerful adhesive.</i>

114
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,248
Wow, so this is space, huh?

115
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:50,533
<i>Goku, don't panic. You've</i>
<i>got a lifeline, don't you?</i>

116
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:55,197
That's right. I just have to
reel myself in, huh?

117
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,873
You know, this speed is amazing.

118
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:06,879
Yikes, I'd better hurry.

119
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,968
Oh, that gave me a start.

120
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:28,306
<i>Goku, the soles of your boots are magnets,</i>
<i>so you can stand up and walk around.</i>

121
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,399
Oh, yeah?

122
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,403
Ha-ha, it's true!

123
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,410
This is terrific!

124
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,575
Oh, that must be it.

125
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:46,082
All right, there it is.

126
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:50,860
Let's see... This is the glue, huh?

127
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:58,031
Let's see, the course deviation
caused by that damage is...

128
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,832
Oh, what's this!?

129
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,617
All right, that does it.
It was easier than I thought.

130
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:18,956
<i>Goku, this is bad! You have to</i>
<i>make a course correction right now!</i>

131
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:24,962
Goku, your position right now
is at SU-83 by 643-XY.

132
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,731
If you keep going the way you are,

133
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:32,294
you're going to collide
with the star Alpha HZ at 653-XY.

134
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:37,908
I can't understand anything as
complicated as that! What should I do!?

135
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:41,412
Oh, just do as I instruct you to,
and it will be easy.

136
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:44,582
Hurry and get back inside the spaceship.

137
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,584
All right, you got it.

138
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:47,846
Huh?

139
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm stuck here.
Come on, now!

140
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,932
This is bad.
I can't get loose.

141
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,196
All right, one more time...

142
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:17,948
<i>Goku, what are you doing?</i>
<i>There's no time!</i>

143
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:20,618
That's easy for you to say,

144
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:24,288
<i>but my feet got stuck with</i>
<i>the glue, and I can't get free!</i>

145
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,222
What did you say!?

146
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,234
What do I do!?

147
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,236
<i>Tell me!</i>

148
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,237
G- Goku!

149
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,228
Goku-<i>san</i>!

150
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:54,847
I don't want to die out here!

151
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,593
All right, all I can do now
is count on this...

152
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:05,930
<i>Ka... me...</i>

153
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,934
<i>ha... me...</i>

154
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:14,200
<i>Ha!!</i>

155
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,045
Whew! This is incredible power!

156
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,503
I get it, this is the result
of the 20 G training!

157
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:29,552
He did it! He did it!

158
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,563
I- it's no use!

159
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,394
Goku-<i>san</i>!

160
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,240
All right, I'm sure of myself now.
This time, full power!

161
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,910
<i>Ka... me...</i>

162
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,249
<i>ha... me...</i>

163
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,185
<i>Ha!!</i>

164
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,203
He did it! He did it! He did it!

165
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,385
That much force from 20 Gs.

166
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:37,411
If I raise the Gs even more,
I'll become even stronger!

167
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:58,576
I feel it! Larger-size powers!
They number about twenty.

168
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:01,412
No question about it,
it's a Namekian village.

169
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,575
They probably have
one of the Dragon Balls.

170
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,588
Freeza and his men don't have Scouters!

171
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:15,252
No matter what action I may take
now, they won't know about it!

172
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:27,938
Sure enough. And since
the villagers are still alive,

173
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:31,430
that proves that Freeza and the
others haven't been here yet!

174
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,889
W- what's this?

175
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,050
It's an alien!

176
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:54,565
Is the one called Elder here? I've come
to take your Dragon Ball off your hands.

177
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:56,726
W- what?

178
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:05,576
I am the Elder. Would you tell me
why you want the Dragon Balls?

179
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:09,580
Never mind, just hand it over
quickly. You have it, don't you?

180
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,918
Leave us. I cannot allow you
to have it. I can sense evil in you.

181
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,754
Then die.

182
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:27,594
Bang!

183
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,090
Elder!

184
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,296
<i>Planet Namek was in</i>
<i>the worst of circumstances.</i>

185
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:04,635
<i>At length, Vegeta had also set out</i>
<i>in search of the Dragon Balls.</i>

186
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:09,572
<i>ls their only hope to await</i>
<i>the arrival of Goku?</i>

187
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:20,572
