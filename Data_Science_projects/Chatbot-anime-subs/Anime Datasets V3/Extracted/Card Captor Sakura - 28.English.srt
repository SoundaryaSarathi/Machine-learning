1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,290
Today, we’ll be cooking with oil…

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:10,100
…so everyone, put on your gear,
and let’s work hard, alright?

3
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,098
Enchanting Card?

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,739
It’s really popular now!

5
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:16,769
What’s this Enchanting Card?

6
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,235
For studying,

7
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:20,775
diets, or love.

8
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,946
There are all kinds of cards.
If you have the right card,

9
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:26,917
your wish will be granted.

10
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,514
They’re selling them at Maki’s shop.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,857
I see.

12
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:35,018
Sakura, the oil is ready.

13
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:36,390
Yes.

14
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,804
Eh?

15
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,403
Sakura, are you alright?

16
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:51,510
I’m OK.

17
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,610
But when I look at that hot oil,
I’m scared…

18
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:55,945
If you don’t put
the croquette in the pot,

19
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:58,413
it won’t cook.

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,587
I wonder if I can do it…

21
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:01,980
Sakura.

22
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:03,685
You can do it.
You’re good at cooking.

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,858
I’ll try it again.

24
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:22,599
Sakura, the pot…

25
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,905
What do I do? What do I do?

26
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,216
What do I do?
I’m scared!

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,852
Are you alright?

28
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:38,091
Yes…

29
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,061
Everyone, when cooking with oil,

30
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:43,692
it’s very hot,
so please pay attention.

31
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:44,962
Right!

32
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:46,697
You’re not hurt, are you?

33
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:48,792
No, it’s nothing.

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,734
Mei Lin,

35
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,863
thanks for turning it off for me.

36
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:55,063
Kinomoto.

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,538
Um, next time I’ll be careful…

38
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:02,575
Where’s this Maki’s shop?

39
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,710
What?

40
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,223
[Sakura and the Enchanting Cards]

41
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,457
Thank you very much.

42
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:22,994
Huh?

43
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,901
H… hello…

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,638
Welcome.

45
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,267
Um, the Enchanting…

46
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:31,567
Enchanting…

47
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:35,047
Oh, you mean the cards?
We’ve got a lot of them.

48
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:36,909
Which one would you like?

49
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,950
L… L…

50
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:40,848
Yes?

51
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:51,622
That looks good, right?

52
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,194
Yep.

53
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,623
If you do it now, you should be fine.

54
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,268
Okay.

55
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,505
Sakura!

56
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:03,606
Are you okay?

57
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:05,576
Sorry about that…

58
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,277
No problem.
I’ll take care of it today, OK?

59
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,918
How come you’re so good at it?

60
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,820
Don’t worry,
you’ll be able to do this.

61
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:18,382
I wonder…

62
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:19,485
I’m home!

63
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:20,725
Welcome home!

64
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,591
I’ll take one!

65
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,229
Brother, don’t eat that!

66
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,294
Did you make this?

67
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:28,792
Dad did…

68
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:30,135
Then this should be fine!

69
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,560
What’s that supposed to mean?!

70
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:37,505
Good morning!

71
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:38,673
Good morning!

72
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,637
How did the deep-frying practice go?

73
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:47,320
I see. But I’m sure you’ll
get the hang of it.

74
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,488
Oh, Naoko, good morning!

75
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:51,855
Morning.

76
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:53,783
What’s wrong?
You look a little down.

77
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,253
Because today’s P.E.
is jumping practice.

78
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,026
But even though
I wasn’t able to do it before,

79
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,391
I’ll try hard today!

80
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:02,698
Go for it!

81
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,261
We’ll be rooting for you!

82
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,062
Okay!

83
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,675
Perfect as always.

84
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:19,552
Next, Li Mei Lin.

85
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:20,984
Okay!

86
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,263
Well, that’s to be expected.

87
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,095
Next, Yanagisawa.

88
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:33,931
Okay…

89
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,027
Naoko, go for it!

90
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:37,961
You practiced a lot!

91
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:40,932
You have the card and wished for this,
so you can do it!

92
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:43,040
Card?

93
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,016
Did it.

94
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,652
Pretty good.

95
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,186
It’s all thanks to the card.

96
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,098
Sakura…

97
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,992
Kinda looks like a Clow Card…

98
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,762
Is this one of the Enchanting Cards?

99
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,933
Yep. I was worried about
today’s jumping practice,

100
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:16,503
so I bought it yesterday.

101
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,606
Chiharu, you have one, too?

102
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,445
They really do look like Clow Cards.

103
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:24,781
Yeah…

104
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,181
Mei Lin, you want to see, too?

105
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,554
Oh, I have no interest in those cards.

106
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:36,662
Oh look,
it’s almost time to start class.

107
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:45,996
It’s so crowded.

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,605
You want a Cooking Card,
don’t you?

109
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,239
There’s also a Love Card, they said.

110
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,503
Thank you very much!

111
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,113
Mei Lin!

112
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,046
Sakura, Tomoyo, welcome!

113
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:02,050
Hello!

114
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,582
Mei Lin, you came to buy a card?

115
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,318
I… didn’t really…

116
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,625
You two also came to buy a card?

117
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:09,857
Yes.

118
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,858
Um, do you have a card that will help
me get better at cooking?

119
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,894
The Cooking one is, I think…

120
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:21,399
Sorry, I had them earlier,
but I already sold out.

121
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,637
I should have more tomorrow.

122
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:24,833
Excuse me…

123
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,715
I’m sorry, but you can
come back tomorrow.

124
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:34,952
I didn’t really…

125
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:36,921
Shao Lan has been mine for
a long time, so…

126
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,388
It’d be all right if they ran out
of these Love Cards, but…

127
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,288
For now, for now…

128
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,862
Really, me and Shao Lan
are doing fine, but…

129
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,071
It looks like a Clow Card…

130
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,707
You see, it’s not like
I’m trying to win your heart or anything…

131
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:06,980
See you later, Kinomoto!

132
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:13,056
What was that?
They look like Clow Cards?

133
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:16,221
The pictures and writing
are different, though.

134
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,392
“Whatever you wish for
will come true,” they say.

135
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,195
Today, thanks to a card,

136
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:24,597
Naoko was able to do the
jumping practice for the first time.

137
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:27,640
So, do you have one of those cards?

138
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,174
They sold out.

139
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,008
So I’ll pick one up tomorrow.

140
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,174
Sakura, I made some pudding.

141
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:35,073
Do you want some?

142
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,008
Sure!

143
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:37,011
Something wrong.

144
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,082
So serious?

145
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:51,087
A card that looks like a Clow Card,
huh?

146
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:09,479
Shao Lan!

147
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,012
What?

148
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:12,615
Lunch! Shall we eat together?

149
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,849
I was going to eat
in the cafeteria today…

150
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,416
I have done!
So, let’s go eat!

151
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,058
Wow, looks great.

152
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,593
Thank you.

153
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,029
Tomoyo, you’re good at cooking, too.

154
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:27,361
When you say that,
it makes me want to make more.

155
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,936
Next time,
I’ll make lunch for us.

156
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:32,536
So, shall we eat?

157
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:33,601
Sakura!

158
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,533
Yukito!

159
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,182
You eat croquettes?

160
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,988
Yeah. Your croquettes are really good.

161
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,054
Yukito, you like croquettes?

162
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,551
Yeah, I love them.

163
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,156
I see.

164
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:59,689
Now I have to try even
harder to make croquettes!

165
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,829
I guess I’ll have to buy
that Cooking Card…

166
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,726
Hey, why do we have
to go so far away…

167
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:04,801
Come here.

168
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:08,002
You…

169
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:11,138
Li-kun and Mei Lin,
you’re eating lunch, too?

170
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:12,241
Eh!

171
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:16,209
What’s wrong, Shao Lan?

172
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:17,579
I’ll introduce you, OK?

173
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:19,814
My classmate, Li Mei Lin.

174
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:21,514
Li’s cousin…

175
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:22,853
Fiancee!

176
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:24,489
Fiancee?

177
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,253
No, no…

178
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:29,895
Why’re you so nervous
all of a sudden, Shao Lan…

179
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,334
Oh, Sakura, Tomoyo!

180
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,264
Are you going to buy a card?

181
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,298
Yep.

182
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,268
We ended up buying more!

183
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,269
They still have them?

184
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:43,702
They have a lot today.

185
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:44,870
Really?

186
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:45,840
Yeah.

187
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,146
They have all kinds, don’t they?

188
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,011
This is the one.
The card to become better at cooking.

189
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:00,024
Sakura?

190
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:02,288
I feel the aura of a Clow Card.

191
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:23,172
Nope. None of these are Clow Cards.

192
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:31,147
But the aura was just here…

193
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,425
Maki!

194
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,353
Yes?

195
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,492
The card that was here,
what happened to it?

196
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,530
I just sold it.

197
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,021
What kind of card was it?

198
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:44,463
If I remember right, it was “Shot”…

199
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:45,701
“Shot”?

200
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,100
As in shooting?

201
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,503
Do you remember who bought the card?

202
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,239
I think it was one of
the girls in your class, but…

203
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:55,614
Was it Chiharu or Naoko?

204
00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:00,714
Sorry, I don’t remember that much.

205
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:01,815
I’ll come back!

206
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:02,784
Sakura!

207
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:15,767
I lost again?!

208
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:17,933
We’ve got trouble!

209
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,004
It looks like
there was a real Clow Card

210
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:22,264
at Maki’s shop!

211
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,375
And someone from my class bought it!

212
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,937
Do you know which card it was?

213
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,042
Shot!

214
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,110
What?!
Shot?

215
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,526
This is bad! Shot is an attack card!

216
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,889
If it shoots and hits you,

217
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,086
it’ll really hurt you!

218
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,297
Find it quickly!

219
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:47,495
Right.

220
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:55,866
Chiharu and Naoko…?

221
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:57,571
I didn’t see either of them!

222
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,071
We’ll use Fly to go look for them!

223
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:10,981
Key which hides the power of darkness…

224
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,525
…reveal thy true form to me.

225
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,655
By the covenant,
I, Sakura, command thee.

226
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,458
Release!

227
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,142
Fly!

228
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:51,753
I don’t see them.

229
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,661
Where could they have gone?

230
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:54,592
Sakura!

231
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:55,964
Kero.

232
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,327
Did you figure out who has it?

233
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:58,398
Not yet…

234
00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,636
Hurry up and find it!

235
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,066
Even if you say that…

236
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:02,503
Over there!

237
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,012
That Mei Lin…

238
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,779
Calling herself
my fiancee in front of him…

239
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,055
The aura of a Clow Card!

240
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,355
Naoko!

241
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:23,494
Sakura!

242
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,524
Could you show me the
Enchanting Cards you’re carrying?

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,762
Sure…

244
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,432
Is that all?

245
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,299
Yeah…

246
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,475
Oh yeah,
do you know where Chiharu went?

247
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,676
She said she was going straight home.

248
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,409
Thanks. See you later!

249
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,115
Sakura!

250
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:48,711
Hmm?

251
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:53,454
Not her?

252
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,622
Maybe it’s Chiharu…

253
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:55,722
Let’s hurry!

254
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:56,657
Right!

255
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,160
There!

256
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,937
Chiharu!

257
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,300
Oh, what’s wrong?

258
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,434
I’d like to see

259
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:12,708
the Enchanting Cards you’re carrying.

260
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,580
Okay.

261
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:18,115
Nope. N… Not… No…

262
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:23,846
Neither Naoko nor Chiharu…

263
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,856
Then who?

264
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,259
What’s wrong?

265
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,328
When you were at Twin Bells earlier,

266
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,996
was it just you and Naoko?

267
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:38,132
Maybe Mei Lin came out a little earlier.

268
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:39,201
Mei Lin?

269
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,874
It looked like she didn’t
even notice us, though.

270
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:43,470
Sakura.

271
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:44,371
Eh!

272
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,769
The little wench, huh?

273
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,577
We’d better find her.

274
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,714
Maybe it’s alright
if it hurts her a little.

275
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,550
I’ll go check Mei Lin’s house.

276
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:58,254
You two should go look for her.

277
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:01,690
Got it. Let’s meet back at school.

278
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:05,693
Sakura, let’s get moving!

279
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:07,661
It’s weird.

280
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:08,561
What’s up?

281
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,394
It’s Li.

282
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:10,897
Li!

283
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,435
The aura of a Clow Card…

284
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,101
I know, Mei Lin has it.

285
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,174
Mei Lin is holding a Clow Card?

286
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,105
I don’t know for sure yet, but…

287
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,807
It’s an attack card, so it’s dangerous!

288
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:24,278
Which card is it?

289
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,176
Shot!

290
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:26,281
Shot?

291
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:31,888
Fly!

292
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:36,688
Get on!

293
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:38,721
Hurry up and get on, brat!

294
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,880
Show me the direction…

295
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:03,447
That way!

296
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,264
At school?

297
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:31,712
With this card, Shao Lan’s heart…

298
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:33,948
Yes.

299
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:36,586
There!

300
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:38,914
She’s got it, dammit…

301
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:40,689
Mei Lin!

302
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:45,194
Shao Lan!

303
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,531
Why’re you with Kinomoto?

304
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:50,797
Mei Lin, that card you’ve got…

305
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:51,862
This?

306
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:55,202
That’s a real Clow Card!

307
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,875
No way!
This is an Enchanting Card I bought!

308
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,909
It’s a dangerous card!
Hurry up and hand it over!

309
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,279
What’s with you two?!

310
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:07,116
She’s really stubborn, ain’t she?

311
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:10,917
With this card

312
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:12,886
I’ll aim at Shao Lan’s heart!

313
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:14,324
Oh, no!

314
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:21,499
Li!

315
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,463
Brat!

316
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:30,702
Shao Lan!

317
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:31,739
Brat, behind you!

318
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,413
Shield!

319
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:36,979
Sakura, seal it quickly!

320
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,282
It’s not weak enough yet!

321
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,285
I’ve gotta do something,
or it won’t stop.

322
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:48,723
Shao Lan!

323
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,153
It’s only aiming at me!

324
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,165
When you get a chance, seal it!

325
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,260
But…!

326
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:06,974
Hurry!

327
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,271
Those attacks are
only going to get stronger!

328
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,345
Oh, no!

329
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:14,551
No!

330
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,359
That’s it! Li!

331
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:27,528
Got it!

332
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:41,046
Mirror, whatsoever
looks upon you, return it!

333
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:43,576
Mirror!

334
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:11,538
Now!

335
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:16,538
Return to thy true form, Clow Card!

336
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,125
Hey, using the Mirror card

337
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,869
to reflect the shot
back was a pretty good idea.

338
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,170
Oh yeah, where’s Mei Lin?

339
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:42,741
Over here.

340
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:44,867
Tomoyo!

341
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,439
When did you get here, Tomoyo?

342
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:53,279
I was able to capture
your victory on tape.

343
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,265
It’s ready any time.

344
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:17,707
I did it!

345
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,041
You’re doing fine.

346
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:19,971
Yes.

347
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:23,581
I wonder if the Enchanting Cards
granting all those wishes…

348
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,151
…was really because of the Clow Card?

349
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,480
It’s not incantations,
magic, or anything.

350
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:31,752
people keep trying hard,

351
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:33,253
they can do anything.

352
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,430
Sakura, this is a pretty good croquette.

353
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,826
All right, I can eat it myself!

354
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,799
No you can’t, Shao Lan, you’re hurt!

355
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:49,902
Li, how’s your injury?

356
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:51,808
It’s no big deal.

357
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,948
Shao Lan, we’re still
in the middle of eating.

358
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,513
Kinomoto!

359
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:04,855
For me?

360
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,488
Thanks for getting
the Clow Card this time…

361
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,661
…but next time we’ll win!

362
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,797
Thanks, Mei Lin!
I appreciate this!

363
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,498
But, Sakura,

364
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,465
you were able to make croquettes
this time, right?

365
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:23,169
Yep! But there’s still
room for improvement.

366
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,302
And Mei Lin gave me this.

367
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:26,875
I’m glad.
