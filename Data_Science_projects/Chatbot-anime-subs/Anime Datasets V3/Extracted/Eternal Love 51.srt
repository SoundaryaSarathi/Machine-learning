<i>[Episode 51]</i>

3
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,372
Master.

4
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,931
I cleaned up
the elixir cauldron chamber.

5
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:31,296
Your seniors have worked hard to restore
Kunlun Mountain to its original state.

6
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:36,867
It feels like the good old days
now that we're all together again.

7
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:42,210
It just came to my mind.

8
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:48,879
Master took three holy thunderbolts
for me here.

9
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,591
You don't remember the tactical strategy
or magical skills I taught you.

10
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,074
Who knew that remember
such a trivial matter?

11
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:04,423
I'd never forget your kindness, Master.

12
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:10,231
In the future,
I'll surely be filial to you.

13
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,959
Be filial to me?

14
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,489
Master, are you thirsty?

15
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,688
Shall I make you a pot of hot tea?

16
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,301
It's fine.

17
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,915
Go on with your chores.

18
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,443
All right, I won't disturb Master then.

19
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,806
I'll take my leave now.

20
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:45,258
How did you get me trapped again?

21
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,153
I taught you everything you know
about chess, music, drawing, and studies.

22
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:51,818
It will be hard for you to surpass me!

23
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:10,128
Fourth Brother, this is called
a landslide defeat.

24
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,367
You keep pacing back and forth.

25
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,561
Are you here to ask for a favor?

26
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:17,358
You're most probably right.

27
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,720
Fourth Brother, come with me.

28
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,427
Seriously! Kunlun Mountain is your turf.

29
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,225
You even speak to me differently here.

30
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,985
When I get back
I'll take you down in the next round.

31
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,911
The same trick again?

32
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,533
Don't underestimate me.

33
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,720
Let's go.

34
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:43,113
- Fourth Brother, quickly.
- Forget it.

35
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,850
I'd better line up
the next round for you.

36
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,930
Just in case you lose to me
and get upset again.

37
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,166
You'll run off for a few days or weeks.

38
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:56,416
Fourth Brother, do me a favor.

39
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,201
What? Weren't you quite stern just now?

40
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,841
Now you're begging me?

41
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,858
It's just a small favor.

42
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,867
Is it?

43
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,235
How could you consider

44
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:08,002
anything related to the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe trivial?

45
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,365
How did you know it has to do with him?

46
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:13,259
I've never know anyone else

47
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,884
who could make you behave
so shy and womanly.

48
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,242
All right, you're the smartest.

49
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,600
It's about him.

50
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,267
Fourth Brother, can you cover for me?

51
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:30,940
I just need seven or eight hours
in the Mortal Realm to check on Ye Hua.

52
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,502
You made such a big deal
out of such a trivial favor?

53
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,461
Are you afraid that
your seniors will tease you

54
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,745
about your romance if they find out?

55
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:44,899
Fourth Brother, you don't always
get it right after all.

56
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,973
I'm not making such an effort
because of my seniors.

57
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:53,492
I'm just worried about my mentor.

58
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,245
I'm afraid that he's concerned

59
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:58,346
about his twin's heavenly trial
in the Mortal Realm.

60
00:05:58,346 --> 00:05:59,776
He might want to check on him.

61
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,307
You should know how foul it is
in the Mortal Realm.

62
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:06,526
It could hinder my mentor's recovery.

63
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,995
Fourth Brother,
you think too highly of me.

64
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm such a sensitive person.

65
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,807
If I give you seven or eight hours,
I won't get any sleep tonight.

66
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,841
You can have one hour.

67
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:25,559
Ye Hua is just going through
a heavenly trial in the Mortal Realm.

68
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,309
It's nothing serious.

69
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:28,725
You're bothering to check on him?

70
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,000
Isn't that a bit too clingy?

71
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,334
It's a deal then.

72
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:38,035
One hour at most.

73
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,372
Otherwise, I'll bring you
back here personally.

74
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,677
Fourth Brother, look.

75
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,233
It's snowing on Kunlun Mountain.

76
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,199
It's the first time that
you're here with Zhe Yan, right?

77
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,240
You should take a look
at the back of the mountain.

78
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,247
Kunlun Mountain is
well known for its snow.

79
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,177
Don't bother mentioning the snow.

80
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:05,237
I wouldn't even bother
if there was a fire.

81
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,963
One hour. That's it.

82
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,754
You have to return once
I beat Zhe Yan at chess.

83
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,420
That's not right.

84
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,485
The Crown Prince will only be
about 10 years old now.

85
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,250
What could she do in the Mortal Realm?

86
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,341
Forget it.

87
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,269
I'll keep that old phoenix waiting.

88
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:31,841
Let me take a look down there first.

89
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:38,954
<i>"Luan Wuzi didn't have
100 acres of land."</i>

90
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:44,572
<i>It's also snowing in the Mortal Realm,
just like it is on Kunlun Mountain.</i>

91
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:48,512
<i>"He made himself well known
to feudal lords of other states."</i>

92
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,447
<i>"Other feudal lords were fond of him"</i>

93
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,771
<i>"and some minor tribes
pledged allegiance to him."</i>

94
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,517
<i>"Hence, Jin State could remain peaceful."</i>

95
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,218
<i>"They stayed uncorrupted
and law-abiding."</i>

96
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:58,790
<i>"That's how they steered
clear of disasters."</i>

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,740
<i>"Luan Wuzi didn't have
100 acres of land."</i>

98
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,764
"He was too poor to have objects
of rituals but he promoted his morals."

99
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:12,314
"He abided by the laws."

100
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,975
"He made himself well known
to feudal lords of other states."

101
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,300
"Other feudal lords were fond of him"

102
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,630
"and some minor tribes
pledged allegiance to him."

103
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,560
"Hence, Jin State could remain peaceful."

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,505
"They stayed uncorrupted
and law-abiding."

105
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,769
"That's how they steered
clear of disasters."

106
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,011
Stop.

107
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,668
Zhao Ge, stand up.

108
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,766
Keep reciting from there.

109
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,062
Yes.

110
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:40,172
"When Huanzi took the throne
he was arrogant, greedy, and wasteful."

111
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:43,572
"He violated the law and took bribes."

112
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:46,299
"He should have been punished
but he ended his life well"

113
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,028
"due to the blessings of
his father's kind deeds."

114
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,134
<i>It's said that Ye Hua was mentored by</i>

115
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:54,106
<i>Lord Yuan Shi and
Spiritual Master Ci Hang.</i>

116
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,389
<i>He was well mentored in Taoism
and celestial powers.</i>

117
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,846
<i>He was said to be the only
child prodigy in the Nine Heavens.</i>

118
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:02,432
<i>These books in the Mortal Realm
are too easy for him.</i>

119
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:05,929
"but he could promote his morals,
abide by the law..."

120
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:12,568
It's snowing!

121
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,731
- It's snowing!
- It's snowing!

122
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,472
Rice is expensive, so is oil!

123
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,774
Liu family has a sickly boy.

124
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:22,947
Even if the child prodigy
knows many words

125
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:26,482
what good is he if he has no strength?

126
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,735
What are you doing?

127
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,149
They have no manners!

128
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,692
How dare they bully
our young master at the Academy?

129
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,850
Exactly! We've tolerated them
for more than 10 days.

130
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,706
Let's go and teach them a lesson!

131
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:40,793
Don't bother.

132
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,585
<i>The Heavenly Lord is so cruel
to his own grandson.</i>

133
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:52,500
<i>He even made him lose
his arm in the Mortal Realm as well.</i>

134
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,030
Kind people always suffer.

135
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,110
Young Master is so kind but
why would the gods make him lose an arm?

136
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:32,812
- What happened?
- What happened?

137
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,466
This is just a dream.

138
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,350
Hey...

139
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,840
This isn't a dream?

140
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,236
Do you recognize me?

141
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:56,663
No.

142
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,453
Who are you?

143
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,912
How did you get into my room?

144
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:03,905
Listen up.

145
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:08,075
I'm a deity in Qing Qiu.

146
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,791
I snuck a peek into my fate
and learned that

147
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,092
we're destined to be married in 10 years.

148
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:18,533
So, I'm here today
to take a look at my future husband.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,349
I'm your future husband?

150
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:31,437
Judging by your expression,
you dislike the way I look?

151
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,154
You're... very pretty.

152
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,470
Do you mean it?

153
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,924
I haven't met many ladies

154
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,375
but even the ones in paintings
aren't as beautiful as you are.

155
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,027
Do you believe what I said?

156
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:52,313
That we're destined to be married?

157
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:02,820
I have a string of beads here.

158
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,754
When I'm not by your side,
will you keep it with you?

159
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,576
I have a jade pendant here.

160
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,697
It's for you.

161
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,628
This is for me?

162
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:23,825
Thank you. I'll wear it every day.

163
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,086
Yes, I'll wear the beads
every day as well.

164
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,327
We've made a promise then.

165
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:32,515
You can't marry anyone else.

166
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:35,144
I'll come and visit you
whenever I have the time.

167
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:38,102
When you grow up, I'll marry you.

168
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:47,470
I only tagged along for some fun.

169
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,551
Who knew...

170
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,750
Who knew that you'd plan so meticulously?

171
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,961
You wouldn't even spare a young boy.

172
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,461
I'm just concerned that he might
get caught up in unnecessary romances.

173
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,383
It's said that Second Sister-in-law
is the most jealous of all.

174
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,131
Why do I think that you're even worse?

175
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,975
Fourth Brother!

176
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:09,441
You wouldn't understand
even if I explained it to you.

177
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:12,902
In the entire world, you're the last one
to know anything about women.

178
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,750
Young Master, you're awake?

179
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,144
Qing Qiu?

180
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,880
Young Master, what are you looking for?

181
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,793
I'm looking up a place called Qing Qiu.

182
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,311
Qing Qiu?

183
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:04,278
What a strange name.

184
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,375
I have accompanied Young Master to school
every day but I've never heard of it.

185
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,309
Young Master, stop looking it up.

186
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,903
Let's ask your teacher later.

187
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,947
You're right. I can ask
my teacher about it.

188
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,797
You haven't heard of it either?

189
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,267
No.

190
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:35,099
I've read thousands of books,
but I've never seen Qing Qiu in any book.

191
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:01,421
My dear, what brings you here?

192
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:07,115
Aren't you afraid to be
beaten up by your father?

193
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:10,857
My father's given up on me.

194
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,485
Has my second brother
gotten over it already?

195
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:17,484
He won't try to hinder you anymore?

196
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:19,625
No, it's not that.

197
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,849
It's just that my father knew

198
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:26,307
Lord Dong Hua wouldn't have me,
no matter what I did.

199
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:31,187
It doesn't matter if he tries
to stop me or not.

200
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,597
Silly girl.

201
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,224
I thought that you'd feel better
after you cried.

202
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:49,710
But you still can't forget him?

203
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:54,293
There's no way I could forget him.

204
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:59,822
Even if he speaks to me cruelly
or bullies me

205
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,431
I just can't forget him.

206
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,841
If you were told to forget
the Crown Prince, could you?

207
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,870
I should be more empathetic.

208
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,615
You still haven't answered me.

209
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,802
Could you do it?

210
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,471
I couldn't.

211
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,652
Old Phoenix, why are you
eavesdropping on us?

212
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,615
Little Princess.

213
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,937
High God Mo Yuan and I have been
standing here for quite some time.

214
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,913
You should have stepped aside.

215
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:51,988
How could you eavesdrop on women?

216
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,059
How rude!

217
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,493
You're finally awake?

218
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:58,038
Feng Jiu!

219
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:00,495
How can you be so rude to my mentor?

220
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,434
My apologies, High God.

221
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:08,326
When I saw you standing there...

222
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,846
I haven't recovered from my surprise.

223
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:15,200
After all, I've seen you asleep in
Yan Hua Cave for 70,000 years

224
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,732
so now, seeing you awake, I...

225
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:24,088
No, I mean, now that I see you so
energetic and awe-inspiring

226
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,798
I couldn't adapt quickly enough.

227
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:27,201
Please forgive me, High God.

228
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,307
It's fine.

229
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,161
You happen to be here today,
so why don't you join us for some wine?

230
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:38,252
Mo Yuan once took a few urns of
my thousand-year-old wine.

231
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,551
We can enjoy them today.

232
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,182
Good. Wine can drown one's sorrow.

233
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:44,194
And make you feel even worse.

234
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:49,830
I'll leave the sorrows for tomorrow then.

235
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:07,863
I still remember that you asked me for
this wine as Qian Qian's birthday gift.

236
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,119
Exactly.

237
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,692
I also remember that.

238
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,219
It's a pity that I was captured by
Master's admirer, Goddess Yao Guang

239
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,786
before I could even take a sip.

240
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:18,246
She had me locked me in a water cell

241
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,954
so I spent my birthday
in there that year.

242
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,112
How unforgettable.

243
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:25,364
Really? Did that happen?

244
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,577
Let's not talk about someone

245
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:28,801
who's already in
the realm of nothingness.

246
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,476
I was wrong to bring her up.

247
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,038
I'll punish myself with a cup of wine.

248
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:41,900
Old Phoenix, tell me
about Lord Dong Hua's past.

249
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:46,903
Dong Hua?

250
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:51,276
He's even worse than Mo Yuan
in terms of celibacy.

251
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,760
Why is he said to be celibate again?

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,327
Is he a man or not?

253
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,784
Xiao Jiu.

254
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,584
You have to get this straight.

255
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:05,258
The man you're in love with
was once the God of Heaven and Earth.

256
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:07,556
He's a remarkable man.

257
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:11,673
Anyway, I'm quite impressed by you.

258
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:14,840
Of all man, you had to choose him.

259
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,111
You're not to criticize him.

260
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:22,873
Your little lady is nowhere near
as good a drinker as you are.

261
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:26,188
It's good that she can't drink
so she gets drunk faster.

262
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:32,423
But Zhe Yan, do you know why
Lord Dong Hua stays celibate?

263
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:34,547
It's for the sake of all realms.

264
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,314
Exactly.

265
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,986
It's for the sake of all the realms.

266
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,473
When I came here with Yan Zhi
a few days ago

267
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,531
I could still head up
the mountain freely.

268
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:14,441
Now that the divine energy is here,
it's so hard for me to get close.

269
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:21,269
This means that High God Mo Yuan
has been restored to his body.

270
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,739
What are you doing up here?

271
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,413
Nothing much.

272
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:41,907
I just felt that Kunlun Mountain
was restored to its former glory

273
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,406
so I came to take a look.

274
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:46,265
High God Mo Yuan's spirit
has returned to his body.

275
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:49,781
High God Zhe Yan,
High God Bai Zhen of Qing Qiu

276
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,760
and that Lady High God are here.

277
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,645
It really is true then.

278
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,788
Thank you for telling me.

279
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,848
This person is so weird.

280
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:12,013
He's not even happy to hear
that High God Mo Yuan has returned.

281
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,811
Could he be... of another tribe?

282
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,064
Perhaps?

283
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,182
Xiao Jiu.

284
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:32,955
Good morning, Auntie.

285
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,711
It's already late in the day.

286
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,826
Bai Zhen and Zhe Yan
have been waiting for you.

287
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,097
They are waiting for me?

288
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,741
Yes, you should know that
the Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu

289
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,191
are busy preparing for
my wedding with Ye Hua.

290
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:46,769
You have to take my throne

291
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:49,491
so it's time you sort yourself out
and head back to Qing Qiu.

292
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,220
You'd have me take your throne?

293
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:59,167
You're the only girl of your generation
in our entire clan.

294
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,950
Who else is to take the throne but you?

295
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,673
You also want me to give up on Dong Hua?

296
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:07,378
I didn't say that.

297
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,737
You're marrying into the Celestial Tribe
so you can't keep the throne.

298
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,028
You won't be able to look after
our people in Qing Qiu

299
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,954
after you're married into
the Celestial Palace.

300
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:20,864
However, if I wish to marry
Lord Dong Hua

301
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:22,922
I'll also have to marry into
the Celestial Palace.

302
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:25,272
I also won't be able to
look after our people in Qing Qiu.

303
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:30,047
Auntie, you know this but
you still want me take your throne?

304
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:33,791
You mean to make me stay
in Qing Qiu forever, don't you?

305
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,921
Xiao Jiu, it's best for you
to forget him.

306
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,785
But you said last night that

307
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:47,027
you wouldn't ever be able to forget
Crown Prince Ye Hua either.

308
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,531
Because you like him.

309
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:54,343
Why would you have me do
what you can't do?

310
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,809
Xiao Jiu, listen.

311
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:10,119
You and Dong Hua are not meant to be.

312
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,394
Why do you keep pushing it?

313
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,363
I thought that after last night
I at least had your support.

314
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:22,242
Even if everyone in our family
tries to tie me down

315
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:25,660
only you would untie me

316
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,881
and let me try again
to make Lord Dong Hua like me.

317
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:38,660
I don't want to become the Queen.

318
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,366
Once I become the Queen, I can never
come to the Nine Heavens again!

319
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,506
Xiao Jiu!

320
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,743
Xiao Jiu!

321
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:53,972
Xiao Jiu!

322
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,122
It still didn't work?

323
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,023
All I told her was to become
the Queen of Qing Qiu

324
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,204
and she broke down in tears.

325
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:09,847
The two of you, one fell in love
too soon and the other too late.

326
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,691
Forget it. Leave her to me.

327
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,376
I'll bring her home safely.

328
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,821
Tell Second Brother not to
be too harsh on her.

329
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:19,578
Don't worry.

330
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,338
I know what to do.

331
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:24,188
You're her aunt so you feel bad for her.

332
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:27,609
I'm her fourth uncle, how could I
not feel bad for her?

333
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,317
Zhe Yan is worried about Mo Yuan's health

334
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:32,576
so he will stay in Kunlun Mountain
for a few more days.

335
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,648
I'll get going now.

336
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:34,691
All right.

337
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,038
Would you like to see A-Yin?

338
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,614
Yes.

339
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,038
So would I.

340
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:03,432
This might be the last chance
I get to see her.

341
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:07,182
Isn't the Crown Prince going
to marry her soon?

342
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,759
The wedding invitation will surely
be sent to Grand Ziming Palace.

343
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,203
My Lord, you can see her then.

344
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:24,893
I can't wait until then.

345
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,606
You can't wait until then?

346
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:29,086
Why not?

347
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,233
Aren't they getting married soon?

348
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,471
What are you looking at?

349
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,200
Young lady, you're ruining
your pretty face with all that crying.

350
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,973
That's quite a strange sight
in Kunlun Mountain.

351
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:05,060
You dare to say that I'm ruining my face?

352
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,795
I'll keep crying until
you can't bear to watch me.

353
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:14,003
Go ahead.

354
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:18,013
You're the one who is upset, not me.

355
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,721
Is this cave pretty?

356
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,726
It is very pretty to me.

357
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,861
What a boring man.

358
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:48,363
Indeed, how boring.

359
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:52,220
I said that you're a boring man.

360
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,931
I know.

361
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,229
I'm also talking about myself.

362
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:02,452
Here I stand before the cave and as
I look back tens of thousands of years...

363
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:09,426
I realize just how long
and boring my life has been.

364
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,617
- Good baby...
- Ghost Lord.

365
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,683
Did you get to see the Crown Prince?

366
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:37,365
I didn't.

367
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,982
You didn't?

368
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:42,769
Did you not see the Heavenly Lord
or Lord Dong Hua either?

369
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:46,805
Why not?

370
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:49,634
Didn't you visit the Celestial Tribe
because you were worried that

371
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,162
once Father breaks out of the bell

372
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:55,136
he will burn all four seas
with crimson hellfire?

373
00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,717
Now that the Ghost Realm is in chaos

374
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:02,780
the clan leaders can't suppress
the riots anymore.

375
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,792
Li Jing, we have no time to lose.

376
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:11,229
If Father really breaks out of the bell
our people will all support him.

377
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:14,236
By then, it will be too late to ask
the Celestial Tribe for help!

378
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,440
I know.

379
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:20,625
Li Jing, tell me more.

380
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,329
Let me know what you think.

381
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,394
Otherwise, I'll be worried sick!

382
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:33,634
Yan Zhi, do you know that A-Yin and
the Crown Prince will soon be married?

383
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:36,103
They are already engaged.

384
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:41,403
This is also a marriage bond
between the Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu.

385
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:46,403
It will be the most glamorous
wedding in all the realms.

386
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:58,737
I had once thought that
as a prince of the Ghost Tribe...

387
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:02,933
I'd give the woman I love
the best wedding ever seen.

388
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:09,614
Yet it seems so ridiculous
when compared to Ye Hua.

389
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:16,531
Li Jing, I know that
all you care about is High God Bai Qian.

390
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,510
But...

391
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:25,528
Now that High God Mo Yuan
has been revived...

392
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:32,808
A-Yin must be so thrilled
in Kunlun Mountain.

393
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:36,199
High God Mo Yuan has been revived?

394
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:38,865
That's good.

395
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:41,728
Li Jing, we'll tell High God Mo Yuan

396
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:46,414
that our lives enhance
the powers of our father.

397
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:51,220
Inform Kunlun Mountain that
our father's power increased

398
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,324
after the death of Li Yuan.

399
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,700
The bell won't keep him
sealed for much longer.

400
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,347
We can't tell them.

401
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:59,246
Why not?

402
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:04,971
Yan Zhi, have you wondered
who should seal him back up

403
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,336
if Father breaks out of the bell?

404
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,173
It would have to be High God Mo Yuan.

405
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:13,827
The Bell of the East Emperor
was created by Mo Yuan himself.

406
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:17,164
70,000 years ago, he had him
sealed up in the bell.

407
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:19,907
He would have to do it again.

408
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:21,420
Think it through carefully.

409
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,557
If A-Yin knows that Mo Yuan has
to seal the bell again

410
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:28,278
will she allow her mentor to
be vanquished once again?

411
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:34,951
She will surely risk
her life to protect her mentor.

412
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:39,714
She is about to get married.

413
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:45,490
I don't want anything
to happen to her.

414
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,433
But...

415
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,138
As the Ghost Lord for 70,000 years...

416
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,333
I've never done anything for the welfare
of my people or the Ghost Realm.

417
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:05,298
All I've done is search
the Mortal Realm for Si Yin.

418
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,179
Now that it has come to this

419
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,226
if I still don't do anything constructive

420
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:15,772
then I really am fatuous scum.

421
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:17,634
Li Jing...

422
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:20,297
What are you talking about?

423
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,503
What are you doing, Li Jing?

424
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:54,178
Get up quickly!

425
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,996
Yan Zhi...

426
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:08,386
I entrust my child to you.

427
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:15,015
You'll soon become the last royal
family member of Grand Ziming Palace.

428
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,935
I also entrust the Ghost Realm to you.

429
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:24,055
What are you going to do?

430
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:36,270
Fiery Qilin!

431
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,421
My Lord.

432
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:50,087
Lock the princess up in the Arctic Lands.

433
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:54,520
She is not to be let out until
the Bell of the East Emperor is resealed.

434
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,594
No! I can't leave Your Lordship!

435
00:32:57,594 --> 00:32:58,647
Behave!

436
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:00,232
I can't do this!

437
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,059
Do you not regard me as your lord?

438
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,577
It isn't that...

439
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,872
You grew up with me.

440
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:17,984
Apart from my mother,
you're my closest friend.

441
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:24,076
I can only be at ease if
I entrust Yan Zhi and my child to you.

442
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:25,920
Do you understand?

443
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:32,019
My Lord, can I come looking for you

444
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,234
after I take the princess
to the Arctic Lands?

445
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,413
No.

446
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,260
After my death

447
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,538
you must assist Yan Zhi
in becoming the next Ghost Lord.

448
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:48,057
You're the luckiest magic beast
in the Ghost Realm.

449
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:53,258
With you by her side,
no one will dare harm Yan Zhi.

450
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:55,659
Without my father...

451
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,517
Without me...

452
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:01,169
They will have to acknowledge
Yan Zhi as the Ghost Lord.

453
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,237
Take the princess away now!

454
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,538
- Yes.
- Yes.

455
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:25,094
My Lord...

456
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:26,181
Leave!

457
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,911
Seven days...

458
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,356
Just give me seven days.

459
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:57,360
I can surely pull this off.

460
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:13,547
Ruoshui River has been churning
so fiercely these days.

461
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:15,949
I wonder why.

462
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,286
It can't be that simple.

463
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:20,360
We have to stay alert.

464
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,710
More visitors are here!

465
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,389
Serve tea!

466
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:49,353
Zhe Yan, quit fooling around.

467
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:50,610
I want to sleep for a while.

468
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,728
I didn't sleep well last night...

469
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:57,047
I'm here to discuss a serious matter.

470
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,900
What serious matter could possibly
bring you to Kunlun Mountain?

471
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,675
Mo Yuan has set the date
for his meditation.

472
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:11,449
It will be in seven days.

473
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,780
I have to make him some elixir.

474
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:18,003
He is take it into meditation
to assist with his recuperation.

475
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:21,516
You have to be my assistant
for some time.

476
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,731
Master is going into meditation?

477
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,918
He's been back for 11 days now.

478
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,228
It's about time.

479
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:31,141
After all, Ye Hua's cultivation is
only enough to keep him awake.

480
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,380
He's still very frail.

481
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,375
He needs to recuperate properly.

482
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:44,235
You've been in either the pharmacy
or the elixir chamber recently.

483
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:48,914
You might not even have had time
to have some tea to quench your thirst.

484
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:52,469
If you have nothing else to do today
go and visit your mentor.

485
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:54,472
I'm afraid that once
he goes into meditation

486
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:56,639
it will be a long while
until you meet again.

487
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,844
How long is the meditation?

488
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:03,925
It might be for a few days or weeks,
it could even be 10 years.

489
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:07,467
I'll visit Master now.

490
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:13,541
Master likes peach blossoms the most.

491
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:17,384
I'll go to the back of the mountain
to get him some fresh ones for his room.

492
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:47,461
I love listening to Master
play the zither.

493
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,905
It always calms me down.

494
00:37:49,905 --> 00:37:52,353
Will I be able to become
a high immortal sooner

495
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,701
if I listen to Master
play the zither more often?

496
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:11,882
Master, I'll assist Zhe Yan
in making the elixir tomorrow.

497
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:14,849
I won't be able to see you for a while.

498
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:18,599
I'm replacing the peach blossoms
in your room with fresh ones today.

499
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,652
Peach Blossoms go bad in a day.

500
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:25,726
I've asked Sixteenth to
replace them for you daily.

501
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:32,181
You came here tonight just for that?

502
00:38:35,956 --> 00:38:39,108
Master, since you returned
to Kunlun Mountain

503
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,798
you've been so busy every day that I
haven't had a chance to chat with you.

504
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:47,648
I heard from Zhe Yan that
you're going into meditation soon.

505
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:51,764
It might take you weeks or even years.

506
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:55,530
So, I'm here to visit you.

507
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:04,744
Did I disturb you from
playing the zither?

508
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,688
No.

509
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,092
I remember when I first
came to Kunlun Mountain

510
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:12,710
I was still very immature then.

511
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,454
When I learned that you play
the zither very well

512
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,844
I pestered you for a tune every day.

513
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,186
Do you remember that?

514
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,987
I do.

515
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,871
Speaking of which,
Ye Hua has never played for me.

516
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:37,744
Does Ye Hua treat you well?

517
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:43,677
He treats me well, but it's different
from how Master treats me.

518
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:46,478
He's also very sincere.

519
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:50,625
That's good.

520
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,932
It's snowing!

521
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,775
Such coincidental mishaps...

522
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:03,536
What is High God thinking about so hard?

523
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,791
I just happen to recall that
your mentor told me

524
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,922
about his disciples' hobby of
making candied peach blossoms.

525
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:13,000
That's just for the children.

526
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,704
They are very sweet.
Does High God like them?

527
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:18,094
Really? They're very sweet?

528
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,817
That's good. Pack some for me.

529
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:23,914
Zhen has always had a sweet tooth.

530
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:28,952
He never takes medicine when
he's sick unless it's sweet.

531
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:30,934
Zhen?

532
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:34,228
When did High God get married?

533
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,144
He's not my child.

534
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:38,626
I'm talking about High God Bai Zhen.

535
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:41,914
You're right.

536
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:44,838
Compared to High God Zhe Yan,
High God Bai Zhen is indeed a child.

537
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,242
I'll have some bottled for you now.

538
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:12,976
Master, are you cold?

539
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,048
I'll shut the window.

540
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:16,577
Don't bother.

541
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,344
It's late.

542
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:25,744
Seventeenth, you should go to bed.

543
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,304
It's my fault.

544
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:30,735
I forgot that Master needs to rest well.

545
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,786
I'll take my leave now.

546
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:55,045
