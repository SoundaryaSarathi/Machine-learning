I wouldn't feel hurt by something like that.

Even real parents and kids
don't get along sometimes.

135
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,587
I've always been irresponsible and loved chicks,

136
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:42,056
and that really annoyed my conservative dad.

137
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:46,000
And I hated my dad because
I thought it was stupid

how he was just uptight and
didn't have a shred of humanity.

Even if you're related, you hate what you hate.

141
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,258
The fact that you're related just makes it worse.

142
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:55,636
Every time we approach one another, we fight.

143
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,672
My mom did whatever my dad
said, so she wasn't any help.

144
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,401
Being at home sucked.

145
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:04,935
So I decided to study real hard and get into a
good high school so I could stick around here.

146
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:06,840
What a relief.

147
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,484

being with their family is hell,

150

151
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,322
Well, I'm going to school at my parents' expense,

152
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:21,185
so I didn't really get away or anything.

153
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,059
You have a nice family.

154
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,126

They're easygoing and straightforward.

156
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:31,307
That may be a part of why Arima likes you.

157
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,537
So I like both him and you.

158
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,403
Every so often I get to thinking.

159
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:38,974
Arima's hard working side
kind of reminds me of my dad.

160
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,847
I can't like my dad, but I can like Arima.

161

better by liking him.

families get along until now.

we've been over to grandpa's place.

178
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,486
Why? Well, to go to the pool...

179
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:56,951
No, we didn't go. 

180
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,055
Dad flipped out and wouldn't let us.

181
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:04,325
What the heck are men thinking?

182
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:09,370
Come on, I'd rather shave my
head than get seduced by Asapin.

184
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:11,499
How about you? Anything new?

185
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:13,670
No, nothing's changed.

186
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,947
You're not overworking yourself,
are you? You're not tired?

187
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,343
What's this, all of a sudden?

188
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,046
Well of course, with this much
practice I'm a bit tired.

189
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,988
R..Right. Y..You can
always talk to me about anything.

190
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,792
Listening is all I can do, but...

191
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,458
What's the matter?

192
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,301
U..um...It's just that you're really
good at holding things back...

193
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,603
And I'm worried I might not
notice anything if you don't tell me...

194
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,209
Thanks.

195
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:54,481
I'm okay. I'm not pushing myself too hard.

196
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:56,876
Well, but...

197
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:00,254
I really wish I could see you.

198
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:03,221
Yeah, me too.

199
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,025
OW!

200
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:05,691
Wh..what's wrong?! Did you hit something?

201
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:07,159
I'm okay.

202
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:09,960
I think I've gotten in a growth spurt lately,

203
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,026
so my body keeps creaking.

204
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:14,661
How tall are you now?

205
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,833
Around 172 cm (5'6")

206
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:21,506
172?! What do you mean, "nothing's changed?!"

207
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,968
You should mention stuff
like that! I can't believe you!

208
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:26,442
What?! S..sorry!

209
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:30,114
But I've been getting
taller since before vacation.

211
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:32,314
But that's so cool!

212
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:33,677
I can't wait to see you.

213
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:36,122
"Cool"...?

214
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:50,028
I felt a bit insecure.

215
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:54,806
My family's still all together,
so I can only imagine these things.

217
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:59,812
But someone who was born without the things
that all of us take for granted,

219
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:03,243
has to fulfill them by herself somehow.

220
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:06,017
That's the fight she has to fight.

221
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,256
That's really...tough.
*You don't know anything about Arima!*

222
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,119
While no one could enter Arima's field
of vision, Tsubasa alone was special.

224
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:16,362
Arima's hard working side kind of reminds me of my dad.
*Because he knew somewhere in his heart,*

225
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,193
I can't like my dad, but I can like Arima.
*that they were the same kind.
Maybe Arima's more deep and*

226
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:23,832
I've been able to feel better by liking him.
*chaotic inside than I thought..*

228
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,270
Now and then... that's what I think.
*Maybe I still know only a small part of him.*

230
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:31,839
Since Arima's been gone I've
come to see so many sides of him.

231
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:34,872
How much do I really know about him,

232
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,141
and how much do I not know?

233
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,021
Do I understand him fully?

234
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,153
At times like this, I realize...

235
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:53,761
I'm really not as strong as I thought I was.

236
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,232
Without Arima, 

237
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:59,106
I get really insecure...and weak.

238
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,341
[ To Be Continued ]

239
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:02,820
What'll happen next!

240
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,754
Our family goes to visit grandpa's
house for the first time in ages.

241
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,430
And there we catch a glimpse of
the tale of mom and dad's youth.

242
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,666
I guess everyone had to be young some time.

243
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:13,799
Next time on KareKano:

244
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:15,400
Endless Continuum.
