1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was great!

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:18,930
Here.

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,810
Let's go up to the roof.

4
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,290
I'm sorry...

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,030
Huh?

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,560
I'm sorry... I didn't stop her.

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,870
Sometimes snow isn't a bad thing at all.

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,330
Because of the snow, all she had is a broken bone.

9
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,260
Put that aside, it's beautiful.

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,010
She's really pretty.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,120
Why couldn't she cry?

12
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,470
Perhaps she has a strong mind?

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Is that all of it?

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,100
Go away.

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,850
I can never forgive you.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
Are you awake?

17
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,390
Are you thristy, perhaps?

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,490
Oh yeah, I've some coffee...

19
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,650
I was wondering if I can do it too after I saw Shinichirou's dance.

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,760
Onii-chan worried about me again...

22
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,060
And I also hurted your feelings...

23
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,890
You didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,880
I was determined to do it, and you knew nothing about it.

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,340
It's wrong because I know nothing about it...

26
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,190
You were only hurt because I know nothing about it.

27
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,890
If I knew, then I could have avoided getting you hurt...

28
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,940
Did you see that yesterday?

29
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,020
Of course I did!

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,830
Hey, put that over there.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,570
Got it!

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,150
It's all my fault...

33
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,530
Things are ought to be less troublesome if everybody thinks it's their fault.

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,790
It's fine, you have nothing to do with it.

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,740
I've nothing to do with it?

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,010
You don't like that?

37
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,800
Is that some trash from the festival?

38
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,910
Did you see it?

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Nah, I was working.

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,680
You probably did, right?

41
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,190
Yup, it's was really spectacular.

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,670
I see...

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm sorry...

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,090
It's fine.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,940
Just as you said, I don't like you.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,350
Not even a tiny bit.

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,670
Nakagami-kun, that was really cool!

48
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,670
That was awesome!

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,690
You're everybody's hero, Shinichirou-kun.

50
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,670
Shut up!

51
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,030
Can you stop by my apartment after school?

52
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,520
Hey!

53
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,590
Shinichirou-kun.

54
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:06,840
Here.

55
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,210
Huh, where's your coffee?

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,590
I broke one of the cups.

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,150
It's fine...

58
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,680
Fine...? What do you mean?

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,950
What's going on with you...

60
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,150
You seems strange today.

61
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,220
Don't hate me...

62
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,630
I'm not!

63
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,340
You liar...

64
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,460
Hiromi...

65
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm sorry...

66
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm a bit off my mind...

67
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,240
Sorry, but please go home.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,780
It's a lie that my tears are beautiful.

69
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,690
Slowly... slowly...

70
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,450
Slowly... slowly...

71
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,810
I became someone that's hated.

72
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,500
I can see everything, Hiromi-san.

73
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,690
Nice shoot!

74
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,860
I'm home.

75
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,750
There's a call for you.

76
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,610
The phone.

77
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,820
Is it the publisher?

78
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,850
Yeah...

79
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,670
They want me to send in more.

80
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,760
Hey, dad...

81
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,860
When do you usually cry?

82
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,150
When my heart's trembling... Perhaps...

83
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,900
Thanks.

84
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,150
When my heart trembles...

85
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,650
Hey, what's wrong?

86
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, I want to talk to Shinichirou-kun.

87
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,110
Hiromi.

88
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,480
Shin-chan, there's some cheese cake in the fridge that someone brought over.

89
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,370
Err... The Che-

90
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,910
Let's talk right here.

91
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,360
I think I am ashamed.

92
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,580
I hate how I am now.

93
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,220
So...

94
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,420
I never wanted to give up because I've always loved you.

95
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,210
But in turn, I don't want to give you any trouble.

96
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
So, I hope you can face all this,

97
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,560
No matter if it's me, or Isurugi-san,

98
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,530
I want Shinichirou-kun to face it, and make a proper decision.

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,260
I am going to accept it too.

100
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,480
You know,

101
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,630
Hiromi, you aren't bad.

102
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,140
You're pretty cool.

103
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm an athelete, after all.

104
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,230
Shin-chan, you going out?

105
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,860
Yeah, I'm heading out for a second.

106
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,050
Hiromi-chan, too?

107
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,000
I...

108
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,360
If not, take a breather inside the living room.

109
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,030
Sure.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,310
Then...

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,200
Oh yeah, what are you having for dinner tonight?

112
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,340
Ve- Veggie stew.

113
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,370
That's great.

114
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,830
I will come over for dinner, wait for me.

115
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,340
What's wrong?

116
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,990
Nothing.

117
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,360
Sure, I'll wait...

118
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,670
Take a look at it.

119
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,610
No.

120
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,760
But I only drew it becaused Noe wanted it.

121
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,690
You got it wrong.

122
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,800
Even without me, Shinichirou can do fine.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,530
You can still draw it without me.

124
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,440
Then, let's put it this way,

125
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,410
I only drew it because I want you to read it.

126
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,040
No.

127
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,260
If you aren't gonna, I'm throwing it away.

128
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,600
If you want to, go ahead.

129
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm throwing it away.

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,660
Just go ahead, why are you even telling me?

131
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,750
Where are you throwing it to?

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,260
To the sea where Ground doesn't wish to fly to.

133
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,660
You saw it?

134
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,650
I did.

135
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,170
Noe.

136
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,120
Noe!

137
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,000
What are you doing, you idiot?!

138
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,720
Coming.

139
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,330
I've made a little bit too much fish, have some of it.

140
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,230
Err, thank you.

141
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,620
Please come in.

142
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,950
Don't worry about it.

143
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,860
No, I'll go get some tea.

144
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,250
Err...

145
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah.

146
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,100
Well, be sure to give me back my box.

147
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,940
Looks like they are delicious, obaa-san.

148
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,990
Really?

149
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,550
Thanks.

150
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:05,180
Waiting takes a lot of patience, doesn't it?

151
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,650
Thank you... Very much...

152
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,530
And I thought it's still useable.

153
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,050
I made it.

154
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,110
How is it?

155
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,460
The last page's gone.

156
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:37,130
It's fine, I will take a guess about what happened after Raigoumaru flies.

157
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,510
I...

158
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,390
I love Hiromi.

159
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,440
I know.

160
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,280
But, I drew the picture book for Noe...

161
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,260
And I only danced because of what Noe said...

162
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,100
Shinichirou thinks I can fly.

163
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,450
I do think that...

164
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,710
I...

165
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,150
I love Hiromi...

166
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
But...

167
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,850
Whenever I see you...

168
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,320
My heart trembles.

169
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,330
Shinichirou thinks I can fly,

170
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,460
That is what my wings are.

171
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,910
Let me carry you back to the hospital.

172
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,860
No.

173
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,520
But... I am worried about your leg.

174
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,570
So, please trust me.

175
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,220
It's tough...

176
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,980
Inside the pot by the side, there's a cockroach.

177
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,340
And it's painful...

178
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,780
But because I can't fly yet...

179
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Shinichirou's shoe has a cockroach.

180
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,730
I'm walking.

181
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,960
Inside the pot by the side, there's a cockroach.

182
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:14,060
Shinichirou's shoe has a cockroach.

183
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,480
Inside Shinichirou's heart there is...

184
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,220
Yuasa Hiromi!

185
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,300
Inside the pot by the side, there's a cockroach...!

186
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:43,390
Shinichirou's... shoe has... cockroach...

187
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,450
Hiromi, are you there?

188
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,130
I'm coming in.

189
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,200
Just now...

190
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,930
I did a split.

191
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,320
A 180 degrees one.

192
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,170
It's the first time I've made it.

193
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,780
Did you let Isurugi-san see the picture book?

194
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,140
Yup.

195
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,350
I want to see it too.

196
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,310
Let's go out together.

197
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:11,990
No...

198
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,080
Let's go out together!

199
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,980
No!

200
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,250
You can see it whenever you want!

201
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,200
Since, from now on...

202
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,810
I'll be by your side forever...

203
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,020
By your side forever...?

204
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,730
What's that...

205
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,070
It's just like an engagement...

206
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,010
I still haven't agreed to go out with you...

207
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,770
I want to wipe your tears.

208
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,190
As I am right now,

209
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,840
I can do it.

210
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:08,920
It's snowing...

211
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,720
Nothing...

212
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,880
Good Morning!

213
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
Morning, Noe!

214
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,680
Good Morning!

215
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,090
People can really obtain tears from people most important to them.

216
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,090
Noe, Granny probably is going to say that too.

217
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,050
If you really think about the people important to you,

218
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,490
Then the tears will flood out.

219
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,340
Hiromi!

220
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,320
Watch your side!

221
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,050
If you can understand these true tears,

222
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,820
Listen,

223
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,750
Don't just use your eyes.

224
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,720
Find the difference with your ears too.

225
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:43,670
Okay.

226
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,180
Come take a break.

227
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,150
Sure.

228
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,490
It's already time to open up!

229
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,200
Miyokichi,

230
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,610
Come on, you only came early by a tiny bit!

231
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,550
Let's go in.
