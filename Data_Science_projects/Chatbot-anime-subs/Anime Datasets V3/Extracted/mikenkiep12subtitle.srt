00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,990
. See, it has become a very interesting</font></font>

213
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,540
Likely. From that Aoyama Takeru's ability existed since birth</font></font>

214
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,470
, Even though we did not notice it before, given the severe Rose which was done in Omanohara</font></font>

215
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,610
Maybe it may be close to the lineage of us</font></font>

216
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,600
What are you saying?</font></font>

217
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,350
.Taquero ... It's impossible to be Takei-chan Mthelkma</font></font>

Takei was. We have always-chan boy who sacrifices himself for the sake of others</font></font>

219
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:15,500
But on that day when he was not able to protect his mother from the man who challenged our dojo</font></font>

220
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,240
. I have left it a deep wound in his heart</font></font>

221
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:25,180
For this reason Takei-chan possibility can not see the people they hurt during the fighting today</font></font>

222
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:35,230
Reason. Therefore, Takei-chan is not Mthelkma who want to control others to fight</font></font>

223
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,870
. Only national chattering</font></font>

224

.Currently, Takeru has lost his conscience, which follows his instinct only</font></font>

254
