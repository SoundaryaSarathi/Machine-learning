<i>[Episode 10]</i>

3
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:10,507
In my opinion

4
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:13,426
Bai Qian does not take this
marriage arrangement seriously either.

5
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:16,706
Why not have it canceled?
What do you say?

6
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:19,387
No.

7
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,887
This marriage must not be canceled.

8
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:29,866
This is a promise the Celestial Tribe
made to the Fox Clan.

9
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:34,586
How can such a fine marriage arrangement
be spoiled because of a mere snake?

10
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,146
That is true.

11
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,627
I think the Heavenly Lord's point
is reasonable as well.

12
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,787
From what I see

13
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,546
Second Prince does not have
much interest in Bai Qian either.

14
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:57,146
Bai Zhi, it would not be nice for us
to tear apart a pair of lovers, would it?

15
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,347
Yes.

16
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,866
Fox King, what do you actually think?

17
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,067
Why do you approve of
canceling the marriage

18
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,507
and not canceling it?

19
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:12,227
I think the two of you are both
stating very reasonable points.

20
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,146
<i>- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.</i>

21
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:27,266
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

22
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,426
Rise.

23
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,467
Yes.

24
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:42,266
Zhe Yan, Fox King,
this is my grandson, Ye Hua.

25
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,866
Greetings to the two of you.

26
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,467
Are you related to Mo Yuan?

27
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,146
I am not related to him.

28
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:06,146
Heavenly Lord, do you not think
your grandson and the high god, Mo Yuan

29
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,187
look exactly alike?

30
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,347
I was once perplexed by
this very question.

31
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,787
I even once thought this.

32
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,747
Mo Yuan's soul has been
scattered for 70,000 years

33
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,867
but perhaps he held on to
one last piece of his soul

34
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,706
and after 20,000 years of rest

35
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,785
he borrowed Ye Hua's identity
to make his return.

36
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,107
Borrow His Highness's identity?

37
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,987
He wouldn't.

38
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:32,346
If Mo Yuan still had
one last piece of his soul

39
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:35,146
he absolutely would not
head for anywhere else.

40
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,906
He would definitely return to
Kunlun Mountain.

41
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,906
This was only my speculation
in the beginning.

42
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,187
Later on, I set my mind at ease.

43
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:47,466
Mo Yuan ascended to high immortal
when he was 25,000 years old.

44
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:52,107
My grandson ascended when
he was only 20,000 years old.

45
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,747
This child...

46
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,706
just wanted to prove he is not Mo Yuan.

47
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,507
Ascended to high immortal
when he was just 20,000 years old?

48
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,627
The younger generation
will surpass us in time.

49
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,067
He is indeed remarkable.

50
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,346
Does Your Highness have a wife?

51
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,666
His Majesty has yet to bestow marriage.

52
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,226
Good, good.

53
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,067
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

54
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,947
Have many guests arrived
at the palace hall today?

55
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:52,666
Aside from Dong Hua Dijun who
doesn't like crowds, everyone is present.

56
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,826
- You may go.
- Yes.

57
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:01,906
Are you afraid?

58
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,507
I am not afraid.

59
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,187
All the gods are present today.

60
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,826
If I take this chance
to beg Father for mercy

61
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,747
perhaps we may have hope.

62
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:21,747
If he insists on taking your life,
I will follow you.

63
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,226
Your Highness.

64
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,627
I gave the local earth deity
at Ruoshui a token.

65
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,346
If Qing Cang shows any activity
in the next few days

66
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:45,346
I will personally take a look.

67
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,987
Should this be reported to
Heavenly Lord first?

68
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,586
Let's wait.

69
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,026
Zhe Yan, Fox King.

70
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,747
Stop.

71
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,346
Leave us.

72
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,747
- Yes.
- Yes.

73
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,747
How clever.

74
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,466
He chose a moment when so many
are present to beg for forgiveness.

75
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,226
I said this was a bad idea.

76
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,146
You said just play along,
voice my agreement

77
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:44,266
and the marriage agreement would be
broken off in a respectful manner?

78
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:47,346
Now look at this. It'll be done
in front of all these gods.

79
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:50,226
Won't Bai Qian lose
even more dignity now?

80
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,026
You can't blame me.

81
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:57,627
How was I to know this Second Prince
would have such a courageous spirit?

82
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:21,786
Sang Ji, how brazen you are.

83
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,266
You even dared to disregard my ban on
entering Evil Sealing Pagoda!

84
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:27,586
Father, I beseech you
to grant me my wish.

85
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:31,466
Shao Xing does not have much power.

86
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,547
If I did not save her

87
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,466
I'm afraid she would not
have survived the night.

88
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,706
She would have died in
Evil Sealing Pagoda.

89
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:42,667
You care so much about her fate.

90
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:47,826
You would even go so far
as to die with her?

91
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,986
Yes.

92
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:02,826
I am willing to... die with Shao Xing.

93
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:13,986
Very well.

94
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,147
I will grant you your wish.

95
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:24,106
Today, in front of these two high gods

96
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:28,547
you and this snake shall apologize
for your offenses with your deaths.

97
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:43,226
I... obey your command.

98
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:03,746
Shao Xing.

99
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:07,147
We may have only been together
for three months

100
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,866
but our time together surpasses

101
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,626
the hundreds of millennia
I lived before I met you.

102
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:15,826
Today... you will die first.

103
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,787
I will follow soon after.

104
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,807
Your Highness.

105
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,986
I...

106
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,346
am willing to...

107
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:32,866
die with you.

108
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,586
Fox King.

109
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:02,226
Look at how in love these two are.

110
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,706
It isn't as if they committed
some heinous crime.

111
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,267
Why don't you hurry and decide
if you want the marriage canceled

112
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,067
and put this matter to rest?

113
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:16,706
Since Zhe Yan pleas for leniency
on Second Prince's behalf--

114
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:17,907
You must not.

115
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,307
The Celestial Tribe is in the wrong.

116
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,971
The Celestial Tribe must be
held accountable to the Fox Clan.

117
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,866
May I speak, Father?

118
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,547
What do you want to say?

119
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:45,346
I reckon it wouldn't be a bad idea for
Bai Qian and Second Brother's marriage

120
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,027
to be put to rest.

121
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:48,226
Presumptuous!

122
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:54,067
You have no say in the marriage agreement
between Celestial Tribe and Fox Clan.

123
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,067
Please allow me finish first, Father.

124
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,427
Go ahead.

125
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,386
If you say something so impudent again,
I will punish you severely.

126
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,386
Thank you for allowing me
to finish, Father.

127
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:09,267
And thank you to Fox King
for allowing me to speak presumptuously.

128
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:13,147
Second Brother and Bai Qian's marriage

129
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,106
is one between
Celestial Tribe and Fox Clan.

130
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:17,866
It is a serious matter,
an important matter.

131
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,986
It also concerns the friendly relations
between Celestial Tribe and Fox Clan.

132
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:23,986
Since Second Brother
cannot marry Bai Qian

133
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:28,667
why not let another of respectable status
in the Celestial Tribe marry Bai Qian?

134
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,746
First, this would still be a marriage
between Celestial Tribe and Fox Clan.

135
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:34,626
Secondly, the dignity of both tribes
would remain intact.

136
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:46,506
How can the groom be so simply replaced?
Who do you take Bai Qian for?

137
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:50,466
Please do not misunderstand, Fox King.
I dare not look down upon the Fox Clan.

138
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:54,586
That is why the one of
respectable status that I speak of

139
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,667
is no other than
Heavenly Lord's grandson, Ye Hua.

140
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:00,947
Ye Hua?

141
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,027
That is correct.

142
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:06,770
It is Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince,
the next Heavenly Lord, Ye Hua.

143
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:11,746
That does sound like
a meaningful suggestion.

144
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:15,667
You are indeed an understanding person.

145
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,626
Second Brother and Bai Qian
have never met before.

146
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:21,267
Nor do they have
any feelings for each other.

147
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:25,986
Now that he has someone he loves,
he is even more unworthy of Bai Qian.

148
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,957
If Second Brother were to continue to
stand by this marriage arrangement

149
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:31,947
then it would be unjust for
Qing Qiu and the Fox Clan.

150
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,706
Indeed, it would be unjust.

151
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,787
But if it were to be Ye Hua

152
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,706
then it would be an even greater
display of Celestial Tribe's sincerity.

153
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,427
He is the future Heavenly Lord.

154
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,966
If Bai Qian marries him,
she would be the future empress

155
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,986
the most respected woman
in the Celestial Palace.

156
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:51,506
In this case, wouldn't everyone by happy?

157
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:56,067
Not bad, not bad.
Everyone would indeed be happy.

158
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,427
I actually think he is
quite a good match for Bai Qian.

159
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,067
Is that right?

160
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,787
I watched Bai Qian grow up.

161
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,506
Why would I choose the wrong man for her?

162
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:07,346
She has a very stubborn personality.

163
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,547
She was most unwilling
with the previous arrangement.

164
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,907
We finally managed to
cancel the marriage.

165
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:17,147
If you accept another
marriage arrangement without her approval

166
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,187
wouldn't matters become
even more troublesome?

167
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,147
If she is unsatisfied again,
then we'll cancel again.

168
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:30,106
Fox King and I think this is a good idea.

169
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,386
What does Heavenly Lord think?

170
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,267
Ye Hua, step forward to hear my decree.

171
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,067
Your Majesty.

172
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:52,787
I shall accept this
marriage arrangement for you today.

173
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:55,307
After the wedding date has been
settled with Fox King

174
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:56,947
you shall represent the Celestial Tribe

175
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,027
and marry Qing Qiu's
Queen of the East, Bai Qian

176
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,346
bringing her into the Celestial Palace
as your Princess Consort.

177
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,178
When you succeed the throne
as Heavenly Lord

178
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,787
Bai Qian will become Heavenly Empress.

179
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,386
I accept your command.

180
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,947
Sang Ji.

181
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,067
Yes, Heavenly Lord.

182
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,907
You are banished to the north.

183
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,907
You are demoted to
Water Lord of the North Sea.

184
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,106
I accept your command.

185
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:41,267
That brat. He was let off lightly.

186
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,986
He destroyed his life's prospects
for a woman.

187
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,386
Was it worth it?

188
00:15:55,667 --> 00:16:00,706
I still feel a bit guilty.
It does not sit well with me.

189
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:06,947
If you feel guilty,
then why don't you marry Bai Qian?

190
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,947
It would still be considered
a good arrangement.

191
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:12,626
She is no ordinary woman.

192
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,787
She is the Fox King's daughter
and Qing Qiu's Queen of the East.

193
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:17,826
If she ascends to high goddess one day

194
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,917
she would become the only
high goddess in this world

195
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,706
that nobody would dare offend.

196
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:24,386
If I had said I wanted to marry her

197
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:27,226
Fox King Bai Zhi and Zhe Yan
would not have found me worthy.

198
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,506
You do not need to explain any further.

199
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:32,826
It has been decided.
I will just marry her.

200
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,787
Guilt, guilt...

201
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,626
Why did you accept the decree?

202
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:00,427
Why wouldn't I?

203
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:05,386
Ye Hua.

204
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:07,787
I know you see it all.

205
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,586
You see what I think of you.

206
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:13,146
Since you see it all

207
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:17,826
then why do you still act this way?

208
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:23,067
What do you think I should see?

209
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,666
You should see

210
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,146
that I like you.

211
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,626
Su Jin.

212
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,027
I have always thought of you as my aunt.

213
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,707
I respect you in the same manner
I respect my mother.

214
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:58,666
You...

215
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:04,987
Do you mind
that I am older than you by 20,000 years?

216
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:12,666
But... But the woman you will be
taking as your wife

217
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,987
Qing Qiu's high goddess, Bai Qian

218
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,067
is a whole 90,000 years older than you!

219
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,027
Ye Hua!

220
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:24,866
I shouldn't have said that.

221
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,906
I know you have no other choice.

222
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,106
It is to appease Qing Qiu.

223
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,386
I was not forced to make this choice.

224
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:39,346
I have to take a wife sooner or later.
Who it is matters not.

225
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:44,027
If you are capable,
why don't you be like Bai Qian

226
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,971
and leave me no choice but to marry you?

227
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:17,906
Su Jin.

228
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:23,866
Kneeling in front of me is no use.

229
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:27,467
In the Celestial Palace

230
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,826
the only one qualified to bestow marriage
for Ye Hua is the Heavenly Lord.

231
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,906
Then I will beg Heavenly Lord.

232
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,906
Su Jin.

233
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:49,987
I have something to say to you.

234
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:52,106
Your Highness.

235
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:58,186
I raised you myself.

236
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,146
I am aware of your feelings for Ye Hua.

237
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:05,826
I also know if you were to marry him

238
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:08,146
you would surely be
wholeheartedly devoted to him

239
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,666
and take very good care of him.

240
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,346
But that is merely what I wish.

241
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:21,027
Heavenly Lord and Ye Hua's father
have very high expectations of him.

242
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:25,227
A woman who can be
granted marriage to Ye Hua

243
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,586
must be of the Celestial Tribe
or a distinguished clan.

244
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:30,987
Do you understand?

245
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:39,547
Your Highness means that
although I am a princess

246
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,467
it is in name only.

247
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,227
I have no tribe supporting me, no family.

248
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:48,467
I don't even have parents.

249
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:53,467
I am not qualified to marry
the next Heavenly Lord.

250
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,787
Is that correct?

251
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,227
That is correct.

252
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,946
I was also born from an influential clan.

253
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:09,067
It is just that in the war, for the sake
of the Celestial Tribe, they...

254
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,307
For the Celestial Tribe, they...

255
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,707
Yes.

256
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:21,826
Your entire clan did sacrifice
their lives for the Celestial Tribe.

257
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:28,186
That is why you were conferred
the title of princess and raised by me.

258
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,227
If Ye Hua had feelings for you

259
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,106
perhaps... you would
still have a chance.

260
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:41,267
But he has no feelings for you.

261
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,586
Why must you be so fixated on him?

262
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:57,467
Choose someone who will treat you well.

263
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:28,547
You've rattled me senseless.

264
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,507
That Golden Lion just now was
much more formidable than you.

265
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:33,227
Golden Lion?

266
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,547
Is it the Golden Lion that dwells in
the woods of the Ghost Realm?

267
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,346
It is very ferocious.

268
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:42,467
I'm afraid only a powerful high immortal
would be able to subdue it.

269
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:46,507
High immortal, high immortal.
Can you stop mentioning high immortals?

270
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:48,787
I don't know when I'll be
able to ascend either.

271
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:55,186
Oh, yes. What have you summoned me for?

272
00:22:55,946 --> 00:23:00,267
Dijun said you are to use your powers
to shake the small bell that he gave you

273
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,027
if there is any activity here.

274
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,547
Do you still remember?

275
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,626
I wouldn't dare forget.

276
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,346
Dijun has changed his mind.

277
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,106
He says it would be better
to use this flute instead.

278
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:13,747
This...

279
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:15,386
You don't believe me?

280
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,467
How could I dare not believe you?

281
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:23,507
You came here with Dijun.
I saw it with my own eyes.

282
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:25,787
It's just that...

283
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,946
- What should I do with this bell?
- You can just give it to me.

284
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,507
All right. Please take it.

285
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:34,227
I shall take my leave now.

286
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:42,426
Oh no. I have to hurry back
to celebrate Aunt's birthday.

287
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:57,186
Your Highness! Please spare
my life, Your Highness!

288
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,426
Your Highness!

289
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,666
Spare your life?

290
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:07,426
You know that I will take your life?

291
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:15,326
It was only because I saw your face
has a resemblance to mine

292
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:18,826
that I picked you out of
all the palace maids

293
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:21,586
and purposely sent you to serve the Lord.

294
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:25,031
Yet you dared to secretly throw out
the contraceptive decoction

295
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,891
and conceive His Majesty's child?

296
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:31,707
You are but a palace maid.

297
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:35,707
And you dare attempt to birth a prince?

298
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,666
Your Highness, it wasn't me.

299
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,547
It was His Majesty.
He really wishes to have a child.

300
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,758
I had been attending to him
for three straight months

301
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:44,547
yet he saw I was still not with child.

302
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:46,386
So, he summoned a shaman to read my pulse

303
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,826
and found out I had drank
the contraceptive decoction.

304
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:51,386
Yes, it was His Majesty!
He told me not to drink it!

305
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:52,666
Shut up.

306
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:56,906
Your Highness, I defied your wishes.
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

307
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,666
Spare your life?

308
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:08,626
If you were not with child,
perhaps I could have spared your life.

309
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:12,507
But now that you have his child
as nothing but a lowly servant

310
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:15,146
how can I spare you?

311
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:22,987
Do you want His Majesty
to be ridiculed by the whole world?

312
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:24,707
Your Highness.

313
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:28,747
Seize her.

314
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:30,227
Dispose of her cleanly.

315
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,707
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:35,426
Xuan Nu, you will meet a cruel end!

317
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:38,267
I have been loyal and devoted to you,
yet you treat me in this manner!

318
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,866
You call me a lowly servant?

319
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,106
It is only that you are
unable to bear a child yourself!

320
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,106
You envy me for

321
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,946
bearing His Majesty's child
after only three months!

322
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,067
You deserve this! It is retribution!

323
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:50,227
It is your retribution for
betraying Qing Qiu!

324
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:52,666
You will never have children
in this lifetime!

325
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:08,227
I will have you know in this very moment
what it means to meet a cruel end.

326
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,307
Toss her out to the Arctic Lands.

327
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,186
- Feed her to the snow wolves.
- Yes!

328
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:18,787
Xuan Nu, you will meet a cruel end!
A cruel end!

329
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:36,946
Aunt!

330
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,987
Aunt.

331
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,826
The little fox is back.

332
00:27:44,987 --> 00:27:47,866
I rushed back just to celebrate
your birthday, Aunt.

333
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,426
May you continue to be
the world's number one beauty.

334
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:53,826
Does it make you happy to hear that?

335
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:54,987
It does.

336
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:58,626
You are still the same,
old but playful.

337
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,227
You dare call me old?

338
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:10,707
I'll have you be a fox for a bit, then.

339
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,467
This is nice.

340
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:21,467
Who knows
where you stole it from, though.

341
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:38,787
<i>Where is Aunt going?</i>

342
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:31,826
<i>Back in the day, Kunlun Mountain was
a picture of grandeur, blanketed by fog</i>

343
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:34,027
<i>and worshipped by all the gods.</i>

344
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:37,747
<i>How come it has fallen to
such a state now?</i>

345
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:22,946
<i>So this is the legendary Kunlun Mountain?</i>

346
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,067
<i>From this day forth</i>

347
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,106
you will follow Kunlun Mountain's
God of War, Mo Yuan

348
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:37,267
as his 16th disciple, Zi Lan.

349
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,547
Thank you, Master.

350
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,666
17th disciple, Si Yin.

351
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,027
Thank you, Master.

352
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,666
Master!

353
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:56,426
This is my heavenly trial, Master!

354
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:11,547
Ninth.

355
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:13,586
Ninth!

356
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:23,987
Wait for me.

357
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,267
Master!

358
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,853
<i>Yesterday, I passed through
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods</i>

359
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:53,227
<i>and brought back for you
three peach blossom wines by Zhe Yan.</i>

360
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,866
<i>Why did you bring wine back for me?</i>

361
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:58,626
<i>Isn't it your birthday tomorrow?</i>

362
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:08,826
<i>Aunt came here in the middle of the night
just to steal some wine to drink?</i>

363
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,787
<i>Oh no!</i>

364
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:31,267
Little girl, you've followed me
a long way here.

365
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,707
Did you find a moment to admire

366
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,810
the finest sacred land
of the Celestial Tribe?

367
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,826
I will be traveling far away.

368
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:53,426
A magic technique is recorded
in this scroll.

369
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,866
I am the only one
who knows this technique now.

370
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:02,707
If I die, this technique
will be lost forever.

371
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,067
The world would be in big trouble.

372
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:14,866
This bell of yours was given to you
by Dong Hua Dijun, wasn't it?

373
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:17,987
I knew at first glance.

374
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:21,467
As for how you got this bell

375
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:26,106
if I live to return,
I will interrogate you then.

376
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,547
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

377
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:32,386
<i>Where are you going, Aunt?</i>

378
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,146
You must want to ask me where I am going.

379
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,707
You must also know

380
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:44,666
if it is something I don't want to tell

381
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,507
nobody would be able to find out from me.

382
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:54,906
Sleep here for three days.

383
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:59,146
After three ways, the barrier spell
I use to protect you will be broken

384
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:02,906
shaking the bell,
and summoning Dijun for you.

385
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:07,346
Sleep.

386
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:26,706
<i>Is the seal indeed about to be lifted?</i>

387
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,987
Save your life, immortal.

388
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:59,547
It's been 70,000 years.

389
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:04,467
Mo Yuan's soul has scattered.

390
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:08,586
But I have merely been
imprisoned for 70,000 years.

391
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:13,106
Qing Cang, do you think you can
live freely after 70,000 years?

392
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,827
Although my master is no longer here

393
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:18,027
he passed on the sealing spell to me.

394
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:20,480
I, Bai Qian, will seal you away
for another 70,000 years

395
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,811
even if I lose my life doing it.

396
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,106
You are Mo Yuan's disciple?

397
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,867
Who exactly are you?

398
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:32,547
I am Qing Qiu's queen, Bai Qian.

399
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:36,067
That is, Si Yin of the past!

400
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:01,586
Crimson hellfire?

401
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:21,306
You attempt to seal me in?

402
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,766
Only if it is Mo Yuan,
back from the dead!

403
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:38,987
I shall have your appearance
and powers repressed

404
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:41,507
and you shall live out
the rest of your life

405
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:45,907
suffering the hardships of mortality
in the mortal realm

406
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:50,947
never knowing who you really are!

407
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:35,987
<i>Just yesterday, Qing Cang was
displaying signs of waking.</i>

408
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,146
<i>How come it is so calm today?</i>

409
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:55,067
Greetings, Dijun.

410
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,507
Why are you in such a state?

411
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:58,786
Report, Dijun.

412
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:00,146
At daybreak

413
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,896
the Bell of the East Emperor did
seem to have unusual activity.

414
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:05,387
However, just as I popped
my head out to look

415
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:08,907
I was sent back down by
an extremely beautiful lady.

416
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:10,666
Extremely beautiful lady?

417
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,427
Exactly.

418
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:15,347
Was it the young lady who
came with me yesterday?

419
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:18,586
- No.
- No?

420
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:22,987
<i>Then who could it have been?</i>

421
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:26,547
Oh, yes.

422
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:29,827
The young lady who
came with you yesterday

423
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:32,586
exchanged the bell with this flute.

424
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,867
The Bell of the East Emperor
lies dormant once again.

425
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:42,226
It's likely nothing serious
will happen now.

426
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:43,947
Give me the flute.

427
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,387
Yes.

428
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:50,586
I take my leave now.

429
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,786
Who dropped this fan?

430
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:49,266
Oh well. I'll take it for now.

431
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:02,907
What is this place?

432
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:04,987
Who am I?

433
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:06,867
Where is my family?

434
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:32,067
Is this the house where your owner lives?

435
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:38,746
Who am I?

436
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:53,626
