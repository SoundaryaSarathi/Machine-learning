1
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:06,801
Hey, Nana. Do you remember
the first time we met?

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,541
I'm the type who believes
in things like fate.

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,311
So I think it was fate.

4
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,041
You can laugh if you want.

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,281
You have a new message
Unopened messages: 1

6
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:25,351
Dear God! Great Buddha! Demon Lord!

7
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:31,801
Shoji
The sakura has blossomed

8
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,161
All right!

9
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,271
E-Excuse me, this...

10
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,431
Nana! What are you shouting for?

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,011
Oh, you want to return that?

12
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,281
This man will be happy to help you.

13
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,141
Nana?

14
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:46,381
From this moment on,

15
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,981
I'll have you know,
I am no longer working here.

16
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:49,911
You're quitting?

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,391
Thank you for all that you have done
for me this past year,

18
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,891
and do give my regards
to the manager.

19
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:55,921
Oh, and tell him to be sure to transfer
the rest of the pay he owes me

20
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,151
into my bank account.

21
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:01,291
Well then. Be well.
I'll see you around!

22
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:02,961
Nana!

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,201
It's spring!
Spring has finally come!

24
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:09,401
After the long wait,
spring has arrived!

25
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:12,741
I got into my top-choice University!
Yay! Call me.

26
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,881
I got into my top-choice University!
Yay! Call me.
Oh I can't wait to see you, Shoji.

27
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,211
I got into my top-choice University!
Yay! Call me.

28
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,761
When I was darkness at that time

29
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:33,601
With trembling lips

30
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,691
In a corner of a room I cry

31
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:41,771
The more I struggle

32
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,611
The more this wound deepens

33
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:47,771
The broken promise hurt me

34
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,501
Nobody can save me

35
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:55,681
God, I have only one request

36
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,311
Stop tearing apart my love

37
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,661
I need your love

38
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:05,891
I'm a broken rose

39
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:08,831
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

40
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,001
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

41
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,771
I need your love

42
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,071
I'm a broken rose

43
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,011
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

44
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,971
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

45
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,941
I wanna need your love

46
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:30,181
I'm a broken rose

47
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,511
I wanna need your love

48
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:49,001
Well then, in celebration of
Shoji's acceptance into university...

49
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,561
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

50
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:57,011
I am so happy for you.

51
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,141
Wasn't it worth working hard
that extra year after failing the first time?

52
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:00,981
Stop bringing that up!

53
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,671
No, really. I'm happy for you, too.

54
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:04,681
I thought for sure you'd fail again.

55
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,681
You too?

56
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,051
What did you say, Koichi Sato?!

57
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:13,861
Hello? Nana?

58
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,051
What if it isn't her?

59
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,151
Did you get my email?

60
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,231
Thanks.

61
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:22,041
I guess that's proof
he hasn't been fooling around.

62
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,971
There's no way he could
ever cheat on her. It's not in him.

63
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:29,771
Yeah. I'm just having a drink with
Kyosuke and Junko at the Junction.

64
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,551
That's right,
the bar I'm always telling you about.

65
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,451
How about you, Nana?
What are you doing?

66
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,621
I was packing.

67
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:50,591
Nana says she's on her way
to Tokyo.

68
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,761
- Yes?!
- Yes?!

69
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,241
To Dad and Mom,
I'm going to Tokyo!
I'll be in touch as soon as I find a place,
so please send me the boxes
in my room.

70
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,071
I'll find new, fancy furniture
in Tokyo,
so just leave the furniture
in my room as is.

71
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,101
I'll be back from time to time!
Say hi to Nao and Nami for me.
See you, Nana

72
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,771
One ticket to Tokyo. One way.
Non-reserved seating!

73
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,411
None of the trains are on schedule
because of the snow.

74
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,381
That's okay.
As long as I get there.

75
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,071
March 519:30
I'll meet your train.

76
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:25,861
What time are you arriving?
Which train?
Let me know and
I'll wait for you at the platform!
Am I nice or what?
Shoji.

77
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:27,631
Shoji.

78
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,501
Thank you for using
the Tohoku bullet train today.

79
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,311
- Due to the snow, the train's departure, .,
- What's this? It's packed.

80
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,981
- was delayed by forty minutes.
- I wanna find a seat quickly,

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,341
so I can email Shoji.

82
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,791
Um...

83
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,301
Um, excuse...

84
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,521
What? Why did it suddenly stop?
An accident?

85
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:23,921
Are you all right?

86
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,091
I'm fine. Sorry.

87
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:31,731
I'm sorry too.
You got flattened by this, didn't you?

88
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,561
I'm fine.

89
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,201
Er... By the way...
Is this seat open?

90
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:42,501
Go ahead.

91
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,681
What a beautiful person.
More like, so cool.

92
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,881
She has an aura different
from that of a commoner.

93
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,361
She's skinny and has a small face.
Could she be a celebrity?

94
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,531
And such long eyelashes!

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,471
I envy how the loud makeup
looks good on her.

96
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,231
Beautiful people look great,
no matter what they do.

97
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:14,601
Wow, a well-worn Vivienne Westwood ring!

98
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:16,901
So cool!

99
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,781
Sorry. Is the smoke bothering you?

100
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,971
No, I'm totally fine.

101
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,621
It's not moving.

102
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:33,481
The train. It's been running like this
for a while now.

103
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:38,201
Is that so? What am I gonna do?
I'm in a hurry.

104
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,501
Really? That's a problem.

105
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,901
No, it's all right.

106
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,361
I'll send an email.

107
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:46,771
Okay!

108
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,571
Wow, you're really fast!

109
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,771
I'm amazed at what high school students
can do nowadays.

110
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,001
But I'm twenty years old.

111
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,321
Sorry. Then I guess we're the same age.

112
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,521
She's so cute when she laughs.

113
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,551
What? The same age?
No way, you don't look it. That's fraud!

114
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,201
The way you said
"high school students nowadays"

115
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,961
makes you seem a lot older!

116
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,161
Yeah, it's a habit.
I live in the analog world.

117
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:16,171
An announcement to our passengers.

118
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,731
Due to the snow, we will be
proceeding at low speeds for a while.

119
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,241
We apologize for the inconvenience

120
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,781
- this delay is causing you.
- No way!

121
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,971
How long is it gonna
take us to get to Tokyo?

122
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,411
What is the purpose of your stay
in Tokyo?

123
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,821
Nothing in particular.

124
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,841
I'm moving there.
I'll look for a job in Tokyo.

125
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,551
Really. Same for me.

126
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,991
What, you're moving there too?

127
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,391
Really? I thought you were
from Tokyo.

128
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,191
So you're not returning home
from a tour around the country.

129
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:42,261
A tour?

130
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,101
Like concerts.
You have a guitar, after all.

131
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,791
I figured you were
a professional musician.

132
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,301
So, are you in a band?

133
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,501
Back in my hometown I was.

134
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,401
That's so cool!
Where is your hometown?

135
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,881
An email.

136
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,511
Or, no, it's the phone.

137
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,951
Hello, Nana here.

138
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,551
Oh, Shoji? Yeah, that's right.

139
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,491
The train has stopped.
I've got no idea when we'll arrive.

140
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,621
Huh? You sure?
But it could be around midnight.

141
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,631
You sure it's okay?

142
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,231
Thanks.

143
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:22,531
Then I'll call you again
when I know what time we're arriving.

144
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,431
Bye-bye.

145
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,641
Is your boyfriend from Tokyo?

146
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,741
You sure are lovey-dovey.

147
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:37,151
I get it. So you're chasing after
a guy who moved to Tokyo.

148
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:37,841
You're wro--!

149
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,551
Well, I guess you're right about that.

150
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,251
Which is it?

151
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,121
Well, he's not from Tokyo.

152
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,161
We went to the same college
at our hometown.

153
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:54,161
But he came to Tokyo
a year ago to study art.

154
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,801
Why didn't you go with him then?

155
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,271
I told him that I'd go too.

156
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,381
But Shoji...
He insisted I shouldn't.

157
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:05,581
Why's that?

158
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,311
Because I have no objective
or money.

159
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,951
He says it's not wise to make
such a move without a plan.

160
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:13,381
I see.

161
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:18,491
So I tearfully stayed back and
saved up money to make the move.

162
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,931
We made a promise
that if Shoji passed

163
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,791
the entrance exams to University,
then I'd move to Tokyo!

164
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,401
When I get to Tokyo,
I'm gonna find a job

165
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,871
and give every effort
so he doesn't tell me to go home!

166
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,441
Say... What am I doing telling
all this to a stranger?

167
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:35,911
A total stranger!
What's wrong with that?

168
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,001
Tell me more.

169
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,881
From the look of things,
we've got lots of time.

170
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,881
Yeah, you have a point.

171
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,691
Then, will you hear me out
so we can kill time together?

172
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:48,851
To be honest, I was dying to talk
to someone about him.

173
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:53,061
His name's Shoji,
and he's kind, reliable, and pretty cool.

174
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,191
But when he talks,
he acts like a fool.

175
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,131
Like a fool?

176
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,021
Hey, wanna have some beer?

177
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,931
Sure, I would.

178
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,561
Two beers please!

179
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,761
Okay, then. Let's make a toast.

180
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,241
A toast to what?

181
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:08,601
Well...

182
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,871
To Shoji passing
the University exams!

183
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,411
No. that has nothing
to do with me.

184
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:16,921
Then, can we at least drink
to this unique moment?

185
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,421
Hey, I like that.

186
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,051
To two girls, the same age,

187
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:22,851
arriving in Tokyo at the same time
on the same train.

188
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,361
That's quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

189
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,231
And to one more thing.

190
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,391
My name is Nana too, Nana.

191
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,961
Do you remember
the first time we met?

192
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,701
Before we knew it,
there was a snowstorm outside.

193
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,611
The train was stop and go all the way,

194
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:50,271
and it took us five hours
to get to Tokyo.

195
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,141
But I wasn't at all bored.

196
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,621
I kept talking about myself

197
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:02,031
and didn't bother to ask
about you at all.

198
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,371
But knowing you,

199
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,201
you likely would've just changed
the subject or something, anyway.

200
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:18,941
Nana!

201
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,781
Shoji!

202
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:41,931
Why are you crying?

203
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,131
You're so mean to be laughing!

204
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,711
You really had a tough time.
Five hours, right?

205
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:49,871
But you know...

206
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:55,141
What's the matter?

207
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,451
I became friends with
the girl sitting next to me.

208
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,621
Oh?

209
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,691
But she's not here,
even though we got off the train together.

210
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,251
Has she already left?

211
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,961
I should've given her
my cell number and stuff.

212
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:10,221
You didn't do that?

213
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,061
Then you can hardly
call yourself friends.

214
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,601
Don't cry. Kyosuke and Junko
are waiting downstairs.

215
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,341
Jun-chan!

216
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:30,011
There's no snow
on the ground in Tokyo.

217
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,851
So. What do you want to do?

218
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,721
Wanna go have a drink?

219
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:37,591
But I gotta tell ya,
I'm really tired.

220
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,091
And it's one o'clock
in the morning.

221
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:41,191
Well then, I guess that means
we'll go home directly.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,561
I'm really sorry.

223
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:44,931
I mean, you guys came all
the way out here to meet me and all.

224
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,931
Hey, there's no reason
for concern.

225
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,061
We can get together any time
we want to now.

226
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,101
We'll take a rain check
on the party.

227
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,631
It feels so good to be together,
the four of us.

228
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,671
Just like old days back
at our specialty school.

229
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:02,211
More than just a nostalgic feeling,
a sense of relief.

230
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,911
It's like this is my second family.

231
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:09,751
Here I am finally, in Tokyo,
with all of you.

232
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:14,961
See you!

233
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:15,891
Good night.

234
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:20,561
Huh?

235
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,541
What are you doing, Nana?
Let's go.

236
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,501
Ah, right.

237
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:24,571
Shoji Endo

238
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,611
Shoji Endo
Wait a minute.

239
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,281
Is it all right to be staying over...

240
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,541
- like it's the natural thing to do?
- Come on in.

241
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,041
Though the place is a mess
since you came on sudden notice.

242
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,751
Sorry 'bout that.

243
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:36,581
Huh?

244
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,051
I'm being a bother by suddenly
coming like this, aren't I?

245
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:44,361
I was hoping to stay with Jun-chan
until I found my own place.

246
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,491
But that wouldn't be
too considerate, would it?

247
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,861
Those two are living together now.

248
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:53,201
I had no idea!
Jun-chan never told me!

249
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,001
Since when?!

250
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,001
I wonder.

251
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,441
It was like, before I know it,
Kyosuke had moved to Junko's place.

252
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,101
I see. I never knew.

253
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,181
Hey, you've still got
your shoes on!

254
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,171
Tokyo is not a foreign country,
you know!

255
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:09,981
They always did have the composure
of a middle-aged couple.

256
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,181
"Middle-aged couple"?

257
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,251
I guess they just bonded more
after moving here.

258
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,391
That's totally great!

259
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,111
What?!

260
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,491
Hey, are you taking
my clothes off already? You pervert!

261
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,031
I wonder, can Shoji and I
gradually become like that too?

262
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,661
I wanna make up for
all the time we were apart.

263
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,431
I'm so happy.

264
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,701
I should be back around 6.
When you go out,
leave the key in the mailbox. Shoji

265
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,281
Damn! I wanted to be sure to
get up early

266
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,751
and make breakfast for him.

267
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:47,421
I'll make up for it
before Shoji gets back.

268
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,861
Doing stuff like this makes me feel
like a newlywed wife.

269
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:03,471
Just to imagine how happy I'd be
to help him out like this every day...

270
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,641
I wonder if it would be all right
if I just stayed here.

271
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,611
Shoji would surely appreciate it.

272
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,511
Hi! How was your day?!

273
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,781
Uh... hi.

274
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:18,981
This is pretty tasty.

275
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,051
What's with that surprised look?

276
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,321
Because you come across as the type
who doesn't do much cooking.

277
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,961
Th-That's not true.

278
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,651
Just joking.
But this is really good.

279
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:28,891
I'm impressed.

280
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,461
This was worth the three hours
it took me to make it.

281
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,101
By the way, how did it go with
the real estate agent?

282
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:36,761
Did you find a place?

283
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,071
I didn't have time today,
so I couldn't go.

284
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,971
Why? Oh, of course.

285
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,231
You were looking for a job.
Did you find something?

286
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,811
That's right.
I've gotta look for a job.

287
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,581
Don't tell me you were sleeping
the whole time.

288
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,321
No way! I cleaned the house,
did laundry and stuff,

289
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,081
it was a super productive day!

290
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,421
You serious?

291
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,391
You didn't come all the way
to Tokyo to do that, did you?

292
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,401
You promised me you'd find
a job that would allow you

293
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:07,031
to make it on your own,
and give it every effort, right?

294
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,441
How can you say such a thing?!

295
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,631
I did this all for you, Shoji!

296
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,101
I shouldn't have talked
to him like that.

297
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,141
It's like I'm trying to
make him feel guilty.

298
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,351
Thanks for the meal.

299
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,121
I'll clean up.

300
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:31,951
It's all right.

301
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,421
I can take care of myself.

302
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,201
I'm pathetic.

303
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,071
I'm gonna take a bath.

304
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,021
I'll never make it like this.
He's just gonna hate me.

305
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,171
What am I to do?

306
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,611
What can I do to keep him
liking me?

307
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:31,811
Hey Nana.

308
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,111
Wanna take a bath together?

309
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,281
Not a chance!

310
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:40,361
Oh, give me a break.

311
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:42,351
What are you playing Miss Innocent for,
at this point?

312
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:43,891
Well, it's embarrassing!

313
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,431
What's embarrassing?

314
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:46,871
I mean like...

315
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:49,541
Well, being an old couple,
you and Kyosuke may have long forgotten

316
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,401
the embarrassments in a relationship.

317
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,731
An old couple?

318
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,201
The bathroom's brightly lit
and it's small.

319
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,171
He'll be seeing every inch of me.

320
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,571
There's no way!

321
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:00,811
Keep your voice down.

322
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:05,411
Maybe living with my boyfriend
isn't for me.

323
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:07,451
You know,
I started going out with Shoji and

324
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:09,391
then right away
we became long-distance lovers.

325
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:14,861
So there's still a bit of uneasiness
and nervousness when we're alone.

326
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,091
What are you talking about?

327
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,701
When you were hanging around
as friends back home,

328
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,561
there was nothing to
be nervous about.

329
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:23,061
Being friends and being lovers
is different!

330
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,931
I don't want to show
my boyfriend my bad side!

331
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,871
I think it's a bit late for that.

332
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:33,511
By the way, I gotta go to
the real estate agent by the station.

333
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,281
Could you join me?

334
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,321
Out of the question.
I have to work this afternoon.

335
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,921
Come on. I won't know what
to do by myself, Jun-chan.

336
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:41,911
Get a hold of yourself!

337
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,721
You are going to start living alone.

338
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,361
You have got to learn
to do things on your own!

339
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,001
She's right. I don't think
I can live with Shoji,

340
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,201
but living alone might
be even harder.

341
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,931
Ando Real Estate

342
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,471
You won't find a nice place for
fifty thousand yen a month or less.

343
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,281
If I work hard,

344
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,441
I might be able to afford
a bit more for the rent,

345
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,981
but can't I get a better deal
on the deposit?

346
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:12,791
Hmm... if you don't mind living
in an older building.

347
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,511
No deposit!

348
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:20,481
And it's very reasonable for this space!
I can have pets, too?

349
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,161
Do you wanna go and see it?

350
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:22,991
Yes!

351
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:30,461
It's not often you find
a good deal like this!

352
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,781
There it is.
That old brick building.

353
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:49,791
That mansion,
built long before I was even born,

354
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,051
had such a high-class feel to it.

355
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:57,561
I fell in love with the elegant
western design the moment I saw it.

356
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:05,131
The only problem was that
the seven-story building had no elevator.

357
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
Being a country girl,

358
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:13,781
the riverside location and
green environment was an added bonus.

359
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:20,951
So what do you think?
Do you like it?

360
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,781
The view from the window
is great, isn't it?

361
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,091
It's not often you find
a good deal like this.

362
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,521
You know,
you are a very lucky girl.

363
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,211
Hey, Nana.

364
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,251
Do you remember how we used
to stand side-by-side by the river,

365
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,481
gazing at the lights
that colored the water?

366
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:03,901
That song you were singing.
Sing it for me again.

367
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:13,061
I reached into the sky

368
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:19,581
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

369
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:24,951
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

370
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:30,951
Like colorful balloons

371
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,061
I'm alone

372
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:36,791
My hand had no place to go

373
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:43,431
And gently you took it

374
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,601
Starless night

375
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:48,801
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

376
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:54,611
I want to feel your warmth

377
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,481
Tears are falling down

378
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,581
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

379
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:07,081
Of your hand holding mine
