1
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,714
Just a little farther till we're at
Kame House. Hang in there, Gohan.

2
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:23,874
Right.

3
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:42,059
H- hey, over there...

4
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,076
T- that's the direction
we just came from.

5
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:55,413
What could it be?
It's awfully bright. A star?

6
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,405
No, it doesn't appear to be a star...

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,354
This can't be!

8
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,382
T- this is impossible!

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,731
W- what is that? There's
a tremendous <i>Ki</i> rising up.

10
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,402
Father's <i>Ki</i> hasn't risen again, right?

11
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,739
N- no. This nasty feeling
is coming from the other one's <i>Ki</i>.

12
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,904
And you know, that's an incredible
amount of <i>Ki</i>. What's going on!?

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,352
F- Father...

14
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,856
Gohan!

15
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,204
I- I'm going back.

16
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,386
I'm going back.

17
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:45,724
G- going back? You mean
to where Goku is?

18
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:53,732
I can tell... Father is in trouble.
He's going to die if this keeps up...

19
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,400
What are you talking about, Gohan?

20
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,671
There's no way Goku- your father
is going to die, is there?

21
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:02,574
Besides, even if we go back there,

22
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,676
we can't do anything against
a guy with a <i>Ki</i> that incredible.

23
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:08,012
Yeah, I know.

24
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,682
Even so...

25
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:11,842
Even so!

26
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:17,355
I absolutely have to go back there!

27
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:18,686
Hey!

28
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,682
Wait up, Gohan!

29
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:42,046
How about it, Kakarrot?

30
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:44,537
You're finished now!

31
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:50,884
What's going on!?

32
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:09,167
A Great Ape?
A Great Ape monster?

33
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:18,016
Let me give you some good news.

34
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:23,010
A Saiyan who has become a Great Ape
has ten times more battle power!

35
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:33,031
Goku, there's a great ape monster
that comes out during the full moon.

36
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:38,036
You must not go outside. As long
as you stay asleep, you'll be safe.

37
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:43,374
I- I'll make it so that
tail of yours never grows back.

38
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,865
It's something of a nuisance.

39
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,546
<i>S</i>- <i>so that's it!</i>
<i>l finally get it!</i>

40
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,994
H- how awful...

41
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,895
The monster that crushed
Grandpa to death...

42
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,604
...and the monster that showed up
at the tournament grounds,

43
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,007
and busted everything up...

44
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,168
...that was me!?

45
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:28,686
<i>l'm sorry, Grandpa.</i>
<i>This guy is incredible.</i>

46
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:34,025
<i>l'll probably have to use up all of my Ki,</i>
<i>or I won't be able to beat him.</i>

47
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:39,361
<i>Once I die, and go back over to the</i>
<i>Next World, l'll go apologize to you.</i>

48
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,379
What is that monster!?

49
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,049
I- it's outrageously huge!

50
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:03,851
That monster's clothes're the same
as the Saiyan's! Is he that Saiyan!?

51
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,495
I'll show you, Vegeta!

52
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm going to feed you your fill
of me and the earth's <i>Genki Dama</i>!

53
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,008
You're at last going to use
the <i>Genki Dama</i>, are you?

54
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,678
Still, with your body
as ragged as it is,

55
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,511
this is going to put
too much of a burden on it.

56
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,036
<i>K</i>- <i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

57
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,486
What's the matter?

58
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,220
Can't you even get away?

59
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,390
Die!!

60
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,078
What is it?

61
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:42,687
Is anything appearing?

62
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:47,692
I'm starting to see some light.
Goku's <i>Ki</i> has subsided.

63
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,922
Goku-<i>sa</i> has won, right?

64
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:55,366
--Goku!
--Son-<i>kun</i>!

65
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:56,367
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

66
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,369
I- is he dead?

67
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,972
No, he is not dead.

68
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:04,308
What the hell has happened?

69
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,644
I- impossible!

70
00:08:06,644 --> 00:08:11,315
You mean the Saiyan has transformed,
even without the moon!?

71
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:16,320
It's hopeless now! There's no way
he can stand up to that monster!

72
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,390
What about Gohan-<i>chan</i>!?
What's Gohan-<i>chan</i> doin'!?

73
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,051
Where's Gohan-<i>chan</i>!?

74
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:33,064
There's someone else there...

75
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,008
It's Yajirobe!

76
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,568
What is he doing!?

77
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:45,574
Come on, Yajirobe!
Why aren't you helping Son-<i>kun</i>!?

78
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,020
Hey!

79
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,356
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

80
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,584
Chichi!

81
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,433
<i>Father!</i>

82
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:11,034
<i>Goku, he's your son, all right.</i>

83
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:20,548
What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you manage anything!?

84
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:25,389
H- he's so fast
for as big as he is!

85
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,393
I don't have enough time to mentally
focus so I can create a <i>Genki Dama</i>!

86
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:33,731
And even if I went to a 5X <i>Kaio-ken</i>,
it wouldn't be any use against him!

87
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:39,070
Hmph. If you're not going to come
at me, then I'm coming after you!

88
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,565
I- I just need ten seconds!
I need some time to concentrate!

89
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,029
T- that's it!

90
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:22,880
Tenshinhan, I'm going
to borrow your technique!

91
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,542
<i>Taiyo-ken!!</i>

92
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:40,887
Now, while his eyes
are blinded by the glare!

93
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:45,065
M- my eyes! My eyes!

94
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,748
All right...
At this distance...

95
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:12,697
T- the Land...

96
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,365
...the Seas...

97
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,368
...and...

98
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:21,372
...all living things...

99
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:26,537
Each of you, share with me
just a little bit of your <i>Genki</i> energy!

100
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,869
<i>l beg you!</i>

101
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,854
Dammit, that was an insolent stunt!

102
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,863
<i>J</i>- <i>just a little longer...</i>

103
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,696
<i>Just a little more,</i>
<i>and I can form a Genki Dama...</i>

104
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,696
<i>W</i>- <i>what's he doin'?</i>

105
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,889
<i>He's starting to get</i>
<i>his sight back.</i>

106
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>Still, at this distance,</i>

107
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,572
<i>l'll be able to launch the Genki</i>
<i>Dama before he can attack.</i>

108
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,513
Dammit!

109
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:11,003
Where are you!?

110
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:16,687
Where are you!?
Where did you go!?

111
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,679
It's useless to run away from me!
I can sense your presence!

112
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:47,882
Dammit!

113
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:55,548
<i>l've gathered the Genki energy together.</i>

114
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,388
Why, you!

115
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,729
<i>He found me! Please,</i>
<i>let there be enough time!</i>

116
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:20,010
I-it's done. I've collected the
<i>Genki</i> energy from all earthlings.

117
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:27,684
All right!

118
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,353
Take this!

119
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,382
W- what was that?

120
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:53,543
What happened?

121
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:48,372
I- I never expected him to attack like that...
T- that was an awful miscalculation.

122
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:53,036
What a development... The <i>Genki Dama</i>
I worked so hard to make has vanished...

123
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,548
Hmph, you're a tough bastard.

124
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:01,040
But you appear to be
near your limit. I can tell.

125
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:07,057
H- he's got me. There ain't
no way even I can win now.

126
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:11,323
I used up most of my <i>Ki</i>
on that <i>Genki Dama</i>.

127
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,341
Now what are you going to do!?

128
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,310
Goku's <i>Ki</i> is shrinking fast!

129
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,313
F- Father!

130
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,543
Hurry! We're almost there!

131
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,667
Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

132
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,229
Looks like I carelessly stepped
on you and crushed your leg.

133
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,068
Well, this time, I'll
carelessly crush your heart.

134
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,586
This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

135
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:47,358
Even if you were to come back to life again,
this planet won't be here when you do!

136
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,428
D- damn...
I'm utterly defeated...

137
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:54,365
I never imagined there'd be
this much difference in our power...

138
00:17:54,365 --> 00:18:00,638
I'm glad there was someone
so strong... but if I die...

139
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,266
...it'd be so frustrating...

140
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:10,205
Die!!

141
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,562
That's what you call
the weasel's last fart...

142
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:38,575
Now, I ain't even got enough
strength left to blow my nose...

143
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,066
D- do as you like...

144
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,581
W- why, you!

145
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,694
Kakarrot!

146
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:02,098
How dare you...
how dare you scar my face!?

147
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:16,039
I'm going to squeeze you to death!

148
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,065
<i>Having been wounded,</i>
<i>Vegeta was burning with anger.</i>
