<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
In the beginning,
I picked you up from here.

4
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,319
When I found you, you were barely moving.

5
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,360
You didn't wake up
even after I took you home.

6
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,479
I thought I had taken home a dead snake.

7
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,159
<i>I was nursing my wounds here.</i>

8
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>I could have fully recovered
in three days.</i>

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,919
<i>Who knew you'd take me home
and apply yellowseed herbs on me?</i>

10
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,759
<i>Even now, my wounds aren't healed yet.</i>

11
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
But you can't understand
even if I tell you this.

12
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,719
You can leave if you want.

13
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,240
But if you really go, I won't have
anyone to talk to anymore.

14
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,759
A kingfisher bird?

15
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,919
Little bird.

16
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,199
Are you injured?

17
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,919
You are so much like
the one that flew away.

18
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,280
If you don't mind,
then come home with me.

19
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,840
This bird is so pitiful.
I'm taking it home with me.

20
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,639
To you, am I any different
from this bird?

21
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,120
<i>You are an unmarried woman.</i>

22
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,480
<i>Yet, you've shared the same bed</i>

23
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,879
<i>with the Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince
for three months.</i>

24
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,920
<i>If I don't marry you</i>

25
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>I'm afraid nobody else
would dare touch you.</i>

26
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,839
Golden Lion?

27
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,720
Your Highness.

28
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,279
You are still alive.

29
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,600
Where have you been
over the past 70,000 years?

30
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,279
Your Highness, I left after
Second Prince took the throne.

31
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,680
Why did you leave?

32
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Have you seen Li Yuan?

33
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,040
Have you been searching for
Eldest Prince the entire time?

34
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
Yes.

35
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,240
I have been searching for
Li Yuan's whereabouts all these years.

36
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,959
Do you know where he is?

37
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,800
Has Second Prince
never told Your Highness?

38
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,319
Told me what?

39
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm afraid he's the only one
in this world who knows most clearly

40
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,600
where Eldest Prince is.

41
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,879
What do you mean by that?

42
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,519
The Ghost Lord personally led
a rebellion 70,000 years ago

43
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,399
and had Eldest Prince imprisoned
in the Arctic Lands.

44
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,800
Impossible.

45
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,680
How is it impossible?

46
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Li Jing would never do that.

47
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,480
And if it was Eldest Prince who killed
Ghost Lord's mother with his own hands?

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
What did you say?

49
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,600
Li Yuan killed Li Jing's mother?

50
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
Do not say a word, Your Highness.

51
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,079
I can sense the scent of
the Celestial Tribe.

52
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,519
Celestial Tribe?

53
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,879
You've brought
a black snake into the city?

54
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,759
That is most taboo in Zhong Rong State.

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,439
You again?

56
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,959
Miss, do you still remember me?

57
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,360
You tried to steal my fan last time.
Of course I remember you.

58
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
You thoroughly humiliated me last time.

59
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,639
Even when I'm dreaming,
I wake up with hatred.

60
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,120
Luckily, I have
come across you again today.

61
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,879
What do you want?

62
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,439
What is it?

63
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,560
What are you doing?

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,800
- I'll show everyone what you have here!
- Let go!

65
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,160
He pushed that lady to the ground.

66
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,839
Everybody, come look!
The witch is here again.

67
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,399
Witch?

68
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,040
The other day, she and another witch
stole my ancestor's heirloom.

69
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,399
For the sake of the city's people,
I have not left

70
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,759
just so I could one day
reveal this witch's true colors

71
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,279
and show you all the truth!

72
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,560
This lady sure is unlucky
for you to be so fixated on her.

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Leaving aside stealing her fan
a few days ago

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,639
you were even taught a lesson
by a beautiful lady passing by.

75
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,600
What's the matter? Gone crazy?
Come to cause a ruckus again?

76
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,000
Exactly.

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,360
Don't say I didn't tell you
what is inside this basket.

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Inside this is an evil... black snake!

79
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,680
- Black snake?
- Black snake?

80
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
A monster.

81
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,439
What's the matter? Scared now?

82
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,319
You lied to us last time.

83
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,720
Do you think we'll believe you
because you say there's a black snake?

84
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,039
If you don't believe me,
I'll lift this cloth and let you see.

85
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,120
No, no.

86
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,200
It is only a small snake.
It won't harm anyone.

87
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Miss, do you mean there really is
a black snake in this basket?

88
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,240
Yes, but it is not some evil thing.

89
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,759
There really is something evil in there!

90
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,879
- Burn it!
- Burn it!

91
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,679
- No!
- Burn it!

92
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,000
- Burn it!
- Burn it!

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,480
- Burn it!
- No!

94
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Burn it!

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,759
My ancestor's Monster Binding Rope
has finally come to use today.

96
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,320
- Burn the black snake!
- Burn it to death!

97
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Burn it to death!

98
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,200
- There really is a black snake!
- Snake!

99
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,840
- Burn it!
- Kill it!

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,039
Kill it!

101
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,200
Kill it!

102
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
- Kill the black snake!
- Kill the witch!

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,480
How outrageous.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,879
Calm down, Your Highness.

105
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,840
Look at what is inside the basket.

106
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
- Do not let her live!
- Kill them!

107
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,799
It's a dragon?

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
It's a dragon god!

109
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
Dragon god!

110
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,879
- It's a dragon god!
- It's really a dragon god!

111
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,240
- Dragon god!
- Bless us!

112
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,759
Bless us, dragon god!

113
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,639
I... Impossible.
Impossible!

114
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,159
You... You aren't a black snake?

115
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,919
<i>In this world, only you would
take me for a snake.</i>

116
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,639
You've become so big. How will I
take care of you from now on?

117
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,440
<i>Now that I've shown my true form,
the Celestial Palace will be aware.</i>

118
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
<i>Wait patiently for me for a few days.</i>

119
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,519
Miss.

120
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,519
Miss, that black dragon
once saved my grandson's life.

121
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,559
I don't have much to repay the kindness.

122
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,279
Why don't you come to
my house for a meal?

123
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,879
No need, Granny.

124
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,440
He is your savior, not me.

125
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,879
- Miss, we were mistaken about you.
- Yes, yes.

126
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,279
Miss, you must stay
so we can make it up to you.

127
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,000
That's not necessary.
If I leave too late, it will be dark.

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,759
- Miss, you must not leave like this.
- Yes, yes.

129
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,720
- If you leave, we will feel guilty.
- Thank you.

130
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,679
- Come with us.
- Miss.

131
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,080
- Thank you.
- Stay!

132
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
- Don't go, Miss.
- Miss!

133
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,600
- Miss!
- Miss!

134
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,159
Don't go!

135
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,039
We've wrongly accused the lady.

136
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,600
Just now, you said

137
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,159
it was Li Yuan who
killed Li Jing's mother?

138
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,519
That's correct. I heard Li Jing
say that with my own ears.

139
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,960
I am certain.

140
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,240
Has Your Highness never been suspicious
of Eldest Prince's disappearance?

141
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,080
No, I've never suspected Li Jing.

142
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,600
If Your Highness does not believe me

143
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,039
you can come with me
to Ghost Realm's Arctic Lands

144
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,440
to see the truth for yourself.

145
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,759
Without Li Jing's military seal,
nobody can go near there.

146
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,759
Yes, that is why Your Highness
must first steal the military seal

147
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,320
for us to be able to
rescue Eldest Prince.

148
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,559
- Steal?
- Your Highness.

149
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,799
Eldest Prince's life is in your hands.

150
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,799
What harm is there in stealing?

151
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,480
I took care of you for so long

152
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,344
but I didn't even know
you were a black dragon.

153
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,399
Since you are a dragon...

154
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,080
then go where you belong.

155
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,679
What does Your Highness
need to see me for?

156
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,320
I mentioned the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
to you a few days ago.

157
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,679
Do you remember?

158
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,960
Yes.

159
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,000
Didn't Your Highness say it is
in a mortal's possession?

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,078
Yes.

161
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,159
However, I went to the mortal realm
to investigate

162
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,240
and found the fan has disappeared again.

163
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
Would you be able to
locate its whereabouts?

164
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,120
An artifact of the Celestial Tribe
is like us immortals.

165
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
It does not appear in the records.

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,360
But if Your Highness
is interested in the mortal

167
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,360
I could look through this mortal's fate.

168
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,600
There’s no need.

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,860
I don't need to know
what she goes through.

170
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,720
I have been too meddlesome.

171
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,759
Speaking of which...

172
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,360
I'd like you to go to the mortal realm
to do something for me.

173
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,879
Please do tell, Your Highness.

174
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

175
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,480
- You may go.
- Yes.

176
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,080
How dare you.

177
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,240
In this palace,
only you like to be mean to me.

178
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
The Heavenly Lord has decided on
the date you become consort.

179
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,799
You shouldn't come here again.

180
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,159
Can't I serve you one last time?

181
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,960
Starting from when
you were 10,000 years old

182
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
I have been with you every day
while you were reading

183
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,840
and with you through
your morning and afternoon lessons.

184
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,759
Can't you just grant me
my wish this once?

185
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,360
Step outside.

186
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,600
Su Jin, think about this carefully.

187
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,279
If you do not leave

188
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,519
I'll call someone in and they'll see you
in such a state in my quarters.

189
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,159
Even if you have a million reasons

190
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,960
you won't be able to
become consort anymore.

191
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:21,200
You're threatening me?

192
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,639
I am in my prime.

193
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,960
If not for you

194
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,799
why would I marry Heavenly Lord?

195
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,879
You are saying
you want to be with this woman?

196
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes.

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,359
The day has come for you.

198
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,240
You are aware of women now?

199
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
It isn't what you think, Third Uncle.

200
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,279
To me, she is like something I once lost

201
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,519
and have finally found after
thousands of thousands of years.

202
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,599
Third Uncle, do you understand
what I am saying?

203
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,119
Of course I understand.

204
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,799
After all that,
just three words are enough.

205
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,160
What are they?

206
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,400
You are enamored.

207
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,880
Instead of saying enamored,
I'd say I am repaying a kindness.

208
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,440
Repaying a kindness?

209
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,240
For the minor injury you sustained
from the Golden Lion?

210
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,480
Is that worthy of you saying
you'll repay the kindness?

211
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,319
You don't need to be embarrassed.

212
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,799
Going by what you said,
you two were brought together by fate.

213
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,839
You shared the same bed with her
for several months in the mortal realm.

214
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,759
Although it was only
a few hours in heaven

215
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,559
it is still considered monumental.

216
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,279
Think back. You've lived
dozens of millennia.

217
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,400
Countless goddesses at countless banquets

218
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,240
have tried to speak to you,
but have you ever given them the chance?

219
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,680
So, if you weren't enamored,
why would you share a bed with her?

220
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,759
All right, stop fighting.

221
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,680
You're already enamored.
Let's keep talking.

222
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,319
Talk about what?

223
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,440
Didn't you bring me out here
just to ask me

224
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
how to make her like you?

225
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,759
That's right.

226
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,279
However, I've never interacted with
mortal women before.

227
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,119
There is a phrase that puts it well.

228
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,319
Since the ancient times,
women have loved the hero.

229
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,480
There isn't a young woman
who doesn't like a charming man.

230
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,160
Walk right up to her

231
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,319
and smile at her.

232
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,559
She is guaranteed to melt.

233
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,359
Using your charms is beneath you?

234
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
All right, use something else.

235
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,631
Since the ancient times,
women have loved the hero.

236
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,400
Release a monster on
the mountain to scare her.

237
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
When she is scared witless

238
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,079
you'll appear wielding the Qingming Sword

239
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,519
and valiantly rush forward
to kill the monster.

240
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,160
Then you'll become her savior.

241
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,240
She'll have no means to repay you
except to devote herself to you.

242
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,759
So is this how you tricked Lady Cheng Yu
into giving herself to you?

243
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,079
Lady Cheng Yu and I
ended 30,000 years ago.

244
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,599
That is old history.

245
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,960
Why did you mention her?

246
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Let's keep talking about you.
Will that method work?

247
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,880
It won't work, Third Uncle.

248
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
I showed my true form
in front of her a few days ago.

249
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
She wasn't frightened at all. She...

250
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,519
She is no ordinary woman.

251
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,759
Using your charms is beneath you.
Playing the hero won't work.

252
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
Then how about the other way around?

253
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
How about playing the pity game?

254
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,480
Third Uncle.

255
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,119
You like this one?

256
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,599
This method is the only one
that may be feasible.

257
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,079
Thank you, Third Uncle.

258
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,480
Let me remind you.

259
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
Create a barrier around Mount Junji

260
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,920
and shield it from
the eyes and ears of heaven.

261
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Otherwise, someone will eventually notice

262
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,000
the Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince
is living there.

263
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,559
Don't worry, Third Uncle. I already
put up a barrier before I came back.

264
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,119
I'm not done yet!

265
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,599
He's so handsome. Why does he
need to play the pity game?

266
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,400
No... no...

267
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,519
Impossible! Impossible!

268
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,279
Out of everyone, you just had to
offend Crown Prince.

269
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,680
His Highness said
someone like you must be punished.

270
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,759
Tramp! You brought me harm!

271
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,559
- A diversionary tactic!
- All right.

272
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
I've looked at your fate.

273
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,680
You've done many bad deeds.

274
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,319
Your lifespan...

275
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,400
Your life ends this year.

276
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,599
I came all the way here. What kind
of fate should I write up for you?

277
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,880
I was originally thinking that
since winter is approaching

278
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,960
I'd dig a burrow for you
so you could pass the winter comfortably.

279
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:38,079
Who knew you'd turn into
a black dragon and fly off.

280
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,240
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

281
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,880
Let's go.

282
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,720
What's wrong? Are you all right?

283
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,680
There's so much blood!

284
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,359
Oh no, oh no.

285
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,720
This herbal medicine is used for
birds and snakes.

286
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I don't know if it can be used on people.

287
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,039
Don't move! Don't move!
You bled a lot.

288
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,759
Are you all right?

289
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,759
You don't need to worry, Miss.

290
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,200
It is just a minor injury.

291
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,880
Minor injury?
You've been bleeding the whole time!

292
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,759
Wait here. I'll be done soon.
Wait for me.

293
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,359
I haven't cleaned your wound yet.

294
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
Wait for me.

295
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,000
Can you take off your clothes yourself?

296
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,519
No need to trouble you.

297
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,759
All right, all right.

298
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,599
I'll help you.

299
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,880
Let me wipe this clean for you.

300
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
It'll be a bit painful. Bear with me.

301
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Does it hurt?

302
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Let me change out the water.

303
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,160
<i>Have I gone too far?</i>

304
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,200
<i>How come she is crying so much?</i>

305
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,599
Should I find a physician for you?

306
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,480
I think I should find a physician.

307
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,720
This medicine is only used for
tending to small animals.

308
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,279
Your wound is so deep. I'm afraid--

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Your wound is healed?

310
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,920
It is healed!

311
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,799
How is that possible?

312
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,160
Just now, it was...

313
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,279
It's said there is a rare plant
on Mount Junji of the Far East

314
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,319
that is a miraculous herb
for healing injuries.

315
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,359
Could the medicine you applied for me
be this very miraculous herb?

316
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,839
I randomly picked the herbs.

317
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,640
I don't know if they are
miraculous herbs.

318
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,920
Then... do you also have
internal injuries?

319
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,480
You are correct.
I have severe internal injuries.

320
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
Why are you so heavily injured?

321
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,759
Did an enemy come after you?

322
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
I happened across a monster
and fought with it.

323
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,079
Monster?

324
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,519
Are there monsters here?

325
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,119
Do you not know there are
many monsters on this mountain?

326
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,359
I've lived here for many months.
I've never seen any monsters.

327
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,119
That monster--

328
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,640
You are in no condition to speak.
Lie down for now.

329
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,400
That would be good.

330
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,559
Thank you, Miss.

331
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,660
- I'll make some food for you.
- All right.

332
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,559
I sold a basket of loquats
at the foot of the mountain

333
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,200
but only received very little rice.

334
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
I don't have many vegetables either.

335
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,480
- You've gone to much trouble, Miss.
- Here.

336
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
All right.

337
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,319
Seeing the condition you're in,
I think I should feed you instead.

338
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,799
I don't dare trouble you, Miss.

339
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,160
It's fine.

340
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,480
I often take care of
some injured small animals.

341
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,000
It's no trouble.

342
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,079
Miss, you sure are kind-hearted.

343
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,160
I am the only one living on
this mountain.

344
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,720
The nearest town is far away.

345
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,599
Instead of saying I'm taking them in,
I'd say they're keeping me company.

346
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,480
Otherwise, it is too lonely
being by myself.

347
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,519
Your injuries are so severe.
Why don't you stay here to recuperate?

348
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,839
The rice I received in exchange
should be enough to last you a few days.

349
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
Thank you, Miss.

350
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,240
What about yourself?

351
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,119
I...

352
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,599
I don't think I made
enough porridge today.

353
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,319
If you are not full yet,
I'll go pick some fruit.

354
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,839
Miss.

355
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,799
You are my savior.

356
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
Can you tell me your name?

357
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,720
I don't have a name.

358
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,279
No name?

359
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,839
I have no name and no family.

360
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,079
I live alone on this mountain.
I don't have any friends either.

361
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,000
In that case...

362
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,920
Why don't I give you one?

363
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,559
You'll give me one?

364
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,119
You are dressed so simple yet elegant.

365
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,119
The two words, Su Su, really suit you.

366
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Su Su?

367
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,359
Su Su.

368
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
All right, then I will be named Su Su.

369
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,400
Thank you for giving me a name.
I'll go pick fruit for you now.

370
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,759
Miss.

371
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,039
Don't you want to know my name?

372
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,440
I forgot to ask.

373
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,480
What is your name?

374
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,880
Ye Hua.

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,440
Which two words are Ye Hua?

376
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
Can you write them out for me?

377
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,000
I know now.

378
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,000
What happened?

379
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Did I bump into your injury?

380
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
No harm done.

381
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,000
Good. Let's leave.

382
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,880
What happened?

383
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
I just wanted to roast something
for you to eat.

384
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,480
Your roast produces so much thick smoke.

385
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
It's always been this way.

386
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,280
How did you survive before I came here?

387
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,760
I am not picky about my food.

388
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,119
When I'm hungry, I pick some fruit.

389
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,400
If I catch some small animals,
I roast them to eat.

390
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,719
It's a good thing you know
you have to roast them

391
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,599
and can't eat them raw.

392
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,599
I can't eat raw meat.
I get a stomachache when I do.

393
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,360
But, I used to take care of
a black snake.

394
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,280
It liked to eat raw meat.

395
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,119
It ate a lot every day.
It was very hard to take care of.

396
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,519
Is it that hard to take care of?

397
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,159
You've never taken care of
a snake, have you?

398
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,559
Naturally, you wouldn't know
the hardships of such a task.

399
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,719
That little black snake of mine
was absolutely finicky.

400
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,760
It had to sleep with me every day

401
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,239
and I even got a quilt because
I was afraid it would be cold.

402
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,280
Su Su, do you know snakes
don't need to sleep on a bed

403
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
and don't need to be covered by a quilt?

404
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,559
Really?

405
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,840
It's true.

406
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,800
Then perhaps it's because that
snake of mine is different from the rest.

407
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,239
That's why it really did turn into
a big black dragon later on.

408
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
It was about as large as this hut.

409
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,159
And then it flew away
and never returned.

410
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,639
All right, I'll stop talking about
that ungrateful snake now.

411
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,119
There should still be some fruit
in the house you can eat.

412
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,480
I'm going to pick
some more herbs for you.

413
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,679
Su Su.

414
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,679
How come you're here?

415
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,039
You're so heavily injured,
yet you walked so far.

416
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,280
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

417
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,280
It was late and you hadn't returned,
so I came looking for you.

418
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
- I got lost.
- Lost?

419
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,639
The last time I entered this forest

420
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:22,119
it took me eight days
to find my way out.

421
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,000
Eight days?

422
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,480
To be able to get lost to such an extent
is an ability all on its own.

423
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,440
I know you want to laugh at me.

424
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,320
It's all right. You don't need to
hold it in. Go ahead and laugh.

425
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,320
I have always been very tolerant
to those who aren't smart.

426
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,599
You were injured and walked so far.

427
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,599
You must not have
any energy left to keep going.

428
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,360
I was originally going to
pick some herbs and then return.

429
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,559
In the end, I lost my way.

430
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,119
It seems someone like me is only capable
of taking care of small animals.

431
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,280
No wonder my little black dragon
never came back to see me after it left.

432
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,320
It must have disliked me very much.

433
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,760
Do you miss it very much?

434
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,000
Perhaps it had no choice but to leave.

435
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,760
Dragons are from a clan of ancient gods.

436
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,679
Most of the time, they appear in
the mortal realm to subdue monsters.

437
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,239
And also because it is an immortal

438
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,440
it cannot stay in
the mortal realm for a long time.

439
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,480
Otherwise, it would affect the fates
of mortals and there would be trouble.

440
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,199
Really?

441
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,599
I remember now.

442
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,239
When the black dragon flew away

443
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,800
the city's people did seem to say

444
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,039
it subdued the gold...

445
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,760
Scarlet Flame Golden Lion.

446
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,440
Yes, Golden Lion.

447
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,920
How did you know?

448
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,119
It seems we'll have to
stay here for the night.

449
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,400
Make a fire and I'll tell you about it.

450
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,119
Okay, wait for me.

451
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,440
Keep telling the story.

452
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,840
Are you tired?

453
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,159
No.

454
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,719
The stories you tell aren't as pleasant
to hear as the ones told at the teahouse

455
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,159
but at least
they haven't been told before.

456
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,519
This Scarlet Flame Golden Lion arrived

457
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,440
at Mount Junji of
the Far East ten years ago

458
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,440
bringing scorched earth and drought
to the nearby Zhong Rong State

459
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,920
causing much hardship and poverty
for the people of the state.

460
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,239
Is it really that formidable?

461
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,119
On the tenth year, the Golden Lion
became even more savage.

462
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,719
He took a liking to the emperor's wife
and kidnapped her back to his cave.

463
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,519
And then?

464
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,360
He laid his hands on her.

465
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,480
Look at you.
I'm not even embarrassed yet.

466
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,360
How come you're blushing already?

467
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,599
Keep talking.

468
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,440
Finish the story.

469
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,000
And then...

470
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,960
And then the Golden Lion was subdued
by the black dragon you took care of.

471
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,400
And then?

472
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,840
And then...

473
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,239
Although the black dragon
defeated the Golden Lion

474
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,840
it had sustained a minor injury.

475
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,400
And then...

476
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,719
And then it met you.

477
