1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,737
Hey, hey! A human's transformed
into a monster!

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:08,573
There's no way I can punish him!

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:12,511
It's a first time experience
for Sailor Moon.

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,379
This is no time for that kind of talk!

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:17,015
Oh, I'm just gonna toss all the
rules out the window!

6
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:19,506
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

8
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

10
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Guided by the light of the moon

12
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

13
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,429
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

17
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:00,173
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

18
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,107
and fight against bad guys.

19
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:06,506
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

20
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:12,385
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

21
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:15,320
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

22
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:18,453
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

23
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,953
But anyway, I just have
to do my best!

24
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:32,037
Jupiter, the Brawny Girl In Love

25
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:40,379
Awaken, oh great ruler.

26
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:45,116
With this supremely blissful energy,

27
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:49,650
return to life, my great ruler!

28
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:18,078
The energy of humans has revived
me from my long sleep.

29
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:24,955
I have long awaited this day!

30
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:28,762
But at times,

31
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:32,994
my consciousness is still drawn
into the depths of slumber.

32
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,896
Find the legendary Silver Crystal!

33
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:40,373
The legendary Silver Crystal
is necessary

34
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:43,443
for me to completely revive!

35
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,901
But we know nothing of
its whereabouts.

36
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,615
When the Seven Monsters

37
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:51,106
have been revived along with
the rainbow crystals,

38
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:55,016
the legendary Silver
Crystal will shine!

39
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,118
Oh, no, I'm late! I'm late!

40
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,899
Hey, Usagi! You forgot something!

41
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:08,265
Oh, thanks! Can you
bring it with you?!

42
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,170
Oh, ouch!

43
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,770
Ouch!
Oh, ouch!

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,135
Ouch!

45
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:14,441
Sorry!

46
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,376
You broke my leg! Ouch!

47
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,549
Yo! What're you gonna do
about this, Missy?

48
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:23,583
Stop it!

49
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,184
What?!
Stop it!

50
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,085
What?!
I saw everything!

51
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:25,881
I saw everything!

52
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,489
She just bumped into him, and
you're getting on her case?

53
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:30,690
Talk about cheap.

54
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,958
What did you say?!

55
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,960
Hey, you might be a cutie,

56
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,190
but you're not getting away with that!

57
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,422
You bitch!

58
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:46,872
Amazing.

59
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:50,577
Are you all right?

60
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:51,378
Oh, yes!
Are you all right?

61
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,037
Oh, yes!

62
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,046
Be careful.

63
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,116
A rose-shaped pierced earring.
That's so nice.

64
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,225
When the Seven Monsters

65
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,727
have been revived along with
the rainbow crystals,

66
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,423
the legendary Silver
Crystal will shine!

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,599
I seem to recall that a long time ago,

68
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,635
our allies, the great Seven Monsters,

69
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,195
were sealed away by our old enemies.

70
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:29,839
Oh, our strongest warriors of legend,
the Seven Monsters!

71
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,282
Damn our hateful old enemies!

72
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:40,755
Into the seven shards of the
legendary Silver Crystal,

73
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:43,329
they sealed away the Seven Monsters,

74
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,320
and dropped them onto the Earth.

75
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:50,365
And those seven shards are
called the rainbow crystals.

76
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,705
Rainbow crystals...

77
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,730
What of the Seven Monsters?

78
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,044
They were reborn as human beings,

79
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,413
and have lost their memory
as monsters.

80
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:01,812
I see.

81
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:05,585
So, if we recover the rainbow crystals
from those human beings,

82
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:08,281
we can get a hold of the legendary
Silver Crystal, correct?

83
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:14,093
Yes. And the strongest warriors, the
Seven Monsters will also be revived.

84
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:25,627
I have modified it so it will only
respond to the rainbow crystals.

85
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,101
Thank you.

86
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,810
Zoi!

87
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:48,391
One of the rainbow crystals
is in this man's body.

88
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,897
Hurry! Let's go! The seats
will be taken!

89
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:55,163
It's lunch time, lunch time.
My tummy is groaning.

90
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:59,263
That's the girl with the rose-shaped
pierced earrings!

91
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,776
Miss Usagi!

92
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,580
Don't show up out of nowhere!

93
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,783
Oh, no, that girl transferred
into Class 6 today.

94
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:11,618
What?

95
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:12,285
Her name is Makoto Kino. She has
enormous physical strength!
What?

96
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:15,522
Her name is Makoto Kino. She has
enormous physical strength!

97
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,790
Rumor is, she was kicked out of
her previous school

98
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,526
because she got into a fight.

99
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:23,326
You'd better stay away from her, Miss
Usagi. If you're not careful...

100
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,032
Huh?

101
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,590
Oh, Miss Usagi!

102
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:34,236
Wow! Her lunch looks
so cute and yummy!

103
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:36,407
Her pouch is adorable, too!

104
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,145
Oh, those seasoned rice
balls look so yummy!

105
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,612
Who's there?!

106
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:43,616
Hello!

107
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,319
Oh, it's you. I didn't know you
went to this school.

108
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,021
I'm Usagi Tsukino!

109
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,255
Why don't you join me?

110
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,452
Oh, okay! Thank you
for this morning.

111
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:54,794
What?!

112
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,262
Would you like to have some?

113
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:59,060
What?! But I don't eat
too much, though...

114
00:07:59,332 --> 00:07:59,699
What?

115
00:07:59,699 --> 00:07:59,999
What?
What?

116
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,500
What?

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,200
Thanks for the food!
What?

118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,497
Thanks for the food!

119
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:04,269
It's good!

120
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,139
I'm glad you like it!

121
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,507
I don't know why,

122
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,442
but everyone here's scared of
me and won't talk to me.

123
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,614
Hey, Mako. Oh, sorry, you're
okay with Mako, right?

124
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:15,615
Oh, sure.

125
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,607
Your mother must be a genius chef!

126
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,279
Oh, this? I made it myself.

127
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:26,459
What?! That's amazing!
Wow! Teach me, teach me!

128
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,861
Oh, maybe I should get you to
fix my lunch! Just kidding!

129
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:31,831
Miss Usagi is a genius when
it comes to making friends.

130
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:32,265
Crown

131
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:35,935
Crown
Hey, Mako, why don't you wear
our school uniform?

132
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:38,037
Crown
This is more my style.

133
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:38,805
Crown
I see.

134
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:39,396
I see.

135
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,744
Oh? I wonder if Motoki's
not working today?

136
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:48,510
Who is this Motoki? Oh, is he...

137
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,851
your older brother?

138
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,318
Bro...

139
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:56,586
No, no. Motoki is...

140
00:08:58,491 --> 00:08:59,859
Excuse me?!

141
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,326
Usagi!

142
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:02,962
So, this is where you were.

143
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,230
What is it?

144
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,667
Well, Luna says that
girl bothers her.

145
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,736
That girl? You mean Mako?

146
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:10,670
Right.

147
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,237
I think you're thinking too much, Luna.
Right.

148
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:12,705
I think you're thinking too much, Luna.

149
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:14,907
Oh, shoot! It beat me!

150
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:15,508
Mako!

151
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,242
What?
Mako!

152
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,010
What?
Let me introduce you.

153
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,477
Let me introduce you.

154
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:20,913
This is Makoto Kino. She just
transferred to Juban Junior High today.

155
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:21,581
Nice to meet you!

156
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,415
Nice to meet you, too!
Nice to meet you!

157
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:22,815
Nice to meet you, too!

158
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,919
And this is the smart Ami
and the meanie Rei.

159
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,488
Who are you calling a meanie?

160
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:29,155
You!

161
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:29,989
I didn't hear you. Who did you say?
You!

162
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:30,990
I didn't hear you. Who did you say?

163
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,291
You!

164
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,695
What year, month, day, day of the
week, hour, minute or second

165
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,230
was I ever mean to you?!

166
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,255
That's why you're mean!

167
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,801
You guys really get along.

168
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,536
What?! No way!
What?! No way!

169
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,738
She's always picking fights with
me whenever she sees me!

170
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:46,506
Who picks the fights?!

171
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,407
You do!
Who picks the fights?!

172
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,007
You do!
They say, the more you fight,
the better friends you are.

173
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:49,941
They say, the more you fight,
the better friends you are.

174
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:52,901
She's got a point there.

175
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,310
Oh, she's so cute!

176
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,554
That cat with the crescent bald
spot is named Luna.

177
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,852
She's staying at my house.

178
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:08,861
Wow!

179
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:09,328
Wow! He did it again! It's amazing!

180
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,830
What?
Wow! He did it again! It's amazing!

181
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:35,922
Wow! It's amazing! He got two! Wow!

182
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,549
That's something!

183
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:41,394
Oh, Usagi!

184
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:41,561
Oh, Yumi!
Oh, Usagi!

185
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:42,295
Oh, Yumi!

186
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:42,895
Oh, Yumi!
Did you see that?!

187
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:43,396
Did you see that?!

188
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:43,796
Yeah, I did!
Did you see that?!

189
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:44,497
Yeah, I did!

190
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:44,897
Yeah, I did!
That guy's called "Joe, the
Crane Game Raider."

191
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:47,266
That guy's called "Joe, the
Crane Game Raider."

192
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,602
Crane Game Raider?
What the heck is that?

193
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,571
He's a genius crane game player!

194
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:54,307
They say that when he goes
after an arcade,

195
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:56,605
it loses every last one of its
stuffed animals to him.

196
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,468
Wow, isn't that amazing, Mako?

197
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:01,314
He looks exactly like him.

198
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:01,748
Mako?
He looks exactly like him.

199
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,772
Mako?

200
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,788
My senior...

201
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:13,659
Hello, there? Mako?
Mako? Earth to Mako?!

202
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,627
What could have gotten into her?

203
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,864
There we go! Oops!

204
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,672
I've found you!

205
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,920
What the?!

206
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,518
This will be over quickly.

207
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,460
Zoi!

208
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:15,485
Stop it!

209
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:38,669
Stop it!

210
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:40,913
Stop right there!

211
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:45,749
It's not nice to pick on people
weaker than you.

212
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,188
Shoot!

213
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:51,924
You'll get hurt if you interfere!

214
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:58,992
What are you doing?

215
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,034
Not too bad.

216
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,501
Barbaric.

217
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,610
You injured my precious face!

218
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,922
Mako! Whoa, what's going on?!
A fight?!

219
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:24,591
Shoot!

220
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,192
Wait!
Shoot!

221
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,093
Wait!
What's wrong?!

222
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:26,855
What's wrong?!

223
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,065
Are you okay?

224
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:32,799
Mako, what happened?
Are you okay?

225
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,959
Mako, what happened?

226
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,824
Let go!

227
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:38,071
Just leave me alone!

228
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,538
Oh, but...

229
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:42,509
What's wrong with him?! We were
worried for him and...

230
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,101
Oh, Mako?!

231
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:45,979
What's wrong?!

232
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:46,914
I felt it.

233
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:47,781
Felt what?
I felt it.

234
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:48,215
Felt what?
I felt a strong evil aura coming from
the guy she was just fighting.

235
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:50,784
I felt a strong evil aura coming from
the guy she was just fighting.

236
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:51,518
What?!

237
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:52,286
He might be part of the Dark Kingdom!
What?!

238
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,854
He might be part of the Dark Kingdom!

239
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:55,188
No way!

240
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:59,393
Then Mako and that guy are in danger!

241
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,156
Wait for me!

242
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,569
How long are you going to
keep following me?!

243
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:12,936
Well, it seems like someone's
after you, so...

244
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,675
I'll be your bodyguard!

245
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:17,109
There's no reason for anyone
to go after me!

246
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:22,115
You've won too much on those
crane games, so... Bang!

247
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,551
Maybe the arcades hired a hit man!

248
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,086
No way.

249
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:32,726
Hey, teach me the trick to
those crane games.

250
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:34,216
You could never do it.

251
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,889
What's wrong?

252
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,167
Welcome!

253
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:40,968
Hey.
Welcome!

254
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:41,301
Hey.

255
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:44,168
I want to have a cup of
coffee by myself!

256
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,435
What a jerk!

257
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,111
That's why I like him...

258
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:55,571
He looks exactly like my senior at
school who broke my heart.

259
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:00,547
That's totally the face of a girl in love.

260
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,669
You don't need to keep me
company, you know.

261
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,398
Now, now...

262
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:23,143
He's telling you to come inside!
You did it!

263
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,644
What shall I do?

264
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:27,080
What are you saying after
all this time?!

265
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,682
Come on! Come on! Come on!

266
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,183
Oh, wait a minute! Wait!

267
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:33,346
No waiting! Go for it, Mako!

268
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:36,089
Well, uh...

269
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,024
Have a seat.

270
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:37,724
Okay.
Have a seat.

271
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:38,486
Okay.

272
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,562
Don't get the wrong idea.

273
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,563
What?!

274
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:47,795
It's just too annoying to have someone
standing outside staring at me.

275
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,568
Okay.

276
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:52,230
The reason I'm good at crane games

277
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,765
is because I have a kind
of psychic power.

278
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,243
Psychic power?

279
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,144
I've had a strange power
since I was a kid.

280
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:03,415
What?!

281
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:09,856
So, do you get it now? No one
else can imitate what I do.

282
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,222
That's why I told you that
you could never do it.

283
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,997
But you know... Isn't that
called cheating?

284
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:21,195
I don't care! I should make
good use of my talent.

285
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:22,969
I don't know about that.

286
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,371
Can I help you?

287
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:26,907
Oh, I'd like a large curry and rice...

288
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,341
No, that's not what I meant!
A milk tea.

289
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,483
Help!

290
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,652
That man!

291
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,959
You're going to leave a girl
behind and run?!

292
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,296
I don't care about that girl!
She just followed me!

293
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,993
What did you say?! And you
call yourself a man?!

294
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,700
I don't care! Anyway, a huge
girl like her isn't my type!

295
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,241
Zoi!

296
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,718
Just as we thought, he's from
the Dark Kingdom!

297
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,983
Oh, Mako! Are you okay?! Mako!

298
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,651
He said the same thing...

299
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:19,893
Mako?

300
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,527
Damn it!
Mako?

301
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:21,425
Damn it!

302
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:30,365
Help!

303
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,274
You don't need to run.
You're one of us.

304
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:36,469
One of you?!

305
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,841
I'm taking the rainbow crystal.

306
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,495
So, this is it.

307
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:56,863
Stop right there!

308
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,330
Sailor Moon!

309
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,031
You're a bit late, Sailor Moon.

310
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,030
Who are you?!

311
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,564
Let me introduce myself.

312
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,912
I am one of the Great Four of the
Dark Kingdom, Zoisite.

313
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:13,046
What?!

314
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,243
I'll leave the rest to you,
monster Geisein!

315
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:17,784
He disappeared!

316
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,251
He's gone!

317
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,329
Geisein!

318
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,856
He's turned into a monster!

319
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:50,584
Geisei...

320
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:54,543
I'm a huge fan of Sailor Moon!
How dare you do this to her?!

321
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,157
That's...

322
00:18:57,157 --> 00:18:58,590
Take this!

323
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,127
Amazing!

324
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,594
Geisein!

325
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:05,931
Watch out!

326
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,867
I can't move!

327
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,671
Sailor Moon!

328
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,939
Wait!

329
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,108
You're a sailor warrior!

330
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:16,543
Luna, you spoke!

331
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:21,715
Hold this transforming pen and say,
"Jupiter Power Makeup!"

332
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,275
And help Sailor Moon!

333
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,553
Okay.

334
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,716
Jupiter Power Makeup!

335
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,995
Sailor Jupiter!

336
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,669
Mako is?!

337
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:52,946
My guardian, Jupiter!

338
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:57,042
Brew a storm! Call the clouds!
Bring down the lightning!

339
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:04,523
Supreme Thunder!

340
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,621
Geisein!

341
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:10,230
Supreme Sundae?

342
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,897
Okay, one more time!
Supreme Sundae?

343
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:11,398
Okay, one more time!

344
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:11,731
Okay, one more time!
No, you can't!

345
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:12,132
No, you can't!

346
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:12,832
What?!
No, you can't!

347
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:13,633
What?!
That monster still has the
heart of a human!

348
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,902
That monster still has the
heart of a human!

349
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:17,370
He was originally a human being!

350
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,004
What?!

351
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:18,872
Then, what are we supposed to do?!
What?!

352
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:19,964
Then, what are we supposed to do?!

353
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,942
Turn that monster back
into its human self!

354
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,466
But, how?!

355
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:28,682
What's this?!

356
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:29,683
It's the Crescent Moon Wand!
What's this?!

357
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:29,849
It's the Crescent Moon Wand!

358
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:32,118
Say, "Moon Healing Escalation!"

359
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,585
Got it!

360
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:41,617
Moon Healing Escalation!

361
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,829
Refresh!

362
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,498
You are the fourth warrior,
Sailor Jupiter!

363
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,080
Sailor Jupiter?

364
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,949
Sailor Moon, we now have
all four sailor warriors.

365
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:06,052
You have to become the leader
and protect the princess!

366
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:07,654
Me?! The leader?!

367
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:11,351
That's right! The Crescent Moon Wand
is proof that you're the leader!

368
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:21,067
Crown

369
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,503
Crown
Take that and that and that!
And that and that!

370
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:23,903
Take that and that and that!
And that and that!

371
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:27,270
I hate... I hate men!

372
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,678
One more time!

373
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,115
Hi, Usagi!

374
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:37,015
Oh, Motoki!

375
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,986
I heard that Crane Game Joe
was here yesterday!

376
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,254
I wish I could've seen him!

377
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:46,726
Really? Oh, let me introduce her.
She's my friend, Makoto Kino.

378
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,193
Hello!

379
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,931
He's exactly like my senior at
school who broke my heart.

380
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,133
What?!

381
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,336
Yesterday, you told me he looked
exactly like Crane Game Joe!

382
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,600
No, his voice sounds exactly the same.

383
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,208
Oh, Mako!

384
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,176
What a weird girl.

385
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:13,175
In my dream, you and I were together

386
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:20,086
Protected by the stars

387
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:35,305
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

388
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,545
And we casually talked to each other

389
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:51,253
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

390
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:58,189
I want to become prettier
right here and now

391
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:05,738
Something changes when
you fall in love

392
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:12,306
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

393
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:26,190
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
