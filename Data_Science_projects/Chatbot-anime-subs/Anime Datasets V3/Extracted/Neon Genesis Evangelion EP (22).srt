1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,820
The fiction has become the reality.

23
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,530
How ironic, that the experiment's
advocate became its victim.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,200
So, you believe that the Contact
Experiment was the direct cause?

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,330
Her mental breakdown was
a result of the contact.

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,000
Even so, this is too cruel,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,140
committing suicide and leaving
such a young girl behind.

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,800
Perhaps, but I believe there may
have been additional causes.

29
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,050
Asuka darling, Mama cooked
your favorite for you.

30
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,550
Oh, no, you have to eat this, or
that girl will laugh at you.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,550
She's like that every day.

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,250
She sits there talking to that doll
as if it were her real daughter.

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,160
I think it's because of the
guilt she must feel.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,300
She devoted her life to research,
not to taking care of her daughter.

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,630
I sympathize with your grief.

36
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,370
But it's like looking at porcelain
figures of a mother and her child.

37
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,770
Perhaps not much is different
between humans and dolls.

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,270
Man creates dolls in
his own image.

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,680
If God exists, it's possible that
we're all just dolls to him.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,710
That doesn't make you sound like
much of a modern physician.

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,850
I may be a doctor, but I'm a human
being and a woman first.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,270
You're a strong girl, Asuka, but
it's all right if you want to cry.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,610
I'm okay. I won't cry.

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,440
I can think for myself.

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>Can you hear me, Asuka?</i>

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,420
<i>Your synch ratio has dropped</i>
<i>an entire eight points.</i>

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,480
<i>Don't think of anything else, just</i>
<i>concentrate the way you used to.</i>

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,070
I'm trying!

49
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,019
Episode 22
Don't be

50
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,090
Asuka's synch ratio is getting
lower and lower.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,830
This is extremely troublesome.
We don't have a spare now.

52
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,400
Maybe we'd better make repairing
Rei's Unit 00 top priority.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
We can't afford to repair them
both at the same time.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,840
<i>Mitosis in Unit 02's left arm has</i>
<i>cleared the numerical requirement.</i>

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,310
<i>Necrosis development is currently</i>
<i>under point zero five percent.</i>

56
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,400
<i>Apotheosis process is in</i>
<i>nominal status.</i>

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,320
<i>Unit 00's regeneration process</i>
<i>is currently stable.</i>

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,290
<i>Connecting receptors to the</i>
<i>secondary terminals.</i>

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,490
The Eva series was born
from Adam.

60
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,560
Now we're using the force which
caused the Second Impact

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,630
to defeat the Angels.

62
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,000
Attempting to harness the engine
of our own destruction.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Only humans are so foolish.

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,740
After all, I myself hate the Evas.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,140
Revenge for my father?

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,240
Major Katsuragi!

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,470
They've started construction on
Evas up through Unit 13?

68
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,790
At seven different locations
around the world?

69
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,320
This is information that came via
Shanghai. The source is reliable.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,730
Why are they speeding up the
construction process now?

71
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,760
Well, we've lost two Evas recently,

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,830
and two more Evas are currently
severely damaged.

73
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,160
So I'd assume that they're
accelerating

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
to create a reserve force for
their contingency plans.

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Perhaps...

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
But we've been receiving spare
parts from Germany

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,600
that were originally intended
for Eva Units 05 and 06.

78
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,010
They've been spending
a lot of cash lately.

79
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,680
They just doubled the budget.

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I think the brass are being
driven by something.

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,380
Yeah, I can feel the
Committee's impatience.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Well, could they be doing
this in anticipation

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,260
of intercepting multiple
Angels at once?

84
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,130
Could be.

85
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,530
Except there's no reason for them
to do it outside official channels.

86
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,690
There must be some other reason.

87
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,450
This is the first time we've gotten
together in a while,

88
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,290
so what's with the gloomy
atmosphere?

89
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm finished.

90
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,130
Asuka!

91
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,930
I'm not getting it. After all, it's
probably Kaji calling for you.

92
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,270
I'm not getting it. After all, it's
probably Kaji calling for you.

93
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,440
You should get it.

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
Never again.

95
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,410
Oh no, I'm sorry that our
mighty invincible Shinji

96
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,550
should have to be bothered
with such a thing.

97
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,020
Yes, hello?

98
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,940
I can't stand the way
he's so aloof!

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,360
It's a call from Germany for Asuka.

100
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,630
It's your mother.

101
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,750
For me? My mama?

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,050
Give me that!

103
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,900
<i>[Hello Mother! It's been awhile since we talked...]</i>
Hallo Mutter! Wir haben uns lange nicht gehört ...

104
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,260
When she's speaking in a different language,
she seems like a different person.

105
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,460
<i>[Oh, no way. He's a lonely person...]</i>
Ach, niemals. Er ist ein einsamer Mensch ...

Ja, ja, wirklich? Ach, so... Das ist aber toll...

107
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,860
Mother...

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,370

Hoffentlich gibt's keinen Regen. Ich muß ins Bett.

<i>[Talk to you later. Good night.]</i>
Auf Wiederhören. Gute Nacht.

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,000
You were on the phone
quite a while.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,010
Well, it was just a routine
periodic communication.

112
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,110
I wish I could talk with my family.

113
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,270
Well, it's just for show.
She's not my real mother.

114
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,620
But it's not like I hate
her or anything.

115
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,240
I just feel uncomfortable
talking with her.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Why am I telling you this?!

117
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Sorry.

118
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,790
I know I've hit rock bottom when
I get sympathy from you!

119
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,040
Synchrograph, minus 12.8. It's
barely over the starting indicator.

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,040
That's pathetic. It's a worse
score than yesterday.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,210
Asuka's not feeling well, it's the
second day of her period.

122
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,650
Synch ratio scores aren't
influenced by physical disorders.

123
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,320
<i>The problem's in her subconscious.</i>

124

So, you've hit your breaking point?

136
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,840
Are you fed up with your
nice imitation family?

137
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,140
That from someone who uses cats
to fill the holes in her own life.

138
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,650
I'm sorry. I'm just a little upset.

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,760
Why do I suffer through this
just because I'm a girl?

140

our invincible Shinji will
destroy it anyway!

Shut up! You do anything you're
ordered to, don't you?!

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,240
You're an unthinking, emotionless
doll, and I hate you!

162
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,350
Everyone! I hate everyone!

163
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,030
Shinji's absent again today.

164
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,210
It's nothing unusual for Ayanami
not to show up, but...

165
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,810
Asuka's missing too.

166
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,900
And Suzuhara can't leave
the hospital yet.

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,420
I guess it's gotten so serious they
can't come to school anymore.

168
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,050
<i>Eva Unit 02's signals</i>
<i>all read nominal.</i>

169
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,490
<i>Connection and fusion of VA's</i>
<i>are within normal limits.</i>

170
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,180
<i>The field of proliferation is within</i>
<i>the expected range.</i>

171
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,960
You're my doll, so move like I
tell you to, and don't argue!

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,790
Why does a weapon need a mind?
It just gives you trouble.

173
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,900
Anyway, you must obey my orders!

174
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,330
This is stupid.

175
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,450
<i>All personnel, go to first stage</i>
<i>alert! Prepare for aerial assault!</i>

176
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,850
An Angel? They're still coming?

177
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,720
Visual confirmation of Angel.
This is maximum magnification.

178
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,760
It's not moving from its orbit.

179
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,230
It's maintaining a constant
distance from our position.

180
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,740
So, does that mean that it's
looking for a place to land?

181
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,440
Or that it's going to destroy
us from up there?

182
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,570
We can't attack it easily
from this position.

183
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,380
Unless it comes into our range,
there's nothing we can do.

184
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,880
The Evas can't destroy an
enemy that's in orbit.

185
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,750
What's Rei's status?

186
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,350
She and Unit 00 are both
in good condition.

187
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,250
She and Unit 00 are both
in good condition.

188
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,390
Understood.

189
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,320
Sortie Unit 00. Prepare for
extreme long range firing.

190
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,760
<i>Unit 02, Asuka, be ready to</i>
<i>sortie as her backup.</i>

191
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,970
Backup? Me? For Unit 00?!

192
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>That's right, take the rear</i>
<i>guard position.</i>

193
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,440
You can't be serious.

194
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,230
Eva Unit 02 launch!

195
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,330
Asuka!

196
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,980
It's okay. Let her take the point
if that's what she wants.

197
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,470
Major Katsuragi?!

198
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,280
If she fails this time, Asuka won't
be allowed to pilot anymore.

199
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,940
You mean this is her last chance?

200
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,310
Let's start preparing to replace
Unit 02's pilot, just in case.

201
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,690
Yes, Ma'am.

202
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,320
Excuse me, but aren't you
going to sortie Unit 01?

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,950
Excuse me, but aren't you
going to sortie Unit 01?

204
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,890
It's to remain frozen. Those are
Commander Ikari's orders.

205
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,520
After what happened,
it's a good idea.

206
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,490
If I fail this time, they're not going
to let me pilot anymore.

207
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,820
You can't make any mistakes
this time, Asuka.

208
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,740
<i>The target is still out of range.</i>

209
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,440
Why in the hell are you so slow?!
Come on down, you lazy Angel!

210
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,820
The Angel has a particle
beam weapon?!

211
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,590
No, there are no thermal emissions
being detected.

212
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,150
We've got abnormal readings
in her psychograph!

213
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,820
Mental contamination
is about to begin!

214
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,220
The Angel's making a
psychic attack?

215
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,990
The Angels can't understand
our minds that well!

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,790
God damn it!

217
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,670
<i>Positrons dissipated!</i>

218
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,640
It's not working! It's too
far out of range!

219
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,650
Unit 02's rifle is out
of ammunition.

220
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,150
What's the result of the
beam analysis?

221
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,990
It's an energy oscillation pattern
on a visible wavelength.

222
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,890
It's similar to an AT Field, but
we don't know much more.

223
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,590
How's Asuka?

224
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,390
It's bad! The mental contamination
is crossing her ego borderline!

225
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,490
It's bad! The mental contamination
is crossing her ego borderline!

226
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,370
No!

227
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,060
Don't! Don't come into me!

228
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,040
No!

229
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,680
No!

230
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,150
No!

231
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,320
No!

232
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,770
Get out of my mind!

233
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,540
Please! Don't rape my mind!

234
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,370
Asuka!

235
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,040
Psychograph shows she
can't take anymore!

236
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,940
Psychograph shows she
can't take anymore!

237
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,080
Yes, her mental circuits
are being destroyed.

238
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,180
This is too dangerous for her.

239
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,350
Asuka! Retreat!

240
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,520
No!
Asuka! Retreat!

241
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:21,850
No!
<i>That was an order! Asuka, retreat!</i>

242
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,350
<i>That was an order! Asuka, retreat!</i>

243
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,190
No! Never!

244
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,720
I'd rather die than retreat now!

245
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,290
Asuka!

246
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,160
<i>Accelerator synchronization initiated.</i>

247
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,320
<i>Voltage is increasing. Approaching pressure zone.</i>

248
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,950
<i>Compulsory focus convergence, activated.</i>

249
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,630
<i>Correction for the Earth's rotation</i>
<i>and gravity, point zero three.</i>

250
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,870
<i>Pressure in the chamber is at maximum.</i>

251
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,670
<i>Release the final safety lock. All</i>
<i>personnel, prepare for firing.</i>

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,210
No effect! There wasn't enough energy

253
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,280
to penetrate its AT Field from this distance.

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,650
We're at maximum power output!
We can't get any more power!

255
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,990
Unit 02's psychograph
is getting weak!

256
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,720
What about the LCL mind barrier?

257
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,090
Negative! We can't even hope
for a buffering effect.

258
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,300
Switch top priority to life support.
Don't allow any feedback.

259
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,790
Yes, Ma'am!

260
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,030
<i>That ray scanned her mental</i>
<i>wavelength, and adapted to it.</i>

261
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,530
<i>Impossible! Is the Angel trying to</i>
<i>analyze a human mind?</i>

262
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,150
Why am I crying? I swore that
I wouldn't cry anymore.

263
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,560
What's wrong, Asuka?

264
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,630
This is a present from your new
mother. Don't you like it?

265
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,200
No!

266
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,760
But why not?

267
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,330
Because I'm not a child!

268
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,970
I'll grow up faster than
other people.

269
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,370
I don't need a stuffed toy.

270
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,810
Please, look at me! Mama! I beg
you, don't stop being my mama!

271
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,080
Come to Heaven with me.

272
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,910
Mama! Mama! Please,
don't kill me!

273
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,320
No! I'm not Mama's doll!

274
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,780
I'll think for myself,
and I'll live for myself!

275
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,550
I don't need a papa or mama,
I'll live on my own.

276
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,720
No! Don't make me remember that!

277
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,360
I want to forget those things!
Don't dig them up from my mind!

278
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,930
I don't want those terrible
memories anymore!

279
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,020
Please, stop this! Stop this!

280
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,220
My mind's being contaminated.

281
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,700
Kaji! My mind's being raped!

282
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,980
What will I do? It's defiling
my mind!

283
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,820
<i>Unit 02 has ceased activation!</i>

284
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,720
<i>The life support system has crashed!</i>

285
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
Pilot's mind is entering
danger zone.

286
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,260
Target position is constant.
Relative distance unchanged.

287
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,530
Possibility of the target coming
into Unit 00's range is 0.02%.

288
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,400
Could we airlift Unit 00 and
try shooting from the sky?

289
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,700
No, we can't do that.

290
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,810
If the Angel attacked during the
approach, we couldn't protect it.

291
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,710
<i>I'll go out in Unit 01!</i>

292
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,730
No! This target has the ability
to attack the pilot's mind.

293
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,250
We cannot allow an
invasion of Unit 01.

294
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,480
<i>But that can't happen as long</i>
<i>as I'm not defeated, right?</i>

295
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,950
There is no guarantee that
you will succeed.

296
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,990
But if we don't, Asuka will...

297
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,430
I don't care. Rei, go to Dogma
and get the Lance.

298
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,330
The Lance of Longinus?!
You can't do that, Ikari!

299
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,090
It's the only way to kill a target
beyond the reach of our AT Fields.

300
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,930
Hurry!

301
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,040
But if Adam and the
Eva come into contact,

302
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,570
it might cause the Third Impact!

303
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,600
It's too dangerous! Commander
Ikari, please don't do this!

304
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,440
<i>So, that story was fraudulent too?</i>

305
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,480
<i>The Second Impact wasn't caused</i>
<i>by contact between two Angels.</i>

306
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,650
<i>Opening Central Dogma</i>
<i>barriers 10 through 15.</i>

307
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,490
<i>Unit 00 has passed the</i>
<i>6th Malvoisie.</i>

308
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,120
<i>Now opening barriers</i>
<i>16 through 20.</i>

309
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,990
<i>If something like this won't cause</i>
<i>the Third Impact, then...</i>

310
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,530
<i>What really happened to cause</i>
<i>the Second Impact?</i>

311
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,010
Ikari, I still think it's too
early to use this.

312
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,420
The committee has already started
to mass produce Evas.

313
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,120
This is our chance, Fuyutsuki.

314
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,720
But...

315
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,520
We cannot make time
run backwards,

316
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,150
but we can spur its course forward
with our own hands.

317
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,420
The old men won't allow this.

318
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,100
Therefore, we must finish this
before SEELE has time to act.

319
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,840
It is not acceptable to lose
Unit 02 at this time.

320
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,370
But you can't use the Lance
without SEELE's approval.

321
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
The need is the justification.

322
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,920
There are no other factors
to consider.

323
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,550
Justification? No, what you're
looking for is an excuse.

324
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,730
<i>Unit 02's pilot's EKG has dropped</i>
<i>to point zero six.</i>

325
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,630
<i>We're past the limits of the</i>

<i>Unit 00 is passing through Vent 2.</i>
<i>She's approaching the surface!</i>

327
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,840
That's the Lance of Longinus?

328
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,780
Unit 00 is in position to throw.

329
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,880
Target sighted. Error corrections
have been made.

330
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,440

Eva Unit 02 is free.

342
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,310
What about the Lance
of Longinus?

343
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,510
It passed escape velocity. It's
moving into a lunar orbit.

344
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,520
It's impossible to recover it now.

345
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,350
Yes, Sir.

346
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,680
We have no method to recover
an object of that much mass.

347
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,170
<i>Unit 02's psychograph is</i>
<i>returning to normal.</i>

How's Asuka?

351
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,040
We've confirmed that
the pilot is alive,

352
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,510
We've confirmed that
the pilot is alive,

353
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,240
and we've established quarantine
for the contamination.

354
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,730
I see.

355
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm glad you're okay, Asuka.

356
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,970
Shut up! Who the hell is okay?!
How could it get any worse?

357
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,900
That little bitch rescued me.
That little bitch rescued ME.

358
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,770
I'd rather have died!

359
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,180
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate everyone!

360
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,070
I hate you all!

363
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
Unit 00 is possessed and
corroded by an Angel.

364
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,850
In order to protect
Shinji from the Angel,

365
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,000
Rei wishes herself dead.

366
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,490
She becomes light and heat
to disappear with Tokyo-3.

367
