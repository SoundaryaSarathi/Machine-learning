Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.58,0:04:02.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Well... the crime itself is pretty straightforward.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.14,0:04:07.65,Default,,0,0,0,,The culprit just waltzed right in through the entrance, killed the staff,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.65,0:04:11.28,Default,,0,0,0,,helped himself to whatever substances he wanted,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.28,0:04:13.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and then calmly strolled out through those doors.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.09,0:04:33.49,Default,,0,0,0,,his Psycho-Pass showed a normal value and his Hue was clear.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.24,0:04:35.96,Default,,0,0,0,,This was all logged by the scanner.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.67,0:04:40.42,Default,,0,0,0,,So he's just like that Makishima guy?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.42,0:04:44.22,Default,,0,0,0,,He can kill while keeping his Psycho-Pass normal.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.68,0:04:48.97,Default,,0,0,0,,This helmet is probably the key.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.97,0:04:53.60,Default,,0,0,0,,It must have had some means of deceiving the cymatic scan.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.45,0:04:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,,That Makishima guy who got the jump on Inspector Tsunemori
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.32,0:05:00.75,Default,,0,0,0,,might have used a similar device.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.84,0:05:10.03,Default,,0,0,0,,But is a helmet like that all that's needed to fake one's Psycho-Pass?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.58,0:05:15.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I could understand if all it did was block the cymatic scan.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.35,0:05:19.11,Default,,0,0,0,,But of course, that alone wouldn't get them through security
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.11,0:05:21.71,Default,,0,0,0,,because if someone who can't be scanned passes through,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.71,0:05:24.01,Default,,0,0,0,,an alarm would go off right away.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.08,0:05:30.47,Default,,0,0,0,,The problem is that the scanner detected the intruder's Psycho-Pass,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.47,0:05:35.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and assessed his Hue as that of a good citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.23,0:05:37.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you think he cracked the system?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.71,0:05:39.56,Default,,0,0,0,,That's not possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.56,0:05:42.87,Default,,0,0,0,,The crime took place in a short span of time and appeared not to be premeditated.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.87,0:05:46.82,Default,,0,0,0,,It'd be impossible for someone to alter the data without leaving any trace.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.42,0:05:50.29,Default,,0,0,0,,The current security system
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.29,0:05:53.86,Default,,0,0,0,,is based around the assumption that a cymatic scan is reliable.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.92,0:05:58.29,Default,,0,0,0,,That's why, if someone's Psycho-Pass checks out,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.04,0:06:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,it allows them through on the assumption that there's no way they could cause trouble.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.64,0:06:09.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Even when actual assaults and thefts are committed,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.92,0:06:12.60,Default,,0,0,0,,the Drones' AI routines don't have the ability to identify them as crimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.25,0:06:16.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Since everyone gets a Psycho-Pass scan, their judgement is solely based on that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.32,0:06:23.28,Default,,0,0,0,,There are no longer any means left for dealing with crimes like this...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.19,0:06:28.41,Default,,0,0,0,,in this town.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.54,0:06:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.54,0:06:49.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So I told him, "That's not my job, right?"
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.30,0:06:54.31,Default,,0,0,0,,After that, he got this really stupid look on his face!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.68,0:07:00.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Wh-What do you want?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.49,0:07:34.51,Default,,0,0,0,,I have detected that you are experiencing a great deal of stress.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.37,0:07:40.90,Default,,0,0,0,,I recommend you seek immediate mental care from a specialized medical facility.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.37,0:07:43.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you distressed?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.16,0:07:49.61,Default,,0,0,0,,The Ministry of Welfare's Urban Service helps everyone live a healthy life.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.91,0:07:58.37,Default,,0,0,0,,would you like to request an ambulance from the nearest emergency hospital?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.37,0:08:04.50,Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}If so, be aware you will be charged an uninsured service fee at a later date.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.17,0:08:05.84,Default,,0,0,0,,This is good. Real brutal stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.88,0:08:12.30,Default,,0,0,0,,In the olden days, people physically locked their front doors as a matter of course
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.30,0:08:17.17,Default,,0,0,0,,because doubting others was the basis for maintaining order.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.17,0:08:20.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that from one of Masaoka's stories about the past?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.66,0:08:25.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah. I heard it from that old man.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.01,0:08:30.74,Default,,0,0,0,,We no longer have to operate on the assumption that other people cannot be trusted.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.84,0:08:34.26,Default,,0,0,0,,You know that those strangers you see on the street are all safe, good citizens,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.26,0:08:38.88,Default,,0,0,0,,because they've all had their Psycho-Passes verified.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.70,0:08:43.41,Default,,0,0,0,,This society maintains its order based on that assumption.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.00,0:08:46.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Just like that helmet-wearing man,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.48,0:08:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,if people find out that there's a way to deceive the cymatic scan,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.56,0:08:52.09,Default,,0,0,0,,there's no way to avoid a panic.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.38,0:08:58.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Or if they announce the existence of people like Makishima Shougo...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.76,0:09:05.52,Default,,0,0,0,,What's the matter?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.05,0:09:09.70,Default,,0,0,0,,An Area Stress Level warning has been issued in Setagaya ward.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.70,0:09:11.73,Default,,0,0,0,,But more importantly than that,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.26,0:09:15.49,Default,,0,0,0,,an almost unbelievable video has been uploaded onto the net.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.49,0:09:15.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Look.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.86,0:09:21.12,Default,,0,0,0,,What the hell is this?!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.10,0:09:25.73,Default,,0,0,0,,It's begun.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.73,0:09:28.79,Default,,0,0,0,,What is that? What's happening?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.12,0:09:31.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Makishima's behind this crime.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.27,0:09:33.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I'd put money on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.04,0:09:35.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Though...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.77,0:09:39.68,Default,,0,0,0,,What does this world define as "crime" to begin with?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.68,0:09:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Ko... What's on your mind?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.67,0:09:45.51,Default,,0,0,0,,This is no ordinary crime.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.51,0:09:46.39,Default,,0,0,0,,It's more like...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.43,0:09:50.22,Default,,0,0,0,,something that shakes the very foundation of our society.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.36,0:09:53.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Whoa! This is crazy...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.16,0:09:56.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So when they said that they were gonna demo it, they were serious.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.00,0:10:00.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Shall we go?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.52,0:10:19.54,Default,,0,0,0,,So they managed to elevate the Area Stress Level this much in so little time...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.54,0:10:27.10,Default,,0,0,0,,So far, so good.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.78,0:10:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,This will work.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.46,0:10:31.48,Default,,0,0,0,,The plan doesn't have to be revised.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.57,0:10:34.54,Default,,0,0,0,,That's silly.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.06,0:10:38.59,Default,,0,0,0,,It's just one person killing another. That's all.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.59,0:10:41.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Nothing really serious has happened yet.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.17,0:10:45.16,Default,,0,0,0,,The really serious stuff is yet to come.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.24,0:10:50.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Hey... You're the only one I've told the entire plan to.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.84,0:10:52.92,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm counting on you.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.49,0:10:57.26,Default,,0,0,0,,This is the Criminal Investigation Department, part of the Public Safety Bureau.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.03,0:11:13.85,Default,,0,0,0,,It's very likely.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.60,0:11:18.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Even so, all the people that were here...

Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.58,0:11:45.39,Default,,0,0,0,,that something like this could happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.39,0:11:49.46,Default,,0,0,0,,In the end, no one reported the incident,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.46,0:11:53.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and the Area Stress Level warning was what revealed the anomaly.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.65,0:11:56.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And it wasn't just people who overlooked it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.88,0:12:04.40,Default,,0,0,0,,The crime was committed right in front of a Psycho-Pass scanner, of all things.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.40,0:12:08.83,Default,,0,0,0,,So the culprit's Hue was also monitored in real time?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.52,0:12:10.36,Default,,0,0,0,,This is it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.10,0:12:17.25,Default,,0,0,0,,So once again, it remained normal all the way through? Unbelievable.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.66,0:12:21.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Even at the instant he strikes her, it shows only a small change.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.99,0:12:25.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, any possibility that the value itself could be faked?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.38,0:12:26.79,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.79,0:12:29.42,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not possible to fabricate a Psycho-Pass reading
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.42,0:12:31.98,Default,,0,0,0,,unless he's dragging around a supercomputer with him or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:31.98,0:12:33.04,Default,,0,0,0,,No...

Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.04,0:12:42.27,Default,,0,0,0,,It's too much like an onlooker's reaction.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:42.27,0:12:43.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Look at this.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.66,0:12:45.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Here's the change in the Area Stress Level.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.21,0:12:49.77,Default,,0,0,0,,It's going up and down in exactly the same way as the perpetrator's Hue.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.97,0:12:52.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Ah, you're right.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.83,0:12:54.75,Default,,0,0,0,,This means...
