Tear open the door to your heart...

<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

Standing there smiling serenely.

A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,610
This may be my last assignment.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,550
This looks like blood.

25
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,490
Episode 21
He Was Aware That He Was Still A Child

26
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,300
The Vice-Commander
was abducted?

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,570
Two hours ago. He was last
seen in the 8th District.

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,440
That's inside our installation.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,740
What in the hell were you idiots
in Intelligence doing?

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,940
The whole thing was set up by
someone inside our operation.

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,010
We were taken by surprise.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,500
Someone who could outwit
Section 2? It couldn't be him?!

33
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,190
Ryoji Kaji is suspected of being
the mastermind behind this plot.

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,690
Then, that's why you came for me.

35
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,820
We believe that you can
be of use to us, yes.

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,930
As your colleagues,

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,930
we regret having to consider the
Director of Operations a suspect,

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,960
but that is the nature
of our profession.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,140
Considering our relationship,
it's a natural precaution.

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,840
I appreciate your cooperation.

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,330
Take her away.

42
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,800
It's been a while, Chairman Keel.
This is a rather rough reception.

43
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,870
I will not apologize for
necessary discourtesies.

44
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,250
This was necessary for us to speak
without the Commander present.

45
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,020
You haven't changed.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,590
You still have no concern for the
circumstances of others.

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,220
The subject to be addressed has
become an immediate concern.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,090
Thus, these measures
were unavoidable.

49
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,930
Please understand our situation.

50
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,170
What a surprise. Not the
committee, but SEELE itself!

51
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,540
We have no intention of
creating a new god.

52
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,530
We hope that we will have your
cooperation, Professor Fuyutsuki.

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,800
Professor Fuyutsuki, is it?

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,840
Professor! Professor Fuyutsuki!

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,580
Hello, boys.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,250
Why don't you join us for a beer
by the Kamo River?

57
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,450
What, again?

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,060
Ryoko and the other girls said
they'll come if you come.

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,620
The professor said that you
shouldn't be so unsociable.

60
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,620
All right, I'll be there.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
It's nice to have a drink
outside for a change.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Yeah...

63
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,700
You're very competent,

64
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,270
but you tend to underestimate the
value of relationships with others.

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,610
I'm sorry, Sir.

66
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,570
Speaking of which, Fuyutsuki...

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,310
There's a student who wrote a very
interesting research paper

68
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,380
for the bio-engineering class.

69
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,420
Her name is Ikari. Do
you know her?

70
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,850
Ikari? No, Sir.

71
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,520
I've told her about you, and she
says she'd like to meet you.

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,890
She'll be calling you soon, and
I'd like you to take her on.

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,260
And her name is Ikari?
I understand.

74
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,800
<i>Metaphysical Biology</i>
<i>Fuyutsuki</i>

75
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,360
I've read your paper.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,000
There are a few things I disagree
with, but it's very interesting.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,440
Thank you, Sir.

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,810
Your name is Yui Ikari, right?

79
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,010
Yes.

80
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,110
What are your career plans?
Corporate research?

81
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,950
Or joining the school
research facility?

82
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,450
I haven't really thought about it.

83
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,580
And there may be a third option.

84
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm also thinking about
getting married,

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,850
assuming that I meet
the right person.

86
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,273
<i>Again A.D. 2015</i>

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,530
By incorporating the
S2 unit into itself,

88
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,700
it has achieved its ultimate form.

89
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,870
Evangelion Unit 01!

90
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,370
A supreme being which we
created. What blasphemy!

91
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,610
The creation of a god
is unacceptable.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,210
Man must not create gods. He
can't possess such power!

93
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,610
Can we trust Gendo Ikari?

94
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,370
Gendo Rokubungi? Well,
I have heard the name.

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,010
No, I've never met him.

96
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,520
However, he does seem to be at
the center of many rumors.

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,960
He wants to be released
in my custody?

98
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,030
Yes, I'll come visit him.
What time should I come?

99
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,800
I've been hearing some interesting
things about you.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,670
I've been wanting to meet you.

101
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,140
You were drunk and got into a
fight. How pathetic.

102
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,240
I didn't even have a chance to say
anything before they jumped me.

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm not used to being liked.

104
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,350
Being hated, on the other hand,
is quite familiar.

105
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,790
That's not my concern.

106
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,250
Professor Fuyutsuki,

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,350
you are exactly the kind of person
I expected you to be.

108
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,360
<i>My first impression of him was that</i>
<i>he was a total son of a bitch.</i>

109
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,290
<i>Back then, there were still seasons</i>
<i>in this country. It was autumn.</i>

110
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,040
Are you serious?

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,540
Yes, I'm dating Mr. Rokubungi.
Are you serious?

112
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,840
Yes, I'm dating Mr. Rokubungi.
<i> </i>

113
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,540
<i>When she told me that, I</i>
<i>couldn't hide my shock.</i>

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,810
It's hard to imagine
you seeing him.

115
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,780
Now, Professor Fuyutsuki...

116
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,270
He's actually a very sweet person.

117
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,650
It's just that nobody
really knows him.

118
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,660
Sometimes ignorance can be bliss.

119
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm the one who first mentioned
you to him. Does that bother you?

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,060
Well, I'll admit that he's
an interesting fellow,

121
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,460
but I just don't like him.

122
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,340
<i>It was generally believed that the</i>
<i>real object of his overtures to Yui</i>

123
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,670
<i>was her talent and the support of</i>
<i>the organization backing her.</i>

124
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,440
<i>According to the rumors, that</i>

128
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,860
<i>Then, in the first year of the 21st</i>
<i>century there was nothing but hell.</i>

129
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,550
<i>I can't find any other words to</i>
<i>describe that year.</i>

130
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,570
This used to be a continent of ice?

131
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,900
There's no sign left of it!

132
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,890
Professor Fuyutsuki...

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,270
Is that you? You survived?

134
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,910
I'd heard that you were with the
Katsuragi research team.

135
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,080
Fortunately, I returned to Japan
the day before the incident.

136
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,450
You don't say?

137
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,750
Mr. Rokubungi, you...

138
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,350
Excuse me, but I've changed
my surname.

139
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,320
A postcard? Not a business card?

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,759
<i>We are married</i>
<i>Gendo and Yui Ikari</i>

141
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,100
Ikari! Gendo Ikari!

142
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,930
My wife's been asking me to send
this to you. She's a fan of yours.

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,090
What an honor.

144
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,510
How is Yui doing? She's not
participating in this expedition?

145
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,170
Yui wanted to come too, but
we have a child now.

146
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,320
Your organization, SEELE
or whatever it's called,

147
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,250
is at the base of many
ugly rumors.

148
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,220
I don't like the way it manipulates
the committee by force.

149
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,730
You're still too scrupulous.

150
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,130
No completely chaste organization
can survive in this day and age.

151
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,200
If this official investigation
of the Second Impact

152
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,300
was composed solely
of SEELE personnel,

153
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,060
there would have been trouble.

154
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,300

Her name is Misato Katsuragi.

Katsuragi? Is she Doctor

but repairing the damage to
her mind will take time.

168
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,340
That's true.

169
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,340
The results of our investigation
aren't easy to analyze.

170
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,580
This Giant of Light's origin is but
one of many unsolved mysteries.

171
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,180
The Second Impact was caused by
a massive meteorite strike,

172
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,850
or so the United Nations
officially declared later.

173
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,290
However, from my point of view,

174
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,560
the announcement was
obviously a fabrication.

175
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,260
The organization known as SEELE

176
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,230
and a man named Keel were
behind this artifice.

177
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,360
It became my goal to find out
the truth about the incident,

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,460
even though I discovered that
Yui Ikari was involved.

179
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,540
Why did you conceal the
existence of the Giant?

180
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,810
You knew that the Second Impact
was going to happen, didn't you?

181
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,490
You say it's just luck you returned
the day before it happened,

182
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,760
but explain why you brought back
copies of all the documentation?!

183
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,190
I'm surprised that those
weren't destroyed.

184
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,630
I've checked into your
finances as well.

185
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,740
Bringing up a child and educating
him is expensive,

186
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,070
but isn't this a bit much?

187
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,880
Very impressive,
Professor Fuyutsuki.

188
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,510
Perhaps you should be
teaching economics.

189
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,580
I'm going public with the real truth
about the Second Impact,

190
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,780
about you, SEELE and
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

191
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,320
I can't forgive anyone who would
have caused something like that.

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
As you wish.

193
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,520
However, before you do, there's
something I'd like to show you.

194
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,900
We're getting rather far
down, aren't we?

195
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,470
Are you worried?

196
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,960
A little.

197
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
What is this?

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,540
We didn't create it, someone
else excavated this cavity.

199
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,370
We didn't create it, someone
else excavated this cavity.

200
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,140
Eighty-nine percent of its
total volume is buried.

201
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,700
Was this originally a giant sphere?

202
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,680
This facility has been consuming
all mankind's resources.

203
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,320
Hi, Professor Fuyutsuki!

204
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
Doctor Akagi, you're here, too?

205
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,270
Yes, this is the ideal place
for our research

206
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,760
into creating a functioning
bio-computer system.

207
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm going to name them the MAGI.

208
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,240
MAGI? The three wise
men of the East?

209
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Is this what you wanted
to show me?

210
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,850
No, it's over this way.

211
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,540
Ritsuko, I'll be back soon.

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,620
Is this...

213
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,190
This can't be THE Giant?

214
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,560
No, here in Gehirn, we refer
to that giant as Adam,

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,020
but this isn't the original one.

216
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,160
Then, this...

217
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,060
Was created from Adam
by Man, Eva.

218
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,330
Was created from Adam
by Man, Eva.

219
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,570
Eva?

220
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,000
Our operation to revive Adam
is referred to as Project E.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,530
This is Eva Unit 00,
our system prototype.

222
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,440
This is a prototype of a god!

223
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,280
Fuyutsuki, let us create a new
genesis for Mankind, together.

224
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,260
Hey, boss.

225
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,970
I'm sorry. Let's proceed
with Rei's re-test.

226
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,200
Where is Major Katsuragi today?

227
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,870
I don't know.

228
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,010
Miss Katsuragi?

229
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,530
Yeah, Misato Katsuragi,
pleased to meet you.

230
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,540
Mother, I've just met a girl
named Katsuragi.

231
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,820
People tend to keep their distance
once they find out who I am,

232
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,290
which forces me to remember how
important your name is here.

233
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,190
However, Misato's different. She's
open and honest, even with me.

234
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,000
I've heard she is the only survivor
of the original research team,

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
and that she was once mute.

236
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,120
She talks quite a lot now, as if
she's making up for lost time.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Dear Ritsuko, I'm always
underground these days,

238
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,940
and I'm getting sick of living on
the box lunches they provide here.

239
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,040
On the surface, they've started
construction of Tokyo-3,

240
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,100
as directed by the Second
Capitol Transfer Directive.

241
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,090
Misato missed classes the last few
days, and I finally found out why.

242
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,690
Talk about stupid!

243
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,520
She'd spent the whole week
in her apartment

244
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,390
having non-stop sex with
her new boyfriend!

245
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,520
I think there's another side to
her I haven't seen before.

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,270
She introduced me to him today.

247
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,930
He's handsome, but his unkempt
manner bothers me.

248
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,040
You've always been a little
boy-shy, Ritsuko dear.

249
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,540
I think it's because you
only had a mother.

250
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,210
And I'm afraid I didn't take
care of you properly.

251
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,710
I'm ashamed to admit I acted like a
mother only when it suited me.

252
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,910
Like a mother...

253
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,956
<i>Hakone, 2. Underground Test Site</i>

254
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,260
Why is there a child in here?!

255
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,530
That's Commander Ikari's son.

256
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,000
Ikari, this isn't a daycare center.
This is a very important day!

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,640
<i>I'm sorry, Professor.</i>
<i>I brought him here.</i>

258
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,710
Yui, this is your experiment today.

259
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,210
<i>That's why I brought him.</i>

260
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,650
<i>I want to show him how bright</i>
<i>the future will be.</i>

261
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,580
Those words would be Yui's last.

262
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,180
A freak accident wiped her
from this existence.

263
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,920
Just as I had hoped it would.

264
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,520
What a disgusting woman I am.

265
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,050
After that day, Commander Ikari
completely changed.

266
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,440
Where have you been all week?

267
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,700
I understand your grief,

268
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,810
but you must be aware of
your own importance!

269
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,900
I know. Fuyutsuki, as of today we
will begin the new project.

270
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,850
I have already made the proposal
to Chairman Keel.

271
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,650
You're really going to do it?!

272
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,990
Yes, what has never been done,
the path to becoming a god!

273
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,920
The Human Instrumentality
Project.

274
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,700
Mother, congratulations on
completing your MAGI theorems.

275
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,900
I have good news which I think
will please you too.

276
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,270
I have been officially accepted
by Gehirn!

277
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,070
I'll start working on
Project E next month.

278
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,000
Who are you?

279
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,180
Technology Development Section,
Ritsuko Akagi. Here's my ID.

280
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,790
I heard the command center was
complete, so I came to see it.

281
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,490
But it's a real maze down
here, isn't it?

282
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,260
The Commander and Doctor Akagi
will see you in Command.

283
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,230
Are you really all right?

284
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,330
Yes, I have no regrets
about my work.

285
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,360
You're lying! You still can't forget
about Yui, can you?!

286
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,530
But that's acceptable to me.

287
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,850
That's Gehirn Headquarters.

288
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,960
Good Morning, Commander.

289
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,660
Did you bring your child?

290
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,330
Oh, I thought you had a son.

291
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,840
This isn't Shinji.

292
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,840
I've decided to take care of
an acquaintance's child.

293
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Her name is Rei Ayanami.

294
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,470
How are you, Rei?

295
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,280
She resembles someone...

296
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,680
Yui?!

297
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,390
All of the records concerning
Rei Ayanami have been deleted?

298
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,120
They're all blank!

299
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,610
What's going on here?

300
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,760
Magi Casper...

301
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,430
Magi Balthasar...

302
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,860
Magi Melchior...

303
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,530
The MAGI are the three
aspects of me.

304
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,870
Myself as a scientist, myself as a
mother and myself as a woman.

305
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,640
Those three aspects are in
constant conflict with one another.

306
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,200
Three mothers...

307
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,270
The only thing left to do is to
switch the power on.

308
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,750
I'll be taking off early today.
Misato just got back.

309
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,990
Yeah, I heard that she
joined Gehirn.

310
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,250
In Germany, if I
remember correctly?

311
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,590
Yeah, she's stationed
with the 3rd Branch.

312
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,930
So, she's having a long
distance relationship.

313
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,290
They broke up.

314
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,630
But they seemed like such
a perfect couple.

315
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,630
The things that happen between men
and women are hard to comprehend.

316
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,200
They're not logical.

317
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,270
You're always so cold
about these things.

318
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,000
You may lose your chance
at happiness.

319
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,400
The definition of happiness
is even harder to fathom.

320
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,010
Well, I can't wait to see her.

321
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,210
Have a good time.

322
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,700
A good time it is.

323
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,960
What's the matter, Rei?

324
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm lost.

325
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,230
Is that so? Do you want to
come with me then?

326
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
No.

327
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,140
But how will you get
home by yourself?

328
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,940
But how will you get
home by yourself?

329
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,140
That's none of your business,
old hag.

330
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,610
What?

331
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,110
I can get home by myself.
Leave me alone, old hag.

332
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,440
I can get home by myself.
Leave me alone, old hag.

333
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,290
You shouldn't call someone a hag.

334
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,520
But you are an old hag,
aren't you?

335
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm getting angry. Commander
Ikari will spank you.

336
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,130
The Commander is the one
who calls you that.

337
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,760
That's...

338
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,630
That old hag is annoying. That
old hag is no use anymore.

339
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,390
That old hag is annoying. That
old hag is no use anymore.

340
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,970
That old hag is annoying. That
old hag is no use anymore.

341
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,970
...old hag... old hag...

342
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,710
That old hag is annoying. That
old hag is no use anymore.

343
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,610
The Commander said...

344
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,510
...that old hag is annoying.

345
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,280
...no use... no use...

346
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,480
You little bitch! Did you know
you're replaceable too, Rei?

347
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,180
Replaceable just like me!

348
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,840
Keel Lorenz, Chairman of the
Instrumentality Committee,

349
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,970
dissolved the Gehirn Research
Organization immediately.

350
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,040
In order to complete the project,

351
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,510
the special organization
NERV was formed.

352
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,450
We all transferred to NERV,
except for one person.

353
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,790
The one who had rendered such
great service to the MAGI System,

354
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,650
Dr. Akagi.

355
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,090
Oh, it's you.

356
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,630
Yes, it is.

357
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,430
It's been awhile. The guards
are sleeping.

358
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,070
This action could result
in your death.

359
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,060
All I want is to get closer
to the truth.

360
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,230
To have it in my grasp.

361
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,700
Thank you for your cooperation.

362
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,380
Is it over?

363
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,250
Yes, the problem has been solved.

364
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,340
I see.

365
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,490
Where is he?

366
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,190
I have no idea.
Where is he?

367
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,990
I have no idea.

368
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, hi! You're a little late.

369
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,030
I'm back.

370
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,760
<i>Katsuragi, it's me.</i>

371
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,820
<i>I'm sure you're listening</i>
<i>to this message,</i>

372
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,450
<i>especially after I caused</i>
<i>you so much trouble.</i>

373
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,530
<i>Sorry.</i>

374
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,690
<i>Please tell Ritsuko I'm sorry too.</i>

375
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,170
<i>Oh, and there's one more thing.</i>
<i>I've been growing watermelons.</i>

376
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,660
<i>I'd appreciate it if you could</i>
<i>water them for me.</i>

377
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,330
<i>Shinji knows where they are.</i>

378
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,450
<i>Katsuragi, the truth is with you.</i>

379
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,940
<i>Don't hesitate, move ahead!</i>

380
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,850
<i>If I ever see you again,</i>

381
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,340
<i>I'll say the words that I couldn't</i>
<i>say eight years ago.</i>

382
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,590
<i>Bye.</i>

383
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,190
<i>This message was recorded</i>
<i>at 12:02 PM.</i>

384
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,920
You fool...

385
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,860
You were always such a fool.

386
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,420
<i>All I could do was run away from</i>
<i>the tragedy Misato was facing.</i>

387
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,670
<i>There was nothing I could say.</i>

388
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,760
<i>I was just a child.</i>

389
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,730
<i>But I understood.</i>

390
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,010
Preview

391
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,510
Surpassed by Shinji again, Asuka
falls into a dark pit of despair,

392
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,980
and damage from the next Angel
attack is even more horrifying.

393
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,090
Shinji can find no words to
soothe her shattered soul.

394
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,310
It's the next episode:
"At Least, Be Humane"
