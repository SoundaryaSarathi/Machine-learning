After. Not, I think</font></font>

322
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,540
.However, the numbers alone do not achieve victory</font></font>

323
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
What speeches?</font></font>

324
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,340
Seems that you become a little bit stronger</font></font>

325
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,680
! But you still do not compare me</font></font>

326
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
.I know this</font></font>

327
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,060
...for this reason</font></font>

328
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,240
for this reason?</font></font>

329
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,300
! That's why this is my only choice</font></font>

330
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,770
.Jba, Aoyama has a trump card up his sleeve</font></font>

331
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,560
.Anh usual oblique</font></font>

332
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,730
Is still an idiot. What</font></font>

! He holds the League head in his right hand</font></font>

342
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,530
What happened here?</font></font>

343
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,650
! Replay to watch</font></font>

344
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,190

.Oomaya grabbed her head while the League is a bird</font></font>

348
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,060
! This is how wonderful, what a superhero movement</font></font>

349
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,570
.Asv, Harrow-Apr</font></font>

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,090
Are you okay, Azuki?</font></font>

351
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,870
It was so soon. We have</font></font>

352
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,980
, But fencing in such a height</font></font>

353
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,940
.Atojb to jump up out of his head to the League</font></font>

354
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,980
If you jumped. But, perhaps you may fall in the swimming pool</font></font>

355
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,410
! Come on, come</font></font>

356
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,640
! I thought that you are not so weak</font></font>

364
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,650
.exactly</font></font>

365
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,240
Fighting. We have reached a turning point is expected</font></font>

366
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,260
Precisely for this reason</font></font>

367
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,490
Not. You must loosen from your defense if even a second</font></font>

368
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,380
!Damn</font></font>

369
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,270
.Khtef League head and then return safely to the Persians was really wonderful</font></font>

370
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,630
. Although I did not understand his squad</font></font>

371
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,300
. Also that the teacher Nijo fainted by someone, and he is not qualified</font></font>

372
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,590
It happened. We have at the moment</font></font>

373
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,230
Na-not qualified?</font></font>

374
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,510
! Do not care, just let me</font></font>

375
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,140
!I can not breathe</font></font>

376
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,150
Now. I have three against two</font></font>

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,790
! It seems I am the only one who can Mjaratk</font></font>

378
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,370
I was afraid. I have that this will happen</font></font>

! We are in this to win</font></font>

385
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,390
.I do not think so</font></font>

386
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,870
.Taquero-Be, you should consider only</font></font>

387
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,880
Why is it always?</font></font>

388
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,550
!it is not fair</font></font>

389
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,160

390
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,420
! Do not worry about them</font></font>

391
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,890

.Ooh? </font>They have divided the boys</font></font>

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,230
Do you attack will try pincher?</font></font>

394
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,330
! Sheria has launched its movement towards them secret</font></font>

395
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,050
! No one of the boys groups, attacked from both sides, are able to approach them</font></font>

396
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,290
.Olknha has returned to the horses</font></font>

397
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,630
. It's not only interested Balmanga</font></font>

00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,580
... I was attracted to that side of you or</font></font>

413
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,940
! Why do you talk on top of someone else's summit?</font></font>

414
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,950
Chancellor suffered. We have faculty sad defeat, so also the teacher team likewise</font></font>

415
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,570
! This means that Sheria is the only one that remained in the girls team</font></font>

416
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,260
, While the boys team still have two teams in the battle</font></font>

417
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,330
Sheria strength have shown earlier</font></font>

418
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,470
You will be able to. Do you win the game or not</font></font>

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,110
.Hiria, do not Ttrajaa, even if you Tqatlin Takeru</font></font>

421
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,040
.I will not do</font></font>

422
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,480
. If we are against this, we must expel our methods</font></font>

423
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,190
!Yup! </font>Like my thoughts exactly</font></font>

424
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,120
! Even after they showed him the extent of my strength! </font>Still did not give up</font></font>
