4
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,544
Crown Prince!

5
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:26,346
Crown Prince, I had
a hard time finding you!

6
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,479
Didn't you wake up in Xiwu Palace?

7
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,383
I don't know.

8
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,318
I woke up on Kunlun Mountain.

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,365
How did you know that I've returned?

10
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,520
I checked the Book of Destiny.

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,920
I realized that your mortal self
was so lovesick

12
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,528
that you died young from illness.

13
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,782
It's good that you've returned.

14
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,270
Trouble is brewing in the Grand Hall.

15
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,603
Please come with me immediately!

16
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:46,651
What happened?

17
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,563
High God Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
barged into Xiwu Palace

18
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:55,426
and vanished after digging out
Lady Su Jin's eyes.

19
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,816
Qing Qiu's Little Princess rushed in
and had an argument with Lady Su Jin.

20
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,479
One said that Qing Qiu bullied her

21
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,997
and the other claimed that
Lady Su Jin framed High God Bai Qian.

22
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:06,445
It's a mess.

23
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:10,323
Qian Qian took away Su Jin's eyes?

24
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,323
Yes.

25
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,800
Qian Qian...

26
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,125
Your Highness, you can't leave.

27
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,072
Lord Dong Hua said that
only you could resolve this issue.

28
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:25,493
All right, I need you to bring
three people here.

29
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,516
My Uncle Sang Ji, Lian Song,
and Yuan Zhen

30
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,800
who just finished his trial
in the Mortal Realm.

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,015
Yes.

32
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,229
There's one more.

33
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,578
It's a figurine called Su Su who served
my mother in the Mortal Realm.

34
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:37,171
Su Su?

35
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll get it done right away.

36
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,102
Crown Prince.

37
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:54,735
I wonder why you asked
to see me so urgently?

38
00:03:54,735 --> 00:04:00,163
Today, I'll uphold justice for Yuan Zhen
and redress his case.

39
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:03,762
Forget it.

40
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,306
Yuan Zhen has already
returned from his trial.

41
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:09,859
High God Bai Qian had also
kept him safe in the Mortal Realm.

42
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,425
As for the case...

43
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:14,746
We don't need it redressed.

44
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,512
I know that Father punished Yuan Zhen

45
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,853
because even after I was demoted to
Water King of the North Sea

46
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,906
I still doted on Shao Xing greatly.

47
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:28,947
He was just too angry and
wanted to teach me a lesson.

48
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:33,031
In fact, as his son,
I hurt him so deeply.

49
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,882
There's not much to say now
that my son had to pay for my sin.

50
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,331
Ye Hua, I'm grateful for your kindness.

51
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,216
Uncle Sang Ji, have you considered that

52
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,949
if we don't get this case
straightened out today

53
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,610
Yuan Zhen or even your other children
will still continue to suffer from it?

54
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,930
What will you do then?

55
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,370
This is...

56
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,315
Brother Sang Ji, Ye Hua is right.

57
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:12,350
We should always set things straight.

58
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,940
Otherwise... It's unfair
to Yuan Zhen.

59
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,002
Sure!

60
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:27,149
Once we get to the Grand Hall
I'll do whatever you have me do.

61
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:32,802
Just tell the truth, all right?

62
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,060
Yes.

63
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,622
Crown Prince, is this the right person?

64
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,839
Yes, it's her.

65
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,500
Let's go in.

66
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:07,250
Qing Qiu's Bai Qian threatened me

67
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,403
to seek punishment from
Heavenly Lord to guard the...

68
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:15,367
Guard the Bell of East Emperor that
imprisons Qing Cang by Ruoshui Riverbank

69
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,048
and never return to the heavens, right?

70
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,353
Yes!

71
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,970
Don't stand on ceremony.

72
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,237
Crown Prince, you've returned?

73
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,324
I happened to make it back today.

74
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,814
I've heard that there was
a problem in the Grand Hall

75
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,916
so I came to take a look.

76
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,012
You should be present.

77
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:44,483
This is after all an issue of your harem,
but I ended up having to handle it.

78
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,988
It has put me in a tight spot.

79
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,125
Yes.

80
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:52,117
Ye Hua!

81
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:57,737
Ye Hua, you must uphold justice for me!

82
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:59,271
Ye Hua...

83
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:04,552
Don't worry. I'm here to uphold justice.

84
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,459
Your Highness.

85
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,069
Who are you?

86
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,759
It's me, Your Highness.

87
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,254
I don't know you.

88
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:20,687
Don't address me!

89
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,290
Your Highness.

90
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,735
Who is she?

91
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,908
I don't know her!

92
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,096
Send her away!

93
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,420
Don't let her come near me!

94
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,569
Make her leave!

95
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,333
This is...

96
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,048
She's a figurine?

97
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:00,701
Heavenly Lord.

98
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,019
Ye Hua, what is this about?

99
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,319
When I'm going through
my trial in the Mortal Realm

100
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,059
Su Jin made this figurine to seduce me.

101
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:20,723
According to the celestial law
how would Father punish her?

102
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:23,127
It's the crime of seducing
an apparent heir

103
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,976
of the celestial tribe with witchcraft.

104
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,947
She is to be stripped of
her celestial status

105
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,089
banished to tiryagyoni-gati
to be reborn as animal.

106
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:33,923
Mark that down.

107
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:34,966
Yes.

108
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,517
No!

109
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,989
I didn't make this figurine!

110
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:41,264
I didn't make it... It wasn't me...

111
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:45,825
Why would Water King of
the North Sea have the time

112
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,202
to bring your eldest son
to the Grand Hall today?

113
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:02,916
I'm here for Yuan Zhen's
wrongly accused crime.

114
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,446
Wrongly accused?

115
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:09,519
You mean that I've misjudged his case?

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,163
Yuan Zhen, tell them
what happened that day.

117
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,636
Yes.

118
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:26,774
Yuan Zhen greets Heavenly Lord
Lord Dong Hua, and my uncles.

119
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,335
Don't bother with the formalities.

120
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,676
Just tell the truth.

121
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:33,326
Since I'm here today,
I'll uphold justice for you.

122
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,326
Yes.

123
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:38,273
I never molested Lady Su Jin.

124
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,493
That day on Heavenly Lord's birthday

125
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,714
I came here with Father
for the birthday celebration.

126
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,951
Father went to meet Heavenly Lord
so he had me wait outside the hall.

127
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,373
Lady Su Jin approached me.

128
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:51,254
She said that Heavenly Lord
is actually at Xiwu Palace.

129
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,510
She even smiled and said
that she could take me there.

130
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,287
Then Lady Su Jin knocked me out
with her magical powers.

131
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:59,456
She even fed me wine
and tore off my clothes.

132
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,846
When I woke up

133
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:04,715
Lady Su Jin was already crying
and accusing me of molesting her.

134
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:07,635
It was a huge mess then so
I just sat there dazed

135
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,438
until she brought out
the white linen to hang herself.

136
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:13,476
That was when Heavenly Lord walked in.

137
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,610
That was it.

138
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,096
I've finished my story.

139
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,995
You told it well.

140
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,340
It's very clear.

141
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,524
Su Jin, what do you have
to say to that?

142
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,052
He's lying!

143
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:36,700
He was drunk and barged into
my slumber hall to lay his hands on me.

144
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,538
He lied!

145
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:43,086
Yuan Zhen, how many times had you
been to the Celestial Palace?

146
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:44,796
That was my first visit.

147
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:50,076
Su Jin, you think that someone who came
to the Nine Heavens for the first time

148
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:54,538
would be able to locate Xiwu Palace
and then find your slumber hall

149
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:58,100
among the many other slumber halls
in Xiwu Palace to molest you?

150
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,152
I... He...

151
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:03,484
If you can't come up with
any reasons, don't speak.

152
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,520
Consort Le Xu, how should she be punished

153
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,313
for framing the grandson
of Heavenly Lord?

154
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,726
She is to be stripped of
her celestial status

155
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:16,245
banished to tiryagyoni-gati
to be reborn as an animal.

156
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,421
- Star Lord.
- Present.

157
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,118
- Note that down.
- Yes.

158
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:27,432
We haven't even tried her
for High God Bai Qian's case.

159
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,211
And she already guilty
of so many crimes?

160
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:34,855
No! Lord Dong Hua!

161
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,875
Lord Dong Hua, you've wronged me!

162
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,869
You've conspired with Qing Qiu's
Bai Feng Jiu to frame me!

163
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:41,408
You set me up!

164
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,211
- You set me up!
- How atrocious!

165
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,652
Heavenly Lord!

166
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,724
You have to uphold justice for me
Heavenly Lord!

167
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:56,489
They are all villains!

168
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,259
You mustn't believe in them!

169
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,062
They conspired to frame me!

170
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:04,008
They framed me, Heavenly Lord!

171
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:16,899
You mean to say that I'm also
a villain who plays up to those in power?

172
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:26,626
As my side consort, what is your crime
for slandering your husband?

173
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,971
That is a severe crime.

174
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:32,477
That's more severe
than the two former crimes.

175
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,700
Su Jin, you'd better think it through.

176
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:41,591
No, I...

177
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,525
Ye Hua...

178
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,673
Ye Hua!

179
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,359
Ye Hua!

180
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,956
Ye Hua!

181
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,457
Ye Hua!

182
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,307
Ye Hua...

183
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,116
Ye Hua!

184
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,458
You can't be so cruel to me!

185
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,875
You can't!

186
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,697
Have you forgotten?

187
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,756
I grew up with you.

188
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:03,448
I was...

189
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,384
I was just too flustered.

190
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,556
I panicked.

191
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:10,205
Ye Hua, you can't slander me
like they did!

192
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:13,120
You can't!

193
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,226
I'm the Crown Prince of
the Celestial Tribe.

194
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,296
I'd never side with anyone.

195
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:24,510
Even if I were to side with anyone
shouldn't it be my side consort?

196
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,432
No!

197
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,172
You never take my side!

198
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,423
Never! Not once!

199
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:38,885
You've always pushed me away
no matter how well I treat you...

200
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:43,908
It doesn't matter how well I treat you!

201
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,884
Do we still need to go on with this?

202
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:54,091
Judging by High God Bai Qian's character
and this woman's tainted criminal record

203
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:56,347
if we were to go on with this hearing

204
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:59,389
I'm afraid that Qing Qiu will bear
a grudge against us

205
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,974
for believing in such a woman
and accusing the Queen of Qing Qiu.

206
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:08,149
Indeed. This hearing need not continue.

207
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,205
Su Jin...

208
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,759
You've disappointed me.

209
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,472
I am utterly disappointed.

210
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,375
I think that Lord Dong Hua is right.

211
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,414
Fortunately, all who are present
in the Grand Hall today

212
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:32,187
are our own family members so
this has yet to cause a bigger impact.

213
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:34,572
As the foster father of Su Jin

214
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm  ashamed to have
raised such a woman.

215
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,057
Father, please make a decree
to punish Su Jin immediately

216
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,846
so as to prevent further trouble.

217
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:51,946
I concur. I'm speechless.

218
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,462
I concur.

219
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:58,900
Uncles!

220
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,184
Uncles!

221
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:03,412
Uncles, you can't do this to me!

222
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,875
You can't treat me so!

223
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:10,707
Uncles, look! I'm a princess
of the Nine Heavens!

224
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:12,855
Uncles...

225
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:15,982
Uncles...

226
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,102
Have you forgotten about my parents?

227
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:23,284
They sacrificed themselves
to save you!

228
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,881
Have you forgotten about that?

229
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,124
Look at you!

230
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,485
How could you face your loyal parents?

231
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:36,365
Su Jin, considering that you're the
offspring of a faithful clan

232
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:42,222
I won't punish you for seducing
Ye Hua with a bewitched figurine.

233
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:47,315
However, for the crimes concerning
Yuan Zhen and High God Bai Qian

234
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,216
you have to be punished.

235
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:55,038
Today, you should
volunteer to guard Ruoshui.

236
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,119
Take her away!

237
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,288
No, Heavenly Lord!

238
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,523
I don't want to go there!

239
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:07,072
- I won't go there! I won't!
- Your Highness...

240
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,664
Heavenly Lord!

241
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:09,866
- Ye Hua!
- Your Highness...

242
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:12,243
- I won't leave!
- Your Highness...

243
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,812
Ye Hua.

244
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:22,614
Your wedding with High God Bai Qian
shouldn't be postponed any longer.

245
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:28,518
I'll arrange to meet the Fox King
and decide on a date

246
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,078
to marry her into the Nine Heavens soon.

247
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,648
I accept the decree.

248
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:40,234
Congratulations, Crown Prince!

249
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,464
Ye Hua.

250
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,106
What is it, Mother?

251
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:04,273
I never would have thought
that Bai Qian of Qing Qiu

252
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,428
could be that mortal, Su Su
from 300 years ago.

253
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,810
Although it is for the friendship
between Qing Qiu

254
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,747
and the Celestial Tribe
that you have to marry her

255
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:24,814
I still feel that you've suffered
many grievances.

256
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:32,063
What do you have in mind
about the wedding date?

257
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,694
The second of September.

258
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,135
What?

259
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:39,895
Qian Qian said that the second of
September is a good day for everything.

260
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,011
She wishes to hold our wedding
on that day.

261
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:48,439
Mother, rest assured.

262
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,965
Despite everything that happened

263
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,680
she's still the one
I have been waiting for.

264
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,164
I don't want anyone else but her.

265
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,876
All right.

266
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,512
I'll make the arrangements.

267
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,095
What is it?

268
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,134
Is there some other matter?

269
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,173
I have a question for you.

270
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,844
Ask away.

271
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,234
If...

272
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,067
I said if.

273
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,394
If you didn't remove your name
from the Rock of Three Incarnations

274
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:34,924
would you have fallen for me?

275
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,085
You haven't answered me yet!

276
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:48,178
I told you to ask the question,
but I didn't say that I'll answer you.

277
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:02,788
Why are you following me around?

278
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:06,480
If you don't answer me
I'll keep following you around.

279
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:11,087
By all means, do so.

280
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,365
Is Your Lordship still going to Ruoshui?

281
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,707
Head back to my study first.

282
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,037
Yes.

283
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:35,508
From this day forth
Qing Qiu is closed to all.

284
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,915
I will see no one.

285
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,365
Yes, Auntie.

286
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,730
That's not right.

287
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,972
What about Little Princess?

288
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,874
It's best not to disturb Auntie.

289
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:57,490
Anyway, with that temperament of hers
Little Princess can get by anywhere.

290
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:23,411
Crown Prince, our Auntie drank
a lot of wine and fallen asleep.

291
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:28,000
She's given orders that
none is allowed into her Fox Den.

292
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,733
Pass a message to her.

293
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:36,673
Tell her that I'll wait out here
until she's willing to see me.

294
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:37,730
Yes.

295
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,363
My Lord, I've already built
the ritual platform

296
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,336
in front of the Grand Hall.

297
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:59,290
Good, very good.

298
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,726
Fortunately, you managed to
finish it within seven days.

299
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,788
It's also fortunate that

300
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:14,560
my father still hasn't broken out
of the Bell of East Emperor.

301
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,119
It's been 70,000 years.

302
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,565
Hundred thousands of our warriors
died in the battle of Ruoshui Riverbank.

303
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:22,785
Whose fault was that?

304
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:24,405
The Celestial Tribe!

305
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:28,480
We offered our best food,
the most beautiful ladies

306
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,527
and our largest, most luminous pearls!

307
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:34,107
Think about it! Think long and hard!

308
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:37,801
When the Old Ghost Lord was in reign
did we ever had to suffer so?

309
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:39,480
- Exactly!
- That never happened!

310
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,224
- Am I right?
- Yes...

311
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:42,224
Yes! Exactly!

312
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:43,892
Look up at the sky!

313
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:49,439
Such strange sightings are the signs that
our true Ghost Lord is about to return!

314
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:53,020
Our Old Ghost Lord will eventually
return with his crimson hellfire

315
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,338
to defeat the Celestial Tribe
and conquer all realms!

316
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:57,785
Ghost Lord, abdicate the throne!

317
00:21:57,785 --> 00:22:00,852
Ghost Lord, abdicate the throne!

318
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:16,318
My Lord, there are many rebels
gathered outside Grand Ziming Palace.

319
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:17,653
What should we do?

320
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:23,020
What you need to do next is to
safeguard Grand Ziming Palace

321
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,204
for the next seven days.

322
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:34,724
I need to use these seven days
to disperse the crimson clouds

323
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:37,958
and restore peace to the Ghost Realm.

324
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,598
<i>Father, since you used
your children as your power vessels</i>

325
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,928
<i>You should have known
that such a day would come.</i>

326
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:51,541
<i>Only our blood could summon your spirit.</i>

327
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,142
<i>Please return to Grand Ziming Palace.</i>

328
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:55,142
<i>The place you once
held as the Ghost Lord.</i>

329
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:58,383
<i>Put an end to all this
with your son, Li Jing.</i>

330
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:03,240
<i>Be it my mother's life
or that of Li Yuan</i>

331
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,855
<i>we should both put an end
to this once and for all.</i>

332
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:51,881
Li Jing!

333
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:53,509
Treacherous son!

334
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:56,779
How dare you use your blood
to summon my spirit!

335
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:58,335
What are you going to do?

336
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:05,538
I never should have spared
such a treacherous son 70,000 years ago!

337
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:31,404
Why have all of you come to Ruoshui?

338
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,147
How could I help you?

339
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,257
This is the fairy, Su Jin.

340
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:40,157
She volunteered to the Heavenly Lord
and gave up her celestial status

341
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:43,392
to train near Ruoshuo as well
as guard the Bell of East Emperor.

342
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:45,992
Heavenly Lord consented to it
in appreciation of her kindness

343
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:47,484
and ordered us to bring her here.

344
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,040
Fairy Su Jin is too kind.

345
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,751
I'll take my leave now.

346
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,401
Let's go.

347
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:18,413
Isn't that Lady Su Jin?

348
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,556
Yes.

349
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,442
Su Jin is punished for
some wrongdoing and her eyes are hurt.

350
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:25,800
Heavenly Lord had her use the eyes of
the North Sea's legendary fish

351
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,095
so that she could at least get around.

352
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,682
Has the Crown Prince returned?

353
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:33,364
He has returned
but he's now in Qing Qiu.

354
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,627
Qing Qiu?

355
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,961
His Highness just returned from
the Mortal Realm

356
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,426
so he must have gone to Qing Qiu

357
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:42,386
to discuss the wedding
with High God Bai Qian.

358
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:44,088
All right, you may head back now.

359
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:45,416
Yes.

360
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,413
Ye Hua...

361
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:27,550
I love you.

362
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,688
I want to be with you forever.

363
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:41,984
<i>Back then, I didn't know
what I truly felt for you.</i>

364
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:45,346
<i>Don't take what I said then to heart.</i>

365
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:50,395
Now that we share a mutual affection
the engagement can't be canceled.

366
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:24,071
Auntie, His Highness has been waiting
outside the Fox Den for seven days.

367
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:25,714
He insists on seeing you.

368
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:35,073
I acted upon your orders
so I don't dare to let anyone in.

369
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:37,803
Not even the Crown Prince.

370
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:40,007
However, it's been seven days

371
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,682
and His Highness doesn't seem
to be leaving anytime soon.

372
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:49,981
I can't make any decision
so I came in to ask you what I should do.

373
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,611
<i>Ye Hua...</i>

374
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:05,721
<i>300 years ago, did you only marry me
because Su Ji betrayed you?</i>

375
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:08,037
<i>Have you ever truly loved me?</i>

376
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:11,929
<i>If you do love me
how deeply do you love me?</i>

377
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,553
<i>If I weren't tricked into jumping
off the Zhuxian Terrace</i>

378
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:18,362
<i>would you have willingly married Su Jin?</i>

379
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:24,740
<i>Are you now so deeply devoted to me
because of that guilt from 300 years ago?</i>

380
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,167
<i>What if he admitted to all that?</i>

381
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,653
<i>What if he said that were all true?</i>

382
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:32,999
Auntie, will you see him or not?

383
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:37,751
I won't see him.

384
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,884
Tell him never to come to Qing Qiu again.

385
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:49,988
I'll go to the Heavenly Lord tomorrow
to break off the engagement.

386
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,661
Yes.

387
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,979
Crown Prince.

388
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,936
My Auntie said...

389
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,586
She still refuses to see me?

390
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:33,834
Not exactly.

391
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:37,627
She's just too drunk,
so she didn't pay much attention to me.

392
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:39,969
Your Highness has been here
for seven days already.

393
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:42,065
Why don't you head back?

394
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:44,555
I'll inform you when she's sober.

395
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:46,298
I'm not going anywhere.

396
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,714
Let me get you an umbrella first.

397
00:29:51,714 --> 00:29:53,462
- It might rain soon...
- Don't bother.

398
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:58,907
I'll take my leave now.

399
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:00,114
Mi Gu.

400
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,483
What is it, Your Highness?

401
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,813
Pass on a message for me.

402
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:08,792
Please do tell.

403
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,903
Before I went for my trial
in the Mortal Realm

404
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:17,008
your Auntie told me that

405
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:20,919
should my mortal self
get into any relationships

406
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,894
she would snatch me back
to lock up in her Fox Den.

407
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:32,763
If the maid I brought home to
serve my mortal mother

408
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,357
counts as a relationship

409
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:41,345
could you ask her if what she said
to me still counts?

410
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:45,027
I'll pass on your message to her.

411
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,678
Auntie.

412
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:10,894
His Highness asked me
to pass on a message to you.

413
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:16,313
You said that if he gets into any
relationships as a mortal

414
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:19,020
you would lock him up in Qing Qiu.

415
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,825
If the maid he brought home
to serve his mother

416
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:29,688
is considered as a relationship,
do your words still count?

417
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:33,356
No!

418
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:37,470
No matter what excuses he has,
it doesn't count!

419
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,269
Make him leave!

420
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,315
I don't ever want to see him again!

421
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:43,902
Auntie, calm down. Appease your anger.

422
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,848
Get out! Leave now!

423
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,948
Your Highness suffers from
new injuries and old ailment.

424
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:37,265
There's not enough cultivation
to protect your body.

425
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:38,663
You can't stay out in the rain.

426
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,188
Take the umbrella away.

427
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:41,227
Your Highness...

428
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:42,377
Take it away!

429
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,953
Your Crown Prince stood there
like that for seven days?

430
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:15,035
Exactly, High God.

431
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,056
Please try to talk Auntie around.

432
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,086
Only the both of you know that
His Highness almost died

433
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:25,372
from losing am arm and
using up his cultivation

434
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,030
to make the elixir for High God Mo Yuan.

435
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,298
If it weren't for High God Zhe Yan
he would have died.

436
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,672
If this goes on
he might really die young.

437
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:36,412
Knock wood!

438
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,417
What nonsense is that?

439
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,633
Don't jinx my brother-in-law.

440
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:41,800
High God, does that mean
you could persuade Auntie?

441
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,500
No, I can't.

442
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,202
Why not?

443
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:55,192
Jia Yun, you're not married yet?

444
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,153
Not yet.

445
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,654
The argument between a married couple
is strictly between them.

446
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:04,932
No other advice from anyone
would have helped.

447
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:08,137
It would only make it worse.

448
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:09,590
Exactly.

449
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,976
We can't help much.

450
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:14,644
Not even his own son.

451
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:18,096
Let's just wait and see.

452
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:19,666
Wait and see?

453
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:22,193
Wait till Qian Qian
figures her heart out.

454
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,088
Do you think it's that easy to
marry the Queen of Qing Qiu?

455
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:29,710
Among us four brothers
we only have one baby sister.

456
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,403
She happens to be very stubborn.

457
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,623
She's also a high god.

458
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:35,914
She suffered so much then
and even had her eyes dug out.

459
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:37,909
She will surely be upset for a few days.

460
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,731
Don't worry.

461
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:41,534
She'll get over it in a few days.

462
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,963
What if she never gets over it?

463
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,090
That's not possible.

464
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,371
We know how she is with Ye Hua.

465
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:56,211
High Gods, please rest soon.

466
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,003
I'll take my leave now.

467
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,900
How is the Bell of East Emperor?

468
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,565
Your Lordship.

469
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:23,501
It's been raining heavily
at Ruoshui Riverbank for ten days.

470
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:27,715
What could be the problem?

471
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:31,784
Would you like to ask the Crown Prince?

472
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,690
Since he's kept an eye
on Ruoshui all this time

473
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,331
he might already know about
some bad news?

474
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,353
Where is Ye Hua?

475
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:41,974
He's... in Qing Qiu.

476
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:45,806
That's right.

477
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,722
He should be in Qing Qiu.

478
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:51,251
Doesn't absence make
the heart grow fonder?

479
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,393
Yes.

480
00:35:52,393 --> 00:35:53,891
Forget it.

481
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:57,445
I can only set my mind at ease
if I see for myself.

482
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,333
- Star Lord.
- Present.

483
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:24,454
Whatever happens
you must keep the Little Princess safe.

484
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:25,518
Yes.

485
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,867
<i>Father, stop struggling.</i>

486
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:17,400
<i>Come back to the desolate Ghost Realm
and vacant Grand Ziming Palace</i>

487
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,521
<i>that the battle made bleak
70,000 years ago.</i>

488
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:27,952
Treacherous son!

489
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:30,083
Do you want me to kill you?

490
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:54,065
- Lord Dong Hua.
- How was it last night?

491
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,512
The strong currents raged on
and dark clouds swept in.

492
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:59,907
Such a sight disturbed me greatly.

493
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:04,539
Now that I've lost my powers
I can't investigate into the bell.

494
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:06,572
Judging by this phenomena

495
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:09,217
it's highly likely that
Qing Cang's spirit has consolidated

496
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,608
and is about to break out of the bell.

497
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:15,780
If we're to look inside the bell
we'll need to use soul-tracking magic.

498
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,061
I'm not capable of such magic either.

499
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,742
Head over to
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods now

500
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:22,733
and invite High God Zhe Yan.

501
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,788
Yes.

502
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:27,197
Your Lordship, I can use
the soul-tracking magic.

503
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You?

504
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:33,121
Auntie and Zhe Yan taught me
when we were in the woods.

505
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,273
I know how to conduct it.

506
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:38,445
Besides, you lost your powers
because of me in the Mortal Realm...

507
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:41,326
I should handle this matter.

508
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,592
Don't hesitate.

509
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:46,925
Just let me do it.

510
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:18,579
<i>Lord Dong Hua, there's no spirit in it!</i>

511
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,054
<i>What?</i>

512
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:23,380
<i>It might be that I'm not
skilled enough.</i>

513
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,623
<i>Let me try it again.</i>

514
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,541
Treacherous son!

515
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:21,039
How dare you imprison my spirit!

516
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,809
Father, how have you been?

517
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,782
Don't forget.

518
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:43,967
Only your spirit is here so
you can't touch me.

519
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:50,242
My biggest mistake was
letting you off 70,000 years ago!

520
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,309
You're wrong!

521
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:55,416
Your biggest mistake was raising me.

522
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,744
You wanted to use me
to boost your powers, right?

523
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:04,567
You raised children to serve
as your power vessels.

524
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:08,262
What father can be more cruel than you?

525
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:19,096
You exhausted all resources and
thousands of our soldiers in one night!

526
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,797
You deserve to be killed!

527
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,751
You used your children to
store your powers. How cruel.

528
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:30,342
You deserve to be killed!

529
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,083
You know that crimson hellfire
would destroy all realms

530
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:38,182
and yet you didn't hesitate
to drag everyone down with you!

531
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:39,762
You deserve to be killed!

532
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,036
Treacherous son!

533
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:47,190
Have you forgotten
that I've raised you?

534
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,233
Have you forgotten that
my blood runs in your veins?

535
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:54,186
You want to kill your father?

536
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:57,041
How monstrous!

537
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:05,224
You've used up all your blood
to summon my spirit.

538
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:08,721
How much longer could you live?

539
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,014
Good!

540
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:18,858
Then the both of us will die here today.

541
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,313
Double Crescent Halberd?

542
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,612
You didn't think of that?

543
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:43,193
My spirit might not be able to hurt you,
but this Double Crescent Halberd will.

544
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,367
Li Jing, I'll take your life!

545
