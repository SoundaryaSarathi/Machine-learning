Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.01,0:06:41.67,main,,0000,0000,0000,,But now that we're ready, let us search for what Miss Kiririn desires!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.27,0:06:50.80,main,,0000,0000,0000,,The first thing that comes to mind would probably be this kind of stuff.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.08,0:07:02.98,main,,0000,0000,0000,,But it doesn't feel quite right...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.98,0:07:06.65,main,,0000,0000,0000,,This seems a bit weird for what she'd want the most.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.63,0:07:12.76,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Then perhaps a visual fanbook for eroge she likes?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.76,0:07:16.20,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Or perhaps rare doujinshi?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.59,0:07:20.46,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Uh... thanks for the suggestion,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.46,0:07:23.21,main,,0000,0000,0000,,but the requester would murder me over this.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.10,0:07:25.71,main,,0000,0000,0000,,There's no point in coming here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.31,0:07:29.51,main,,0000,0000,0000,,She probably already has everything she wants from here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.86,0:07:31.30,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.94,0:07:38.56,main,,0000,0000,0000,,The greatest work of art ever to grace the Earth at the hands of Man, for ¥980?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.03,0:07:42.10,main,,0000,0000,0000,,What will they do next?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.75,0:07:45.00,main,,0000,0000,0000,,This please.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.00,0:07:46.27,main,,0000,0000,0000,,You're buying it?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.79,0:07:51.82,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Man, we can't find anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.82,0:07:55.24,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Are you sure a Meruru plushie isn't good enough?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.24,0:07:58.24,main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's probably the best thing we've found so far,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.24,0:08:01.33,main,,0000,0000,0000,,but I get the feeling there's something even better out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.33,0:08:03.33,main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's just not coming to mind.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.33,0:08:07.21,main,,0000,0000,0000,,It just has to be backwards compatible with that, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.21,0:08:10.71,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Something she would like, and isn't indecent.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.07,0:08:14.51,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Something hard to obtain, with real value behind it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.51,0:08:16.93,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Something like that won't just pop—
