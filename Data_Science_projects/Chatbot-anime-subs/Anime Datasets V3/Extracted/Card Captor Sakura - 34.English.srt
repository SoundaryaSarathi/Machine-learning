1
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:07,415
Hey, have you heard?

2
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,218
There’s a Quiz Competition coming up.

3
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,813
Is that the one this Sunday?

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:12,689
Yeah!

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,591
You can only enter in pairs, right?

6
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:19,193
Oh, you’re going to
enter with Yamazaki, then?

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,125
Umm…

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,591
He keeps joking with his lies,

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,470
but it seems he’s good at quizzes.

10
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,031
How about you, Sakura?

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,632
Eh?

12
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:40,181
Quiz Competition, huh?

13
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,352
I don’t have cleaning
duty next Sunday…

14
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:53,658
Maybe I should ask Tomoyo.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,830
I’m looking forward to it!

16
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:07,812
[Sakura and Yukito
and the Midday Moon]

17
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:20,120
Tomoeda Town Quiz Rally

18
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,460
Sakura? What’s wrong?

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,521
It’s this, right?

20
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,194
Tomoeda Town Quiz Rally.

21
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,264
Sounds fun,
doesn’t it?

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,194
It’s some kind
of trivia thing?

23
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:34,761
Let’s see…

24
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,970
This year’s Quiz Competition…

25
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,608
…is meant to encourage a greater
understanding of Tomoeda.

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,641
There will be a number
of questions each leading

27
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:44,479
To a hidden location.

28
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:47,848
We will present a magnificent trophy
to the champion.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,745
A trophy!

30
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:49,980
Wah!

31
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,755
To promote teamwork,

32
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,286
we will only accept teams of two.

33
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,652
So you’re going with Yamazaki, right?

34
00:01:57,196 --> 00:01:58,288
I’m a little worried, but…

35
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,894
Sakura, are you entering?

36
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:03,999
I’ll go root for you!

37
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:05,294
Me, too!

38
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:07,071
OK!

39
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,232
Tomoyo, wanna enter together?

40
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,204
I’d be delighted!

41
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:13,703
But

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,212
if I’m a contestant,

43
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,175
I won’t be able
to capture it on video.

44
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:22,219
To get nice shots of Sakura…

45
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:23,985
That’s my goal!

46
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,282
How about entering with me?

47
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:27,391
Eh?

48
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:32,421
Yukito!

49
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:33,828
You mean it?!

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,800
Isn’t that great, Sakura?

51
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,738
The Tomoeda Town Quiz Competition, huh?

52
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:47,208
Sounds like fun.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,146
Yep!

54
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:49,946
I’m going to enter with Yukito.

55
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:51,206
What about you, Touya?

56
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,449
Part-time job.

57
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:59,247
We’ll win and bring back
the magnificent trophy!

58
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,289
I’ll be looking forward to it.

59
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:05,057
But don’t get hurt trying too hard.

60
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:06,323
OK!

61
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,160
Finished.

62
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:12,431
Oh, thanks!

63
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,369
I’ll wear this tomorrow!

64
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,037
That was worth three cleaning duties.

65
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:39,061
My power hasn’t returned…

66
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,261
Umm…

67
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:54,676
Good morning!

68
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:55,641
Good morning, Sakura.

69
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,673
Morning, Kinomoto.

70
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,777
One two… one two…

71
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,153
Mei Lin, Li…

72
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:09,286
Shao Lan and I are going to win

73
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:10,361
this tournament!

74
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,958
That magnificent trophy will be ours!

75
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,731
Where’re you going, Shao Lan?

76
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,561
Why do I have to be in this?

77
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:17,401
Good morning!

78
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:21,467
Yukito!

79
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:23,033
Sorry.

80
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:24,871
I was at a nearby shop,

81
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,971
and breakfast took longer
than I thought…

82
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,139
Let’s do our best today, all right?

83
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:30,571
Okay!

84
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:33,877
I’ll go get the booklet.

85
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:36,547
Me, too.

86
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,382
Wait here, Shao Lan.

87
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:41,525
Hey.

88
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:43,958
You’re entering with “him?

89
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:45,158
Yes.

90
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:49,795
You’re in this, too?

91
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,629
Let’s do our best, all right?

92
00:04:58,944 --> 00:04:59,535
Oh!

93
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,639
Hey, where’re you going, Shao Lan?

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,310
No, it’s just that…

95
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,976
I can’t tolerate that…

96
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:07,076
I told you I’d be right back…

97
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:18,925
Good luck!

98
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,964
Everyone, good luck!

99
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,028
All preparations are complete.

100
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,266
Good morning, everyone!

101
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,439
Please have lots of fun here

102
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:33,936
in the Tomoeda Town
shopping district all day today.

103
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,013
And remember,
we have a magnificent trophy

104
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:37,907
for the winner.

105
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,151
It’s all mine.

106
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,182
And for all the participants,

107
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,617
we have thank you gifts…

108
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,395
…from the members

109
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,364
of the shopping district

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,392
Chamber of Commerce.

111
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,469
Now, to explain the rules.

112
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,065
First, there’s only
one quiz to solve at a time.

113
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,533
If you solve that,

114
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,068
you will receive a piece of paper

115
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:06,705
with the next goal.

116
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,841
That paper will lead to another quiz,

117
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,843
and if you solve that… 
you’ll find out the next goal.

118
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:13,848
There are 10 quizzes at all.

119
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,583
As you pass each one,

120
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,419
you will get a stamp
in the booklet

121
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,448
that you’ve all been given.

122
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:24,388
If you get all the stamps,

123
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:27,229
you will get the paper
with the final goal.

124
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:28,833
There,

125
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:31,713
It looks like this.

126
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:33,270
A relief with
Tomoeda Town’s flower,

127
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,537
the Nadeshiko, on it.

128
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:36,770
When you find this,

129
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:38,369
bring it back here.

130
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,278
If you find and bring
back the relief by chance,

131
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:42,409
it doesn’t count.

132
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,110
There are plenty
of relief to go around.

133
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,983
No matter who finds them,
that’s the goal.

134
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:48,583
The reliefs are in all kinds of places.

135
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,816
They might be

136
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:52,451
in hard-to-find places,

137
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,656
so everyone, good luck!

138
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:56,491
Sounds hard.

139
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:57,486
We’ll be fine.

140
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,090
If we don’t even try the quiz,
we can’t advance.

141
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,889
Age doesn’t seem to matter.

142
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:03,126
I guess so.

143
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,695
Oh, and speaking of quizzes…

144
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,764
The very first quiz was made
by a Greek philosopher, you know?

145
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:09,573
In morning, I have four legs.

146
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:10,431
During the day, I have two legs.

147
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,437
And at night I have three legs.

148
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:13,904
What am I?

149
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,246
That was the world’s first quiz.

150
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:16,172
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,539
And the one who took
that first quiz was…

152
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:21,749
Yamazaki,

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,382
the answer to that quiz…

154
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:24,514
Eh?

155
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:25,413
A human.

156
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,356
When you’re a baby you crawl,

157
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:28,660
then you walk on two legs…

158
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:30,451
…and finally,
you use a cane to help you walk.

159
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:31,722
I see.

160
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:35,166
So, the first question.

161
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,638
Using 10 matches, we’ve made a star.

162
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:44,807
Using these same 10 matches,

163
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,574
make a different star.

164
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,278
Oh! I don’t know.

165
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,276
So if you know the answer,
go to that booth

166
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:53,344
and demonstrate it.

167
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,613
If you get it right,

168
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,079
we’ll give you
the paper for the next goal.

169
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,448
I don’t get it.

170
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,160
All right, let’s go.

171
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,327
Eh…

172
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:09,529
Do you know it?

173
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:11,730
I sure hope so.

174
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,202
Eh?

175
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,503
Brother!

176
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:20,872
But… weren’t you…

177
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:21,904
Part-time job.

178
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:35,022
That’s it.

179
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:39,160
Here.

180
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:40,993
Here!

181
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,064
Later, Touya.

182
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:47,962
We’re off!

183
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:50,397
Don’t make a mistake by hurrying.

184
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:52,565
We’ll be fine.

185
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,645
Cause I’m with Yukito.

186
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,922
Hey, hey!

187
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,294
I got it!

188
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,531
There!

189
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,541
The matches are
like stars in the sky!

190
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,176
That’s not it.

191
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:31,280
Why?!

192
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,485
Sakura, you’re fast.

193
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:44,057
Your store is the next goal?

194
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,193
So here’s the question:

195
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:49,732
In order to make water into ice,
you have to put it in the freezer…

196
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,993
…and wait for a while, right?

197
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,796
But there’s a way

198
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:57,166
to turn ice back into water instantly.

199
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,737
So how would you go about doing that?

200
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,680
Umm…

201
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,045
How about putting it in a volcano?

202
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:09,984
Wouldn’t that take some time?

203
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:13,982
Then, then…

204
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:15,256
Putting it in the sun?

205
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:18,056
That’s not it.

206
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,062
Eh?

207
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,460
Let me try something.

208
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:26,162
[KOORI]
Here’s ice…

209
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:29,865
Eh?

210
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,440
[MIZU]
Water.

211
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,646
That’s it.

212
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,311
That’s amazing!

213
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,260
It’s a field of stars!

214
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:02,731
That’s not it.

215
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:05,309
Why?!

216
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,097
Looks like we’ve got just one more.

217
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:27,931
Right!

218
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:44,671
You got it.

219
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,447
Yamazaki, you’re great!

220
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,013
The answer was pretty obvious.

221
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:52,949
You like these kinds of puzzles,

222
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:54,052
don’t you?

223
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,651
Yeah, I like it more

224
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:58,187
when the answers

225
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,064
just come to me like that.

226
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,325
What’s that about?

227
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:04,893
Chiharu.

228
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,299
Sakura.

229
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:10,297
Miss Mizuki, what’s going on?

230
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,768
There are a lot of Tomoeda
Elementary students participating,

231
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,107
so I’m helping out.

232
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,748
Hey, Chiharu,

233
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:24,347
how many stamps do you have?

234
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,717
Take a look. We’ve got all of them!

235
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:30,127
Looks like Yamazaki’s
team is the leader.

236
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:31,953
That’s great!

237
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:34,392
Kinomoto, how many do you have?

238
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:35,865
Right now, nine.

239
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,602
So then this is the last one.
Good luck.

240
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:40,026
Thanks!

241
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:41,597
See ya!

242
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:42,871
OK, good luck!

243
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:50,871
So, here’s the last problem.

244
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:01,581
Without putting your hand inside,

245
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:04,660
without tipping the beaker over… and
only using what’s on this table,

246
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,657
please get the ball out.

247
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,027
now, the two of you do
“rock-paper-scissors.

248
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,336
Eh?

249
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:14,930
Jan-ken-pon!

250
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:16,801
Aiko-de-sho!

251
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,037
Aiko-de-sho!

252
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:26,840
This problem will be
solved by the winner.

253
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,618
Don’t worry.

254
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:35,025
If you think it over carefully,

255
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,018
I’m sure you’ll figure it out.

256
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,055
OK!

257
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,556
Um…

258
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:51,568
You are…

259
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,103
I’m Tsukishiro Yukito.

260
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:55,307
You helped us out with cleaning before,
right?

261
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,212
Yes.

262
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,112
How long have you lived in Tomoeda?

263
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,411
Since my first year of high school.

264
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,477
You live with your grandfather
and grandmother, right?

265
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:05,189
I love travel pretty much,

266
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,852
but they’re hardly ever home.

267
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:07,748
I see.

268
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,328
Yukito, you…

269
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:11,161
Yes?

270
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:13,490
I got it!

271
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,576
Here, I’ve got the ball!

272
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,411
Yes, that’s it.

273
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,179
I did it! Yay! Yay!

274
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:36,349
That’s great, Sakura!

275
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:40,346
Stamp, please.

276
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:41,258
Here you go.

277
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,660
Thank you very much!

278
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:46,721
Good luck.

279
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:47,630
Thanks!

280
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,224
All right, let’s go.

281
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:52,299
The last goal is…

282
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:53,998
Kinomoto?

283
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:55,005
Eh?

284
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:57,865
Be careful.

285
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,973
Because there’s a full moon today.

286
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:17,861
Sakura, fight!

287
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,431
Sakura?

288
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,307
I’m going for it!

289
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,413
The last goal is in Penguin Park.

290
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:38,975
The relief is there.

291
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,312
We’re off!

292
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:41,375
Later!

293
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,743
Let’s go.

294
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,264
There’s a place like this around here?

295
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,895
I didn’t know,

296
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,797
since this isn’t near

297
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:04,869
one of the playground areas…

298
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,742
It says the relief should be
right around here, but…

299
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:28,123
The moon.

300
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,101
Oh yeah, I guess you can still
see the moon during the day.

301
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:38,476
How pretty…

302
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:43,740
Be careful.

303
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,409
Because there’s a full moon today.

304
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:27,615
Sakura!

305
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,262
Sakura…

306
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,060
Eh!

307
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:15,229
Yukito!

308
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:16,631
Are you alright?

309
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:20,542
Does it hurt anywhere?

310
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:23,508
No…

311
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:24,639
Good.

312
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:29,949
Your leg…

313
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:35,885
Yukito,

314
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,258
I’m so sorry.
You’re hurt, aren’t you?

315
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:39,994
It’s because I spaced out…

316
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:41,726
I’m sorry…

317
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:45,634
It’s OK.

318
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:52,509
It’s fun just being with you.

319
00:18:58,883 --> 00:18:59,611
Feel better?

320
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:00,450
Yes!

321
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:01,250
Oh yeah.

322
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:04,416
Actually, I fell on this.

323
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:05,648
Look.

324
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:10,592
Woo…

325
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,292
I wonder if everyone
else found their goal.

326
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:20,193
Well,

327
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:21,832
let’s do our best until the end.

328
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,984
Doing it like this… No!

329
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,441
This one for sure!

330
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:45,121
We’ve looked everywhere.

331
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:46,789
I see…

332
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:48,056
Sakura…

333
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:51,629
And they were just
behind Yamazaki and Chiharu.

334
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,931
And we got these amusement
park tickets, too…

335
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,371
I wonder where they went…?

336
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,736
They’re still not back?

337
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:01,207
Going to look for them?

338
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:02,402
Yeah.

339
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:03,303
I’m going, too.

340
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:14,114
Sakura!

341
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:15,451
Sakura!

342
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,224
Eh?

343
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:17,288
Where, where?

344
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:22,523
What were you doing?

345
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,796
Yukito got hurt,

346
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:26,301
and it was my fault…

347
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:27,470
eh!

348
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:28,496
I’m OK!

349
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,133
No you aren’t.

350
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:34,703
How about you?
Are you alright?

351
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,547
I’m fine,

352
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,846
because Yukito saved me.

353
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,342
Oh, man.

354
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,309
Sakura!

355
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:43,010
Alright

356
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:44,617
Are you OK?

357
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:45,783
I’m fine.

358
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,121
You waited for me.
Sorry about that.

359
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:50,017
Sakura.

360
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:50,826
Eh?

361
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:52,354
Your prize.

362
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:54,759
Wah…

363
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,228
This is perfect!

364
00:20:58,669 --> 00:20:59,533
I needed one of these!

365
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,101
We got the same thing.

366
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:13,145
Yukito…
