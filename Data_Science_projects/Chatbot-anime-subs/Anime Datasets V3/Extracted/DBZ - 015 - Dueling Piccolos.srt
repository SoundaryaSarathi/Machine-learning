00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,454
Let's see...

2
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:47,138
Goku-<i>sa</i>, look at this! Gohan is already
solvin' problems as difficult as this!

3
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:51,472
I can't wait to see what kind of great
scholar he'll become in the future!

4
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,371
Yeah, I'll bet!

5
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:05,382
Mother... Father...

6
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:24,098
<i>Try taking this on!</i>
<i>Makankosappo!!</i>

7
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:18,096
H- he avoided it! W- what kind
of bastard is he, with such speed?

8
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:23,261
You pierced through this armor
quite easily. That's quite a technique.

9
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,439
If I had taken that head-on,
I would have been out!

10
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,441
That doesn't mean anything
if I don't hit you!

11
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,811
To think that you would
inflict injury upon me!

12
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:37,115
You're going to pay for this!
I'm through playing around!

13
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,606
It doesn't mean anything
if I don't hit you!

14
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,504
All right!

15
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,834
Wow, I did it!

16
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,552
I lost a great deal of time
to Old Lady Snake there.

17
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,249
If I don't hurry up,
things will get nasty!

18
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,581
Oh, no you don't!

19
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,106
Hey, we meet again!

20
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,658
It sure is big!

21
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,266
I wonder how long
this beach goes on for.

22
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,840
Mother...

23
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:37,955
Chichi!

24
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:46,170
I brung some of my special-made porridge.

25
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,639
Eat some of this,
you'll feel better, Chichi.

26
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,974
Nope.

27
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:55,646
You ain't eaten nothin'
for a whole week now, have you?

28
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:56,581
Come on, just eat this.

29
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,947
I'm not goin' to...

30
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:02,219
Gohan...

31
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,631
Huh? That's what I made!

32
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,270
I've come back to the starting point.

33
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:32,579
All right, then...

34
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:24,496
This is an island!

35
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,748
Beyond there is Mother!
All right, then!

36
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,361
<i>Makankosappo!!</i>

37
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:57,895
This one looks like it's the best.

38
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:59,487
All right, then...

39
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,861
Thank you!

40
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,700
Move it, move it, you're in the way!

41
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,905
It's finished!

42
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:18,242
I did it! I did it!

43
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,176
All right, now...

44
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,911
All right, here I go!

45
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,596
It's okay, I'll be back right away!

46
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,656
I'm just going to go see
my mother for a little while.

47
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,432
That should be good enough...

48
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:11,748
--The kid!
--It couldn't be!

49
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:36,914
Rain?

50
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,541
There's a storm coming!

51
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,200
I can't turn back now!

52
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,897
I've got to tough it out!
Got to tough it out!

53
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:15,151
It's okay, it's okay. I'll get through...
I'll get through the storm soon enough!

54
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:30,567
Ah, this is bad! If this keeps up,
I'll be swamped! And I can't swim!

55
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,970
I... can't swim! I can't swim!

56
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,411
<i>That dirty brat!</i>
<i>Where the hell did he go?</i>

57
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,285
<i>Gohan, what about your</i>
<i>training with Piccolo?</i>

58
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>Have you forgotten about</i>
<i>the crisis the world is in?</i>

59
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:29,055
<i>Eight months remain</i>
<i>until the Saiyans arrive.</i>
