1
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:04,063
They're going to choose
the Moon Princess

2
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,766
by her looks, athletic ability
and gracefulness?!

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:11,237
So, what about me?! I'm stuck
in all this snow!

4
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:14,297
A girl's not supposed to let her
hips get cold, you know?!

5
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:19,234
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short
sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

8
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:08,312
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

9
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:14,718
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

12
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,774
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

13
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta no
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,421
The Snow! The Mountains! Our
Friendship! And Of Course, a Monster, Too

16
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,721
Hey, everyone, let's go!

17
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:10,970
It says here that one of
the events is called

18
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,772
the Moon Princess Contest!

19
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:14,672
Moon Princess Contest?

20
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,542
That's right!

21
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:20,112
Don't you think this contest was
practically made for me?!

22
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:21,881
Let me see.

23
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,283
Wow! "The award ceremony
at Moonlight Course

24
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,551
Moon Princess Contest
Wow! "The award ceremony
at Moonlight Course

25
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,919
Moon Princess Contest
Executive Committee
will be held in the moonlight."

26
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,681
Will be held in the moonlight."

27
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,678
Oh...

28
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,793
Moon Princess

29
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,000
It sure does sound romantic.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,502
Don't you think so?!

31
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:46,405
We don't mind, but won't Luna
make a fuss about it again?

32
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:49,208
You don't have to worry about
that. We'll just tell Luna

33
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,978
that we're going to the snowy
mountains for special training.

34
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:55,675
It's a little surprising to hear that
coming from you.

35
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,850
Huh? You think so?

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,021
But if you tell Luna and Artemis,
I'm sure they'll be satisfied.

37
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,490
Then, we're all going?!

38
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,127
But I wonder if we can get
hotel reservations now?

39
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:09,958
If you'd like, I'll arrange
something for you.

40
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,031
Yuichiro.

41
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:15,134
My parents live right
near that place.

42
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:18,938
Really?! Then, please!
We're counting on you!

43
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:23,342
Sure! Then, Miss Rei, I will ask for
some days off as well and...

44
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:26,903
What? You're planning on
coming with us?

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,882
Would that be wrong?

46
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:31,717
Come on, it's okay, Rei.

47
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,085
"Even a chance meeting is due

48
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,643
to a kindness in a previous life,"
you know?

49
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,959
Mako, that should be "due to your
karma from a previous life."

50
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,394
But either way, I'm not sure

51
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,692
that proverb applies for this situation.

52
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:51,169
Moon Princess Contest
Executive Committee

53
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,701
They are a girly bunch.

54
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:57,076
They are certain to buy into this event.

55
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,373
Kunzite.

56
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:02,044
Do you not think you are
underestimating them a little?

57
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:03,608
What?!

58
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,253
Every last one of your
previous tactics failed.

59
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:08,754
My analysis shows that is entirely due

60
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,813
to you underestimating
your opponents.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,529
I believe knowing your enemy
and knowing yourself

62
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,965
is the first step in building a strategy.

63
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:20,533
Do you not agree?

64
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,835
You impress me, Endymion.

65
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,904
The long time you spent fighting
with Sailor Moon

66
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,439
certainly shows.

67
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:29,135
You must know a great
deal about them.

68
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,333
But this is none of your business!

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,645
I will defeat the sailor warriors
without fail.

70
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,656
Zoisite...

71
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,236
Wow, it's so beautiful!

72
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,171
It really feels like we're here!

73
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:02,041
I feel bad for having left Luna
and Artemis behind.

74
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,175
You don't have to worry about that.

75
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,871
As they say, "The cat curls up
on the heated table."

76
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:11,751
The heated table is the
best thing in winter.

77
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,981
Don't you think so, Artemis?

78
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,913
He looks so peaceful.

79
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:24,094
But I can't believe they went for
training in such a cold place.

80
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,795
I'm so impressed.

81
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,865
My parents are at their vacation
home in Switzerland.

82
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:43,114
Excuse me, Yuichiro...

83
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,184
Why is a rich boy...

84
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,420
Oh, I mean, the son of good
family like you,

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,945
training at our shrine?

86
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,458
To become a better person, of course.

87
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,293
Oh, I see...

88
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:58,457
Rei, I hear there are a lot of weird
people among the rich.

89
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,162
That might be true.

90
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,559
Anyway, whatever!
Come on, let's go ski!

91
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:06,163
Yeah!

92
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,570
Yay!

93
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:12,244
It's snow, it's snow! Yay! Yay!

94
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:14,246
It's a perfect day for skiing.

95
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,681
It really is!

96
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,208
Come to think of it, where did
Rei and Yuichiro go?

97
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,965
Let's go up higher instead
of skiing in this flat area.

98
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,401
No, that's all right.

99
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,970
You and Yuichiro can feel free
to go on up there.

100
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,272
We're having plenty
of fun right here.

101
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:41,762
That's right!

102
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,743
But Miss Usagi,

103
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,445
you're participating in the Moon
Princess Contest, right?

104
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,676
Because the contest hall is
at the top of this mountain.

105
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:53,585
What?!

106
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:57,289
That contest requires beauty
in face and figure, of course,

107
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,484
but you can't be chosen unless
you're also a good skier.

108
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,494
No way...

109
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:04,263
What will you do, Usagi?
Will you forfeit?

110
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:08,222
Then, maybe I'll take the crown
of the princess!

111
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,666
I'm going!

112
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,403
How could the real Moon Princess
not participate?!

113
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,905
Moon Princess Contest

114
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:24,383
Have any likely candidates shown up?

115
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,782
No, not yet.

116
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:28,187
I see.

117
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:30,990
Just remember, if you use the
monster power that I gave you,

118
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,517
you will be able to uncover
Sailor Moon's identity.

119
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,328
Make sure you do it right.

120
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,387
Yes, Sir. Please leave it to me.

121
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:55,381
Don't tell me we're going
to ski down that thing.

122
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:59,283
Not at all! This is nothing compared
to the area near the top.

123
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,446
Oh, no!

124
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:07,854
These people are all a bunch
of daredevils!

125
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:08,327
Moon Princess Contest

126
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,930
Moon Princess Contest
Ladies, thank you for coming
to this event!

127
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,597
Moon Princess Contest

128
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:15,328
Moon Princess Contest
In a moment, we will start the fourth
Moon Princess Contest.

129
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,469
Your hostess, who will guide you
through this contest,

130
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,460
is the first Moon Princess

131
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:22,274
Moon Princess Contest
and our very own instructor here
at the Moonlight Slopes,

132
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,343
Moon Princess Contest
Ms. Saeko Yamamoto!

133
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,078
Moon Princess Contest

134
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,380
Moon Princess Contest
Then, I will now explain the
judging process to you.

135
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,714
Then, I will now explain the
judging process to you.

136
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:32,585
The woman who gets to the bottom
of this Moonlight Course first

137
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:36,822
and does so most gracefully will be
this year's Moon Princess.

138
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:39,625
It is a night course, but
it is completely safe,

139
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,593
so please ski without any worries.

140
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:55,635
Then, start!

141
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:11,924
I'm going to quit after all!

142
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:15,087
Miss Usagi, you can't afford
to get a late start.

143
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:16,991
There you go!

144
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:28,204
See? Nothing's impossible, if you try!

145
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:45,117
This course is actually
going right to Hell.

146
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,602
I just felt something like
an evil aura, but...

147
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:01,607
It can't be.

148
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,201
There's no way a monster
would appear here, right?

149
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,714
Usagi?!

150
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,911
I can't stop!

151
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:18,287
Usagi isn't half-bad! All right!
I'm not going to be outdone!

152
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,323
Someone stop me!

153
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,668
It seems one of those two must be

154
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,159
the princess of the moon, Sailor Moon.

155
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:02,302
Usagi, it'll be dangerous if you
don't slow down more!

156
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:06,796
I know that! But there's nothing
I can do about it!

157
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:18,318
Usagi! Go, faster!

158
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,446
I told you, I have no control at all!

159
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:29,027
I'm pretty sure I just heard
an avalanche!

160
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,422
I hope Miss Rei isn't...

161
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,330
Hurry!

162
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,466
How about this?!

163
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:47,778
Blizzar!

164
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,415
What is this?!

165
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,826
I'm scared!

166
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,496
Miss Rei!

167
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:10,760
Miss Rei, I'll be right there
to rescue you!

168
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,941
Miss Rei!

169
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,442
I thought I just heard
someone's voice...

170
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:27,654
There is something to being
the princess.

171
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:29,849
But I doubt you can escape from this!

172
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:34,757
Bli! Bli! Bli! Bli!

173
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:44,397
Usagi!

174
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,417
What'll we do now?

175
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,984
Something is wrong here.
Could it be a monster?

176
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,190
Rei, are you all right?

177
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,069
Of course, I'm not all right!

178
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,903
Come on! Hurry up and
climb out of here!

179
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,116
Say, Rei, let's think of some other way.

180
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:31,518
What are you saying?!

181
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,953
You'll become less of a woman
if you give up so easily!

182
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:36,319
You have to show your
willpower! Willpower!

183
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:41,161
Man, I guess they will have already
picked somebody else

184
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:42,295
to be the Moon Princess.

185
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,164
I'm sure they did! Thanks to someone,

186
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,466
I've missed my chance at the crown!

187
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,592
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,805
Tuxedo Mask...

189
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,247
Oh, Rei!

190
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,750
That belongs to Tuxedo Mask, right?

191
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,876
Yeah.

192
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:09,383
When I'm feeling Ionely and stuff,
listening to this makes me feel better.

193
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:22,769
Oh, I'm not trying to show
this off or anything!

194
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,071
I just wanted a change of pace...

195
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:28,006
I'm sorry, Rei. Did I hurt your feelings?

196
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:32,378
Why? I don't care about that anymore.

197
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,547
What? But...

198
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:37,217
To be honest, I've already
given up on Mamoru...

199
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,846
No, I mean, Tuxedo Mask.

200
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:44,221
After all, he tried to protect you
and put his own life at risk.

201
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,284
I can't possibly win against that.

202
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:48,653
Rei...

203
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,698
But remember this, Usagi Tsukino.

204
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:56,294
If you don't become happy with
Mamoru, I will punish you!

205
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,194
Okay.

206
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,806
And to do that,

207
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:02,075
we have to defeat the bad guys
in the Dark Kingdom,

208
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,843
and restore peace to the world.

209
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:06,846
You're right. Oh, I just
remembered something!

210
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,348
What's this all of a sudden?!

211
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:12,752
Rei, we can get right out of here
if you use your Fire Soul!

212
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:16,222
You're right! Why didn't you
notice that earlier?!

213
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,691
Usagi, you are such a slowpoke!

214
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:20,386
How about you, Rei?!

215
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:24,330
Okay, let's transform! Mars Power...

216
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,490
Miss Rei!

217
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,227
Thank goodness, you're safe!

218
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,027
Yuichiro!

219
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:34,033
This is a miracle born of love!

220
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:37,043
Come on! The exit is this way!
Let's hurry!

221
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,670
Not so fast!

222
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,880
Who are...

223
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,714
I am the monster, Blizzar.

224
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,658
I was sent to assassinate Sailor Moon.

225
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,993
I bet the minions of the
Dark Kingdom...

226
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,223
...transformed her into a monster!

227
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,154
Prepare to die, Sailor Moon!

228
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,233
What? Me?!

229
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,105
Good looks, athletic ability
and gracefulness.

230
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,699
You must be the princess of the moon!

231
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,344
Oh, you think so, too?

232
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:14,247
You are such an honest little monster.

233
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:17,350
What?! Miss Rei, you're Sailor Moon?!

234
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,885
You've got the wrong person!

235
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,150
Shut up! My judgment is never wrong!

236
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,891
Blizzar!

237
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,018
I will protect Miss Rei!

238
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,895
Yuichiro!

239
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,504
Usagi, this is perfect! Let's transform!

240
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,341
Rei, you're colder than this snow.

241
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,475
Hurry up!

242
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:43,276
Okay!

243
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,609
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

244
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:06,656
Mars Power Makeup!

245
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,318
So, both of you were sailor warriors?

246
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:37,296
I'll never forgive you for trapping us
in this place!

247
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:40,533
A girl's not supposed to let her
hips get cold, you know?!

248
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,269
How dare you freeze my Yuichiro?!

249
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,238
I hope you're prepared to pay for it!

250
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:51,036
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

251
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:54,974
In the name of the Mars,
I will chastise you!

252
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,682
That's enough impertinent talk.

253
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:01,146
Bli!

254
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:05,352
Fire

255
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:10,218
Soul!

256
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,798
This is the end!

257
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:16,799
Huh?

258
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,495
Tuxedo Mask!

259
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,937
Good evening, sailor warriors.

260
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,572
Endymion?!

261
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:31,850
I will take care of them.
Blizzar, back off!

262
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,482
Sailor Moon, en garde!

263
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,420
I will not miss next time.

264
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,232
What should we do?

265
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:52,099
Tuxedo Mask, have you forgotten

266
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,731
how you fought with us?!

267
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,243
The person you loved most dearly,

268
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,006
Sailor Moon, is right here!

269
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:01,039
Sailor Mars...

270
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:12,088
Please remember, Tuxedo Mask!

271
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,845
Endymion, what are you doing?!

272
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,580
Now, Sailor Moon!

273
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,877
Okay!

274
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:48,216
Moon Healing Escalation!

275
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:56,296
Refresh!

276
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,349
Killing you guys right now

277
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,285
would give me nothing to brag about!

278
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,810
Good-bye. We will meet again.

279
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:29,025
Tuxedo Mask, someday,
please come back to me.

280
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:34,035
But you know, Yuichiro is
such a hopeless idiot.

281
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,607
Idiot.

282
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:47,445
Oh? What am I doing here?

283
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:58,527
Oh, are you finally awake?

284
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,803
I'm so glad! You're safe!

285
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:08,541
Yes. Sailor warriors showed up
and rescued us.

286
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,745
I see. I'm sorry, I'm such
a good-for-nothing.

287
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:16,806
That's not true! Yuichiro,
you were really cool!

288
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,751
What?

289
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,184
Right, Rei?

290
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:22,755
Well, kind of.

291
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:25,053
Oh, really?!

292
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:28,387
Man, you're making me blush!

293
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:31,659
Hey, what are you doing
goofing off over here?!

294
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,767
Honestly! Everyone was worried!

295
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,068
But, I'm glad.

296
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:38,371
After all, they say, "A healthy horse
is a good horse."

297
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:42,137
I don't think that proverb is used
in situations like this.

298
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,978
Usagi kept on making
a mess of things,

299
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:47,780
so I just had an awful time of it!

300
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,383
What?! How could you say that?!

301
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:53,386
We reaffirmed our friendship
with each other, remember?!

302
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:56,549
Friendship with you?! I'd scrunch
it up and toss it away!

303
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:03,453
Rei's being mean to me!

00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:15,462
