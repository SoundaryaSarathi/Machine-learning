1
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm heading out.

2
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,420
Ah, bocchan, good morning!

3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,480
Shoveling the snow...

4
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,940
Good morning.

5
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,530
You don't have to.

6
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,380
Since I'm not going to school, my body's been too idle.

7
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,980
So this is like a substitute for club activities.

8
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,030
I see...

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,540
Be careful.

10
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,070
We weren't siblings, after all...

11
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,550
We weren't siblings, after all...

12
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,970
Well then, let's keep working...

13
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,060
Hiromi-san, you must be tired, right?

14
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,040
No, I was just spacing out a bit.

15
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,610
Hey! {was "Here", that could work too}

16
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,840
Thanks.

17
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,820
Were you calling your girlfriend?

18
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,470
Yeah, I guess...

19
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,040
You're quite popular with the girls, huh?

20
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,910
Ka-chan, time for a smoke!

21
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,910
TL Note: Ka-chan translates to "mom", but he's referring to his wife.

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,130
Yes!

23
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,460
That's not it...

24
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,620
This part is really important.

25
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,710
These problems will show up in the test, so remember them well!

26
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,910
Alright, now copy down this problem.

27
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
Making notes for Yuasa Hiromi?

28
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,740
What? There's nothing wrong with just taking notes, is there?

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,830
You've got it so good...

30
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,610
What is that supposed to mean?

31
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,050
Nothing.

32
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,680
Well then, maybe I should go see Ai-chan's cute face again.

33
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,010
Go ahead, do it!

34
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,180
Well then, see ya.

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,370
It's being buried more and more... more... more...

36
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,820
The love message Shinichirou gave me...

37
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,650
I want to see you...

38
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,520
I want to see you!

39
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,150
Isurugi Noe.

40
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,130
What?

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,150
Why don't you curse me too?

42
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,000
Curse me so that I will never come to like anyone.

43
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,020
I did something horrible to Miyokichi... something really horrible.

44
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,290
Let's break up.

45
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,250
Isn't a guy considered cool if his heart isn't affected by anyone?

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
I want to become a guy exactly like that.

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,630
No.

48
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,660
I will never agree to that.

49
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,120
Miyokichi...

50
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,440
I thought we needed to talk about this thoroughly again.

51
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,450
I am fine now.

52
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,100
Isurugi Noe cursed me so that I will never come to love anyone.

53
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,000
All I want now is to see Aiko smile.

54
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,910
Because Aiko has the prettiest smile.

55
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,520
See ya.

56
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm home.

57
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,650
Welcome home.

58
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,890
Today's math.

59
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,630
I heard that it's gonna be on the test.

60
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
I asked Tomoyo for the notes.

61
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,850
I think that won't happen. Kurobe-san was sleeping like a sealed demon!

62
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,430
Then, I'll talk to Tomoyo about your help.

63
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,520
She was sleeping so deeply that not even the teacher was able to wake her.

64
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,980
Such bad handwriting.

65
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,670
"Now, let's fly."

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,060
"Even if that's what Raigoumaru was thinking,"

67
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,830
"his stomach suddenly started growling."

68
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,570
This isn't the place where you take flight.

69
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,590
Why would Noe say that?

70
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,020
Um... I'd like to talk to you.

71
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,120
There's been a lot going on...

72
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm sorry for the trouble my wife has caused.

73
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,180
No, it's fine. It's already...

74
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,720
She went straight to the conclusion, thinking that with your mother, I...

75
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,360
Anyway, I understood what you wanted to say. I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

76
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,040
But, please don't forget this,

77
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Hiromi, you are part of the family.

78
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,200
Right.

79
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,650
Um...

80
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,020
Do you really mean it?

81
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,850
Thank you very much.

82
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,850
Hey.

83
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,970
You didn't pick up my calls.

84
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,880
I was suspended, after all.

85
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,020
Aren't you still suspended, though?

86
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,830
I don't want to hear that from someone who's suspended and still needs to work.

87
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,750
Well, whatever.

88
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
So, what's the matter?

89
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,900
Why don't we end it? This pretend dating?

90
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,360
It's not that I hate you.

91
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,320
But a lot has happened, and I've done a lot of thinking.

92
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,550
I think I want to break free from all this at once, and sort out my feelings.

93
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,450
Oh, I will use my work money and pay your bike...

94
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,800
I've told you. Breaking up would be troublesome for me!

95
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Because you'd break the contract?

96
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,980
I got an older bike from my boss.

97
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,830
I just need to exchange some parts and repair it, and it'll run.

98
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,020
Hey...

99
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,230
Listen to me!

100
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,610
I can't break our agreement.

101
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,850
Come on! For preventing injuries, running is the best!

102
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,470
The next match against Hotarugawa...

103
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,940
We have to win!

104
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,740
Yes!

105
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,240
What? You two broke up?

106
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,990
Yeah.

107
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,650
I see.

108
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,170
That's not something for you to be sad about!

109
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,880
Isurugi Noe is a pretty nice girl.

110
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,680
Just some helpful advice.

111
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
Well then, I'm leaving.

112
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,090
What? No way!

113
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,170
It's true! It's the first time I've heard about that!

114
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,900
Is it because of me?

115
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,780
Did you feed it those red seeds?

116
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,120
Yup.

117
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,340
What's the matter?

118
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,300
Well, a lot of things happened.

119
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,400
Why are you coming to me?

120
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,100
Eh?

121
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,770
Nah, it's nothing.

122
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,590
We have dance practice later, you want to come?

123
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,060
Can you dance for me today?

124
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,030
Yeah, sure.

125
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,160
Granny, just one more time.

126
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,950
This will be the last time I do it.

127
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,680
I made a lot today!

128
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
Eat as much as you'd like!

129
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,020
Good evening.

130
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,240
Good evening, bocchan!

131
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,020
There are lots of these left, so go ahead! Don't hold back.

132
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,620
Ai-chan's onigiri is always delicious.

133
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,750
Thanks.

134
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,290
I'll fetch you some tea.

135
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,530
Oh, this is my childhood friend Nobus...

136
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,520
Eh...

137
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,140
This is my childhood friend Ai-chan.

138
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,930
And this is my...

139
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,650
I know all about it. Isurugi Noe-chan, Shinichirou's first girlfriend.

140
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,620
It's about time to start.

141
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,960
Maybe I should say thank you.

142
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,810
Thanks to that curse you gave Miyokichi, I was saved.

143
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,690
I used to love Shinichirou...

144
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,780
What am I saying?

145
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,730
Things like curses don't exist.

146
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,490
If they did, I'd...

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,190
I'm leaving early!

148
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,550
I didn't tell my brother about this, so...

149
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,470
Good bye!

150
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh... see ya...

151
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,410
You two broke up, didn't you?

152
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,120
So you heard about it from Miyokichi.

153
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,090
Yeah.

154
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,350
You are thinking that this is your fault, right?

155
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,730
No...

156
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,020
But in truth, that's exactly it.

157
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,880
It's all Shinichirou's fault!

158
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,970
Hey, that's heavy, right? Let me carry it.

159
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,300
I won't accept Shinichirou's help anymore.

160
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,140
I'm starting to outgrow you.

161
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,740
Shinichirou-kun.

162
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,100
There's something I'd like to talk about.

163
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,850
Come in for a bit.

164
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,190
Take a seat there.

165
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,030
I will be done soon.

166
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,290
I've decided to leave this house.

167
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,310
He told me when I first came here,

168
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,220
If I don't feel comfortable living here, I could stay at his acquaintance's apartment.

169
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,260
But, I wanted to come to this house.

170
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,640
Then there's no need for you to leave now.

171
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,070
It's a lot of trouble living alone.

172
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,540
Oh, you were drawing something like this?

173
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,680
Eh? Ah, that is...!

174
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,310
"The you inside me has always been crying..."

175
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,620
"I want to wipe off your tears."

176
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,690
Well, that's...

177
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,890
What a beautiful drawing.

178
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,790
So you can draw this well, Shinichirou-kun.

179
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,150
I don't think it's a good idea for you to live alone.

180
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,590
Even while living in the same house,

181
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,670
I never got to know Shinichirou very well, it seems.

182
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Can't you reconsider?

183
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,530
I've already decided to.

184
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,650
I see...

185
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,100
"Now, let's fly."

186
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,400
"Even if that's what Raigoumaru was thinking,"

187
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,170
"his stomach suddenly started growling."

188
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,290
"So in the end, he decided to call it a day off."

189
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,990
"Tomorrow, after filling his stomach, he'll try to fly to the sky again."

190
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,420
Hiromi's leaving this home...

191
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,990
In the end, I couldn't do anything.

192
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,410
I even pulled everyone close to me into this,

193
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,130
and all it did was hurt them.

194
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,940
I never got to know how your soft cheeks would feel after the tears are wiped off.

195
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm moving on Sunday.

196
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,620
How sudden.

197
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,330
Yeah.

198
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,080
A room just got vacant.

199
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,550
I'll help you move.

200
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,610
Is there anything else to carry?

201
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,830
Oh, that's all.

202
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,460
What's the matter?

203
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,570
I remembered what happened when I first moved here.

204
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,340
It was this empty in here that time, too.

205
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,380
It's not that happy of a memory, is it?

206
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,960
No, sometimes nice things happened as well.

207
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,200
We went to the festival when we were small, right?

208
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,090
After seeing I'd lost one of my sandals, Shinichirou-kun made do with only one sandal, too.

209
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,940
"I don't remember..."

210
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,440
You told me the other day that you don't remember that.

211
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,870
How could I possibly forget?

212
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,010
That memory...

213
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,140
The happiness of the festival,

214
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,310
then getting lost, feeling sad...

215
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,860
and lonely.

216
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,350
Then you found me,

217
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,380
and we walked together with one shoe.

218
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,150
I was so happy.

219
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,190
That's why I came to this house.

220
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,210
Even if I lost my parents and was alone...

221
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,400
But if I came here, I was sure Shinichirou-kun would help me find a way.

222
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,500
A way back from all that sadness.

223
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,220
But now, that's not something I can wish for anymore.

224
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,290
Hiromi, I...

225
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,110
I'm going.

226
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,530
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

227
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,240
Don't act like a stranger, we're still just a stonethrow away.

228
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,310
Feel free to stop by and eat with us.

229
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,770
Sure.

230
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,770
I will also be waiting!

231
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,330
Yeah. Thank you.

232
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,950
If you want to come back, just tell me any time.

233
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,000
I will.

234
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
What's Shin-chan doing?

235
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,900
It's fine, we'll see each other at school.

236
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,060
"The you inside me has always been crying..."

237
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,530
"I want to wipe off your tears..."

238
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,780
I want to wipe off your tears!

239
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,730
I'm... a freaking idiot!

240
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,160
I could have done it! I could've wiped Hiromi's tears!

241
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,940
And still, why was I hesitating!?

242
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,010
I...

243
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,320
I...!

244
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,610
Err... The window...

245
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,480
You guys!

246
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,140
I'll properly wipe away your tears...

247
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,190
Properly wipe all of it away...

248
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,690
In the end, I couldn't understand your feelings.

249
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,920
It was definitvely on purpose! How terrible!

250
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,150
Wouldn't you like to meet?

251
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,800
The one you love is not me.
