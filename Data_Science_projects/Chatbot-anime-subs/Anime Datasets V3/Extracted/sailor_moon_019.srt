1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,568
There is no way a monster that plays

2
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:06,337
with an innocent girl's
emotions would...

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:12,469
There is no way he'd look
good in a tuxedo!

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,980
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

6
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

7
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

8
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

9
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:22,534
Guided by the light of the moon

10
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

11
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

13
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,429
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

15
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:00,173
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

16
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,308
and fight against bad guys.

17
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:06,472
I'm the sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:12,278
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

19
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,755
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

20
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,417
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

21
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,926
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

22
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,904
Usagi Is Thrilled!
Tuxedo Mask's Love Letter

23
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,002
The stars know everything.

24
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,447
Leo shines in the
southern night sky.

25
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:44,507
And the star, Regulus,
presides over his strong leg.

26
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:49,651
Show me the weakness of the sailor
warriors, our despised enemies.

27
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:05,838
Tuxedo Mask!

28
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:08,575
Moon Tiara Action!

29
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:12,204
Fire Soul!

30
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,010
Good-bye, sailor warriors!

31
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,889
He's so dreamy!

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,158
I have found Sailor Moon's weakness!

33
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,664
Nephrite, Queen Beryl
is calling for you.

34
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,574
Nephrite, it seems the collection
of human energy

35
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:47,113
is not proceeding very well.

36
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:49,513
The universe was not
created overnight.

37
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,684
Do not talk back to me!

38
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:54,254
If you cannot defeat Sailor Moon
and the others,

39
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:59,123
I will sentence you to "Eternal Sleep",
just like Jadeite!

40
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:03,630
Such a terrible punishment.

41
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,066
I am one of the Great Four of the
Dark Kingdom, Nephrite!

42
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,902
I do not need others to
order me around.

43
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:13,206
I am already thinking of a way to
defeat Sailor Moon and the rest.

44
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:17,734
I remember Jadeite used to say the
same thing... I wonder if you can...

45
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:24,008
I swear that I will lure Sailor Moon
out and kill her, without fail.

46
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,477
Very well.

47
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,485
And I already have a plan.

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,867
Oh?

49
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:41,501
Miss Usagi Tsukino
Oh?

50
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:41,728
Oh?

51
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,271
Why?! Why?! Why?!

52
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:45,772
From Tuxedo Mask
Why?! Why?! Why?!

53
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,740
From Tuxedo Mask
It's from Tuxedo Mask.

54
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,206
From Tuxedo Mask

55
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,777
"I love you more than anyone else."

56
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:54,247
"Please meet me at the MS Department
Store in Shinjuku tomorrow night."

57
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:57,080
Wow! All right!

58
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:02,244
Why the heck would Tuxedo Mask
send you a love letter?

59
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,957
You know why! Because...

60
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,163
He loves me!

61
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:14,600
But that's not right. How come he
knows you're Sailor Moon?

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,329
Love conquers all!

63
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:19,505
The power of love can
solve all mysteries.

64
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:25,545
In short, Tuxedo Mask's love is so
strong, he saw through my secret!

65
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,514
Tuxedo Mask has always helped you,

66
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,950
but we still don't know if he's
on our side or not.

67
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,815
You have to be careful!

68
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:37,051
Miss Usagi Tsukino

69
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,025
Junban Municipal Junior High School

70
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:41,594
Junban Municipal Junior High School
No! Thatcan't betrue!

71
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:47,300
But it is. I also got a love letter from
someone named Tuxedo Mask.

72
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,134
Me, too.

73
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:48,735
Me, too.

74
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:48,935
Me, too.
Me, too.

75
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:49,001
Me, too.

76
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,235
Me, too.
Me, too.

77
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:49,502
Me, too.
Me, too.

78
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:49,836
Me, too.

79
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:50,403
Who is this Tuxedo Mask?
Me, too.

80
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,038
Who is this Tuxedo Mask?

81
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:53,339
I have no idea.

82
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:53,706
Miss Naru Osaka
I have no idea.

83
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:56,976
Miss Naru Osaka
I wish this love letter was
from that person.

84
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:57,710
From Tuxedo Mask
I wish this love letter was
from that person.

85
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,987
Everyone, you must not be tricked
by the prank love letters!

86
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:11,724
Ladies should always be modest.
Do you understand?

87
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:13,487
Yes!

88
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:19,232
That letter may have been sent by
somebody vicious to tempt you.

89
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:23,169
Do not go to the MS Department Store
in Shinjuku. Do you understand?

90
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,037
Yes, Ma'am!

91
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:26,595
Good!

92
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:32,711
It's outrageous! Why didn't
I get a love letter, too?!

93
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,546
See?

94
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:37,507
Don't you think something is fishy?

95
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:42,219
That's true. We should probably
talk to Rei about this as well.

96
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,161
So, someone named Tuxedo Mask is
sending love letters? Oh! So close!

97
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,527
It seems like lots of girls got one.

98
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,199
I wonder if it's some
kind of promotion?

99
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,531
Who knows? Yeah, maybe it
is something like that.

100
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,100
Hi, Usagi!

101
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,406
What's wrong? You look upset.

102
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:11,584
Oh, I know. Lots of girls
got a love letter

103
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:14,420
from that guy called Tuxedo Mask,

104
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,912
but you didn't! That's why
you're upset, isn't it?

105
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:21,660
You're wrong! I did get one!

106
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,862
Then, why are you sighing so much?

107
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,061
It's terrible!

108
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:32,370
How could Tuxedo Mask send love
letters to those other girls?

109
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:39,245
Hikawa Shrine

110
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:41,406
Hikawa Shrine
What? Rei, you're sick?

111
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:45,451
I caught a cold and I
have a high fever,

112
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:49,785
so I can't go out, even though I have
an invitation from Tuxedo Mask.

113
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,959
It's just awful.

114
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,227
I'll take care of you.

115
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:54,694
Miss Rei Hino
I'll take care of you.

116
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:54,760
Miss Rei Hino

117
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,462
Miss Rei Hino
Thank you, Ami.

118
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:02,100
[Skipped item nr. 120]

119
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:09,475
She will come! Sailor Moon is
in love with Tuxedo Mask.

120
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,340
She is certain to come here tonight!

121
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:13,779
This is where Sailor Moon will die.

122
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,576
Oh, Mr. Sanjoin!

123
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,385
It's me!

124
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:23,617
I'm a member of Juban Junior High's
tennis club, Naru Osaka.

125
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,825
I remember now. Are
you out shopping?

126
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,292
Yes...

127
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,796
Would you mind if I asked
you a question?

128
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:31,697
What?

129
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:32,298
You wouldn't happen to
be Tuxedo Mask?
What?

130
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:35,001
You wouldn't happen to
be Tuxedo Mask?

131
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:38,630
What?! Why do you ask?

132
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:41,897
Oh, it's nothing. I was just
wishing you were.

133
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:44,199
It's something that crossed my mind.

134
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:48,881
Could she be aware that I'm the one
who sent those love letters

135
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:50,716
by using Tuxedo Mask's name?

136
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:54,086
Could this... Could this
girl be Sailor Moon?!

137
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,884
I'm sorry for asking you
such a silly question.

138
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,190
Naru.

139
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,791
Yes, Sir?
Naru.

140
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,292
Yes, Sir?

141
00:08:59,292 --> 00:08:59,692
Yes, Sir?
You're the cutest girl at
Juban Junior High.

142
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:02,528
You're the cutest girl at
Juban Junior High.

143
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:03,995
What?

144
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:08,765
I've been interested in you for a
while now. I'll see you tonight.

145
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,565
Tonight? By tonight,
does he mean...

146
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,874
I want to bare my heart to you.
I love you more than anyone else.
Please meet me at the MS Department
Store in Shinjuku tomorrow night.

tomorrow night

00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:16,969
tomorrow night
Tuxedo Mask
It really is him!

149
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:25,384
You're the cutest girl at
Juban Junior High.

150
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:27,682
I've been interested in you
for a while now.

151
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,322
Mr. Masato Sanjoin...

152
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,125
I want to bare my heart to you.
I love you more than anyone else.
Please meet me at the MS Department
Store in Shinjuku tomorrow night.
Tuxedo Mask

00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,427
I want to bare my heart to you.
I love you more than anyone else.
Please meet me at the MS Department
Store in Shinjuku tomorrow night.
Tuxedo Mask
Why?

154
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:34,859
I want to bare my heart to you.
I love you more than anyone else.
Please meet me at the MS Department
Store in Shinjuku tomorrow night.
Tuxedo Mask

155
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:39,966
Why did Tuxedo Mask send love
letters to all those people?

156
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:45,404
I don't get it! I'll just
have to ask him in person!

157
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,232
Date etiquette, rule number one!

158
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,900
Wear clean underwear

159
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,871
and a nice clean outfit!

160
00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:57,105
Date etiquette, rule number two!

161
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,676
Wear a nice, non-offensive fragrance!

162
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,455
Date etiquette, rule number three!

163
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:06,158
Brush your teeth and be
ready just in case.

164
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,227
Date etiquette, rule number four!

165
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:10,491
Use a soft pink lip color

166
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,796
for a neat, innocent look!

167
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:30,443
Just like that! Oh, what am I thinking!
How embarrassing!

168
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:47,462
Tuxedo Mask?

169
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,838
Tuxedo Mask? Oh, no...

170
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:55,636
Mr. Masato Sanjoin, where are you?

171
00:10:57,343 --> 00:10:58,742
Here!

172
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,045
Welcome.

173
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:06,675
That voice... So, you are
Mr. Masato Sanjoin!

174
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,921
You can recognize me by my voice?

175
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:09,922
Of course.
You can recognize me by my voice?

176
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:10,022
Of course.

177
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,791
Your voice and the way
you carry yourself...

178
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,225
You are none other than
Mr. Masato Sanjoin!

179
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,663
Do you love Masato
Sanjoin that much?

180
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:20,700
Since I heard what you
told me this afternoon,

181
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,191
I have become a prisoner of love!

182
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,003
Sailor Moon!

183
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:30,868
Reveal yourself! Show me
who you really are!

184
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,110
Maybe I should have told
Ami and Rei after all.

185
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,518
Where are you, Usagi?

186
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:15,318
Oh, Ami, I'm sorry.
I'm in Shinjuku.

187
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,924
Is she going on a date with Tuxedo
Mask behind my back?!

188
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:25,999
Mr. Sanjoin...

189
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,797
What's wrong?! Transform
into Sailor Moon!

190
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,570
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,697
Are you not Sailor Moon?!

192
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,008
I love you.

193
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:44,284
What tremendous energy!

194
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:46,275
Mr. Sanjoin...

195
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,563
Oh, Naru!

196
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,956
Why is Tuxedo Mask...

197
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:06,763
No! That's not Tuxedo Mask!

198
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,875
Naru, wait for me!

199
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,402
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

200
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,782
It's happening again!

201
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,121
My head...

202
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,875
This girl was not Sailor Moon,

203
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,777
but I have obtained an unexpectedly
vast amount of energy!

204
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:20,013
Release Naru!

205
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,674
Who are you?!

206
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,952
A tuxedo is not fitting for a monster
who toys with a girl's love!

207
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,254
You're...

208
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:27,454
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,
You're...

209
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:31,515
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

210
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,931
Sailor Moon!

211
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,525
In the name of the moon, I
will punish you!

212
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,071
How were you able to tell that
I am not Tuxedo Mask?

213
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,307
It's the intuition of a girl in love!

214
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:50,367
Sailor Moon Kick!

215
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:55,579
If you want this girl,
you can have her!

216
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,515
Naru!

217
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,354
You're Mr. Masato Sanjoin!

218
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:10,630
I am Nephrite, one of the Great
Four of the Dark Kingdom!

219
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,097
Nephrite?!

220
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:17,027
Sailor Moon, I became Tuxedo
Mask in order to lure you out.

221
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,710
O Regulus, star of Leo, shining
in the southern night sky,

222
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,507
grant me your power!

223
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,828
I'll tear your body to pieces!

224
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,523
No! No!

225
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,732
Who's there?!

226
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:58,911
So, you sent those love
letters using my name

227
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:03,416
in order to lure out Sailor
Moon! Unforgivable!

228
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,619
Oh, he's the real one!
He's so gorgeous!

229
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,280
Tuxedo Mask...

230
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,959
Sailor Moon! Go now!

231
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,894
Okay, Mr. Real Tuxedo Mask!

232
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:19,721
Fool! Do you think you can
get away from me?!

233
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,370
Come!

234
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,837
Go!

235
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,605
Tuxedo Mask, watch out!

236
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:48,223
Moon Tiara Action!

237
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,936
No way! It's not working like usual.

238
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:59,105
Sailor Moon, get in the elevator!

239
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,572
Yes!

240
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,684
You fell for it!

241
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:13,353
Oh, no! It's a trap!

242
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:14,587
What do you mean?

243
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:14,854
This elevator will go up to the roof.
What do you mean?

244
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,589
This elevator will go up to the roof.

245
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,854
What do you suppose will happen
when it gets to the top floor?

246
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,222
So, what will happen?!

247
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:26,362
By the law of Earth's gravity,
the elevator will fall!

248
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,099
Your bodies will be flattened
into pancakes!

249
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,475
I don't wanna become a pancake!

250
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,113
Tuxedo Mask!

251
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:44,978
We must do something.

252
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,788
What's going on? My
life is in danger,

253
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:52,884
but my heart is pounding like crazy.

254
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:55,261
Sailor Moon!

255
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,888
A kiss?

256
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,599
What are you doing? We're
getting out of here!

257
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,066
Right!

258
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,171
Come on.

259
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:10,710
It's the top floor! Jump off!

260
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,177
Okay!

261
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,727
I did it!

262
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,508
I can't hold on anymore!

263
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:44,444
Do not give up! We will get
out of here somehow.

264
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:47,514
Until then, we should distract ourselves
by talking about something.

265
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:53,520
Okay. Let's see. Let's see.
Why do you always rescue me?

266
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,751
My blood roars and it makes
me want to rescue you.

267
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,951
I've secured a foothold!
Can you get onto my back?

268
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:06,198
Yes!

269
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,005
I know why. It's because
you must love me.

270
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:15,875
Oh, I can't believe it! I'm spouting
such nonsense!

271
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,333
Let's see. Who are you?

272
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:22,913
I think I can guess who you are.

273
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:28,288
You're Motoki, aren't you?! Oh,
I've said something silly again!

274
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:29,422
Sailor Moon.

275
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:29,789
Yes?
Sailor Moon.

276
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,024
Yes?

277
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:37,054
I cannot help but feel that I knew
you somehow long, long ago.

278
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:39,465
Something is stirring in the
corner of my mind,

279
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,490
but I just cannot remember it.

280
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:45,030
We're going to fall!

281
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:46,339
Calm down!

282
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:47,040
Okay.
Calm down!

283
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,574
Okay.

284
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:51,244
Let's see. What's your hobby?
What are your favorite foods?

285
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:55,215
Oh, I'm so stupid! I keep coming
up with weird questions!

286
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,944
It's just sad!

287
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,359
Tuxedo Mask!

288
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,663
Sailor Moon, you should never have
come here without telling us!

289
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:12,324
I'm sorry!

290
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,696
That was close.

291
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:18,638
Thank you for rescuing us.

292
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,107
I have a cold, you know.

293
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,409
How dare you take that chance
to go behind my back

294
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,679
and drape yourself all over
Tuxedo Mask?! It's not fair!

295
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,315
Oh, it wasn't like that!

296
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,084
Stop fighting!

297
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:35,282
Not you, too, Ami! You're going
to side with Sailor Moon?!

298
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:40,249
No! I just want to quickly
take Naru to a hospital!

299
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,824
Everyone, be good to one
another. Good-bye!

300
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:46,361
Oh, please wait!

301
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,625
Tuxedo Mask...

302
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:58,436
I do not deal well with girls fighting.

303
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:04,150
Queen Beryl, Nephrite boasted that
he would defeat Sailor Moon.

304
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,086
But in spite of it, he was
not able to kill her.

305
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,919
He should be sentenced
to "Eternal Sleep."

306
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:15,660
The energy that Nephrite brought
back has enormous power.

307
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:19,898
In light of that, I will not
punish him this time.

308
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,066
But my lady...

309
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,072
I can punish him anytime I want.

310
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:28,741
Zoisite, stop worrying about others
and tend to your own business!

311
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,077
Hurry up and find the Silver Crystal!

312
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,669
Yes, my lady!

313
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,752
All humans become focused
on something

314
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,487
at least once in their lives

315
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,546
and produce an enormous
amount of energy.

316
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:48,622
That girl, Naru... The powerful energy
she produced was unbelievable.

317
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,297
It seems she truly loves my disguise
as Masato Sanjoin.

318
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,429
What a foolish girl!

319
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:12,841
In my dream, you and I were together

320
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:19,752
Protected by the stars

321
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,971
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

322
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,212
And we casually talked to each other

323
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:50,885
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

324
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:57,855
I want to become prettier
right here and now

325
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:05,394
Something changes when
you fall in love

326
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:11,973
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

327
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:25,858
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
