Katsuragi, it's me.

23
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm sure you're listening to this message,
after I caused you so much trouble.

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,890
Sorry.

25
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,690
Please tell Rit-chan "I'm sorry".

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,700
And there's one more thing to trouble
you with.  I've been growing flowers.

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,620
I'd appreciate it if you
could water them for me.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,660
Shinji-kun knows where they are.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,450
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
Don't hesitate.  Move ahead.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,940
If I can see you again, I'll say the
words that I couldn't say 8 years ago.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,540
Bye.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,790
A telephone that doesn't ring...

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>ON BUSINESS
Sorry, but don't
call me</i>

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,740
Misato-san's shutting herself

Asuka...  she isn't coming back?

37
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,230
She doesn't go to school or home,
she just plays games all day.

38
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,160
Hikari...

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Hmm, what?

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,690
Let's go to bed.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,270
Yeah.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,730
I'm sorry. I'm causing
you a lot of trouble.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,750
No, you're not.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,260
I lost. I'll never pilot an Eva again.
Now, it's not worth living.

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,370
I lost all my values for everything.

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,050
I hate this. I hate everyone.
I hate everything.

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,990
Though I hate myself the most.

48
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,560
Now I don't care about anything.
I have nothing to do.

49
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,960
I think you can do anything you want to.
I don't blame you.

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
I really think you've done well.

51
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,180
Well, that child is gone.

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,560
Hmm, probably.

53
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,880
Even cats die.

54
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,550
Don't cry, Grandma.

55
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,910
Mm, I'll come home when I have time to.

56
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,900
I haven't been to my mom's
grave in three years.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,580
Next time, I'll call you.

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,670
OK, I have to go.

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,530
So, that cat died.

Episode 23'
TEARS

61
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,230
It's impossible for us to
retrieve the Lance of Longinus.

62
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,840
Why did you use it?

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,380
And about the Eva series, we
don't have all of them scheduled.

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,980
The annihilation of the Angel was more
important. There was no other way.

65
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,960
No other way? Your excuses
should be more persuasive.

66
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,020
The things you have done recently are too bold.

67
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,280
Fuyutsuki, I'm in conference.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,140
Understood.

69
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,270
An Angel is approaching right now.

70
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,330
We'll finish this discussion
at the next opportunity.

71
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,100
That is, if your chair remains.

72
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,280
Ikari, are you going to betray us, SEELE?

73
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,910
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,960
Launch Unit 00 from the 32nd gate.
Set Unit 02 as backup.

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,630
No, I don't have the right to cancel
Commander Ikari's freeze on Unit 01. Bye.

76
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,220
Angel confirmed visually...  right?

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,820
<i>Unit 00 launched. Deploying
to interception point.</i>

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,680
Unit 02, wait at your present position.

79
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,190
No, sortie.

80
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,190
Commander!?

81
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,930
I don't care. At least it
might be useful as a decoy.

82
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,400
<i>Eva Unit 02, preparing for launch.</i>

84
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,340
I'm on board again, as usual.

85
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,760
Oh, no. Am I still synched to this?

86
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,820
<i>Send Unit 02 to Gate Eight.</i>

87
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,340
<i>As soon as a location is
designated, we'll launch.</i>

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,310
Even if I sortie, all I can do is disturb the others.

89
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>Target's approaching and is past
the Gora Final Interception Line.</i>

90
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,260
I don't care about anything, anymore.

91
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,320
<i>Target is rotating in the
air over Owakidani valley.</i>

92
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,270
Target's AT Field is still active.

93
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,210
Where have you been?

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,660
I don't have an excuse.
Present status?

95
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,880
Still a stalemate.

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,470
Changing cyclically from pattern blue to orange.

97
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,460
What does that mean?

98
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,850
The MAGI are still working
on the answer.

99
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,610
The data is insufficient to find an answer.

100
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,710
But I'm sure that shape isn't fixed.

101
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,500
Our side can't attack first.

102
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,350
<i>Rei, we'll observe its status for a while.</i>

103
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,740
No, it's coming.

104
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,550
Rei, prepare for battle!

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,300
No! It's too late!

106
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,320
Target has physically contacted Unit 00.

107
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,410
Unit 00's AT Field?

108
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,480
Active, but being penetrated.

109
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,230
The Angel is trying to achieve
first level contact with Unit 00?

110
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,280
Danger! Unit 00's bioparts are being penetrated.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,790
Eva Unit 02, sortie! Have her
rescue Rei and provide cover.

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,150
<i>Target is penetrating Unit 00.</i>

113
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,230
This is dangerous. 5% has
already been bio-fused.

114
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,470
Asuka, advance 300 meters and
spread your AT Field,

115
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,170
then fire the
palette gun at the Target's back.

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,010
Alright? Eva Unit 02, lift off!

117
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,380
Move out! Asuka?! What's wrong?

118
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,550
Unit 02's status?

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Impossible. Synchro ratio is under 10%.

120
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,920
Asuka!

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,830
It doesn't move. It doesn't move.

122
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,590
Like this, she'll be a victim too.
Retrieve her! Hurry!

123
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,130
Who? Me? Me within Eva?

124
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,230
No, I feel someone else other than me.

125
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,700
Who are you? An Angel?

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,190
A being that we call an Angel?

127
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,530
Don't you want to be unified with me?

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,730
No. I am I. Not you.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,190
Hmm, but you shall be. It's too late.

130
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,650
I give you part of my mind.

131
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,990
I give you this emotion.

132
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,840
Pain... See, your mind has pain.

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,500
Pain? No, something different.

134
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,450
Loneliness. Yes,loneliness.

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
Loneliness?  I don't understand.

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,730
Do you hate being alone?

137
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,470
We are many, but you are alone.
You hate it, don't you?

138
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,910
That's called loneliness.

139
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,630
That's your mind. Full of sorrow.

140
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,810
That's your own mind.

141
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,030
These are tears?

142
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,910
It's me who's crying?

143
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,030
Rei!

144
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,540
The freeze on Unit 01 is
canceled, effective immediately.

145
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,290
Sortie as soon as possible.

146
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,000
Sortie!

147
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,340
Yes, sir!

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,790
Am I so worthless to you?
You didn't do this for me.

149
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,450
<i>Spread your AT Field.
Rescue Rei immediately.</i>

150
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,040
Yes!

151
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,060
Ikari-kun!

152
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,140
Shinji-kun, use your prog knife!

153
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,770
It hurts, doesn't it Ikari-kun?

154
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,330
Is this my wish? To be one with Ikari-kun?

155
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,260
No!

156
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,390
AT Field has been reversed! It
will be corroded immediately.

157
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,330
To hold the Angel?

158
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,660
Field limit reached! The core
can't hold up much longer!

159
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,890
Rei! Abandon the unit and escape!

160
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,050
No. If I escape, the AT
Field will disappear.

161
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,750
I won't let it.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Rei, do you want to die?

163
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,990
The core is collapsing,
critical pressure exceeded!

164
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,200
The target has disappeared.

165
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,390
This operation is finished.

166
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,150
Move to level one alert.

167
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,350
Roger. Moving to situation yellow immediately.

168
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,510
Unit 00's status?

169
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,390
Entry plug ejection not recognized.

170
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,200
Rescue the pilot as
soon as possible. Hurry!

171
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,740
You mean, if there still is one.

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,360
<i>Still unable to find the constituent matter for
section 16. Location efforts proceeding.</i>

173
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
<i>...extending in the southwest direction.</i>

174
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,760
Dr. Akagi...

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,540
This is top secret. Scavenge the plug.

176
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,330
Dispose of the parts concerned.

177
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,830
Roger.

178
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Do it immediately.

179
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,240
The 3rd Angel

180
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,720
Sachiel

181
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:08,990
The 4th Angel

182
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,210
At last we have defeated
the Angels, up to the 16th.

183
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:09,500
Shamshiel

184
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:09,740
The 5th Angel

185
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,220
Ramiel

186
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,490
The 6th Angel

187
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,000
Gahgiel

188
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,240
The 7th Angel

189
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,750
Israphel

190
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:11,990
The 8th Angel

191
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,210
Now there is only one Angel left, which is
described in the Dead Sea Scrolls of Seele.

192
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,500
Sandalphon

193
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:12,740
The 9th Angel

194
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,250
Matriel

195
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,490
The 10th Angel

196
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,000
Sahquiel

197
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,240
The 11th Angel

198
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,750
Ireul

199
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:14,990
The 12th Angel

200
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,500
Leriel

201
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,740
The 13th Angel

202
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,230
Bardiel

203
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,440
The 14th Angel

204
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,480
The promised time is close.  The road
has been long, with many casualties.

205
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,020
Zeruel

206
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,260
The 15th Angel

207
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,740
Arael

208
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:17,980
The 16th Angel

209
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,520
Armisael

210
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,380
Aye.  After losing the Lance of
Longinus, we lost Eva Unit 00.

211
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,710
That's sufficient reason to dismiss Ikari.

212
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,730
He must understand why
we returned Fuyutsuki alive.

213
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,690
We have to find another pawn
to use against Ikari.

214
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,500
And this one must know the truth.

215
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,270
Shinji-kun, I'm coming in.

216
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,420
Misato-san, the tears won't come.

217
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,920
I think I'm sad, but tears never come.

218
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,580
Shinji-kun, all I can do for you is this.

219
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,380
Stop it! No, Misato-san.

220
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,940
I'm very sorry.

221
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>I'm sure he's feeling lonely.
Is he afraid of women?</i>

222
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,280
<i>No, he's just afraid of
affection in general.</i>

223
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,570
Pen Pen, come here.

224
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,240
<i>Okay, I just want anybody.
I'm the one who's lonely.</i>

225
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,650
<i>It's me who's lonely.</i>

226
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,100
Rei...

227
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,700
The product of my despair,
and yet the object of your hope.

228
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,990
I guess it's impossible to forget her.

229
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,590
Yes, hello. Really?!

230
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,800
Shinji-kun!

231
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,300
<i>Dr. Odani of the First Internal Department...</i>

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,630
<i>Dr. Odani, please contact the second
conference room immediately.</i>

233
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,340
Ayanami!

234
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,580
<i>First Neurological Surgery
Third Surgery</i>

235
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,680
<i>2nd Floor
Hospital Ward
Radiation Diagnosis
X-ray Reception</i>

236
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm glad, you're alive!

237
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,840
But, my father isn't here?

238
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,410
Thank you. You saved me.

239
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,300
What?

240
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,850
You saved me, by sacrifying Unit 00.

241
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Oh, did I save you?

242
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,790
Yeah. Don't you remember?

243
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,090
No... I mean, I don't know.

244
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,150
I think, probably, I'm the third.

245
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,320
Are these tears?

246
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm seeing this for the first time,
but it feels familiar.

247
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,680
Am I crying?

248
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,820
Why am I crying?

249
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,660
That's right. Preserve the present
status for the First Children.

250
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,830
No restrictions are necessary.

251
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,800
This applies to the Second and
Third as well. Just watch them.

252
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,190
If they find out Rei is alive, Chairman
Keel and the others will cause trouble.

253
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,210
I'll present something else to the
old men of SEELE.

254
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,720
There's no problem.

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,530
We wish to proceed peacefully.

256
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,150
We don't wish you to suffer from insults anymore.

257
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,620
I don't feel any insult.

258
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,490
A strong tempered woman.

259
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,440
I can see why Ikari wants
to keep her next to him.

260
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,270
However, it was none other than
Ikari who presented you to us.

261
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,320
Rejecting the interrogation
of the pilot of Unit 00,

262
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,420
he presented you as her replacement,
Doctor Akagi.

263
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,580
<i>I'm Rei's substitute, am I?</i>

264
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,430
<i>ON BUSINESS
Sorry, but don't call me</i>

265
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,980
<i>The way to the truth which you wanted,
was sent to you by 36 other methods.</i>

266
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,630
<i>But those won't reach you.</i>

267
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,030
<i>The only one guaranteed is this capsule.</i>

268
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,860
<i>It's completely up to you how to use this.</i>

269
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,940
<i>The pass code is our first memory.</i>

270
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,770
<i>Bye, Take care.</i>

271
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm not upset anymore by
the telephone that doesn't ring...

272
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,030
...since I received your heart.

273
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,440
Are you sure about releasing
Doctor Akagi?

274
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,620
She isn't like Fuyutsuki. It will be
beneficial to release her.

275
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,670
She rendered remarkable
service to the Eva series.

276
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,000
She should be useful to us for a while.

277
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,430
Yes, for the future of humanity.

278
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,130
Regarding Evangelions, eight of
them are under construction.

279
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,560
So, there are four more to go.

280
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,860
The disappearance of Tokyo-3
will enhance the project.

281
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,940
Hurry with the completion.
The promised day will be that day.

282
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,740
Yes, hello.

283
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,270
<i>Listen to me. You're free from
the secret service right now.</i>

284
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,100
<i>You can go out now.</i>

285
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,490
Ritsuko-san...

286
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,500
No good, without my pass.

287
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,480
I see. Kaji-kun arranged this?

288
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,810
The secret of this place must
be revealed before my eyes.

289
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,490
Alright. But this one will see it as well.

290
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,320
Very well.

291
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,100
This looks just like Ayanami's room.

292
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,050
Ayanami Rei's room. This is
the place where she was born.

293
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,350
In this room?

294
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,370
Yes, her birth place.

295
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,960
Light and water, which make up Rei's
deep mentality, reflect the image of this place.

296
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,660
Dr. Akagi, I didn't come to see this.

297
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,070
I know, Misato.

298
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,280
Eva?

299
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,070
The first one. A failure.

300
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,040
Disposed of ten years ago.

301
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,360
A graveyard for Evas.

302
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,950
Nothing but a dumping ground.

303
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,850
This is also the place where
your mother disappeared.

304
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,850
You probably don't remember
but you were watching it,

305
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,950
watching the moment
when your mother disappeared.

306
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,270
Ritsuko!

307
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,000
You say this is the core of the dummy plug?

308
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,090
I'll show you the truth.

309
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,470
Ayanami...  Rei.

310
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
What? Eva's dummy plug is...

311
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,780
Yes. These are about to be
the core of the dummy system.

312
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,480
This is the factory for manufacturing them.

313
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,700
This is...?

314
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,590
These are dummies.

315
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,280
And nothing but spare parts for Rei.

316
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,340
Humans found a god, and thus tried to obtain it.

317
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,970
As a result, humanity was punished!
That was 15 years ago.

318
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,900
The god that they found vanished.

319
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,840
However, Man tried to resurrect
God with his own hands,

320
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,740
and created Adam. From Adam,
man created what resembles God.

321
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,340
That is Eva.

322
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,530
Human? Is that a human?

323
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,590
Yes, that's a human.

324
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,690
Eva, which originally didn't have
a soul, now has a human soul.

325
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
All of these were salvaged.

326
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,670
However the vessel which truly contains
a soul is Rei. Only she has a soul.

327
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,300
None of the other vessels have a soul.

328
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,070
There was nothing within the room of Gauf.

329
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,250
These are empty containers.
They have no souls.

330
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,820
Nothing but vessels.

331
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,970
So I'll destroy them, because I hate them.

332
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,610
Do you know what you're doing?!

333
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,190
Yeah, I know. Destruction.

334
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,440
These are not human, but human-shaped things.

335
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,670
I lost against the THING. I couldn't win.

336
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,880
When he's in my mind, I can bear any insult.

337
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,190
I don't care about my own body.

338
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,300
But...  but he...  he chose...

339
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,220
I knew that.

340
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm stupid. I...  I'm as stupid
as my mother. So foolish!

341
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,390
You can kill me, if you wish.

342
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,210
I'd be glad if you did.

343
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,900
You're truly stupid if you wish that.

344
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,390
<i>This is the tragedy of
people possessed by Eva.</i>

345
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,360
