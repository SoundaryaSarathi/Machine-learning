1
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,265
How beautiful.

2
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,733
This must be…

3
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:04,709
[Sakura, Yukito, and the summer festival]

4
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:09,313
Must be…

5
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,827
It must be?

6
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,425
Umm…

7
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,100
What a rude person you are.

8
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:23,067
What kind of voice is that
to have when you see somebody’s face?

9
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,070
It was because you were
so close all of a sudden.

10
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:26,631
You can’t sleep in forever

11
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:28,871
just because it’s Summer vacation.

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,437
I was just about to wake you up.

13
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:35,181
So, it must be what?

14
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,945
I forgot.

15
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,950
You surprised me,
so I forgot what it was.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,657
Hey, hey. Dreams are important.

17
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:50,892
Especially the dreams of those

18
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,893
with power have a high chance
of being a premonition.

19
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,097
You have to remember them.

20
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,800
Yeah.

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,347
The breeze feels nice,
doesn’t it Kero-chan?

22
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,187
Summer is almost over.

23
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:21,954
So, did you finish your summer
vacation homework?

24
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,156
Eh!

25
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,065
Today it is my turn to make dinner.

26
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:36,266
What should I make?

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,304
I foresee hell on the last day

28
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,539
of summer vacation.

29
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,754
OK, we have cabbage and flour, great.

30
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,217
Today I will make okonomiyaki!

31
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:56,422
Yay! Okonomiyaki!

32
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,967
Well, I’m going grocery shopping.

33
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:01,961
If you’re making okonomiyaki,

34
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:03,665
I want modayaki!

35
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,198
Modayaki! Modayaki!

36
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,773
Moda…

37
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,843
OK, the one with soba on top, right?

38
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:17,949
Modayaki.

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,088
I bought the soba, and the sauce.

40
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,129
A festival?

41
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:32,533
It ends today?

42
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:34,724
I’ll invite Tomoyo-chan
and check it out.

43
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:45,436
Maybe I’ll take a side trip.

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,318
He isn’t here after all.

45
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,753
Too bad.

46
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:03,990
Sakura-chan.

47
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,325
Eh!

48
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,534
Over here.

49
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,539
Good afternoon.

50
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,135
Yukito-san!

51
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:21,046
On an errand?

52
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:25,745
Yes! But I am finished already.

53
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,882
Would you like to have some tea?

54
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,225
May I?

55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,719
Yeah.

56
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,326
I just got some good snacks.

57
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:36,926
Ah, wait a second,

58
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:38,624
I’ll go over there now.

59
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,195
I am glad I took a side trip.

60
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:53,943
Here.

61
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,909
I made it a little thin.

62
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:04,653
Touya told me that
you like thin tea.

63
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,093
Thank you.

64
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,826
Umm, why were you on the roof?

65
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,827
Because the weather was nice.

66
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,707
Where is your family?

67
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:21,699
On a trip.

68
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,412
My grandpa and grandma
get along really well

69
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,540
And are on a summer trip.

70
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:30,880
Just the two of them.

71
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,485
This time it is to Atami.

72
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:35,752
I see.

73
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,385
So Yukito-san is alone.

74
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,988
I wonder if he is lonely.

75
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,472
It’s good.

76
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,070
Yes.

77
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,606
Delicious.

78
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:03,881
Right?

79
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:18,093
It was a really cute dog,

80
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,830
this time they are going
to let me give it a bath.

81
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:25,963
It would be good
if she doesn’t hate the bath.

82
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,511
It’s this late already?
I have to go home.

83
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,076
Is it your turn to cook today?

84
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,007
Yes.

85
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,879
Shall I walk you home?

86
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:42,546
Eh!

87
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:46,115
You pack looks pretty
full and heavy.

88
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:49,492
And I have something
I have to give back to Touya.

89
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:51,189
I’ll take you home.

90
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,464
Is it OK?

91
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:54,225
Yeah.

92
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:00,102
Today really is a good day.

93
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:09,842
You would eat it in a time like that.

94
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,019
That’s right.

95
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,852
So I ate the gelatin
in the refrigerator.

96
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:19,518
But it was my brother’s.

97
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,861
So it was you who ate it after all.

98
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:31,335
B… Big brother.

99
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,775
You really surprised me.

100
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:42,942
It was because you were walking
without looking where you were going.

101
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,618
Umm, it’ll be done in just a bit.

102
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:49,514
But is it OK to stay here?

103
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,688
Stay and eat. You’re home alone,
aren’t you?

104
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,556
Well then, I’ll help out.
Should I grate these?

105
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,194
Yes.

106
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,840
Oh yeah, did you know
there’s a festival?

107
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:12,710
Yes, I thought I would
invite Tomoyo-chan and go later.

108
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:14,474
Just the two of you?

109
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:15,915
Yeah.

110
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,748
Umm…

111
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,745
I’m going too.

112
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:21,679
Why?

113
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:24,547
Because I want to.

114
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:26,591
Eh?

115
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:29,423
May I come too?

116
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes! Then I will go call
Tomoyo’s place and ask her.

117
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:40,670
You’re worried because
there are many people at the festival,

118
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,273
and it’s dangerous to come home so late.

119
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:48,279
What a kind big brother.

120
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,011
Shut up.

121
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:54,746
Tomoyo-chan said she could.

122
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:57,449
Well then, the four of us will go.

123
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:58,650
Yeah.

124
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,021
Do you know the place?

125
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,429
Yes. It was the Tsukimine shrine,
wasn’t it?

126
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:06,596
Yes.

127
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:11,337
My hand slipped a bit.

128
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,165
Eh?

129
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,245
This is how okonomiyaki has to be.

130
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:31,314
Maybe I will wear this one.
I wonder if this one is better?

131
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:35,753
Going out?

132
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:39,299
There is a festival.

133
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:41,827
That is good.

134
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:46,599
A present. Be sure to buy one.

135
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:49,443
Yeah.

136
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:58,216
It looks very good.

137
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:05,018
My dad made it for me last year.

138
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,326
Your father really can do anything.

139
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:15,927
I brought my video camera.

140
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:18,061
You must let me film you.

141
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,736
Umm…

142
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:24,036
Over here.

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,676
Let’s go.

144
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,156
Do you want that red one?

145
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:47,592
Yes.

146
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:49,196
Mister.

147
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,108
Ah!

148
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,034
Here.

149
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,340
Thank you!

150
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:02,807
How cute.

151
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:07,550
Sakura-chan is cute too.

152
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,489
Do you want one too, Touya?

153
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:17,864
What’s wrong?

154
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,034
Nothing.

155
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:25,962
What shall we do next?

156
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:31,136
Umm, umm… the ring toss.

157
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,242
It was over there right?
Let’s go check it out.

158
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:34,339
OK.

159
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,610
You should have done it
too, Tomoyo-chan.

160
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,744
Aren’t you bored just watching.

161
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:43,314
No, being able to film
Sakura enjoying herself

162
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,190
is fun enough.

163
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:47,060
Eh!

164
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,895
Chiharu-chan! Yamazaki-kun!

165
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:00,501
Hey.

166
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,266
Sakura-chan.

167
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:04,503
Good evening.

168
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:05,402
Good evening,

169
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,039
did you two just come?

170
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,276
Yeah, I heard from Naoko-chan.

171
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:16,021
Naoko-chan likes these things.
Shrines and temples.

172
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,857
And scary stories too.

173
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,293
Naoko and the others didn’t come?

174
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:25,889
Naoko-chan and Rika-chan

175
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,767
have piano lessons today.

176
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:29,264
I see.

177
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:31,795
Ah, how cute.

178
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,300
Now that you mention it,

179
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:39,675
do you know the beginning
of water balloons?

180
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:42,043
In the beginning of the Edo era

181
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,351
it was like a normal feature
to the common people.

182
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:50,416
Did that have rubber that long ago?

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,954
This is rubber isn’t it?

184
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,053
Yes.

185
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:59,664
Yeah, that’s why long ago
they made them out of glass.

186
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:02,498
At last it starts to get suspicious.

187
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,870
Glass?

188
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:08,435
Well, then they couldn’t
play with them like this.

189
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:14,013
No, it seems they went to
great measures to figure out

190
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,848
how to play with them
without breaking the glass.

191
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:17,677
Eh!

192
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,320
It’s a lie. A lie.

193
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,355
What was that?

194
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:29,725
He hit it.

195
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,194
You’re very good.

196
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:37,701
Did you get these all
on your own Li-kun?

197
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,367
Well, yeah.

198
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:42,833
That’s impressive.

199
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:53,348
May I have these?

200
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:54,811
Yeah.

201
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:56,385
Thank you.

202
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,450
Speaking of shooting games,
a long time ago…

203
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:00,418
Yes. Yes.

204
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,458
Yamazaki-kun, I want that one.

205
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:05,692
If you get it for me,

206
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,863
I will bring you some
home-made cookies tomorrow.

207
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:10,702
We have to go pray.

208
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,105
Eh? Why pray?

209
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,370
That I will survive.

210
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,846
What was that? You’re horrible!

211
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:25,879
They really do get along well.
Chiharu-chan and Yamazaki-kun.

212
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:26,944
Yeah.

213
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:31,116
Isn’t it good that you got
that water balloon

214
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,685
from Yukito-san?

215
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:35,253
Yeah.

216
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:36,220
Eh?

217
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,058
Did he hear that?

218
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,831
You hear the name of
the one you love

219
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:44,760
no matter the situation.

220
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,338
Umm…

221
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:54,978
Yukito gave this…

222
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,018
Something about me?

223
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,581
Do you have some business
with my sister?

224
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:06,860
Yay!

225
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:12,821
That’s it.

226
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:16,793
Sakura-chan,
don’t you want that one?

227
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:20,932
You like rabbits don’t you?

228
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:22,568
Yeah.

229
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:25,603
Really. It’s cute.

230
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,972
Yes.

231
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,354
Wait!

232
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:55,641
One more time.

233
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,768
Quite a competition.

234
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,577
You’re right.

235
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,146
Shall we go somewhere else?

236
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:09,119
I will watch their splendid
competition from here.

237
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:10,382
Eh?

238
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:14,220
Sakura-chan, don’t worry and go ahead.

239
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:17,895
But…

240
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,164
It’s not often that there’s a festival.

241
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,973
Well then, Sakura-chan.

242
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,411
Sure.

243
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,322
I wonder if we are behind the shrine?

244
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:49,587
I wonder if they are fireflies?

245
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,558
But there isn’t any river near here.

246
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:56,932
Shall we go look?

247
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,262
Yes.

248
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:12,781
Ah!

249
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,190
This is…

250
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,465
It is the same as
the dream this morning.

251
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:32,400
They’re beautiful aren’t they?

252
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:34,566
Yes.

253
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:36,873
Almost like snow.

254
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:38,069
Yes.

255
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:42,446
Yukito-san.

256
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,975
What?

257
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,117
I…

258
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:50,919
What?

259
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:53,650
I…

260
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:58,558
I got it.

261
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:03,734
Eh!

262
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,935
They couldn’t come to a conclusion,

263
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,941
so the man running
the stall gave them two.

264
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,540
It was a climactic battle.

265
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:14,740
Really.

266
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:16,807
Eh?

267
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:19,979
Is this for me too?

268
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,148
Yeah.

269
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:25,686
Ah!

270
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,560
If you don’t want it, give it back.

271
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,329
I want it.

272
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,940
But I wanted to be left
like that a bit longer.

273
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,073
Oh yeah. There was a
shaved ice stall over there.

274
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:47,745
Let’s go.

275
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,715
I’ll treat you in thanks.

276
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:53,744
Touya, you come too.

277
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,949
Sakura-chan. Tomoyo-chan.

278
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,184
Sakura-chan?

279
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,058
Something is bothering me.

280
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,654
Let’s hurry.

281
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,261
Well come soon, go ahead of us.

282
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,968
What is it?

283
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:24,910
I saw it in a dream.
The same as this.

284
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:28,686
Could it be?

285
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,160
Release.

286
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,798
Return to your rightful form.

287
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,295
Clow Card.

288
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:02,820
Glow.

289
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:04,754
Just like Kero-chan said,

290
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,420
that dream was a premonition.

291
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,090
The continuation to the “It must be…” 
I said in the dream was “…a Clow Card.”

292
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,491
OK, Cut.

293
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,837
So it was a Clow Card after all.

294
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,176
I couldn’t tell at all.

295
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:26,109
I didn’t feel an aura either.

296
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,179
It seems Li-kun didn’t notice either.

297
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:30,374
Yeah.

298
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:34,252
But because of this card was

299
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:35,747
really happy.

300
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:37,245
Thank you.

301
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:40,591
Shall we get going?

302
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,427
Yeah.
