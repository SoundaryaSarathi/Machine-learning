1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,165
It's unforgivable, unforgivable!

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:06,070
What is it that's unforgivable?

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,642
It's unforgivable when someone kidnaps
girls who are praying for love.

4
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,839
Until the day everyone's wishes for
safety and finding love comes true...

5
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:19,711
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon
will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

7
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

8
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,313
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

9
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:14,753
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

10
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:22,294
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:35,772
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

13
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

14
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:49,152
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,969
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

16
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,306
I'm clumsier than others

17
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:03,274
and a bit of a crybaby.
That's about it.

18
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:07,445
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

19
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,447
and gave me a peculiar
transforming brooch

20
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:11,549
and made me a sailor warrior.

21
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,619
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

22
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,814
That makes me really nervous.

23
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,523
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

24
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:32,197
Cursed Buses!
Fire Warrior Mars Appears

25
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:37,006
If those troublemakers that
appeared on Earth

26
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,346
get a hold of the legendary Silver
Crystal which we are looking for,

27
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:42,745
we'll have a serious problem!

28
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,352
Our empire is the only one who
should have the Silver Crystal.

29
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:51,049
I will show no mercy to anyone who
tries to hinder our Dark Kingdom!

30
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,120
Can't you find the legendary
Silver Crystal yet?

31
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,460
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,024
You have already failed
several missions,

33
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,327
but I will give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

34
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,804
Collect the energy.

35
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:09,841
And also find the warriors
and kill them!

36
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,001
Yes, my lady.

37
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,874
Did something happen?

38
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,154
Ami!

39
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,689
Oh, Usagi.

40
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:25,490
Oh, Luna!

41
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,057
Ami!
Oh, Luna!

42
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,058
Ami!

43
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,159
Where are you going?

44
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,161
To cram school.

45
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,961
What? You have to take a bus
to go to cram school?

46
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,635
If it's for a good cram school,
I'd even take a plane.

47
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,237
I'm a sailor warrior.

48
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:42,140
I have to study hard

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,540
and gain more knowledge
so that I can help Luna!

50
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,445
Way to go! You're the best, Ami!

51
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,413
On the other hand, when you
compare that to someone else...

52
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:52,081
The bus isn't here yet.

53
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:55,653
Did something happen?

54
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,656
Hey hey, listen! Do you know
the story behind this bus?

55
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,290
What?

56
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,526
I heard a bus with some passengers

57
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:05,163
which left here just after 6pm
suddenly disappeared.

58
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,565
What?! That sounds like fun.

59
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,601
There's nothing fun about it!

60
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:13,271
You know there's a bus stop up ahead
called Sendaizaka Ue, right?

61
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,807
Yeah, it's where the five
slopes are, right?

62
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:19,978
That's right. I heard that a bus
with about fifty passengers

63
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,173
just suddenly disappeared
around there!

64
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:26,518
The police suspected it could be
a mass kidnapping

65
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,119
and kept it secret for a while,

66
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,588
but they just announced
what had happened

67
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,357
and started investigating
the incident.

68
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,159
A cursed 6 o'clock bus...

69
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,859
I'm scared!

70
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:35,326
It's very scary.
I'm scared!

71
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:36,127
It's very scary.

72
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,631
Hey, hey. Do you know the Hikawa
Shrine near Sendaizaka?

73
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,233
They're famous for their amulets
that ward off evils.

74
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,530
Maybe we should buy one!

75
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,071
I heard the daughter who lives
there has psychic powers,

76
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:49,841
and her fortune telling
is really accurate.

77
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,343
I heard that their amulets
really work too!

78
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,778
Maybe, we should buy one.

79
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:56,147
Usagi, can you get me one, too?

80
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:58,249
What? Why don't you come with us?

81
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,717
No, I can't. I have to go
to cram school.

82
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,985
Also, I have an important
mock test coming up.

83
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:05,456
I can't afford to get a cold
while I'm studying.

84
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,582
D'oh!

85
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,057
Hikawa Shrine

86
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,729
May the boy I like also like me.

87
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:18,036
So, you, too!

88
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:18,503
What? Who?
So, you, too!

89
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,026
What? Who?

90
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,632
Tell me!

91
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:27,707
Pray more! And fill your heart with
the energy of burning desire.

92
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,113
It's coming...

93
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:40,786
Something evil is coming closer.

94
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,127
Offering

95
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:43,962
Offering
Oh, you girls are so pretty.

96
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:45,793
Oh, you girls are so pretty.

97
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:48,293
Wanna work as a part-time
shrine maiden?

98
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:53,231
We just came here to buy
amulets for love.

99
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,774
I know, I know. I was just kidding!

100
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,372
It's 5:30. Perfect!

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,716
Then, as usual, I will conduct a
special ceremony for all of you

102
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,081
so that your love will come true.

103
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,421
O god of flames!

104
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:13,958
Please make sure these girls'
thoughts reach their boys,

105
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,155
and make their wishes come true!

106
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:22,563
You girls came from far away, right?

107
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,265
Since you're here, why don't you
draw a fortune slip, too?

108
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,273
We also sell votive paintings of horses
for passing entrance exams.

109
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,707
Wanna buy one?

110
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,641
Thank you for all your concern!

111
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:33,511
I can't believe him!

112
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:34,245
Bye-bye!

113
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:34,879
Was he hitting on us or something?!
Bye-bye!

114
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,743
Was he hitting on us or something?!

115
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,784
Oh, you girls are so pretty!

116
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:47,490
Wanna work as a part-time
shrine maiden?

117
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:49,787
Grandpa!

118
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,262
Stop hitting on girls already!

119
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:53,364
Oh, Rei!

120
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:53,932
There are bad rumors about you going
around in the neighborhood.
Oh, Rei!

121
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:57,265
There are bad rumors about you going
around in the neighborhood

122
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,936
Wow! She looks cool! And so pretty!

123
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,776
So, this is a shrine maiden.

124
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,844
I wouldn't mind doing that part-time.

125
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,141
What?!

126
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,569
Oh, please!

127
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,149
I sense an unusual aura!
An evil spirit?!

128
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,587
You can try to bring misfortune
to our shrine,

129
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,399
but I won't allow you!

130
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,201
Begone, evil spirit!

131
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,410
Usagi!

132
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,713
This wasn't how it was
supposed to be.

133
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,475
Begone, evil spirit

134
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,619
Miss Rei, I have brought you
a towel and water.

135
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,588
Oh, please leave them there.

136
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,622
Yes, Ma'am.

137
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,157
Wow!

138
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,522
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

139
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,129
He's gorgeous!

140
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,231
What?! Where is he?
Where's the gorgeous guy?

141
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,199
I can't believe the way
your mind works!

142
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,535
Is he your brother?

143
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,832
No, he's not.

144
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,635
My grandpa...

145
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:11,007
He likes to hit on everybody
regardless of gender.

146
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:14,539
The other day, that man happened
to visit the temple,

147
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:18,172
then my Grandpa just decided
to make him a live-in helper.

148
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,146
You have a very interesting grandpa.

149
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,689
Did you say that your name
was Usagi? I'm sorry.

150
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,891
Oh, what happened to me?

151
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,756
There is something strange
going on these days.

152
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,496
My sixth sense and prophecies
used to be absolutely accurate,

153
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:32,827
but now, it's gone haywire.

154
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:38,795
Prophecies? Could this girl be
the princess I'm looking for?

155
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:42,073
Excuse me, where is the head priest?!

156
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,141
What is the matter?

157
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,909
My daughter didn't come home

158
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,309
after she left to buy amulets
at your shrine!

159
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:51,616
I hear your head priest always does
his so-called special ceremony at 5:30.

160
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,380
Are you sure he's not trying to force
people to take the 6 o'clock bus?!

161
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:56,353
Please don't make
strange accusations!

162
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,321
The 5:30 ceremony has been
offered for a long time!

163
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,987
A policeman was here
early this morning,

164
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,918
but if you want to report someone
as missing, just go to the police!

165
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,865
It has nothing to do with my grandpa!

166
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:08,599
Now, get out!

167
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,100
My! I cannot believe you! How rude!
Now, get out!

168
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,202
My! I cannot believe you! How rude!

169
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,071
You're the one that's rude!
Please leave!

170
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:14,105
My!

171
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,096
Usagi, something's not right!

172
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:17,975
I think this has to do
with our enemy.

173
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,705
Contact Ami; we have to figure out
what to do.

174
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,747
But, Ami has to...

175
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,849
Many people have disappeared!

176
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,984
Hurry up and get Ami out
of her cram school!

177
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,542
Okay, I got it!

178
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,053
Sendaizaka Ue

179
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,724
So, this is Sendaizaka.

180
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:36,319
Yeah.

181
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:40,119
There are so many of them!

182
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,088
You're right!

183
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,668
Hikawa Shrine

184
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:44,035
Hikawa Shrine
Everyone has Hikawa Shrine's amulets.

185
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,333
Everyone has Hikawa Shrine's amulets.

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,176
Wow, so all these girls are
in love with somebody.

187
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,278
How could they have spare time
for other things,

188
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,678
when they should be busy studying
for high school entrance exams?

189
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:00,009
Oh, but Ami, you fall in love, too,
don't you?

190
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,442
As for me...

191
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,932
Usagi, if you don't know
what real love is,

192
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,492
you shouldn't use the word
"love" so lightly.

193
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:18,799
Eep!

194
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:22,240
It's here! 5:59.
That must be the bus!

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,607
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka
It's here! 5:59.
That must be the bus!

196
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,598
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka

197
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,147
It looks like a normal bus.

198
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:30,136
Yes, it does.

199
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,131
Okay, Usagi! Get on!

200
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:47,965
But...

201
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:48,432
Here, let's go!
But...

202
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:49,400
Here, let's go!

203
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,731
I don't wanna!

204
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,471
Here, hurry!

205
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:54,870
No, I don't wanna!

206
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,276
I really don't wanna!

207
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:00,845
Usagi, don't be silly.
Let's get on the bus!

208
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:02,335
Come on, be brave now!

209
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,738
I don't wanna! I'm scared!

210
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:06,683
I'm scared!

211
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,991
It left!

212
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,127
I can't believe you, Usagi.
You're such a coward!

213
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:17,992
But... But...

214
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,700
It can't be helped, we'll come
again tomorrow at 6 o'clock.

215
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,894
Geez.

216
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,738
What in the...

217
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,898
What?!

218
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,711
No way, no way!

219
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,552
A black hole?

220
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:49,559
A fourth-dimensional space?

221
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,928
Or a hole in the magnetic field?!
What was that?

222
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,439
Master Jadeite, today's operation
was successful again.

223
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,414
The energy in girls who have
offered prayers is enormous.

224
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,984
Draw it out of them nice and slowly.

225
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,212
Yes, Sir!

226
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,974
Here, Phobos and Deimos.

227
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:45,046
Oh, Usagi!

228
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:46,948
What's the matter?

229
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:53,655
I saw it! Yesterday, the 6 o'clock bus
disappeared again!

230
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,520
So, you're also saying that
it's my grandpa's fault?!

231
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,263
What?!

232
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:01,494
The police came here so many times.
I'm sick of it!

233
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,869
No, I didn't mean it like that!

234
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,938
I was just wondering if you might
know something about it.

235
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:08,098
I don't know anything!

236
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:12,409
I'm sorry! I just want to be
your friend. Honest!

237
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:14,206
Please just leave!

238
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:18,706
I'll come again later. Good-bye!

239
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,981
How dare she?!

240
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,764
Did she drop this?

241
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:35,100
We want good-luck amulets for love!

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,261
Sure, which color do you prefer?

243
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,205
Which one should I pick?

244
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,107
Since he came here,

245
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,337
we sell more amulets,

246
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,945
and we have more visitors.

247
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:51,573
But...

248
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:56,621
But why does the bus disappear
in front of the shrine?

249
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,781
Why?!

250
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,757
Is somebody there?!

251
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:03,924
Your meal is ready.

252
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,298
Go away, I cannot concentrate!

253
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:07,322
My apologies.

254
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:12,369
Mysterious eyes like ice...

255
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,741
Do those eyes have something

256
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,299
to do with the way my prophecies
stopped working?

257
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:21,246
Hey, Luna. Why did you
leave that pen for Rei?

258
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,441
I want to check something.

259
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:26,351
Check something? Like what?

260
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,753
I'll tell you later.

261
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,745
Anyway, Usagi, you have to get
on the 6 o'clock bus today!

262
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:31,256
Hikawa Shrine

263
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:33,392
Hikawa Shrine
I know, but...

264
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:34,860
Hikawa Shrine
You can't be scared!

265
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,961
Hikawa Shrine

266
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,529
Hikawa Shrine
Ami's so late.

267
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,464
Hikawa Shrine
She said she'd get on the bus with me.

268
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,565
Hikawa Shrine
Oh, it's the bus!

269
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:40,665
Hikawa Shrine
D'oh!

270
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:41,867
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka
D'oh!

271
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:42,595
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka

272
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,492
Oh, no! It's here!

273
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:44,770
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka
Oh, no! It's here!

274
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,237
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka

275
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,038
Red 66 Via Sendaizaka
We have no choice, let's just
get on the bus by ourselves!

276
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:47,439
We have no choice, let's just
get on the bus by ourselves!

277
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,270
What'll I do now?!

278
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,738
Let's go!

279
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,714
I changed my mind! I'm scared!

280
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,047
Oh, Usagi!
I changed my mind! I'm scared!

281
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:56,915
Oh, Usagi!

282
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:58,473
But...

283
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,383
I'm scared! No!
Don't be such a baby!

284
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,314
I'm scared! I don't wanna!

285
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,984
The bus is going to leave! Hurry!

286
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,953
But I don't know what I should do!

287
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,427
Okay, then!

288
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,431
What are you doing?

289
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:22,534
Moon Power! Turn me into
a cool bus attendant!

290
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,641
Good! This will make me
a little less scared!

291
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:37,823
Why do you have to be
a bus attendant?

292
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,391
Hey, bus, wait!

293
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,483
What's with you?!

294
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:44,196
Everyone!

295
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,356
What in the?!

296
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:50,669
It's my duty to make sure passengers
are safe and comfortable during travel!

297
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,137
Hijacking is unforgivable!

298
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,626
I didn't make it in time.

299
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:19,464
What is the main culprit?

300
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:21,523
What is the origin of these troubles?

301
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,249
So, you're the origin of this evil!

302
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,149
What are you talking about?

303
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:38,717
Don't play dumb! I trust the
fire and it's telling me
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:41,753
Don't play dumb! I trust the
fire and it's telling me

305
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:44,055
that you're the main instigator!

306
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:45,522
Show me who you are!

307
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:49,654
So, you found out. You
will go inside, too!

308
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:51,389
What is...

309
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,445
Where am I?!

310
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:09,047
Usagi, pull yourself together!

311
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:10,878
I can't pull myself together!

312
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:16,211
Rei!

313
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,020
A monster!

314
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,763
Usagi! Transform yourself
into Sailor Moon!

315
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:27,357
I don't wanna live like this anymore!

316
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,165
But I'll do it!

317
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:33,562
That's right! Your spirit and easygoing
attitude are important!

318
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:37,508
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

319
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,182
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

320
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,716
You've finally shown up!
I've been waiting!

321
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:26,958
That mark!

322
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,259
Release Rei!

323
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,126
Keeping everyone locked up
in here is unforgivable!

324
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,956
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

325
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,569
Moon Tiara Action!

326
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,455
You cannot beat me with this toy!

327
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:58,752
You fell for it!

328
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:00,955
What?

329
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,594
Rei, are you okay?

330
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,461
I'm fine.

331
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,029
Rei, take out your transforming pen!
I'm fine.

332
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,864
Rei, take out your transforming pen!

333
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:07,632
The cat spoke!

334
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,634
I'll explain everything later.

335
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:12,262
Hurry up and take out the transforming
pen you picked up at the shrine!

336
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:14,239
This?

337
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,507
Use that and transform!

338
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,176
You're Sailor Mars, a warrior
specialized in fire!

339
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,940
Just yell, "Mars Power Makeup!"

340
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,349
Hurry!

341
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,045
I have no idea what you're talking
about, but I don't care right now!

342
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:31,354
Mars Power Makeup!

343
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,367
So, Rei is the third warrior?

344
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,665
What's going on?

345
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:55,771
Evil spirit, you won't get away
with this! I'll take care of you!

346
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,144
Fire

347
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,214
Soul!

348
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:13,732
Oh, what's that?

349
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:18,002
Oh, no! The dimensional hole is
closing because of Rei's fire power!

350
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,504
We need to get out of here quick!

351
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:20,004
How?!

352
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:20,672
I don't know!
How?!

353
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:21,272
I don't know!

354
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:25,265
Oh, no. What'll we do?!
What'll we do now?!

355
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,149
Sendaizaka Ue

356
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:31,416
Sendaizaka Ue
Usagi, Luna, everyone...

357
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,680
Usagi, Luna, everyone...

358
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:36,886
Please be all right.

359
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,591
It's closing!

360
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,725
What's that? Could it be Ami?

361
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:49,425
It might be Ami trying to show us
where the exit is!

362
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,236
She must be!

363
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,500
We'll escape towards the direction
where the signal is coming from!

364
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,674
I'll be the driver! Hurry!

365
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,177
Oh, Tuxedo Mask! When did
he show up here?!

366
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,236
He's so cool...

367
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,418
We did it!

368
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:07,919
Let's go, both of you.
We did it!

369
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,686
Let's go, both of you.

370
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:09,653
Yeah!

371
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,254
Ami!

372
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,757
So, another warrior has appeared.

373
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:26,838
They are worthy opponents!

374
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:29,136
I will beat them next time, without fail!

375
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:30,708
Luna!

376
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,176
Ami!
Luna!

377
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:31,476
Ami!

378
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:31,876
Ami!
Thanks, Ami!

379
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:32,577
Thanks, Ami!

380
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:33,011
Usagi, good job!
Thanks, Ami!

381
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,342
Usagi, good job!

382
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:36,281
Goodbye, I will see you again.

383
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,340
Oh, where did Tuxedo Mask go?

384
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,555
Don't tell me you like Tuxedo Mask!

385
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:45,456
You have got to be kidding me!

386
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:48,059
I just wanted to thank him.

387
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,256
What about you? Are you
in love with him?

388
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,899
Of course, it could just be
a one-sided love.

389
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,734
One... One-sided?

390
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,396
No, it can't be... It can't be!

391
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:13,486
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

392
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:20,153
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

393
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:35,370
Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

394
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:42,508
Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

395
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:51,286
Anata dake ki ni naru
shunkan ga atta no

396
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:58,254
Motto kirei ni ima sugu naritai

397
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:05,793
Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne

398
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:12,372
Me o tojite tashikamete

399
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:26,258
Dakishimeta tokimeki sono
mama kono omoi tsutaetai
