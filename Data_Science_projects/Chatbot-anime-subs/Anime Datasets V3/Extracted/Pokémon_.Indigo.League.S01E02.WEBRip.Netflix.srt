I declare to the Pokémon of the world,

14
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,653
I will be the greatest
Pokémon trainer,

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,615
the greatest Pokémon Master
of all time.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,079
[narrator] <i>Last time, Ash,</i>
<i>our hero from Pallet, chose Pikachu,</i>

17
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,165
<i>a Pokémon who was not too thrilled</i>
<i>with its new trainer.</i>

18
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,461
<i>Soon they found themselves fighting off</i>
<i>a flock of fearsome Spearows.</i>

19
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>Pikachu saved the day with</i>
<i>its amazing Thunder Shock,</i>

20
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,092
<i>but the electrifying encounter</i>
<i>left Pikachu weak</i>

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>and his fate in Ash's hands.</i>

22
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,763
-Pikachu.
-[sighs]

23
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:41,560
-We beat 'em.
-Chu...?

24
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:48,692

29

Repeat, be on the lookout

30
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,629
Speak of the devil.

[Ash pants]

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,723
Hold it. And just where do you think
you're going with that Pokémon, young man?

33
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,808
It's my Pokémon and its hurt

34
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,519
and I've got to get it to
the hospital right away.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,065
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you might be stealing it.

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,900
Just show me your I.D. and you can go.

37
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,944
I.D. I don't have any.

38
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,364
You see, we just came here from Pallet
and we--

39
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,117
You know, you're the fourth person
I've seen today from Pallet town.

40
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,830
The fourth. Oh, that means Gary Oak
is here already.

41
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,876
It's very unusual for someone to carry
a Pokémon around in his arms

42
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,461
and not in a Poké Ball .

43
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,506
How do I know you didn't steal
that Pokémon,

44
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,300
especially since you don't have
any identification?

45
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,719
Please let me through.
I wouldn't steal a Pokémon

46
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,139
and I've got to get Pikachu
to the hospital. Please, miss.

47
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,725
Hey, what's that in your pocket?

48
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,478
What? Oh, this?

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,688
This, this is perfect.

50
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,442
A Pokédex!

51
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,695
-This will solve our problem.
-Huh?

52
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,407
Let's see. If you're the real deal.

53
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,660
<i>I'm Dexter, a Pokédex programmed</i>
<i>by Professor Oak</i>

54

55
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,790
<i>My function is to provide Ash</i>

Oh, my Pokédex.

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,675
I didn't realize it was also my I.D.

60
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,052
Can I take Pikachu
to the Pokémon Center now?

61
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,055
I'll get you there in no time at all.

62
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,814
Sit back, hold on and don't yell.

63
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,607

-Whoa!

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,154
[coughs]

65
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,577
Hey, what's the big idea?
Ugh, come back here.

A wanted poster. How flattering.

68
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,634
[James] Flattering?
This picture makes me look terrible.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,347
Then you should be happy
the photographer captured the real you.

70
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,599
Exactly.

71
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,434
We'll show these bumpkins.

72
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,605
The people of Viridian City will be sorry
they ever saw this face.

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,984
We're all sorry to see your face.
Stay focused.

74
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,361
We're here to capture rare
and unusual Pokémon.

75
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't forget. Meowth!

76
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,158
-Absolutely.
-But of course.

77
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,994
And just remember, I'm the top cat.

78
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,540
-[James] You got it.
-[Meowth] Meowth!

79
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,876
[engine revs]

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,919
There it is.

81
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,467
Pokémon Center. It's gigantic.

82
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,806
This is tricky. Just hold on. Here we go.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,307
[Ash] Whoa!

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,600
[brakes screeching]

85
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,233
-We have a driveway, you know.
-It's a Pokémon emergency.

86
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,610
-Please help it.
-Looks like a Pikachu.

87
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,153
We'll do what we can.

88
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,199
I need a stretcher
for a small electric Pokémon, stat.

89
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,577
[both] Chansey.

90
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,794
It'll be okay. Rush this Pokémon
to the critical care unit.

91
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,712
[both] Chansey.

92
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,508
We'll begin the treatment right away.

93
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,385
-Uh...
-Who are you?

94
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,680
His name is Ash.
He's the Pokémon's trainer.

95
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,307
If there's anything I can do,
please, just tell me.

96
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,351
-You can be more responsible.
-Huh?

97
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,979
If you want to become
a Pokémon trainer, young man,

98
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,898
you don't let your Pokémon battle
till it's in this condition.

99
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,483
But you don't know what happened.

100
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,070
What's past is past.
Now we have to heal your Pikachu.

101
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,282
-What can I do?
-Just leave everything to me.

102
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,866
Please.

103
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,537
It's in your hands. I know you'll give
the Pokémon excellent care.

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,873
-You got it here just in time.
-That's my job!

105
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,712
Oh, my goodness. I left my motorcycle
parked at the front desk.

106
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,672
Next time, use the driveway.

107
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,923
[chuckles]

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Ash, you'll have to go
to the waiting room.

Yeah, because that's where I am.

00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,387
<i>Mm hmm.</i>
<i>I suppose that proves it.</i>

155

<i>The other new Pokémon trainers</i>

Oh, why do I even bother?

164

But I did see a flying Pokémon
like that one.

<i>Don't talk such nonsense.</i>
<i>You couldn't have seen this Pokémon.</i>

167
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>Trainers have searched</i>
<i>their whole lives and never seen it.</i>

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,387
-It sure looked like it.
<i>-You must have been mistaken.</i>

169
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,556
[doorbell rings]
<i>Ah, there's my pizza.</i>

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,808
<i>Coming!</i>

171
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,312
<i>It was very nice talking to you, Ash.</i>
<i>And good luck.</i>

172
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,941
<i>Mm, anchovies, spinach</i>
<i>and pineapple pizza.</i>

173
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,527
-Huh?
-[Misty] Now I've got you.

174
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,614
[pants]

175
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,366
I knew I'd find you here.

176
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,326
Hey, what happened to your bike?

177
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,286
What happened to my bike?

178
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,789
You happened to my bike, you little loser.

179
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,252
This is what's left after you stole it
to save your Pokémon.

180
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:33,216
Now I can see why your Pokémon
is in the... Whoa, whoa, ah, ah, ah!

181
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,592
Oh!

182
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,095
-[Misty groans]
-Let me help you.

183
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:41,724
I don't need your help and you're going
to pay for what you did to my bike.

184
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,561
I'll make up for it.
I promise I will, really.

185
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,106
But I can't do anything about your bike
until--

186
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,441
I don't want any
of your lame excuses, kid.

187
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,277
I just want a new bike right now!

188
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,320
It's my Pikachu.

189
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,699
-My Pikachu's not too good.
-Huh?

190
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,539
Is it very serious?

191
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,585
I think so and there's nothing
I can do to help now.

192
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,919
[Misty] Oh.

193
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,299
[both] Huh?

194
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,678
Pikachu, are you all right?

195
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,641
Your Pikachu's resting.
It's a good thing you got it here so fast.

196
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,436
The procedure went well
and it should be fine.

197
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,856
-Thanks to the Pokémon Center.
-Yes, thank you very much.

198
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,109
Now your Pokémon needs a good rest
in the recovery room.

199
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,696
 You should go in with it, Ash.
 Thanks.

200
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,781
Listen, I'm sorry about your bike,

201
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,117
but I'm going to need some time
to make things right.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,078
-No way, I fell for that last time.
-Huh?

203
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,540
Well, you should take care of Pikachu now
and we'll settle up later.

204
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,292
Uh, okay.

205
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,501
[alarm wails]

206
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,255
[woman] <i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Our Viridian City radar sensors</i>

207
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,468
<i>have detected an aircraft belonging</i>
<i>to a gang of Pokémon thieves.</i>

208
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,430
<i>If you have a Pokémon in your possession,</i>
<i>exercise extreme caution.</i>

209
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,892
[laughs]
Guess we woke up this sleepy dump.

210
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,937
And how dare
they act like we're criminals?

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,230
They should welcome Team Rocket.

212
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,108
Well, we'll teach them
to respect that name.

213
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,986
Meowth.
And when we snatch all their Pokémon,

214
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,573
those scared little mice
will know I'm the top cat.

215
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,825
[both]
We know, Meowth. We know.

216
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,579
Ekans, Koffing, attack!

217
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,920
Koffing!

218
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,508
Ekans!

219
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,468
Koffing!

220
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,971
 What are...? Who are they?

221
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,765
[Jessie] Don't be frightened, little boy.

222
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,976
[James]
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

223
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,436
To protect the world from devastation...

224
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,897
To unite all peoples within our nation...

225
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,650
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

226
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,236
To extend our reach to the stars above...

227
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,363
-Jessie.
-James.

228
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,866
[Jessie] Team rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

229
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,869
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

230
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,330
Meowth! That's right.

231
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,290
What are you talking about?

232
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,584
He just doesn't get it, does he?

233
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,586
[Ash]
How can I? You don't make any sense.

234
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,255
We're here for the Pokémon.

235
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,923
You're not getting Pikachu!

236
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:24,262
Pikachu? We're not interested
in your precious electric rat.

237
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,390
We seek only rare and valuable Pokémon.

238
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,850
[Misty]
You're wasting your time.

239
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
This is a center for weak
and injured Pokémon.

240
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,189
Well, that may be so,
but I wouldn't be at all surprised

241
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,359
if we find a few little Pokémon gems
among all the junk.

242
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,319
You're starting to bug me.

243
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,156
-Isn't that cute?
-the boy's bugged.

244
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,283
Meowth. Then let's squash him.

245
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,744
-[James] Koffing, attack!
-[Jessie] Ekans, go!

246
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,791
Koffing!

247
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,758
-Koffing!
-Ekans!

248
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,513
 Hey, the lights.
 They must've cut the power.

249
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,183
But we've got our own pika power source.

250
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,816
[all] Pika, pika, chu, chu.

251
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,572
Oh, look at all the Pikachu.

252
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,034
[all] Pika, pika, chu, chu!

255
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,875
We have to save those Poké Balls.

256
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,424
This is the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
We have an emergency situation.

257
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,385
Transporting Poké Balls.

258

-[both] Oh!
-Get those Poké Balls!

262
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,901
Uh, right!

263
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,612
This is war.
Don't just hold them. Throw them!

264
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,075
All right. Poké Ball, here we go. Ah!

265
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,583
-Pidgey. Aah!
-Ekans!

266
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,961
That thing can't beat us.

267
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:25,174
No? Well, try this one.
Poké Ball, here we go. Aah!

268
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,135
Empty?

269
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,597
-We're never going to beat them that way.
-Some of the Poké Balls are empty.

270
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,266
Well, now she tells me.

271
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,602
This one feels like a real winner.
Poké Ball, go. Aah!

272
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,567
Rattata!

273
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,778
-Heh, pipsqueak.
-Meowth!

274
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,030
-Ekans!
-Rattata!

275
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,993
I guess I'm going to have to take
this into my own hands.

276
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,078
You grab Pikachu and get out of here.

277
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,248
I'll take care of these three clowns.

278
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,710
That's pretty big talk
coming from such a little lady.

279
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,920
At least you're right
about the pretty part.

280
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,172
Thanks for the compliment.

281
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,591
The girl thinks she's pretty.

282
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:11,387
I agree with her.
I think she's pretty too. Pretty pathetic.

283
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,307
[grunts angrily] I'll show you.

284
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,101
Poké Ball, go!

285
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,108
Goldeen, goldeen, goldeen, goldeen,
goldeen, goldeen...

286
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,693
[both] Huh?

287
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,987
Goldeen, return.

288
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,906
Goldeen, goldeen, goldeen.

289
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,495
-That's her best shot?
-She's all washed up.

290
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,499
You know as well as I do
that a water Pokémon can't battle on land.

291
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,001
-I was just warming up.
-Warming up?

292
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,129
-Just get Pikachu out of here.
-Right.

293
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,924

-Pikachu!
-Pikachu!

301
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,379
Do I have to do everything?
That mouse is cat food. Meowth!

302
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,548
Just wait. Pikachu, you're mine.

303
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,051
-[grunts]
-Pika, pika, pika, pika.

304
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,136
-Pika, pika?
-Pika.

305
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,056
-Pika, pika power?
-Pika!

306
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,518
So you want... You want more power.

307
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,644
What's this?

308
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,190
Well, let's just say that Pikachu and I...

309
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,110
are going to generate a little
excitement for you, Meowth.

310
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,990
-Huh?
-Uh-oh.

311
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,949
Meowth?

312
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,997
Pika, pika. Pikachu!

313
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,249

00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,185
[brakes screeching]

315
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,730
Too late. But not for the fireworks.

316
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,534
Great, a cat losing to a mouse.

317
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,621
That Pikachu is no ordinary Pikachu.

318
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,790
It's certainly very rare, a perfect prize.

319
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,627
-Let's catch it.
-Perhaps we will.

320
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,380
[all groaning]

321
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,562
<i>Your Viridian City Pokémon</i>
<i>were transported here safely.</i>

322
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:07,980
Thanks, sis.

323
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,525
Ash, Misty and Pikachu are heading
your way, to Pewter City...

324
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,779
if they can get safely through
the Viridian Forest.

325
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,572
Don't worry, from what I've seen,

326
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,783
those three can take pretty
good care of themselves.

327
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,993
Well, I hope you're right.

328

[squawking and Misty screams]

331
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,587
-What's the matter?
-Look, over there.

332
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:36,133
Oh, cool, it's a Caterpie.
It's one of the bug Pokémon.

333
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:40,388
Even if it is a Pokémon, bugs are
