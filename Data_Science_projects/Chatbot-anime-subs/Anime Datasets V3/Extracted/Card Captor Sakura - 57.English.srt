1
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:19,407
Who will you give it to?

2
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:43,271
Li-kun!!

3
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,840
N… nooo… way…

4
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,648
Why am I thinking about her?

5
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:56,375
This can’t be…!!

6
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:05,652
What’s wrong with me?

7
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:08,662
Why do I keep having
her images in my mind…

8
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:11,689
If your mind is calm,

9
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,592
then you will realize your inner truth

10
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,094
Inner truth…

11
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:19,963
What do you mean?

12
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,774
As for the rest of its meaning,
you’ll have to figure it out by yourself.

13
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,351
Inner truth… What is going on…

14
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:42,054
[Sakura, Shao Lan and the Elevator]

15
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:44,093
Good morning!

16
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,836
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan!

17
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,531
– Hi, Sakura-chan!
– Good morning, Rika-chan!

18
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:53,906
Look at this…

19
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:56,405
Teddy Bear Show?

20
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:58,338
How cute…

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,305
Sakura really like teddy bear, right?

22
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,608
Perhaps you will like to see it.

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,308
Love to see it!

24
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,985
We can all go to see it tomorrow.

25
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,479
Sorry,

26
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,188
I have a ballet lesson tomorrow

27
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,393
I can’t go.

28
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,963
Chihara-chan and Naoko-chan

29
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:18,596
don’t have time to go either.

30
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:22,200
You and Tomoyo-chan can go,
it’s already good enough.

31
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,467
I see… then…
thank you very much, Rika-chan!

32
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:28,501
Tomoyo-chan,
do you have anything to do tomorrow?

33
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:32,274
No, it would be nice
if we could go together.

34
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,204
Great!

35
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:36,678
Is it a teddy bear show?

36
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:41,522
– Eriol-kun, Good morning!
– Good morning!

37
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,985
Really?

38
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,292
Eriol-kun is really smart.

39
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:50,895
Oh not at all…

40
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:05,773
Then, Eriol-kun, let’s go

41
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,208
together tomorrow, okay?

42
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,049
Would that be too much
of a trouble for you?

43
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,456
– Good morning, Li-kun!
– Good morning…

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,087
Oh, Li-kun, lets go together.

45
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:28,902
It’s a teddy bear show.
It will be really fun.

46
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,868
Right!

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,086
Great!

48
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:20,679
Yes, yes, lots of bears, yes, yes, yes

49
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,710
Look at this, you could get a teddy bear
gift in the show too.

50
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:25,742
Everybody could be able to get one.

51
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:27,987
Can’t wait till tomorrow.

52
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:32,549
– Can’t wait till tomorrow.
– Right.

53
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:42,331
Sakura is very cute, isn’t she?

54
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,129
I… Me and her… There is nothing

55
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,769
It’s… really is… actually…

56
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,275
This kid is an honest person.

57
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:07,719
What am I doing?

58
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:09,424
This can’t be!!

59
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,063
Damn!

60
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,271
– Are you all right?
– I am okay.

61
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:21,909
That’s good.

62
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:29,648
Coming back from school?
Yeah…

63
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,417
You seem to be out of it.

64
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,179
Anything happended in school?

65
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,217
No… no…

66
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,386
I know, you must be hungry.

67
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:44,793
I guess it was me who’s hungry.

68
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,272
I am really sorry to
have you come along with me.

69
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,664
It’s not a problem.

70
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,405
Sakura invited me to have dinner
at her house tonight.

71
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:03,441
I felt improper to eat at Sakura’s
place even though she invited me.

72
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:04,582
I think

73
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:07,013
I will get her some cookies as a way
to say thank you.

74
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,555
That’s why I want to
buy some cookie bakery tools.

75
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,220
Oh yeah!

76
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,151
If you don’t mind, can you choose
some cookie cutters with me?

77
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,831
Me?

78
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,341
Did you find one?

79
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,443
It’s a teddy bear shape cutter.
Sakura likes it, right?

80
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:35,209
N… no… I really…

81
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:38,543
I choose this two.

82
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,957
But I think they are too big.

83
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:44,924
I think it won’t be a problem,

84
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,417
she eats anything.

85
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,791
If there are foods, she’ll be happy.

86
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:51,356
And…

87
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:54,735
If you are the one who make them,

88
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,895
she’ll definitely be very happy.

89
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,434
It seems like you like Sakura a lot.

90
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,607
Wha… You… I…

91
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:10,241
What’s up?

92
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,133
I like her…

93
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,522
Message one.

94
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,956
Hello, this is Kinomoto.

95
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:56,356
Before tomorrow’s meeting time

96
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,623
and place are decided, you’ve left.

97
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,662
Tomoyo-chan, Eriol-kun

98
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,164
and I have deci…

99
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,636
Message two.

100
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:07,666
It hurts…

101
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:09,474
Hello, sorry about that,

102
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,645
Kero-chan is playing videogame and…

103
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,245
It was you, who knocked me over!

104
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:16,650
What!!

105
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,880
Sorry… Oh,

106
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,815
we are talking about
the meeting time and place…

107
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:24,285
Tomorrow at ten am,

108
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,127
meet us at the train station’s
ticket booth, okay?

109
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,295
If you can’t get there during that time,

110
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,992
please tell me, bye.

111
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,957
Hello, this is Kinomoto.

112
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,894
we are talking about
the meeting time and place…

113
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,468
I discussed with Tomoyo and Eriol-kun

114
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,230
after you gone.

115
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:15,272
And the time is…

116
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,246
=This can’t go on forever,=

117
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,750
=I look up=

118
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,212
=at the blue sky.=

119
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,317
=A gentle breeze=

120
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,587
=goes by,=

121
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,990
=as I walk up the hill.=

122
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:13,523
=My usual serious face watches,=

123
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:18,004
=from far away=

124
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:20,768
=What has happened=

125
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,037
=to my pride?=

126
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,812
=I am devoted.=

127
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,913
=I can’t ignore her.=

128
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,148
=She’s mysterious.=

129
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:36,550
=I’ll just watch quietly from here.=

130
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:42,194
=It seems something=

131
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,459
=big waits.=

132
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,164
=I can’t ignore this feeling,=

133
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,297
=this strange feeling.=

134
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:54,941
=My heart beats like in a dream.=

135
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,004
=It seems that everyday=

136
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:04,148
=it gets stronger.=

137
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:07,147
=I won’t be beaten by her.=

138
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:17,692
=We spent so much time,=

139
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,191
=chasing down an orange bear.=

140
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,599
=It seemed like=

141
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:28,236
=Such a good idea, at the time.=

142
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,713
=When did she start=

143
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:38,149
=to mean so much to me=

144
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,985
=I don’t know why.=

145
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:47,784
=Kick away the asphalt,=

146
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,289
=and hurry home.=

147
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,565
=I can’t ignore her.=

148
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,664
=She’s mysterious.=

149
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:01,167
=I can’t look away=

150
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,873
=from her eyes today.=

151
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:07,443
=Why am I matching my pace to hers,=

152
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:10,314
=as we walk down the street?=

153
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,676
=I can’t ignore this feeling,=

154
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,782
=it’s a strange feeling.=

155
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:19,554
=As if my heart=
=has just started beating.=

156
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:24,161
=I won’t give up whatever happens.=

157
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,867
=But I have an idea!=

158
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,366
=I won’t be beaten by anyone.=

159
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:55,206
Those teddy bears are really cute.

160
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:56,181
Really…

161
00:13:56,197 --> 00:14:00,065
I am very lucky.

162
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,433
I get to record Sakura’s cute moments

163
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:08,840
But if we could get to
see this show earlier…

164
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:13,211
Then the teddy bear
I made wouldn’t be that bad looking.

165
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,540
Oh yeah, Li-kun,
did you finish your yet?

166
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,577
What?

167
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,878
– The teddy bear doll.
– What?!!!

168
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:25,555
You bought the tools
in the store, right?

169
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,758
Eh… Li-kun, you bought
a teddy bear kit?

170
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:31,728
Did you give it to anybody yet?

171
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:36,870
The teddy bear show is over…

172
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,600
I want to hurry home before sunset.

173
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,666
Wait… Li-kun!

174
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:45,777
Li-kun!!! Wait!!!

175
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:10,927
What am I doing?

176
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,002
Why did you walk
that fast all of a sudden?

177
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,448
Hurry! Hurry!

178
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:55,941
What is going on?

179
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,845
It’s probably some minor
flaw in the elevator.

180
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:01,343
I’ll go get help.

181
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,761
Doesn’t work… 
Same here…

182
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,162
Why is it like this?

183
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,794
For now, let’s wait till
the rescuers come and get us.

184
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,970
Tomoyo-chan and Eriol-kun

185
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,872
are probably on
their way to get help.

186
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,499
Someone will definitely
come and get us out.

187
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:55,203
So, don’t cry.

188
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,013
Do you want to sit down?

189
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,687
Standing like that
will make you very tired.

190
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,459
If you sit over there,
it will stain your pants.

191
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,087
– Let sit over here together.
– What!

192
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,266
Found it, here.

193
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:28,098
What is it?

194
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:30,641
Last night,

195
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:34,408
Yukito-san came over
my house to have dinner.

196
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:36,340
Thanks for the food!

197
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:39,046
You always invite me over to have dinner

198
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:40,712
I just don’t feel right…

199
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,148
So, today I want to give you this.

200
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:46,485
Here, cookies.

201
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,689
The cookie bag is so big.

202
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:52,429
The dinning table can barely hold it.

203
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,865
But… I was careless…

204
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,863
– It was really good… 
– Kero-chan!!!

205
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,608
Kero-chan ate all of the cookies,
except this one.

206
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:05,840
Here, you can have it.

207
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,278
Since this is gift for you,

208
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,648
You should have it.

209
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:17,956
Then… I’ll give you half of it.

210
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:19,826
Here.

211
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:28,300
It’s very good.
It’s Yukito-san’s cookie.

212
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:51,256
It’s moving again… 
Aaahh!!

213
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:52,008
Sakura!!

214
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,772
I used the Float card.

215
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:27,419
I am glad.

216
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:44,398
– Li-kun, Sakura-chan!
– Tomoyo-chan!

217
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:47,198
I am glad that you guys are all right.

218
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:48,839
Thanks!

219
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:52,771
I was very worried.

220
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,311
Really!
Good…

221
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,258
– Hello, is this Li-kun?
– Yeah…

222
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,700
Thank you for what you did today.

223
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:15,830
No, I didn’t do anything.

224
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:20,462
When Li-kun and me are
inside the elevator…

225
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:21,934
You yelled my name, Sakura.

226
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:23,674
I am really happy.

227
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:28,882
From now on,

228
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:34,152
can I call you Shao Lan-kun
instead of Li-kun?

229
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:38,821
Whatever you like.

230
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:43,194
Then, I’ll see you tomorrow in school.
