00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,640
"I am Son Goku's Son!! Gohan
Returns to the Battlefield"

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,780
Kaio-sama!

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,110
Are you all right?

4
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,120
Such tremendous power! Still not yet?
Hasn't Shen Long granted the wish yet?

5
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,470
We're counting on you, Shen Long!

6
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,460
Once those who were killed by
Freeza and his ring are resurrected,

7
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,470
the Grand Elder should return to life, and
Planet Namek's Shen Long should appear.

8
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,150
This is the only means by which Goku
and the others can be saved now.

9
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,830
Shen Long...

10
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,170
Father, hang in there!

11
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,010
This is terrible! In three minutes, this
planet will undergo a giant explosion!

12
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,140
Full power!!

13
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,160
What!?

14
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,800
l- It can't be!

15
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,470
Is something the matter?

16
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,810
Father-Father's Ki has disappeared!

17
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,140
What did you say!?

18
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,140
How could Father lose?

19
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,820
Then Son-kun is... ?

20
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,820
Did you see that? My 1 00 percent power!?

21
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,830
How about that!? That's what you get!

22
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,840
There was no way someone like
you could have beaten Freeza!

23
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,340
There's nothing else we can do! You
realize that, don't you Gohan-kun?

24
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,840
If we don't escape from here right now...

25
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,840
Gohan-kun!

26
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,820
Bulma-san,

27
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,300
take Piccolo-san and return
to Earth ahead of us.

28
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,070
What are you saying, Gohan-kun!?

29
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:29,140
Freeza intends to wipe out all Saiyans.
That means if I return to Earth, then
Freeza will go to Earth next!

30
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,140
You're not, by any chance...

31
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,140
H- Hold on!
Wait!

32
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,810
Gohan-kun!

33
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,160
I am my father's-Son Goku's son!
And now I... I will take on Freeza!

34
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,170
You can't! There's no way you can win!

35
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,170
I'm sure Piccolo-san would
say the same thing.

36
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,120
Bulma-san, take care!

37
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,780
Gohan-kun!

38
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,140
Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

39
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,150
Chichi-san, our Goku can't possibly be beaten!
He's must surely be winning against Freeza!

40
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,490
He's right, he's right!

41
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,160
On the other hand, don't matter how bad
Goku may be thrashin' on what's-his-mug,

42
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,090
once the whole planet blows up, he ain't...

43
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,500
Enough of that!

44
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll thank you not to be sayin' such ill-fated
things! My Goku-sa won't be dyin' so easily!

45
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm sure he's comin' home in good shape!

46
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,110
I'm sure... I'm sure he's comin' home!

47
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,450
Oh? Sorry about that.

48
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,340
What is the meaning of this?

49
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,680
Have we returned to life?

50
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,850
There's something strange about this!
What's with the ground shaking?

51
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,150
Not to mention the sky being dark.
What in the world is going on?

52
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,170
W- Where am I? Am I alive again?

53
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,130
Hurry, Shen Long! There's no time!

54
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,140
The sky! What's this?

55
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,150
Is this an indication that the planet
is just about to explode?

56
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,490
It looks as though it would be best for
me to get away from this planet.

57
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,100
If I get caught in the blast, I'll lose
even more power sharply.

58
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,760
T- This can't be!

59
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,790
Now, you'll have to face me!

60
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,800
You surprise me! To think you still
had the power to fly so fast.

61
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Just what you'd expect of a Saiyan brat!

62
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,140
You... I'm going to defeat you!

63
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,090
You're going to defeat me, you say?

64
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,100
Are you thinking of fighting me, Freeza,
in your exhausted condition?

65
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,100
You for one are aware of my
overwhelming power, aren't you?

66
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,310
You're so miserable, you Saiyans.
Even when outclassed, you still
can't keep yourselves from fighting.

67
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,450
It's fine with me. This saves me the
trouble of going to Earth.

68
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,450
So then, last of the Saiyans, come at me!

69
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,810
What do you think you're doing?
Weren't you going to defeat me?

70
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,410
Or is it that before my overwhelming power,
the only thing you could do was run?

71
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,760
Why, you... !

72
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,430
Now then, what manner
of death do you desire?

73
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,110
J- Just a little longer. If I can detain Freeza for two
minutes, he'll be gone, together with the planet...

74
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I have succeeded. Whosoever was
killed by Freeza and his ring on Planet
Namek have been returned to life.

75
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,800
Thank you for service.

76
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,130
So then, farewell.

77
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,220
He did it!

78
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,190
He did it! Everyone has been restored to life!

79
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,730
What about the all-important Grand Elder?
How is Planet Namek's Super Shen Long?

80
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,810
They're all right. They should be
all right. The sky is dark.

81
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,840
That's proof that Super Shen Long and the
Grand Elder are back alive. I'll verify it now.

82
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:41,150
How is this so? Why... why am
I in the mortal world?

83
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,990
Great! It's just as I figured!

84
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,180
All right!

85
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Kaio-sama, hurry! You have hurry
and to tell him your intentions, or he'll... !

86
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,850
That's right! The Grand Elder's
measure of life will once again... !

87
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,130
I know!

88
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,800
Grand Elder of Planet Namek! I am
the Kaio over the Northern Galaxy.

89
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,810
Kaio-sama...

90
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,810
I want you to listen closely to
what I'm about to say.

91
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,490
Just a little bit more time...

92
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,180
Where did all that spirit you
had a moment ago go?

93
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,490
I know! I just thought of something nice!

94
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,120
I think I'll put you into the
same grave as your father.

95
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,500
What do you think? That must make you happy!
You should be grateful for my kindness.

96
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,480
Okay, that put a little bit
more fight into him.

97
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,160
That kid! What is he thinking!?

98
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,830
So that's it!

99
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,840
I've figured out what you were after!

100
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,790
You're stalling for time, aren't you?
That must be it!

101
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,120
You've realized that this planet only has a few
more moments of its life span left, haven't you?

102
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,500
Y- You...

103
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,130
You, who killed Father and Kuririn-san...

104
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,150
I can't allow someone like
you to go on living!

105
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,830
Masenko!

106
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,110
Hmph. It has to be like this, or it wouldn't
be enjoyable. Just like a Saiyan.

107
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,460
However, I'm done playing around. You've
gone to such trouble, so let me show you...

108
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,460
...my 100 percent power, which is
what killed your father!

109
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,470
Father... Piccolo-san...

110
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,150
You're finished!

111
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,830
What!?

112
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,120
F- Father!

113
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,130
Why haven't you escaped?

114
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,670
I thought I told you to get away!

115
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,800
B- But...

116
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,140
- GO!!
- Right!

117
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,150
Father...

118
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,520
You undying freak!

119
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,430
Goku rises again from the brink of death!

120
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Can Kaio's wish reach the Super
Shen Long Polunga before the
destruction of Planet Namek?
