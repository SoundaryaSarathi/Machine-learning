1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,605
=Someday,=
=I’ll become a wonderful person.=

2
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:16,768
=I want to bring happiness=

3
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,439
=with my own magic.=

4
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:25,578
I was so nervous.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,944
It was wonderful.

6
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:28,218
Not bad,

7
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,088
but not as good as me.

8
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:33,493
This karaoke mic turns out really well.

9
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:36,422
It’s from your mother’s company,
isn’t it?

10
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:39,433
Yes, but it is not for sale
in the stores yet.

11
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,565
It’s nice to have one
when watching the cherry blossoms.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,167
It’s nice for parties!

13
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,539
You know, about karaoke…

14
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:47,965
Next, it’s Tomoyo-chan’s turn!

15
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,173
Okay.

16
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:53,038
I love to hear Tomoyo-chan sing.

17
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:54,942
Don’t you, Mei Lin-chan?

18
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,740
I guess so.

19
00:00:58,152 --> 00:00:59,414
I mean only Daidouji-san
can rival me in singing.

20
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:07,558
=When I am lonely,=

21
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:14,023
=I seek warmth.=

22
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:19,030
=I trace far into the distance=

23
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:24,410
=my dear memories.=

24
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:37,315
=Holding her beloved child=

25
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,155
=in her arms,=

26
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:43,930
Tomoyo-chan is
really very good at singing.

27
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:47,730
And she has such a beautiful voice.

28
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:53,468
=This song is dedicated to you…=

29
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:07,753
[Sakura and Tomoyo’s Vanished Voice]

30
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,749
That must’ve been nice.

31
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,649
I wanted to go see

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,251
the cherry blossoms too!

33
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,625
I could’ve pretended
to be a stuffed doll!

34
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:19,124
Then you couldn’t eat anything, you know?

35
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,132
No way!
That’s just too painful!

36
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,202
Thanks.

37
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,342
Hey,
if you return to your original form,

38
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:30,905
will you be able to go
see the cherry blossoms during the day?

39
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:34,408
Even more impossible.

40
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,611
Hey, how does your original form

41
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:38,943
look like?

42
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,619
Reeeeal cool.

43
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:42,946
Like how?

44
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,685
So cool that it’s impossible
to describe in words.

45
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,018
What’s that?

46
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,624
Well, when you finish gathering’
all the cards,

47
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:51,593
you’ll find out.

48
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:52,831
Fine…

49
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,071
But at that time,

50
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,670
you might need to
deal with that guy too…

51
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,551
For next week’s strawberry hunt,

52
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:15,617
everything you need
to bring is printed here,

53
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,456
so make sure you
show your parents.

54
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:19,850
Yes!

55
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,455
Let’s eat lots of strawberries!

56
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:22,420
Yes!

57
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:24,096
Okay, that’s it for today.

58
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,261
Good-bye, Sensei.

59
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,068
Good-bye.

60
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:29,494
Hurry up!

61
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,362
Okay!

62
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:32,496
Tomoyo-chan,
do you have club practice today?

63
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:33,364
Yes.

64
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:34,266
Me too.

65
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:35,900
Let’s go home together afterwards!

66
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:36,768
That is…

67
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,339
Shao Lan, let’s go home together!

68
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,371
Wei asked me to go
buy something for him.

69
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,644
I’ll go with you!

70
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,514
I’m not going to play you know.

71
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:50,646
Sakura-chan.
In order to prepare for the competition,

72
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,052
I might need to stay late.

73
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,788
The set piece this time is hard.

74
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,628
The song you sang
at the cherry-blossom viewing?

75
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,456
No, it is a different song.

76
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,930
Are you singing a solo?

77
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,163
No, it is a group singing.

78
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:07,232
But I have
a solo at the beginning…

79
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:08,768
If I do not perform well,

80
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,077
it will affect
everyone else’s performance.

81
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:16,610
And also,
it is a song that I love very much.

82
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:20,416
Don’t worry!
I’m sure you’ll sing really well.

83
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,188
I will do my best.

84
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,557
See you later!

85
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,455
Kinomoto-san!

86
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,593
Is Daidouji-san going
to the choir practice?

87
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:37,869
Yes.

88
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,943
Daidouji-san…
I think she’ll be having a hard time…

89
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,441
Help her through it, okay?

90
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:02,318
Hurray! Hurray! To-mo-e-da!

91
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,661
Have you heard the new song
the choir’s been practicing?

92
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:05,995
No.

93
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,096
Tomoyo-chan said she’s practicing

94
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,859
a new song for the competition.

95
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:14,072
Tomoyo-chan’s singing is wonderful.

96
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,375
She said she might have to
stay late for practice today as well.

97
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:19,409
Oh, after club practice is over,

98
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,578
do you want to see their practice?

99
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:21,746
Yeah, I’ll go.

100
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:22,880
I’ll go too!

101
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:25,010
Sakura-chan!

102
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,078
Yukito-san!

103
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,425
Cheer-leading club practice?

104
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,353
Yes!

105
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:35,289
I’m glad it’s not a baton this time.

106
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,829
Even if that fell on your head,
it wouldn’t hurt.

107
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:39,930
Onii-chan!!

108
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,959
You’ll be okay even
if you got hit by a baton.

109
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,802
Sakura’s head is as hard as a rock.

110
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,103
It is not!!

111
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,439
Yukito-san,
you’re wearing this uniform…

112
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,849
I’m helping out the soccer team.

113
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,552
He’s helping out
with our next match.

114
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:02,520
Oh, we gotta go.

115
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:03,881
Later, rock-head.

116
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,054
Onii-chan!!

117
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,224
See you later!

118
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,822
Pass it! Pass it!

119
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:15,826
Touya!

120
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:18,896
All Right!!!

121
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,536
I… I’ll go get it!

122
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,570
That went very far!

123
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,780
Sakura-chan’s all full
of spirit today as well!

124
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:36,882
Oh, It’s Tomoyo-chan’s singing.

125
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,720
Her voice is so beautiful.

126
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,029
Clow Card…

127
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:08,786
What’s wrong? Daidouji-san?

128
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,448
Daidouji-san! Daidouji-san!

129
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,766
Daidouji-san!

130
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,198
Tomoyo-chan!

131
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,135
You… can’t speak?

132
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,573
No way!

133
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,617
Please take care.

134
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:38,783
Please excuse us.

135
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,497
And then, Tomoyo went home?

136
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,663
The bodyguard ladies
came to pick her up.

137
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,334
And they went straight to the doctor.

138
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,174
That’s what the maid said

139
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,976
on the phone just now.

140
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,010
It seems she still hasn’t been
able to speak after all…

141
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:12,975
That is probably
the act of the Clow Card

142
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:14,447
you sensed then.

143
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,448
You sensed it, right?

144
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,696
If only I’d noticed
it a little earlier

145
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,488
and sealed it…

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,194
Cheer up.

147
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,827
If you’re like this,

148
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,436
Tomoyo’ll be sad too.

149
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,101
She can’t speak…

150
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:40,978
which means…

151
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:42,472
No doubt about it.

152
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:44,314
It’s the act of Voice card.

153
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,549
Voice?

154
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,046
It liked Tomoyo’s voice,

155
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,221
so it stole it.

156
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,352
That’s mean!

157
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:55,259
What Mizuki-sensei said…

158
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:57,657
Could it be about this…?

159
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,361
I’d like to meet

160
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,259
this teacher for once.

161
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:19,211
Tomoyo!

162
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,922
You couldn’t speak?

163
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,083
Even though the doctor
said you didn’t catch a cold…

164
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,326
How about a fever?
Are you cold?

165
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:29,853
Are you in pain anywhere?

166
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,300
Is that right?

167
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,337
I’ll skip work tomorrow.

168
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:39,769
I’m so worried.

169
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,673
[I am okay.]

170
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,914
You are not okay.

171
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,690
I could tell you must be scared

172
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,592
when something like this happen.

173
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:05,222
Because you’re my
one and only daughter.

174
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:22,575
Saitou Mioko-san.

175
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:23,474
Here!

176
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:24,906
Tanade Ryouichi-kun.

177
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:25,847
Here!

178
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,651
Daidouji-san is
not feeling well today.

179
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:32,685
Her mother called saying that

180
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,655
she will be absent today.

181
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:38,687
Tomoyo-chan…

182
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,045
What happened?

183
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,748
Li. Why are you here…

184
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,577
I… I was worried about you…

185
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:03,778
I just think, I

186
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:05,658
…might have found a Clow Card…

187
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,000
Daidouji is absent

188
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:18,970
because of the Clow Card.

189
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,073
Tomoyo-chan,
for the competition this time,

190
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,137
was practicing so hard for
the solo she has at the beginning.

191
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,841
If she can’t sing well,

192
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,810
The rest will be wasted.

193
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,343
It’s not just about the competition.

194
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,684
What if she loses her voice from now on?

195
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,549
Tomoyo-chan!

196
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:39,953
It’s no use crying.

197
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:44,122
You must think of a way
to seal the Clow Card.

198
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:46,990
I’ll think too.

199
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,629
I… just… wanted to capture the card…

200
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,096
Thanks.

201
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,774
In… In the meantime,
we should go visit Daidouji-san

202
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,619
and see how things are going.

203
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,484
Li-kun! Tomoyo-chan’s
house is not that way!

204
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,223
How are you feeling?

205
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,066
You still can’t speak, can you?

206
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:23,401
I’m sorry.

207
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,862
It’s all because
I didn’t notice it quickly enough.

208
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:41,048
[Sakura-chan, please cheer up.
Seeing your sad face
makes me feel sad as well.]

209
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:44,420
Tomoyo-chan!

210
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,420
I’ll capture the card

211
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,753
before the competition.
I promise!

212
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,500
Hello!

213
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,496
Hello!

214
00:12:58,138 --> 00:12:59,036
Oh, we haven’t met before.

215
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:00,471
I’m Shao Lan Li.

216
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,704
I’m Tomoyo’s mother.
Nice to meet you.

217
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,303
Oh, Sakura-chan, please sit.

218
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:07,741
Please let me help you.

219
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh? Thanks.

220
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:26,562
[You are always watching Sakura.]

221
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,960
Wh… Wha…

222
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,069
I… I’m not…

223
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:33,530
What’s wrong, Li?

224
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:36,874
It’s nothing.

225
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:03,527
Did Kerberos mention anything

226
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,527
about the Voice card?

227
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:09,266
He said, “The Voice card
likes Tomoyo-chan’s voice,

228
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,610
so it took it, right?”

229
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,080
It’s not nearby.

230
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,516
He said Voice is not going to stop

231
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,917
until it finishes
collecting all the voices it likes.

232
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,786
Said it’ll also hide from
those whose voices are taken

233
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:31,191
so that they can’t get them back.

234
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:32,892
So if we want to seal Voice,

235
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,530
we must find it first.

236
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,681
I have no idea at all

237
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:00,324
how to search for Voice!

238
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:06,398
[Please cheer up.]

239
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,401
Compare to me, you must
be feeling even more terrible.

240
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:20,572
This is the second time for you!

241
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,604
It’s always you Tomoyo-chan.

242
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,083
Last time I got you involved

243
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,047
in the Song card too!

244
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,282
Song!

245
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,647
We can use Song!

246
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,982
That card has copied
Daidouji’s voice, right?

247
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,089
If Voice could

248
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,024
hear the voice

249
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,322
it has stolen
coming from somewhere…

250
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,059
It might come out
to steal it again!

251
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,571
Deliver the most supreme singing voice!

252
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:56,349
Song!

253
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:33,907
All right!

254
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,522
Return to thy form which thou should be!

255
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,925
Clow Card!

256
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,291
Tomoyo-chan!

257
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,400
Sakura-chan…

258
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,010
Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

259
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,551
Thank you very, very much.

260
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,058
Next is the Tomoeda
Elementary School Choir.

261
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,401
Tomoyo-chan has a solo, you know?

262
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:06,794
I can’t wait!

263
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,304
When it comes to singing,
Daidouji-san is my only rival.

264
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,307
So there’s no way she can lose.

265
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,279
Where’s Sakura-san?

266
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,357
I’ll cheer for you with all I have!

267
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,759
Because you went
through all that trouble

268
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,998
to bring me back my voice,

269
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,394
I’ll do my very best.

270
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,666
Next is the

271
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,231
Tomoeda Elementary School Choir.

272
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,936
I will sing from the bottom of my heart.

273
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:51,242
Because I am dedicating this song to you.

274
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:54,442
Please go listen to it.

275
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:18,576
=Sunshine dances between the clouds,=

276
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:26,349
=and pours into the plains…=

277
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:31,949
=The season has just begun.=

278
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:40,892
=run up to the voice of my friend.=

279
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:49,139
=And there, as I turn to her,=

280
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,638
=is always her smiling face,=

281
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:58,448
=where the brightest sun always shines.=

282
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:08,051
=As I walk in the street=

283
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:12,520
=in the freezing winter,=

284
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:18,163
=you encourage me naturally,=

285
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:24,543
=and helped me so many times.=

286
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:31,643
=Like you… Just like you…=

287
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:40,789
=I want to be someone=
=who can give courage to others.=
