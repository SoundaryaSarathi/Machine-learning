00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,786
-We sure have traveled a long way.
-Yeah, we've seen tons of places.

18
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,788
-I wonder where we should go now?
-Pi.

19
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,667
That's easy. We have to go to the next gym
so we can get another badge.

-Well, Fuchsia Gym isn't far from here.
-Where is it?

Uh, over the mountain.

-[Misty] Uh...
-[Ash] Mm...

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,220
-Uh, Brock, over which mountain?
-[Brock] The map says the Fuchsia Gym's

24
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,015
on the other side of one
of those mountains right over there.

Is it this way or that way?
Or maybe it's that way?

Oh, great.

-Okay, I won't tell you.
-Kachu?

Wait a minute.
It looks like there's a road here.

-I'm having some lovely Chinese food.
-It's tea and crumpets for me.

This place looks like a battle zone.

55
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,997
Maybe we're being attacked
by aliens from another planet.

56
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,749
What planet are you from?

Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.

63
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,483
Diglett.

00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,819
Pika.

Are you all right?

70
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,546
It's the Diglett.
They're destroying everything.

Oh, look how cute.

75
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,309
You think they're cute, do you?

76
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,771
Thanks to them
we can't finish building that dam.

77
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,483
[groaning] I hate Diglett! I hate them!

78
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,193
Hmm. Diglett.

79
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,321
[Pokédex] <i>Diglett. The movement</i>
<i>of these ground Pokémon</i>

80
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,991
<i>can be easily detected</i>
<i>by their tracks of upturned earth.</i>

81
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,286
[Ash]
Hmm. I don't see any upturned earth.

82
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,165
That's because the ground here
is covered by concrete,

83
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,167
but if you look closely...

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,421
-They're underneath.
-It looks like a mini-earthquake.

85
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,466
And it looks like we'll never be able
to accomplish our dream

86
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,719
of building the great Giva Dam
here in these mountains.

87
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,846
-Giva Dam?
-Over there.

88
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,973
All right! Let her rip!

89
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,728
That blasting is part of building a dam?

90
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,648
Yes, the blasting
is part of building a dam!

91
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,651
But we can't get supplies through
because of Diglett!

92
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,736
Hmm. That is a problem.

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,993
We even created a special division

94
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,330
for developing strategies
to fight off the Diglett.

95
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,751
We're calling for any able Pokémon trainer
who's traveling through the area,

96
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,588
somebody with real Pokémon know-how
who can help us get rid of these Diglett.

97
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,718
The reward's a six-night, seven-day stay
at the famous Giva Hot Springs Resort.

98
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,886
If you know any Pok--

99
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,973
We're three able Pokémon trainers
at your service.

100
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,351
Oh, so you're the first squad
of the trainers we called in!

101
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,771
[chuckles]
Uh, well, we weren't exactly called in.

102
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,524
The first Pokémon trainers have arrived.

103
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,776
The rest are in these buses.

104
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,240
-It's Gary.
-Huh? Who are...

105
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,578
Well, if it isn't little Ash from Pallet.
What are you doing here?

106
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,914
It must just be an unlucky coincidence.

107
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,250
Only the best were invited,

108
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,297
like me, Gary from the town of Pallet,
the number one trainer.

109
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,260
-Ash is fourth.
-I'm fourth? I'm better than that.

110
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,723
You're the fourth to leave home,
but as a trainer, you're dead last.

111
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,641
Aw!

112
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,854
Now watch as I step up to the plate
and hit a Pokémon grand slam!

113
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,147
Hooray, hooray!

114
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,482
-He's very...
-Detestable.

115
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,278
[Gary] So, Ash, have you picked up
any good Pokémon?

116
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,324
-Of course I have. Do you want to see?
-No, thanks, Ash.

117
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,577
Only amateurs show off their Pokémon.

118
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,789
If I were going to show something off,
it'd be my personal fan club.

00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,087
[Ash groans]

122
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,881
Don't be dumb.

123
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,801
-So who are the girls?
-Oh, they're just my friends of mine.

124
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,470
They're nice friends.

125
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,015
How would you lovely young ladies
like to get together with me sometime?

126
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,976
[all] Yes, sir. That would be fine.

127
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,811
[Brock] Yes, sir?

128
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,105
Brock's over-the-hill already.

129
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,943
Okay, so they think I'm an old man,
but I don't care, I'm desperate.

130
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,278
Could I have somebody's phone number,
please?

131
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,572
Maybe an address? E-mail?

132
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,368
Can we please get back
to the business at hand?

133
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,621
Somebody's got to get rid
of these Diglett.

134
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't forget: a resort vacation.

135
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,542
Don't give it another thought, sir.

136
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,088
Those Diglett are as good as gone
now that Gary Oak is on the case.

137
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,297
So long, losers!

138
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,758

139
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,760
What about those phone numbers?

140
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,722
We're losers?
[groans] I can't let him beat me. I can't.

141
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,560
We're Pokémon trainers, aren't we?
Why don't we try to win that reward?

142
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,021
That's a brilliant idea, Jessie.

143
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,025
If we get rid of the Diglett,
we spend a week at that hot spring resort.

144
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,194
I could use a rest.

145
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,030
I could use a little relaxation myself,
Jessie.

146
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,782
I'll get rid of those Digglet.

147
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,410
Don't forget, James, we're a team.

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,371
You're right. I almost forgot that.

149
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,833
[both] And our team is Team Rocket!

150
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,797
Hello. Uh, I wonder if it's possible
to get traded to a less embarrassing team.

151
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,345
-It sounds like those...
-Aliens are back.

152
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,847
[both groan]

153
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,973
[rumbling]

154
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,271
We greatly appreciate all of you
talented Pokémon trainers

155
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,150
interrupting your training to come here
and help us get rid of the Diglett.

156
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,153
Mm, there sure are a lot of people here.

157
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,030
You, with the Pikachu on your head,

158
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,323
listen with your ears,
not with your mouth!

159
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,160
You'd think the least he could do
is yell at me by name.

160
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,538
Don't be mad.
He doesn't know what your name is.

161
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,208
My name is Ash Ketchum,
the loser from Pallet.

[groans]

163
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,212
Don't listen to Gary.
You can still catch up.

164
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,466
My name's Jessie. Look at all those punks.

165
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,968
Each outfit is more dreadful
than the last.

166
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,555
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Jessie, there's no need to be catty.

167
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,100
-What's wrong with catty?
-I just thought of something.

168
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,313
With this many trainers,
imagine how many Pokémon they must have.

169
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,776
Let's see. If each of them has six,
there'd be six times that many Pokémon.

170
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,237
You can do the math,
I just want to grab all those Pokémon.

171
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,281
It's a Pokémon bonanza.

172
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,200
All we have to do is...

173
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,620
[sighs]
Forget it. Let's just give up now.

174
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,455
James, what's the matter? What's wrong?

175
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,666
How can we possibly defeat
all those Pokémon

176
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,127
-when all we've got are...
-Ekans.

177
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,337
And Koffing.

178
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,381
-Ekans.
-Koffing.

179
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,300
[both groaning]

180
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,052
Another sneak attack.

181
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,305
They've never worked in the past,
have they?

182
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,516
-No.
-How about plan B?

183
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,894
You know what this would mean?

184
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
-Let's try it.
-It's the...

185
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,024
[all]
Principle of induced evolution.

186
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,069
-Ekans.
-Koffing.

187
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,032
Pokémon trainers, here you see Diglett,

188
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,327
the greatest parasitic bug Pokémon
of the century.

189
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,456
Just a minute.
Technically Diglett is not a bug Pokémon.

190
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,085
As a matter of fact, the term mole Pokémon
would be more appropriate.

191
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,630
With a height of eight inches
and a weight of two pounds,

192
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:35,552
they're hardly candidates to be called
the greatest anything of this century.

193
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,264
That showoff thinks he knows everything.

194
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,726
They may seem to be weak,
but together, they can destroy. [gasps]

195
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,355
It's the Diglett! It's the Diglett!

196
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,317
[all] Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig,

197
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,987
-Diglett. Diglett.

<i>Oh, no... ♪</i>

199
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,161
Now everyone will be able to see
the top Pokémon trainer in action.

200
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,246
This should do the trick.

202
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,254
Hey, what?

203
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,388
-It won't come out. What's wrong?
-Pikachu.

00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,396
Wait! This can't happen!

207
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:33,067
Okay, I can take care of this.
I'll just bring out my best Pokémon.

What's going on here?

211
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,748
All right. I'll show them.
I'll use every Pokémon I have.

Please, somebody stop them!
Stop the Diglett!

00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,906
-At least they're polite.
-Yeah and unstoppable.

00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,660
[Ash] Ha! All right. Now it's my turn.

222
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,163
As long as they're underground,
I'm going to use Squirtle.

223
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,374
-I choose you!
-Pika!

224
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,334
I can't stop now!

225
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,507
It almost came out.

226
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,842
-They won't come out.
-Huh?

227
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,720
For some reason, the Pokémon
don't want to battle the Diglett.

228
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,224
-Why wouldn't they battle?
-I just can't figure it out.

229
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,644
-Is that right, Pikachu?
-Pikachu.

230
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,897
You won't get away with this! Go away!

231
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,273
[Gary] That won't work.

232
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:59,821
Diglett can pull their heads in
at 186 282 miles per second.

233
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,365
-What's that?
-The speed of light.

234
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,868
Diglett aren't very strong,
but they can move super-fast.

235
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,204
Wow. You've been studying, huh?

236
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,290
Yeah, I've been studying, unlike you.

237
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,876
Well, that's it. I'm gone.

238
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,713
Look, since no one's Pokémon
will come out and battle,

239
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,007
there's no reason
for any trainers to be here

240
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,342
unless they want
to watch this arcade game.

241
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,678
I, on the other hand,

242
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,682
must continue my journey
to become a Pokémon master.

243
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,936
<i>-Hasta la vista,</i> Poké people.

245
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,775
Good luck!

00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,029
Aah! I don't like him.

Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath.

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,500
-But something doesn't feel quite right.
-Don't complain.

250
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,669
We got into this place for free,
didn't we?

251
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,880
-No, it's not that.
-Then what's wrong?

252
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,592
I can't understand why the Pokémon
wouldn't come out of their Poké Balls.

253
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,055
-Oh, yeah. Why was that, Pikachu?
-Pika. Pika.

shouldn't we put some clothes on first?

257
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,687
Hey, Pikachu.

00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,814

262
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,201
[James]
Some principle of induced evolution.

263
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,372
It says here, "Pokémon need to have
a certain degree of experience points

264
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,248
before they can successfully evolve."

265
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,959
[James]
Our experience is nothing but losing.

266
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,628
But here's something to think about.

267
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,591
When they finally do evolve,
Pokémon become entirely different Pokémon.

268
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,386

[Brock] Probably all the forests

00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,227
[Misty] Beautiful gardens
made by these little guys.

301
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,066
And if we complete the dam,

302
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,904
this whole mountain forest
would be completely covered with water.

Then nothing could live here.

306
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,623
[Brock] All of our Pokémon
realized that before we did.

307
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,125
[Misty] That's why none of them
would leave their Poké Balls,

even when their masters ordered them to.

309

still have a lot to learn

334
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,406
Our Ekans has evolved into Arbok!

Arbok!

336
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,289
And Koffing is now Weezing!

Weezing!

338
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,045
Arbok! Maximum power!

339
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,005
Arbok!

340
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,966
-Ah, we can handle this, right?
-Pi.

341
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,010
-Charmander!
-Charmander!

342
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,886
-[Ash] Squirtle!
-Squirtle!

343
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,097
-[Ash] Bulbasaur!
-Bulbasaur!

344
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,933
-Everyone, go!
-Weezing, smog!

345
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,893
Weezing!

346
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,937
Pikachu, use your thunderbolt!

347
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,356
Pikachu!

348
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,942
Arbok! Dive underground!

349
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,944
-Ar!
-[James] Weezing, follow it!

350
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,946
[groans]

351
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,283
-[all Diglett] Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-[all Dugtrio] Trio, trio, trio.

352
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,578
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Trio, trio, trio.

353
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,246
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.

354
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,290
[both] Trio, trio, trio. Huh?

355
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,629
[smacking]

356
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,547
What happened?

357
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,008
-I know what's coming.
-Me too.

358
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,927
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Trio, trio, trio.

359
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,471
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Trio, trio, trio.

360
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,598
[both groan]

361
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,643
[both yell]

362
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,480
-We're surfing.
-Yes, we're curling the shoot.

363
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,439
Cat-a-bunga!

364
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,524
[all] Hang ten, baby, yeah!

365
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,486
-Hey, what's that thing up ahead?
-[both] Huh?

366
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,074
-The dam!
-Maybe it won't hold!

367
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:24,872
[all] It looks like Team Rocket's
busted up again!

368
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,048
Gee, those guys never seem
to catch a break, do they?

369
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,966
And they never learn their lesson.

370
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,929
Not like me.
I definitely learned my lesson.

371
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,641
So our stay wasn't a waste after all.

372
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,685
That's right. And we're in luck.

373
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,896
-Fuchsia Gym's just over those mountains.
-Mm-hm.

374
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,858
[groans]

375
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,238
Ooh!

376
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,616
