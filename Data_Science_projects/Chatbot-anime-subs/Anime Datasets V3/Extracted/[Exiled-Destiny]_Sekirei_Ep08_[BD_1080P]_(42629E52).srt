"Inspection"

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,010
Hurry up, stupid!

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,440
I don't care about crime
prevention or whatever!

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
That has nothing to do with us!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,670
Idiot! Stop shaking.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,740
Wait!

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,180
Run!

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,690
Hey! Wait!

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,290
Don't look back!

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,170
Number 95, Kuno, I presume.

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,170
What is this?

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,510
The Blue Sekirei!

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,510
What did you say?

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,880
Warning. If you go farther,
what waits for you is...

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,850
Haruka-sama, let's go back.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,520
Idiot! What are you saying?
We've already come this far!

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,190
No! This person is bad!

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,190
Hey!

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,530
Please, I beg you! Even you'll get killed!

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,530
Over there!

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,000
Damn!

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,870
They're running away over there!

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,770
Chase them! Chase them!

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,730
They're running away.
They're running away.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,450
Number 104, Haihane...

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,880
I didn't expect the Discipline Squad
to be out in public like this...

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,010
Damn Minaka! He's serious.

Ku-chan, here it comes!

49
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,990
What art thou doing?!

50
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,660
Landlady's orders! Clean well!

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,600
Musubi-chan's wearing swimwear...
I've never seen that before.

52
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,000
Minato...

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What art thou staring at?

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,670
No! I was... ah...

55
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,340
If thou wishest to see
breasts so much, then...

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,640
Thou canst just see mine.

57
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,020
Mine, too!

58
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Um... Ku-chan...
that is... what should I say...

59
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,360
Per-ver-t?

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,690
No! You've got it all wrong!

61
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,360
Everybody, we'll eat soon.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Yes!

63
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,860
Is this...

64
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,370
Matsu-san, meal time.

65
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,140
Yes, I'm coming.

66
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,380
What are you looking at?

67
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,180
MBI's ultra top secret data bank.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,720
Ultra top secret...

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,360
The security was extremely tight,

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,730
but there are a lot of
interesting things to be seen here.

71
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,730
Information on which Sekireis have emerged,
each Ashikabi's detailed personal info...

72
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,060
Plus each Sekirei's win record,
and the losers too...

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,070
That means the Sekireis
whose functions have stopped.

74
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,070
To tell you the truth,
something's bothering me...

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,340
Bothering you?

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,740
"Winner Unidentified"

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,080
"Winner Unidentified"
"Winner unidentified"?

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,450
Even among the Sekireis
who oppose each other,

79
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,420
there's what you could
call an unspoken rule.

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,020
The conqueror who erased
the opponent's Sekirei Symbol

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,760
stays with the loser and guards
her until MBI comes to retrieve her.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,090
It's the minimal courtesy
we show each other in battle.

83
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,930
But whoever defeated this Sekirei

84
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,430
abandoned her lying
at death's door, and left.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,440
I've confirmed another two
Sekireis defeated in the same manner.

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,780
Are you saying that they were
defeated by the same Sekirei?

87
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,440
Likely so.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,110
I can't understand this action at all.

89
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,780
Isn't she just a rude one?

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,120
There's another and more important
reason the winner stays along with the loser.

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,130
That is to let MBI confirm who the winner is.

92
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,130
But leaving without doing so means...

93
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,140
...losing the reason for
the battles among Sekireis.

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,400
This feels quite suspicious, somehow...

95
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,410
Uzume-san, food is served.

96
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,810
Uzume-san!

97
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,680
Uzume-san?

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,190
She isn't here.

99
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,290
"Hiyama-kai Hospital"
She isn't here.

100
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,120
"Hiyama-kai Hospital"

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,090
Chiho...

102
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,450
Thank you, Sahashi-san.
You really helped me.

103
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,110
It's nothing.

104
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,080
Big brother!

105
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,860
What's that, Ku-chan?
Are you a mouse?

106
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,630
You were a wagtail the other day, weren't you?
Did Uzume-san give that to you, too?

107
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,470
Oh my! What a cute mouse!

108
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,070
Those maid uniforms and these...
Why does she own such costumes?

109
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,270
Come to think of it,
I don't know much about Uzume-san.

110
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,080
Are you curious?

111
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,180
Jeez, Sahashi-san.
Boys are all like that.

112
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,450
No! It's nothing romantic
or anything like that!

113
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,280
More like, you're teasing me, aren't you?!

114
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,430
I don't know about the details either,

115
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,030
but I've heard all these
are for only one person.

116
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,230
Only... one?

117
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,180
Listen, listen, Miya!
This was a big hit today!

118
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,740
She was so cute when she smiled!

119
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,520
All she wanted was to see her smile...

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
I heard that person's been
in a hospital for a long time.

121
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,460
And Uzume-san can
see her only occasionally.

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,000
Is that person... her Ashikabi?

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,370
I don't know.

124
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,870
But I know how strong
the bond between them is.

125
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,870
The bond...

126
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,880
Well, I'd better start preparing for dinner.

127
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,400
It's about the time the shoppers are back.

128
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,710
I'm back.

129
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,230
I lost... this is the third consecutive loss...

130
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,230
W-Welcome back.

131
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,230
For now, the bond between Sekireis
is the problem more than anything.

132
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,770
I won!

133
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,570
Damn! If this were a battle
of skills, I'd never lose to thee!

134
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,330
But a loss is a loss.

135
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,110
Um... I...

136
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,580
What?!

137
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,670
Um... I have something
to talk to all of you about.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,160
I have to head back soon.

139
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm sorry...

140
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,260
Uzume-chan?

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,270
Oops, did I wake you up?

142
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,270
Don't do anything strange.

143
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,270
When did you get here?

144
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,940
Just a little while ago.

145
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Uzume-chan, were you crying?

146
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,610
Of course not! See?

147
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,610
I'm sorry...

148
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,890
I'm your Ashikabi,
but I can't do anything for you...

149
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,050
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,290
It is fine as long as you are alive.

151
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,420
It's just fine...

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,570
"Keep Out"
"Secret Meeting in Progress"

153
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,640
"Keep Out"
"Secret Meeting in Progress"
So, as you now know, some
dangerous Sekireis are out there...

154
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
So, as you now know, some
dangerous Sekireis are out there...

155
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,310
He's right.

156
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,640
Safe is better than sorry,

157
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,310
so try not to be conspicuous
as much as possible, and...

158
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,810
And so...

159
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,320
Ah... are you listening?

160
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,990
Despicable! How dare they
defile the sacred Sekirei battle!

161
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,150
That person must be strong!
I definitely want to fight her!

162
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,600
I said it's dangerous...

163
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,800
No, Ku-chan!
Don't you get fired up too!

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
The master who can't even control his pawns.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,010
It's not a laughing matter, is it?!

166
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm worried you guys
might get hurt or something!

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Well, I think you don't need to worry.
If things get bad, we can just run away.

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,350
Matsu-san, you're so irresponsible...

169
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,080
How could you say that?!
As a strategist, I'm...

170
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,030
Did talking to those two
have the opposite effect?

171
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,520
I know how strong the bond is...

172
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,130
The bond, huh?

173
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
W-What is it?!

174
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,710
Tsukiumi?

175
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,250
Um... well...

176
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,050
Art thou worrying about me?

177
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,620
I'm asking if thou art worried about me?!

178
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,220
I'm worrying! I'm worrying!

179
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,390
I see...

180
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,200
It's not bad to be worried about by thee...

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,430
Huh?

182
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,300
I've never noticed Tsukiumi is...
this beautiful...

183
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,080
W-What art thou staring at?

184
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
I'm sorry!

185
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,750
In any case...

186
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,090
There's no need to worry.

187
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,620
I am the strongest.

188
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,560
I see.
This feeling is the same as I felt before.

189
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,160
Right!

190
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,570
It's the sense of reassurance
I felt from Musubi-chan.

191
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,440
What art thou laughing at?!

192
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Can't you at least say I'm smiling, please?

193
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,900
At any rate, thou shan't need to worry.

194
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,650
Even though they are so different...

195
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,980
Is this because she's also my Sekirei?

196
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,490
Ah, Minato-san.

197
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,800
M-Musubi-chan?!

198
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,470
Yes?

199
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,370
How long have you been there?

200
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,470
I just got here.

201
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,340
Dinner is ready, so I came to get you.

202
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,670
Ah... I see...

203
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,480
I didn't do anything to hide...

204
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,410
No, I didn't...

205
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,440
A soap opera, soap opera...

206
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,160
The hairs just stood up
on the back of my neck...

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,260
Dark... something
vicious and dark was just there...

208
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,300
Is it about time for dinner?

209
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,630
Oh, Uzume-tan, when did you get back?

210
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,170
Just a while ago.

211
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,170
You've been out often recently.

212
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,170
My jobs keep me busy.

213
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm so hungry!
What's for dinner today?

214
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,340
Blood?

215
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,860
Got it?
We shall be busy starting tomorrow.

216
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,190
Yes! Let's do our best!

217
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,860
Would you mind if I come in?

218
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Uzume-san! Of course not!

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,940
Oops! Did I get this when I changed?

220
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,210
Uzume-san, I'll wash your back.

221
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,270
Ah, oh... yup.

222
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,950
Thou dost not get it at all.

223
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,890
The real wife is me!
The rest of ye are mistresses!

224
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,350
I'm his real wife, too!

225
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,220
It's a matter of order!

226
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,760
Listen.
There were once Shogunate harems,

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,230
and only the top woman was the
real wife in that inner palace, and...

228
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,900
Minato-san doesn't have
his hair tied up in a topknot!

229
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm not talking about
Japanese samurai shows!

230
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,740
You guys are so funny.

231
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,910
I wish we could be like this forever...

232
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,910
Acting silly here, getting scolded by Miya...

233
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,850
Why art thou saying such soft things?

234
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,250
Thou hast thy own Ashikabi.

235
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,740
So thou might have to fight us someday.

236
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,590
That's right! We've gotta fight someday.

237
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,790
Uzume-san?

238
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,210
Number 04? The one who killed
Mitsuha was the Black Sekirei?

239
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,280
Yes, there's no mistake.

240
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,620
I confirmed.

241
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,950
The Discipline Squad...
Why did they mess with my possession?

242
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,620
Members of the Discipline Squad
are also participants in this game.

243
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,190
They don't need any excuses.

244
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,960
Mutsu, what is the
Sekirei with that woman doing?

245
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,300
You mean number 107?

246
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Akitsu is keeping an eye on him.
He doesn't seem to have emerged yet.

247
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,830
We have to make up for
what we've lost, don't we?

248
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,880
Meal's ready.

249
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,940
Ah, yes!

250
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,420
Here!

251
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,000
Ah, by the way!

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,670
Shiina, you said you're
looking for somebody, didn't you?

253
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,730
Yes.

254
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,460
If you don't mind,
would you tell me about that?

255
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Your younger sister?

256
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,110
Her name is Ku.

257
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,040
I've been looking for her for a long time,

258
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,210
and when I went to town,
that person with whips chased me.

259
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,650
That's when I passed by, huh?

260
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,760
OK! Let's look for her! I'll help you out.

261
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,260
See, I have an older brother, too.

262
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,830
An older brother?

263
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:13,430
Yup! When I was little, he always
came to get me whenever I was crying.

264
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,040
When I couldn't get down from a tall tree

265
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,580
or when I got lost in a dark forest...

266
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,380
Yukari! There you are!

267
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,050
Here! Come on!

268
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,720
Even though he was afraid of
tall trees and dark places, too.

269
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,390
He always gave me a
piggyback ride when we went home.

270
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,690
I still remember his warm back.

271
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,400
But he's now a wimpy loser, though.

272
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:57,810
So I'm sure that Ku-chan is waiting
for her big brother just as I did... definitely.

273
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,420
I hope Ku's met somebody like that.

274
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,350
Just like I met you.

275
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,020
Yup! I hope so, too.

276
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,690
OK, we'll go out to search
for Ku-chan starting tomorrow!

277
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,020
Yes!

278
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,070
"Hiyama-kai Hospital"

279
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,110
Thank you for your hard work.

280
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,450
I heard you killed almost
instantly again the other day.

281
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,820
I suppose that's what we should expect

282
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,450
from the Sekirei who received
Takehito Asama's personal attention.

283
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,460
Mr. Higa thinks highly of you.

284
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,130
Cut the crap. What's the next target?

285
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,060
Number 95, Kuno.

286
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,230
This Sekirei's power is bit special...

287
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,860
Doesn't matter.

288
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Please keep in mind

289
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,470
that your Ashikabi
doesn't have much time left.

290
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,500
I know.

291
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,090
Let's go!

292
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,920
Yes!

293
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,490
A-Are you really going out to
exterminate that dangerous Sekirei?

294
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,830
Of course we are! I, Tsukiumi, will not
forgive the bastard who defiles our battle!

295
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,840
This case doesn't
seem to need the Guardian.

296
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,830
But before that...

297
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,470
Water Celebration!

298
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,130
Thou hast passed.
I'll leave my back for thee to protect!

299
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,530
What? What was that?

300
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,530
A secret between a woman and a woman.

301
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,200
Yes!

302
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,530
- Minato-san, we will go now!
- Minato, we shall go now!

303
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,560
Ah, yes.

304
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,710
Kuno, hurry!

305
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,870
Please wait, Haruka-sama!

306
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,870
Idiot! You're so incompetent.
Stop falling like a fool.

307
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,550
My name's "Kuno," not "Idiot"!

308
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,620
Here! Hurry up!

309
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,780
Haruka-sama...

310
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,560
Rats! She caught up!

311
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,230
Ashikabi, step aside.
I don't want to hurt humans.

312
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,570
How can I leave my girl
and run away, you dumb shit?!

313
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,840
Then I'll send you to
the grave together at least.

314
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
Kuno!

315
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,590
What?

316
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,820
Let's go there, Tsukiumi-san!

317
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,930
Did you see Kuno's deadly skill,
the "Screaming Sob"?

318
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,300
Haruka-sama, that name is so lame...

319
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,070
Oh crap! It didn't work!

320
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,620
Number 09, Tsukiumi!
Fight me fair and square!

321
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,580
Number 88, Musubi!
Pleased to meet you!

322
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,390
Why are these two?

323
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,170
Who are these guys?

324
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,230
Thou! Stop hiding thy face with clothes,
and declare thy number and name!

325
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,580
Unable to identify thyself?
Suspicious, indeed.

326
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,980
A strong opponent!
A strong opponent!

327
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,650
We hear that recently a reprehensible
Sekirei has been haunting the capital

328
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:01,320
who fights without identifying herself and
abandons her opponent even if she is dying.

329
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,860
It is thee, is it not?

330
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,390
Not yet... I don't want to fight them yet!

331
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,830
If thou canst not identify thyself,
I will strip those veils!

332
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,940
I don't know what's going on,
but let's use this chance and run!

333
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,000
I-I can't stand up.

334
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,350
What is this woman?

335
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,380
She stinks like alcohol...

336
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,490
I don't like this...

337
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

338
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is renai no shinansho

339
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, aserazu so

340
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without furaingu de show time

341
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,480
Get the funky beat!

342
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,960
Hayai mono gachi?

343
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,090
Kono bayai wa kankei nai nai
