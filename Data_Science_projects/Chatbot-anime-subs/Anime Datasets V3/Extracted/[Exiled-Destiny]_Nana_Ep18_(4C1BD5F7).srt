1
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:08,271
At the time, three years after their debut,

2
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:12,031
Trapnest had reached a million in sales,
both in the singles and album charts.

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,911
Their vocalist, Reira, was
in a class of her own

4
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:19,001
with a voice quality and range exceptional
for a Japanese singer.

5
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:22,081
Ren wrote almost all of their songs.

6
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,011
That day, for all two hours of the show,

7
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,521
my eyes were on Ren the whole time
as if he was performing on his own.

8
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,361
I kept sending him telepathic waves

9
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:43,431
hoping that he would
sense Nana's presence.

10
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:51,901
At times I felt Ren was looking
this way,

11
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:58,881
but in an instant his eyes
would wander off elsewhere.

12
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,851
When I was darkness at that time

13
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,691
With trembling lips

14
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,781
In a corner of a room I cry

15
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,861
The more I struggle

16
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,701
The more this wound deepens

17
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,861
The broken promise hurt me

18
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,601
Nobody can save me

19
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,781
God, I have only one request

20
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:01,401
Stop tearing apart my love

21
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,751
I need your love

22
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,981
I'm a broken rose

23
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,921
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

24
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,091
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

25
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,861
I need your love

26
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,161
I'm a broken rose

27
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:22,101
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

28
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:26,061
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

29
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,031
I wanna need your love

30
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,271
I'm a broken rose

31
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:34,601
I wanna need your love

32
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:30,371
Is he unreachable?
After coming all the way here?

33
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,911
Thank you very much.

34
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:29,531
Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

35
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:33,101
The fans were great today.
They were really into our performance.

36
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,121
Is this their national identity?

37
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:38,461
You mean prefectural identity.
We're not on a world tour.

38
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,741
Please, don't bother talking to
the audience on stage, Naoki.

39
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,041
It exposes your lack of intelligence.

40
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,211
Let's add songs to our encore.

41
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,011
Two more songs don't feel like enough.

42
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,051
But we haven't rehearsed any others.
Don't be ridiculous.

43
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,621
That'll be impossible.
We're approaching our time limit here.

44
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,921
We're not renting this hall
for free, you know.

45
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,281
For a manager,
you can be real stingy, Take.

46
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:02,851
Reira, you shouldn't talk either.

47
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,301
Hey, Ren, you know you made
a mistake in the second song.

48
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,841
You might've thought
you got away with it,

49
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,741
but that was pretty obvious...

50
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,271
Where are you going, Ren?

51
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,141
Toilet!

52
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,171
Where'd he make a mistake?
I didn't notice anything.

53
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,911
So even Ren can make a mistake,
I guess.

54
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:28,311
Notice it, damn it.
What is it with our band members?

55
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:34,591
Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

56
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:39,131
Hasn't Ren noticed that you're here?

57
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,631
He's not likely able to see
the audience at all with all those spotlights.

58
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,531
Really?

59
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,771
Well, I can't speak from experience.

60
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,761
I've never performed on
a stage this big.

61
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,411
No way! He cannot see us?

62
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:52,081
Maybe. But we're sitting in the first row.
Can't he see a little?

63
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,141
Oh, this may be a trap set up
by the Demon Lord.

64
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:59,081
It must feel really good,
singing in such a big place.

65
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,181
You'll be able to...

66
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:08,751
Being you, Nana, I'm sure you will.

67
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,901
The band BLAST will surpass Trapnest!

68
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:26,641
Yes.

69
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,131
Yasu, Nana's here!

70
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,681
Right. Is the concert over already?

71
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,551
It's not over.
We're about to go out for the encore.

72
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,251
Well, good luck with that.

73
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,251
You knew about this, didn't you?
Why didn't you tell me?

74
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,021
I wanted it to be a surprise.

75
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:44,461
Then you succeeded.
I even made a mistake on stage.

76
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,721
Although I faked it with
a little rearrangement.

77
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:49,171
Really? That's even more
than I could've asked for.

78
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,471
It's not a laughing matter!

79
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,641
If it were in Tokyo, that's one thing,

80
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,411
but what's she doing here
out in the country?

81
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,671
Not to mention the front row.

82
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,971
Then jump off the stage and embrace her.

83
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,511
You can't expect me to do that!

84
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:02,481
Ren! What are you shouting about?

85
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,481
Don't lose it yet, we're not done
with the performance!

86
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:05,971
We're going out for the encore!

87
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:10,751
Go. I'll email you the cell number
of the girl Nana's with.

88
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,561
If you wanna see Nana, call that number.

89
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:20,531
How can I face her after
what happened?

90
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,861
I'm tired of hearing you say that.
You can be such a drag sometimes.

91
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:31,671
If you don't intend to see her...

92
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,071
I'll take Nana for myself.

93
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,911
Ren, we're going!

94
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:53,761
Welcome home.
You must be hungry.

95
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,791
Dinner is ready.

96
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,801
They played two songs for the encore.

97
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,531
Ren didn't glance over this way
even once.

98
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:11,081
This is making me really nervous,
having a meal with such a cute girl.

99
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,201
A cute girl?

100
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,511
What are you saying, dad?
You perverted old man.

101
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:19,751
What! You're one to talk,
with that Tarzan outfit.

102
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,791
- Tarzan?
- Go back to the jungle!

103
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,691
It was as if I had awakened
from a dream.

104
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,901
We were reminded once and for all
that Ren is now a superstar

105
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:35,271
and out of our reach.

106
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,331
It made me feel miserable.

107
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,981
That was refreshing.

108
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,811
The bath's available if
you wanna take a bath, Nana.

109
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,251
I left towels out for you.

110
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,941
Sure. Thanks.

111
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,481
Oh, darn! I forgot to switch it back on.

112
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,591
YASU

113
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,621
YASU
Yasu?

114
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:24,021
YASU

115
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,561
That's unusual. What could it be?

116
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,891
Ren might be giving you a call.

117
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:43,371
Nana! Big news!

118
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,581
You know, you shouldn't barge
in like that while someone's taking a bath...

119
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:47,941
But this really is big news!

120
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,381
Another murder somewhere?

121
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,511
No! Look here!
Yasu sent me an e-mail!

122
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,011
Yasu?

123
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,721
I'm sorry, Nana. I had forgotten
to switch my phone back on.

124
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,991
Because it had to be switched off
while at the concert hall?

125
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,531
It's past midnight.
He may have tried to call.

126
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,331
What's the meaning of this?
Why would Yasu?

127
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,591
I don't know.
Maybe Yasu gave Ren my number.

128
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:10,931
But Ren was unreachable, wasn't he?

129
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,331
I don't really understand,
but what should we do?

130
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,201
Call Yasu.

131
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,751
- Hello.
- Hello, Yasu. It's me.

132
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:35,521
Hello, Nana. Sorry about giving out
your number without asking.

133
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,721
No problem.

134
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,121
Did Ren call?

135
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,161
I'm not sure.

136
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,261
Huh? Did you check
your missed calls?

137
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,531
I forgot to turn the phone back
on after the concert.

138
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,471
- What?
- I wonder if Ren's already called.

139
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,671
Who knows?

140
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,361
What'll I do?

141
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,411
Just wait and I'm sure he'll call again.

142
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:53,501
Really?

143
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:57,011
Probably. I provoked him a bit.

144
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,881
Don't joke around, baldy!

145
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,881
I don't know what you told Ren,
but mind your own business.

146
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,451
I have nothing to say to him
at this point.

147
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,191
Well, let me make one thing clear.

148
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:12,651
It was he who called me after noticing you
at the concert hall.

149
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:15,861
I just gave him the phone number.

150
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,991
If you have nothing to say to him,
tell him that directly.

151
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,511
If you have no need for the key to
the place you and Ren used to live,

152
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:27,441
and the key to the padlock
around Ren's neck, just get rid of them.

153
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,241
That would put an end to everything.

154
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,421
Put yourself in his shoes.

155
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:35,411
He's bound by a woman
he can never have again.

156
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:52,371
I understand.
Give me Ren's cell number.

157
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,541
I'm not the type to just sit around
and wait.

158
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:06,381
FROM: YASU
GOOD JOB
NANA KOMATSU'S NUMBER

159
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:11,651
If you don't intend to see her,
I'll take Nana for myself.

160
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,831
Ren!

161
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:41,451
Hey, give me one too.

162
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,811
Come on.

163
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,291
Oh, never mind.

164
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,091
I can't sleep so I'm going
to Takumi's room to play cards.

165
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,261
Wanna come?

166
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,591
Cards again?

167
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:54,091
Yes. We're playing Shichi Narabe again.

168
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,631
Not the image of rock musicians, is it?

169
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,971
I'm fine. I'll pass.

170
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,401
Being a rock musician and all.

171
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:05,871
Let's play! It's no fun without you.

172
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,311
Takumi, Naoki and Take
are all lousy players.

173
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:13,151
It's no fun winning all the games.

174
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:17,481
Sorry, but I'm really tired.
I'm going to bed. Good night.

175
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:20,721
Is that so? Darn.

176
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:23,721
Reira.

177
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:24,761
Huh?

178
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,991
Your voice is a bit rough. You okay?

179
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:33,031
Let's do our best, okay? Sixteen to go.

180
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:08,231
Who is it?

181
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,361
Nana.

182
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:20,081
What a way to greet me.
You seem to be well.

183
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,921
I have something to talk to you about.
Can we meet now?

184
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:29,591
Sure.

185
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,021
Where are you now?

186
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,791
In my hotel room.

187
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:33,831
Alone?

188
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:34,761
Yeah.

189
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,031
Would it be unwise for me to go there?

190
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,161
No.

191
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,431
If you'd rather meet me
outside somewhere, just tell me where.

192
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,501
No, that would be less convenient.

193
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,641
It doesn't look like
I'll be able to leave here.

194
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,341
Then I'm coming right now.

195
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,841
What hotel and what's the room number?

196
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,741
So many fans...

197
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:22,951
They've found out where
the band's staying.

198
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:24,241
No wonder he can't go out.

199
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:55,801
What does Nana plan to do
once she meets Ren?

200
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,811
What's she gonna tell him?

201
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,911
Nana's really stubborn,
which worries me.

202
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,391
I'm so worried it's not likely
I'll get any sleep.

203
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,511
Good job.

204
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:32,101
Are you a staff member?

205
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,241
Show me your pass.

206
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:40,521
Oh, my pass? It must be tough,
having to check passes here as well.

207
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:46,661
Oh? I think I left it in my room.
I'll go get it.

208
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,161
This area is off limits to the public.

209
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,661
It's a real problem.

210
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,441
Do you have any idea

211
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:56,171
how much trouble obsessed fans
like you cause the band members?

212
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:58,141
I'm not really a fan!

213
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,931
Now go on. Go on home.

214
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,741
I asked that girl to come.

215
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,111
Please let her through.
Here's a little payment to keep it a secret.

216
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,381
Oh, is that so? Well, sorry 'bout that.

217
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:35,411
The security's really tight.
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have come.

218
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,551
Ren...

219
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:50,991
Let me go!

220
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,121
I have no intention of getting back
together with you!

221
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,131
I wanted to see you.

222
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,351
I shouldn't have come.

223
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,951
You're ingenious, Yasu.

224
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:30,201
Knowing Nana, naturally she's gonna feel
the need to give the keys back to Ren

225
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:31,391
after what you told her.

226
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:32,761
Hey, I'll take that! Pon.

227
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:35,771
But if she gives him the keys,
it would be over between them?

228
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,711
If she really wanted to end it with him,

229
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,441
she wouldn't go through the trouble of
meeting him just to hand over some keys.

230
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,151
It just gives them
an excuse to meet.

231
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,511
They're man and woman.
Let that take care of the rest.

232
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:49,481
Shin, not that I care,
but you've been acting saucy lately.

233
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,351
Don't be so snobbish.

234
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,151
- Oh, that's Ron for me!
- Huh?!

235
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,381
Did I win?

236
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,091
He's good.

237
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:59,821
You tricked me.
You are so not cute.

238
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:02,061
Mahjongg is so much fun.

239
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,861
Next time we should play
with four people.

240
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,501
Does Nana play too?

241
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,901
Yeah. We used to play
a four-person game a lot

242
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,341
when Ren was around.

243
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,671
Say, let's ask Ren over next time.

244
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,841
Really? I can meet Ren?!
I wanna see him!

245
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,471
I wanna see him too!

246
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:20,341
Why is it you're always
secretly meeting Ren behind my back?

247
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,521
I'm always left out.

248
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:25,021
Ren doesn't have the guts
to see you.

249
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,121
Huh?

250
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,591
So he feels guilty about leaving BLAST.

251
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:34,221
He initially declined Trapnest's offer,
you know.

252
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,791
Then Takumi gave me a call.

253
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:40,801
I was the one who persuaded Ren
to join.

254
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:45,111
Still, he feels that he betrayed us.

255
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,501
There's no need for him to fuss over
something that happened in the past.

256
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,141
It doesn't suit him.

257
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,341
But that's Ren for you.

258
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,691
Can a guy so awkward with people

259
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,711
really make it
in the brutal world of entertainment?

260
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,451
It worries me.

261
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,591
Well, in that case,
why don't I send him an email?

262
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,791
An invitation to
a mahjongg tournament.

263
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:07,731
Yay!

264
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:09,361
He'll be so happy that he'll cry.

265
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:12,501
By the way, Yasu, you said
you provoked Ren on the phone.

266
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,101
I reached into the sky
By the way, Yasu, you said
you provoked Ren on the phone.

267
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:14,171
I reached into the sky

268
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,171
I reached into the sky
What did you say?

269
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:15,341
I reached into the sky

270
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:17,541
I reached into the sky
What tactics did you use?
Tell me so I can learn for myself.

271
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:17,611
What tactics did you use?
Tell me so I can learn for myself.

272
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:18,411
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
What tactics did you use?
Tell me so I can learn for myself.

273
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:18,841
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

274
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,211
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
I don't really have any tactics.

275
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:21,581
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

276
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,781
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
Can't you tell the level of my stupidity?

277
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:23,881
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

278
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,051
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
But you're really smart! Unlike Nobu.

279
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:24,211
But you're really smart! Unlike Nobu.

280
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:26,181
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky
But you're really smart! Unlike Nobu.

281
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,051
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

282
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,451
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky
It's not about how smart I am.

283
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:29,391
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

284
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,791
Like colorful balloons

285
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,861
Like colorful balloons
You still have a lot to learn.

286
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,381
Like colorful balloons

287
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,491
I'm alone

288
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:41,201
My hand had no place to go

289
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:41,261
My hand had no place to go
Back then, I thought I'd never
wanna fall in love again.

290
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:41,401
Back then, I thought I'd never
wanna fall in love again.

291
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:45,801
And gently you took it
Back then, I thought I'd never
wanna fall in love again.

292
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,871
And gently you took it

293
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:47,901
And gently you took it
But that night, I wanted to dream again.

294
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:47,971
But that night, I wanted to dream again.

295
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:49,041
Starless night
But that night, I wanted to dream again.

296
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,211
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past
But that night, I wanted to dream again.

297
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,281
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past
I wanted to love someone
from the bottom of my heart,

298
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:53,481
I wanted to love someone
from the bottom of my heart,

299
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:55,511
I want to feel your warmth
I wanted to love someone
from the bottom of my heart,

300
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:56,081
I want to feel your warmth

301
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,051
I want to feel your warmth
no matter how I may get hurt,
no matter how I may suffer.

302
00:20:59,551 --> 00:20:59,651
That's what I felt that night, Nana,
while praying for your happiness.

303
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:00,921
Tears are falling down
That's what I felt that night, Nana,
while praying for your happiness.

304
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:05,061
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go
That's what I felt that night, Nana,
while praying for your happiness.

305
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:05,091
That's what I felt that night, Nana,
while praying for your happiness.

306
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:06,161
Of your hand holding mine
That's what I felt that night, Nana,
while praying for your happiness.

307
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,091
Of your hand holding mine

308
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,631
Starless night

309
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:13,761
Even if your lips spill weak words

310
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:19,831
I want to believe in your warmth

311
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,241
Endless love

312
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:25,371
I even love your contradictions

313
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:40,621
You are my shining star
