out in the middle of nowhere like this.

That Vulpix for my Psyduck?

No way.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,328
It wouldn't take much time to brush
'cause Psyduck only has three hairs.

any old houses like this still existed.

171
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,564
-Well, at least we're in the right place.
-[beeping]

172
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,400
[Meowth]
So that's the famous ninja mansion.

173
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,613
Well, I for one am not impressed.
It looks like a Japanese restaurant.

174
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,908
There are lots of precious
poisonous Pokémon in that mansion.

175
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,744
Then let's figure a way
to bust into this ninja joint,

176
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,121
snatch the poison Pokémon
and hit the road.

177
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:45,418
Poisonous Pokémon are positively perfect
for perfidious people like us.

178
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,089
-What does that mean?
-It means beautiful things can be painful.

179
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,466
Ow. That hurt.

180
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,301
-Let's go.
-Ooh!

181
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,095
Well, that's fine with me.

182
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,848
We were looking for Fuchsia Gym,
and now I'll win one of your badges.

183
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,645
[Koga] This soul badge will be yours
if you defeat me, of course.

184
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,064
All right, let's battle.

185
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,528
We shall have two-on-two Pokémon battle,
young man.

186
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,156
That's fine with me.
I'll start with Pidgeotto!

187
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,200
Then I shall lead with Venonat.

188
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
[squawks]

189
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,707
[laughs] Guess I'll just have to beat
this Venonat, too.

190
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,420
[laughs] This Venonat
has a great deal more experience.

191
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,385
-[Ash gasps]
-Venomoth! Venomoth! Venomoth!

192
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,471
-A metamorphosis attack?
-No, it just evolved.

193
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,642
[Pokédex]
<i>Venomoth. An evolved form of Venonat.</i>

194
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,478
<i>Tiny scales on its wings</i>
<i>disperse various spores</i>

195
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,021
-<i>when they are flapped.</i>
-Uh-oh.

196
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,316
-Venomoth, stun spore.
-Venomoth!

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,694
-Pidgeotto, whirlwind!
-[screams]

198
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,491
-Pidgeotto!
-Venomoth, release your sleep powder.

199
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,411
[shrieking]

200
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,832
Oh. Pidgeotto, return.

201
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,002
Charmander, go!

202
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,047
Venomoth, stun spore.

203
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,384
-Charmander! Flamethrower!
-Char!

204
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,931
Great job, Charmander.

205
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,767
Huh? What's that?

206
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,275
[both]
Welcome to the show.

207
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,860
What's going on here?

208
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,197
[Jessie]
Now let our ancient performance begin.

209
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,994
Prepare for trouble.

210
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:48,041
[James grunting rapidly]
Make it double.

211
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,500
[rapid grunting]

212
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,212
To protect the world from devastation.

213
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,716
To unite all peoples within our nation.

214
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,012
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

215
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,974
To extend our reach to the stars above.

216
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,684
-Jessie.
-James.

217
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,606
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

218
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:16,235
Surrender now or prepare.
Prepare to fight.

219
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,862
Meowth. That's right.

220
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,283
Now step aside while we pick up
all your pretty little poisonous Pokémon.

221
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,079
-Forget it, Meowth.
-[groaning]

222
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,624
Jessie, it's too hard to move
in these costumes.

223
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,377
A ninja mansion calls for a kabuki star.

224
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,796
-We have to wear these outfits.
-Yes, but--

225
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,423
If you can't move, we'll lose the Pokémon.

226
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,092
You're right. Let's change.

227
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,557
[grumbling]

228
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,059
We'll have to join forces

229
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
-to vanquish them.
-Right.

230
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,562
-Charmander, go!
-Char!

231
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,856
-Go, Venomoth.
-Go, Venonat.

232
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,401
Step right up. Ha!

233
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,777
[all screaming]

234
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,779
-Huh?
-Oh.

235
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,031
-Ah, Pikachu.
-Pika!

236
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,951
-You're in the way.
-[screaming]

237
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,453
-Pika.
-Pikachu!

238
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,832
-Pika, pi!-
We need you now, Starmie!

239
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,918
Psyduck.

240
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,797
-Psyduck! You're not Starmie!
-Psy?

241
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,676
[groans] This time I'll choose Staryu.

242
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,927
Psy?

243
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,805
You're Psyduck, not Staryu.
Don't you understand?

244
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,600
[grumbles] Fine, then.
Go if you want to.

245
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,521
-Psyduck. Psy.
-[groaning]

246
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,691
-Psy!
-Psyduck, you're driving me crazy!

247
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,193
Psy-i-i-i.

248
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,572
-Psyduck. Psyduck.
-What attacks can Psyduck do?

249
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,657
Here, ask Dexter.

250
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>Psyduck's attacks are, one, tail whip.</i>

251
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,080
Psyduck. Tail whip attack now!

252
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,502
-Psyduck. Psyduck. Psy...
-[all groan]

253
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,839
How can you call that lame tail wag
an attack?

254
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,507
It must have other attacks.

255
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,136
<i>Psyduck attacks. Number two: scratch.</i>

256
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,015
-All right, Psyduck. Scratch attack now!
-Psyduck.

257
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,309
Psy. [grunting]

258
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,522
Psy.

259
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,776
Psy!

260
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,570
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

261
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,948
What a totally pathetic Pokémon.

262
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,410
-Now it's giving me a headache.
-I think I have a way out of this.

263
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,084
-[both] Huh?
-What are they?

264
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,586
I don't know what they are,
but they're in the way.

265
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,171
[grunts]

266
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,341
[squeaking]

267
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,593
This is a nice little catch.

268
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,053
I don't know what these things are,

269
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,305
but I can use them
to practice my bowling game.

270
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,392
[whimpering] That's a Voltorb!

271
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,227
A Voltorb?

272
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
-Voltorb.
-Ah!

273
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,319
[all coughing]

274
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,987
-Ah!
-Hey, Brock.

275
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,574
Do you notice anything weird
about this room?

276
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,036
The walls, the beams, the ceiling,
they're all on a slant.

277
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,456
This is a slanted room
to confuse our enemies.

278
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,626
[groaning]

279
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,670
-No good. I can't get it off.
-Char.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,005
How about your electric attack, Pikachu?

281
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,675
-Kachu!
-Char.

282
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,634
Pikachu.

283
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,929
This gunk isn't affected by electricity.

284
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,180
-[low rumbling]
-Huh?

285
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,393
There you are.

286
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,980
For some reason
I seem to be losing my liqui-ebrium.

287
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,523
[both]
Whoa!

288
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,486
They built this place like a fun house.
The floor is slanted.

289
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,530
Maybe they'll have some fun
with this Voltorb.

290
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,240
Voltorb.

291
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,284
[all scream]

292
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,036
[grunts] Pikachu! Electric attack now.

293
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,497
Pika, pika.

294
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,790
Oh, I forgot.

295
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,626
What's with this loser Pokémon?

296
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,213
Psyduck, you're just
going to get hurt out there. Return!

297
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,341
[groans]

298
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,051
Psy-i-i-i!

299
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,428
[grunts]

300
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,264
You're in the way!

301
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,640
[gibbers angrily]

302
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,561
-Let's snatch this Pokémon, too.
-We don't need Pokémon like that.

303
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,772
[gibbers angrily]

304
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,901
Even rejected by Team Rocket.

305
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,236
It looks like its headache's
getting worse.

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,240
-Uh, look. You come here right now.
-Huh?

307
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,995
[screams]

308
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,124
-Ah! What's...? What's happening?
-I... I'm frozen. I can't move!

309
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,336
Hey, this must be one Psyduck's attacks.

310
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,507
[Pokédex]
<i>Psyduck's attacks. Number three: disable.</i>

311
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,676
[whimpering]

312
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,305
[Pokédex]
<i>Psyduck's attacks. Number four: confusion.</i>

313
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,851
[all screaming]

314
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,854
-Psyduck's attacks are pretty good.
-Yeah.

315
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,858
-You're right.
-[all screaming]

316
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,027
This place looks a lot nicer from the air.

317
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,446
And what else it looks like--

318
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,201
[all] Team Rocket's blasting off again!

319
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,744
Psy.

320
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,539
[whimpering]

321
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,875
-Pika.
-Char!

322
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,835
[groans and Brock sighs]

323
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,338
And you had that kind of power all along?

324
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,801
[Pokédex] <i>When Psyduck's headache</i>
<i>becomes severe, it uses amazing power.</i>

325
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,470
Psy-i-i-duck.

326
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,765
-That kind of talent's a real pain.
-Oh, yeah.

327
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,435
Magnificent.
That was quite an impressive display.

328
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,604
I was very impressed by your performance.

329
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,150
Young lady, would you consider
trading your Psyduck for my Venomoth?

330
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,319
I'd gladly trade for my Venonat.

331
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,824
Well, I wouldn't trade Psyduck
for any Pokémon in the world.

332
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,785
Misty, you couldn't wait
to get rid of Psyduck.

333
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,038
A woman's heart
can be a very fickle thing, Ash.

334
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,750
A Pokémon like that would certainly merit
one of our soul badges.

335
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,546
Uh, that's right.
We still haven't finished our match.

336
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,010
The Pokémon I choose for this battle
is Charmander.

337
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,179
And I will choose, Golbat!

338
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,476
-Golbat.
-[sighs] What's that?

339
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,229
[Pokédex]
