1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,930
In the northern area...

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,340
Multiple Ashikabis and
Sekireis are moving suspiciously...

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,170
I see, in the north, huh?

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,180
Red is heading there.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,350
Don't you mind letting Red
have all the fun by herself?

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,950
I'll go, too.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,020
Ah, that's better.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,360
Hey, did the Discipline Squad
exist before I became an Ashikabi?

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,030
Yes, it did. It was only
two of us then, though...

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,040
The Sekirei of Fate, Number 08, Yume.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,710
An individual Sekirei larva was
stolen by underground operatives!

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,670
Retrieve it without fail!

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,710
The Sekirei engine was destroyed.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,650
That chick's done.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,050
My unfulfilled wish...

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,720
I ask you to realize it for me.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,390
Someday, you will spread your wings,

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,400
and meet your destined
one somewhere in this world,

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,590
then fall in love.

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,240
Yume.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,900
You can't mean to...

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,650
Stop messing around!

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,420
Was that other Sekirei strong, then?

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,090
She was in the Discipline Squad...

25
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,760
Yeah, she was strong.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,770
Then it's a shame she's dead.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,770
Yes, it's a shame indeed.

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,300
I was going to kill her with my own hands...

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,940
I wonder if Mu-chan can survive tonight.

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,630
Now my life is blooming then falling

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,640
I grab destiny tight

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,040
There's no more hesitation anymore

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,640
Tying our bond

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,650
To the sky waiting for the dawn

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,480
Holding you, my love, tightly

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
I present an unbreakable prayer

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,860
We all are still in the darkness

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,490
Right now I just

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,490
Want to touch you deep in your heart

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,800
And give you all of my overflowing passion

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,170
I spread out my wings

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,340
Toward the future of our dreams

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,680
On them are engraved

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,680
The feeling you gave me that day

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,180
The words of our oath

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,350
Will make a miracle happen

47
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,360
My pounding heart, take off now!

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,390
My wish can fly high, high up

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,270
Feather 11:
"The Sekirei Symbol Disappears"

50
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,880
Feather 11:
"The Sekirei Symbol Disappears"
Ah, what a pleasant wind!

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,010
Ah, what a pleasant wind!

52
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,220
It's just right for the
romantic departure of the young.

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,890
Are you observing, too?

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,560
As the Guardian of Sekireis,
I'd like to see the whole story

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,890
of this violation of our rule.

56
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,560
Don't you need to help them?

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,230
You seemed to be quite excited last night.

58
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,170
That's because if I
go out to help, I can't watch.

59
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,470
You can't watch?

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,510
That boy...

61
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,570
What will he show me?

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,970
The plan goes like this.

63
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,280
Matsu can only hack the
surveillance satellites for about an hour.

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,870
That means we must be done
within an hour of commencing the plan.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,590
You'll make a fuss at the checkpoint
on the bridge and attract their attention.

66
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,960
"Danger Keep Out"

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,690
"Danger Keep Out"
Meanwhile, we'll hit the
railroad's electric power substation,

68
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,960
Meanwhile, we'll hit the
railroad's electric power substation,

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,630
- This is so boring...
- We have no choice. It's part of the plan.
Meanwhile, we'll hit the
railroad's electric power substation,

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,630
- This is so boring...
- We have no choice. It's part of the plan.
And stop the trains.

71
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,630
Enough to so they can't
resume service for a while.

72
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,970
Take that chance to run
along the rail track to escape.

73
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,660
Five seconds left.

74
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,980
Four.

75
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Three.

76
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Two.

77
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,780
One.

78
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,910
Commence the operation!

79
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,990
Musubi-chan!

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,580
Yes!

81
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,560
Let's go!

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,090
It's time.

83
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,830
Now, go!

84
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,140
Thunderstorm of our pact,
destroy our Ashikabi's misfortune!

85
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,570
God's Song!

86
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,250
What was that?

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,360
What are you doing here so late all alone?

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,030
Where is your mom or dad?

89
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,370
No...

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,370
Wait! She's on the checklist!

91
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,100
She's a Sekirei!

92
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,510
What happened?!

93
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,970
What are these?!

94
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,520
That's amazing, Ku-chan!

95
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,390
Hey!

96
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,720
Yeah?

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,060
This has become a really big deal.

98
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,390
Are you sure it's all right to do this for us?

99
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,060
We no longer have a choice,
now that we've come this far.

100
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,400
Sahashi, you might be an incredible guy.

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,530
What? Why?

102
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,380
They're doing things
in a pretty flashy manner.

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,110
You know what they say: "Fires and
fights are the highlights of the capital."

104
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,090
Oh my!

105
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,550
It appears the winds have changed.

106
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,800
I've just gotten a report that the
surveillance satellite system's gone down.

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,110
It's me.

108
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,770
An explosion at the substation?

109
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,110
Don't panic. Report on the situation!

110
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,780
Excuse me, but I'll contact you later.

111
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,450
The checkpoint at the north block...

112
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,450
What?

113
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,550
...has been taken over by Sekireis.

114
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,460
You bastard, how could you!

115
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,790
You knew it from the start!

116
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,130
Takami-kun, I'm the Game Master.

117
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,800
Games are more exciting when
the players make improvised moves.

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
As the Game Master,

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,330
I have but to enjoy it.

120
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,810
Trains on all the lines have stopped.

121
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,810
Good! How about the checkpoint?

122
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,800
Kusano-tan's
diversionary tactic is also succe...

123
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,620
That's strange.

124
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,420
What's wrong?

125
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,490
The soldiers are moving too fast.

126
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,820
In addition to that, their
numbers are increasing quickly.

127
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,660
Emergency alarm!

128
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,160
Everybody, move away from
where you are immediately!

129
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Move away? To where?

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,500
Wherever you can.

131
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,170
It's likely MBI figured out our plans.

132
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,970
Ku-chan!

133
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,850
It's so exciting, isn't it, Takami-kun?

134
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,200
Shit!

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
They've read our movements, huh?

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,700
We're completely surrounded.

137
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,540
I'll find an escape route right now.

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,870
The three of us can manage somehow.

139
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,870
But... those guys are...

140
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,210
Sorry, our aim was off!

141
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,210
Be careful!

142
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,210
The cell phone's dead!

143
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,880
Anyway, we'll leave here now!

144
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,890
Seo-tan?! Seo-tan! What happened?!

145
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,960
Matsu-san!

146
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
Y-Yes!

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,230
I'm going to help Ku-chan.

148
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,570
Don't be crazy, Mina-tan!

149
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,900
I can't run away leaving Ku-chan behind.

150
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,240
But if the Discipline Squad is there...

151
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,580
Even though you're an Ashikabi,
you'll be killed without any mercy!

152
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,910
Killed?!

153
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,080
Even so, I have to go!

154
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,740
I promised Ku-chan.

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,910
Don't worry. I'm right here.

156
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,730
Please stay with me, big brother.

157
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,320
So I have to go. I'm sorry.

158
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,940
And yet thou hidest thyself in this place...

159
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,200
In the end, thou art the same as those two!

160
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,280
Let's go, Minato-san!

161
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,950
Yeah.

162
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,190
Shigi-kun, go ahead toward the railway bridge.

163
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,150
Matsu-san?

164
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,860
There's a change in the plan.

165
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,960
A change?

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,990
The four of you, continue
forward toward the rail bridge, please.

167
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,830
What do you mean?

168
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,090
Leave Kusano-tan up to me!

169
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,970
Why am I so irritated about this?

170
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,960
It's nothing to do with me.

171
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,730
W-What's going on?!

172
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,990
I, Matsu, will save Kusano-tan without fail!

173
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,260
M-Matsu?!

174
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,560
This sound of exhaust!

175
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,330
Didst thou not say thou
couldst not leave Maison Izumo?!

176
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,340
Mina-tan is... that wimpy Mina-tan is
doing his best, even putting his life at risk.

177
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,470
So even I can take a risk sometimes.

178
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, my, that disturbs the neighbors.

179
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,850
Even armored trucks are
out and around now, huh?

180
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,890
You!

181
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,710
Bummer! There are soldiers all over.

182
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,580
I wonder if the other guys are fine.

183
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,570
Everything rests on their luck, now.

184
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,920
This is the bridge.

185
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,060
Will Ku-chan be all right?

186
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,260
Matsu-san told me she'd save her without fail.

187
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
I believe in her.

188
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,070
Shit!

189
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,170
Is the tear gas ready?

190
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,660
Yes!

191
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,750
Big brother!

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,340
Ready!

193
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,290
Fire! Fire!

194
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,120
Kusano-tan, it's Matsu! Matsu is here for you!

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,110
Maa-chan!

196
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,290
I secured Kusano-tan!

197
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,460
Great...

198
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,130
But wait! Matsu-san,
isn't it bad that you're outside?!

199
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh well, it's too late to back out now.

200
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,010
Now that I've stepped outside,
I won't end up just running away!

201
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,970
Kusano-tan, please go all-out!

202
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,810
Right!

203
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,140
Fire!

204
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,240
Right!

205
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,640
What? A toy?

206
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,160
We'll paralyze the capital,

207
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,830
and sow enough confusion so that Sekireis
will be the least of our enemies' concerns!

208
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,500
An emergency in Block C!

209
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,830
A water pipe's exploded!

210
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,170
Call from a civilian in Block D!

211
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,170
Report the situation! What happened?!

212
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,400
This is Block A. Unusual vegetation is...

213
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm sorry, but please sleep for a while.

214
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Incredible...

215
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Now, let's go!

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,810
R-Right...

217
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,850
Huh? It's so noisy.

218
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,520
What time is it now?

219
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
What's the matter?

220
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,010
It's Ku.

221
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,860
Are you sure it's Ku-chan?

222
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,920
I have no doubt!

223
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,870
They're out just in time.

224
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,870
All right! We're almost
to the prefectural border!

225
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,080
A little bit more, Kuno-san!

226
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,570
Y-Yes!

227
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,550
That's right.
Once we cross there, we'll be free.

228
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,550
I can call everyone now and...

229
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,450
Stop, please!

230
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,220
Jeez, you guys!
Where do you think you're going?

231
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,750
You know that from here
on is the outside of the capital.

232
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,570
Those who try to escape
need to be punished harshly.

233
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,240
These guys are...

234
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,570
The Discipline Squad, number 104, Haihane.

235
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,580
Likewise, number 105, Benitsubasa.

236
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,380
The Discipline Squad!

237
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,920
Shit!

238
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,250
Number 88, Musubi.

239
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,590
I won't lose to someone junior to me!

240
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,120
We'll cross this bridge!

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,260
Musubi-chan!

242
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,600
Now we're the one starting the fight...

243
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,300
How fun! It was worth the wait.

244
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
Have we been underestimated?
I don't like that.

245
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,430
Here I come!

246
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,620
You're a close range fighter, huh?
Same type as me.

247
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,290
Just as Black told me.
Looks like I can have some fun.

248
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,630
Number 88,
Black has her eye on you, I heard.

249
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,630
Black?

250
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,630
Karasuba! Karasuba!

251
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,300
Can't you tell that from the context here?!

252
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,290
Context? Huh?

253
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,970
A born fool...
Benitsubasa, she's your born enemy.

254
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,940
Rats! It's complete
nonsense to deal with this idiot.

255
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,310
Don't call others idiots!

256
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,650
My stomach hurts!

257
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,110
You made me really mad!
I'll kill you instantly.

258
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,850
Take this! And this! And this!

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,190
One down.

260
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,190
M-Musubi-chan!

261
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,810
This inexpressible unease...

262
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,680
Is this what Minato is feeling?

263
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,380
Tsukiumi-san, you are aiming to be strongest

264
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,850
so you can live happily ever after
with Sahashi-san, aren't you?

265
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,360
Landlady! You promised not to say that!

266
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,030
Matsu-san, Ku-chan... even
though they choose different ways,

267
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,160
their feelings of trying to be his wife,

268
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,270
of wanting to help someone precious...

269
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,700
Those must be exactly the same as yours.

270
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,040
You aren't his wife.

271
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,370
Even I can take a risk sometimes.

272
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,830
At this rate, they'll get ahead of you.

273
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,720
Tsukiumi-san!

274
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,950
How boring! I expected she'd be more fun.

275
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,730
Ow! Hey! What was that?!

276
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,900
I told you... I won't lose to my junior.

277
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,070
Musubi-chan!

278
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,400
Hey, let go!

279
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,300
Now, ready, set...

280
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,080
Musubi-chan, are you okay?

281
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,980
That was nothing for me!

282
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,850
Well, you sure act fresh...

283
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,420
I'll show you what happens
when you defy the Discipline Squad...

284
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,290
I won't just shut you down; I'll kill you!

285
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,770
Watch out!

286
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,630
Extreme Quake!

287
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,470
"Extreme Quake"
Extreme Quake!

288
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,900
"Extreme Quake"

289
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,740
What was that?

290
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,080
Minato-san!

291
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,130
Minato-san!

292
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,290
I'll save you right now!

293
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,470
Is this your Ashikabi?

294
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,810
What should I do with him?

295
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,080
Sahashi!

296
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,910
Today, I won't let you go.

297
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,510
Don't move!

298
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,920
I'll fall. I'll fall. I can't swim!

299
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Minato-san!

300
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,830
Good, good. Stay still.

301
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,590
Don't move.

302
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,570
Pulverizer!

303
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,380
"Pulverizer"
Pulverizer!

304
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,670
Pulverizer!

305
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,280
Damn it!

306
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Minato-san...

307
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,680
Your hand...

308
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,730
Musubi-chan, it's enough. Get away.

309
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,200
Musubi-chan!

310
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,200
We, Sekireis are born to meet Ashikabis.

311
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,170
And I... I met you. I met you!

312
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,350
Here's the finisher.

313
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,690
She was so annoying. Idiot.

314
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,370
It seems I was so obsessed
with being the Sekirei I aimed to be

315
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,670
that I lost the most important thing.

316
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,510
Minato...

317
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm the real wife!

318
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,920
Landlady, I'm going.

319
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,590
Yes, be careful.

320
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,220
I don't want to become a widow
before we've even exchanged vows.

321
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,470
It's all over now.

322
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,930
What will you do?

323
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,940
Shit!

324
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,140
Musubi-chan, Musubi-chan... Answer me!

325
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,280
Musubi-chan!

326
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,910
Musubi-san's Sekirei Symbol...

327
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,150
Musubi-cha...

328
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,160
No! It can't be!

329
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,560
Musubi-chan!

330
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,140
Clouds drifting through the faraway sky

331
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,640
I watched them next to you

332
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Now, a gentle wind has wrapped around me

333
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:19,330
No matter how many seasons pass

334
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:31,040
I want to burn my beloved
moment eternally into memory

335
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,020
Every time you smile

336
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,360
I keep falling in love

337
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:56,370
Never-ending story with you

338
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,640
With you

339
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,730
Finally, this game is
about to get to the climax.

340
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,400
Will there be an ending to the
game woven by the little birds?

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,410
But however things may
turn out, do not come crying to us.

342
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,310
The final episode, the Sekirei of Fate.

343
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,740
The Final Feather:
"The Sekirei of Fate"
The final episode, the Sekirei of Fate.

344
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,010
The Final Feather:
"The Sekirei of Fate"
Please favor us again next time!
