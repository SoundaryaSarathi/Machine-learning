1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:02,125
Here you go, the summer homework.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,002
What?

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,338
It's all done, so you can borrow it.

4
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:05,964
It's okay, I'd feel bad.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,034
I can do it myself.

6
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,033

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,445
Don't worry, just take it.
You couldn't study this whole
time because of the Interhigh.

8
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,641
I thought if I did it all, you would be able to
do your studies without needing to lose that time.

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,582
So I worked hard to get it done.
I want you to use it.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:38,699
Her light brown hair. Her intellectual eyebrows,
and her expressive eyes beneath them.
Her slim neck.  Her warm body...

14
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:52,418
Father, mother, good morning.

15
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:53,577
Good morning.

16
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:54,745
Good morning.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,550
I know I always feel this way,

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,616
but I never look forward to
going to see the Arima family.

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,821
Well, they never change.

20
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,231
It's unbelievable how every last

21
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,829
one of them turned out to be so spiteful.

22
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,358
Even though you're

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,634
not like that at all.

24
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:12,601
Anyway, there's no point

25
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,599
in getting depressed ourselves.

26
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,774
After all, the one

27
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,111
who suffers the most is right here.

28
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,341
We'll have to stay strong.

29
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,050
You don't have to worry about me.

30
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,708
I'm not a kid anymore...

31
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,447
I don't let it get to me every time.

32
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,393
My family is a lineage of doctors
going all the way back to the Edo Period.

34
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:39,831
There are many relatives who are doctors
or work for pharmaceutical companies.

35
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,962
Foremost among whom is my father, the
director of the city's general hospital.

37
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:51,105
In other words, there's that certain
social standing and they value this
status above all else.

40
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:57,277
In the eyes of the Arima family,
I was the only "blemish."

42
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:04,955
How time flies.

43
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:09,890
It's already been 12 years since
our youthful father passed away.

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,292
How lovely to see you, Eiko.

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,424
Lovely to see you too, Shizune.

47
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,529
Aunt Eiko, it has been a while.

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,498
I'm shunned by this family.

49
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,143
This has to do with my origins.

50
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,842
My current parents

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,075
aren't my real parents.

52
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,946
They're actually my aunt and uncle,

53
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,112
my real father's oldest brother.

54
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,947
I don't know the details,

55
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,719
but my real father didn't get
along with the family.

56
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,051
He was a terrible delinquent,
caused a lot of trouble...

57
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,154
...and finally disappeared,

58
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:47,225
taking money from the house, leaving
a significant debt, and me, behind.

60
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,695
The child of the trouble maker.

61
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:52,463
That's how I was seen,
ever since I was little.

62
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,339
Hey, this isn't a place for
you to come in your street clothes.

64
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,268
Don't be stupid.

65
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,680
That's a public high school uniform.

66
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,571
You'll hurt his feelings if you say that.

67
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,314
It is? Figures.

68
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,211
How can you stand to wear such cheap clothing?

69
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,192
What, you tryin to ignore us?

70
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:13,791
You better not get on your high-horse.

71
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,287
You're not even wanted here.

72
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,787
You just keep your mouth shut
and do what we tell you.

73
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,558
Lay off.

74
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,126
Kei-chan.

75
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,572
Ignoring us is all he CAN do.

77
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,572
So we should at least let him do that.

78
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,064
Excuse me.

79
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,300
That boy...

80
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,868
He's come to resemble Reiji
since I last saw him.

81
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,107
It gave me a shudder when I saw his face.

82
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,874
Ugh, he makes me remember the past.

83
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,578
It makes me sick.

84
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,650
How could a child like Reiji have
been born into our house?

86
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,349
The amount of shame he brought
upon Father is immeasurable.

87
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,991
I still can't believe you decided
to bring him up.

89
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,257
You should have left him at an orphanage.

90
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,252
I hope you're sure about that boy.

91
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:26,390
Observe him closely to make sure that he hasn't
inherited his father's temperament as well.

94
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:32,135
Don't spoil him and let him
assume he has a right to have anything
belonging to the Arima family.

96
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,044
Always remind him that he's merely
being "allowed to stay" in the family.

98
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,103
I can't stand it.

99
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,912
I wish he would graduate from school
and get out of our family already.

101
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,510
Please, that's enough!

102
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,319
How can you be so cruel towards a child...

103
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,882
What has Souichirou ever done wrong?

105
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:54,526
All of you denounce
him merely because he is Reiji's son...

107
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,730
I am far more ashamed of all of you!

109
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,259
He is both intelligent and good natured.

110
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,358
He is well aware of where he stands.

112
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,700
He puts in so much effort when he doesn't need to.

113
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,504
He entered the top public high school
in the prefecture at the top of his class.

115
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:11,703
If there are those who look down upon him,

116
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,037
I don't know what grounds they have
for their sense of superiority.

117
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,210
It is not a matter of whether he is bright or not.

118
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,477
He is dear to me...

119
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,254
He is our child.

120
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,650
I will not have you speak ill of our child!

122
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,673
On days like this...

123
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,543
...I am tormented by hatred
and the feeling that my own

124
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,747
existence is nothing but a dark stain.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
*I hate them!*
*Just because they were born into a good family!*

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I want to disappear.

127
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:08,692
Even so, I was able to keep a positive outlook
because I loved my current parents.

129
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,729
What? I'm doing it for myself!

130
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:12,534
Because it feels great to be number one!

131
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,603
You can let me take care of you too.

132
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,839
I was much happier being
with you than being number one.

134
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,578
I love you more than before.

136
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,180
I thought if I did it all, you would be able
to do your studies without wasting that time.

137
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,349
So I worked hard to get it done.
Go on and use it.

138
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,424
That's all I need...
...that special person

141
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,630
Yes?

142
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,469
Oh, there you are!
Thank goodness. It's me!

143
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,273
Hi! I heard you went out today so I was

144
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,042
wondering what I would do if you weren't here,

145
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,035
but I'm glad you're here!

146
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,844
What's up?

147
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,645
I forgot one of the reports.

148
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,717
Tsubaki gave it back
when I saw her today.

150
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,175
You should have told me and
I'd have come to get it.

151
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,150
Thanks. Want to come in?

152
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,421
We got some ice cream as gifts.

153
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,584
All right! Lucky! I'll have some!

154
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,129
Where are Mr. and Mrs. Arima?

155
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,359
They're not back yet.

156
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,532
W..W..We're all alone?

157
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:16,801
M..Makes you nervous, doesn't it?

158
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,600
That's OK, nothing will happen.

159
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,705
Oh... ok...

160
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,744
Why does she look so sad?
*I don't get it!!*

161
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,841
So yummy!

162
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,417
Miyazawa?

163
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,341
Eh?

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,618
Can I kiss you?

165
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,914
Awww, you liar.

166
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,727
You said you wouldn't do anythiiing.

167
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,447
Uh... Umm... Y..Your hand...

168
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,951
I'm sorry. I really won't do anything anymore.

170
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,219
But some time I might make love to you.

171
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,988
I want to make love to you.

172
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,035
My lips, my eyes, my hands, everything...

173
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,902
...all exist to feel you.

174
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,347
Now, where shall we go, just the two of us?

175
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,090
But before long I might make love to you.

176
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,856
I want to make love to you.

177
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,062
Wh..Whoa, Arima!

178
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,396
Did I surprise you?

179
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,061
Wh..what's up? How'd you know I was here?

180
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,163
I went to your place and
they said you might be around here.

181
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,270
You never come over without calling first.

183
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:38,604
Hideaki came to sleep over again last night.
He was hanging all over me, so I snuck out.

184
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,739
Asapin's just happy to see you after so long.

185
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,158
Argh, I blew it!

186
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,690
I said weird things out of the blue,
and made you uneasy.

187
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,425
I don't know what came over me yesterday.

190
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:05,328
This may not sound convincing,
but it's not like I have to do that with you.

191
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,700
If you don't want to,
I absolutely won't do anything.

193
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:13,536
What is it?

194
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,243
Oh, um, well.

195
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,650
I was wondering why you said that out of the blue...

196
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,547
You had never let anything like that show before.

197
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,489
But I think I figured it out.

198
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:24,752
How should I put it?

199
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,729
What you're saying is
something more spiritual.

201
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,846
It feels wonderous.
We haven't connected with our bodies yet,

203
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,354
but our souls are definitely connected.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,498
Studying for second semester already

205
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,825
After that, we enjoyed the rest of
our summer vacation just like always.

206
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,134
What are you going to do with all that?

207
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,127
Are you borrowing them?

208
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:16,002
I have time to spare thanks
to all the homework you did.

210
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,037
I thought I'd try to read
30 books during vacation.

212
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,046
What, really?! Me too! I'll do it too!

213
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:23,740
I'll read 50!

214
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,612
Why do you like to compete so much?

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,653
They all go swimming at the beach

216
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,881
We all went to the beach too.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is so fun!

218
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,437
Hey, stop that! Look, sea slug! Blorp!

219
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,445
Arimaaaa!
Lotion me!

220
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,272
No.

221
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,974
Arimaaa!!!
Lotion me.

223
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,076
No!

224
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,747
Aya-chan didn't show after all.

225
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,223
Oh, her...

226
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,516
She's writing a manuscript.

227
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,152
Although she's probably asleep right now.

228
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:10,688
She has day and night reversed and
says she gets dizzy when she sees the sun.

230
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,298
What's wrong with her?

231
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,394
A writer is a cursed occupation.

232
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,267
She's so pale even though it's summer.

233
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,500
Come to think of it, both Tsubaki and
Asapin are here.

234
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,473
They both love girls...

235
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:21,897
I wonder if they'll find friendship.

236
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:23,370
What?

237
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,743
No use.

238
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,279
They both want to monopolize
the girls and have become territorial.

241
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,948
What about Asapin and
the adorable Tsubasa-chan?

242
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:38,283
What?

244
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,591
Shibahime?
I'll give you this, so don't get too close
to that perverted guy over there.

245
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:44,760
Okay?

246
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:48,326
She had her brother!

247
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,618
I'm stiff all over.

248
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,616
We've been studying since morning.

249
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,961
There's a nice breeze in the
afternoons after mid-August.

251
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,159
The sky's gotten really clear too.

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,227
I guess summer's almost over.

253
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:24,961
You okay?

254
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,203
You always wear such skimpy clothes.

255
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,855
Whoa, look over there!
The sky is pitch black!

256
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,881
We better hurry, or we'll get rained on.

257
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,457
We're soaked.

258
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,874
Thanks.

259
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,284
I wonder where the bus is.

260
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,743
Do you want to come to my house then?

261
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,153
It's a bit of a walk, but not too far.

262
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,482
But my parents won't be home today.

263
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:55,753
What do you want to do?

264
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm so happy.

265
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,383
What?

266
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:27,994
That there are moments like this between us.

267
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,086
We love each other so unequivocally.

268
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,828
We believe in each other.

269
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,058
We have no doubts in our minds...

270
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,395
There aren't so many times
as happy as this in life.

272
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,539
So I'll never forget.

273
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:48,714
No matter how much time passes
or how old I get, I'll remember.

274
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,000
I feel like I'm going out of my mind.

275
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,250
I must've fallen asleep.
Uh-oh, what time is it?

276
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,426
Seven o'clock ...

277
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,154
Thank god, that's not so late.

278
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,397
I don't know what I would've done
if it were the middle of the night.

279
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:52,867
So warm...

280
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,244
I just threw stuff together
so I don't think it's good, but...

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,316
We're just like newlyweds!!

282
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,569
You think you can be happy now?

284
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,444
Your scars aren't that shallow.

286
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,885
I get irritated just looking at your face!

287
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,018
Why do you cower all the time, you runt!

289
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,485
I never should have given birth to you!

290
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,354
What're you looking at me like that for?

291
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,231
Whose fault do you think it is
that we have such a hard time?

293
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,831
Stop it! Why are you
making me remember this?!

294
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,344
Because you tried to be happy.

295
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,276
Your heart starts to fray from there.

296
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,216
You can't get away from me.

297
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,683
I'm inside you.

298
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:19,890
I'm your dark half.
I'm the shadow beneath your feet.

299
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,186
Because I am you.

300
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:49,548
A dream I can't wake up from.
A never-ending nightmare...

301
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:53,430
PREVIEW

302
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,643
Finally, the attainment of the greatest desire!

303
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:58,140
Sis experienced the becoming of one flesh and spirit.

304
00:20:58,581 --> 00:20:59,479
But regardless of such things, the flow of
time puts an end to summer vacation!

305
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:00,281
And the second semester begins,

306
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:02,583
and a mysterious transfer student turns up.

307
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:05,147
Next time on KareKano
"14 Days"

308
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:06,581
Bye
