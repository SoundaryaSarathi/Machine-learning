1
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:10,073
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:15,439
Fettucine and spinach pasta.

3
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,679
Okay!
I got done with all my shopping!

4
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:31,928
[Sakura and Another Sakura]

5
00:00:33,397 --> 00:00:34,125
I’m back!

6
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,531
Welcome back, Sakura.

7
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:39,066
Yukito?

8
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:43,071
Touya, what are you doing?

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,303
Can’t you tell?

10
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:45,833
I’m getting a haircut.

11
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:47,538
I just happened to stop by.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,141
With this, I don’t have to pay.

13
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:55,816
Must be nice!
Getting a haircut from Yukito.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,087
Sakura, you want a cut too?

15
00:00:57,488 --> 00:00:57,886
Eh?

16
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:10,027
But maybe you want go to
a salon for a proper cut…

17
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,399
Because you’re a girl…

18
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:13,528
Please!

19
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,272
I’ll just trim a
little for you, okay?

20
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:17,872
Ye… Yes.

21
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:23,941
Clean up after you’re done.

22
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:25,311
I’ll help too.

23
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,581
I’ll do anything !

24
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:37,959
Someday,
I’m gonna wear one of these too.

25
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:40,961
Hey, Shao Lan, wait!

26
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:42,297
Eh!

27
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,224
What’s wrong?

28
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:48,166
Kinomoto!

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,343
Could she be running away because she
knew she did something bad?

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,881
This pencil case is cute too.

31
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:06,917
I’ll get this one.

32
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,659
Which one should I get…

33
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,321
Sakura?

34
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,097
What is it…

35
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,129
Whoa! Who did this?!

36
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,940
What is it? You look happy, Sakura.

37
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:35,611
How is it? Yukito cut my hair.

38
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:38,712
You didn’t look any different at all.

39
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,989
After all, Yukito can really do anything.

40
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,992
Besides, he’s so nice and
he’s good at sports. Schweeeet.

41
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,123
Sakura, come help!

42
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,426
Okay!

43
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,707
I guess girls are hard to understand.

44
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,611
You’re good at cleaning up, Sakura.

45
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:07,581
Not really.

46
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:09,044
She’s not like this normally.

47
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,679
She’d break things here
and there like a monster.

48
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:16,055
I can’t tell if she’s cleaning
or moving things around.

49
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,587
When this is done,
let’s make dinner.

50
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:21,454
How about I cook?

51
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:22,355
Eh!

52
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,498
I always eat here for free…

53
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:25,801
I’ll help you.

54
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:26,826
Thank you.

55
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:30,765
Today’s a really nice day.

56
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,809
I guess we won’t be
eating dinner tonight.

57
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:34,576
Eh!

58
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:35,310
Why not?

59
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:36,611
If Sakura cooks,

60
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,548
you can’t even eat the things
supposed to be edible.

61
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,005
What did you say?!

62
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,113
Touya,

63
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:45,750
where’s the ingredient
for the pasta?

64
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,016
Oh, it’s here.

65
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:52,621
G’morning, Tomoyo.

66
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,789
Good morning.

67
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,790
It’s gotten cooler
little by little.

68
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:59,862
Yes.
You seem cheerful.

69
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:01,029
Listen. Listen.

70
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,905
I had a lot of good times yesterday.

71
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,839
Oh? Did you get a haircut?

72
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,178
Ye… Yeah. Could you tell?

73
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,548
Yukito cut it for me yesterday.

74
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:12,949
I am glad for you.

75
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,543
But you know, Kero said
he couldn’t tell any difference.

76
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,213
I can notice even
if you had the slightest trim.

77
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:22,951
G’morning!

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,054
Good morning!

79
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:25,986
G’morning…

80
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,860
Sakura, you know…

81
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,000
Did something happen?

82
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:36,134
Kinomoto!

83
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:37,540
Ye… Yes!

84
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:39,102
You can’t misbehave like that!

85
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:39,874
Eh!

86
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,107
You were going to steal something,
weren’t you?

87
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:42,806
I saw you yesterday.

88
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:45,715
You messed up the stuffed
dolls yesterday.

89
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,644
Right, Shao Lan?

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,909
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:54,686
Sakura, were you at the
stationery store yesterday?

92
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,957
No. I did go out to buy pasta,

93
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,093
but I stayed home since then.

94
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,822
Just as I thought,
I mistook her for you.

95
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:04,597
That’s right. Sakura wouldn’t
do something like that.

96
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:05,926
Did something happen?

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,098
We saw someone who
looked a bit like Sakura.

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,863
Me?

99
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:10,572
That’s not it.

100
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,066
I’m positive that was Kinomoto.

101
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:14,705
Shao Lan saw her too!

102
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,686
Be careful.

103
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,121
What does he mean?

104
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:38,192
What could he mean by ‘be careful’?

105
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,238
Sakura.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,438
Thank you very much.

107
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,683
Don’t worry about it,
Sakura.

108
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:55,818
They say everyone in this world

109
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,811
has someone who
looks just like him or her.

110
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:58,778
Eh!

111
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,651
Oh, there’s this story too…

112
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,922
It’s called a doppelganger.
The another you.

113
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:10,456
They say if you meet
the other you, you die.

114
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:17,469
Did Li mean by that
when he told me to be careful?

115
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,125
Sakura!

116
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,788
It was her!

117
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,839
You are not feeling well.

118
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:54,606
Tomoyo, did you know?

119
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,947
If you see another you, you d… di…

120
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,576
You mean, you die?

121
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,187
Do not worry.
That is only a superstition.

122
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:05,816
But… But!!

123
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,527
What is wrong?

124
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,227
I saw her!!

125
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,533
Sakura!

126
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,936
Oh, there she is! Sakura!

127
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:29,905
What is wrong?

128
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:30,903
Eh?

129
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,112
Was that you who were
being mean to the little kids

130
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:33,941
In the park?

131
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:35,576
I didn’t do anything like that.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,021
Sakura has been
here with me all this time.

133
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,481
See, here is her ice cream.

134
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,087
She was wearing
the school uniform…

135
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:45,761
It was that girl just now.

136
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:50,097
Someone who looks just like you?

137
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:52,267
She was mean
to the little kids,

138
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,694
and she made a mess at the stores.

139
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,337
So it looked like
it was you who did those things.

140
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,231
At this rate, bad rumors

141
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:00,510
will be spreading around the town.

142
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:05,739
Besides, they say if you
see another you, yo… o… yyou’ll die.

143
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:07,680
A doppelganger…

144
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,620
Were you scared when you saw her?

145
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,322
No, rather than scared,

146
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,554
it was more like a strange feeling.

147
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,857
Could it be a Clow Card?

148
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,922
All right. Let’s tell a fortune.

149
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:20,786
Tell a fortune?

150
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,063
It’s the perfect opportunity for this.

151
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:26,091
I’ll teach you how to tell fortunes
with the Clow Cards.

152
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,103
Pay attention, okay?

153
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:33,168
Okay.

154
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,168
First of all, mix the cards
with your left hand.

155
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:44,477
Okay. Put them back together,
and then divide them into
3 piles with your left hand.

156
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,884
Using your left hand again,
put them back into one pile.

157
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:50,482
In the same order?

158
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:52,762
No. In any order you like.

159
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:57,231
And then, pull out the cards

160
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,459
one by one from the pile, and
arrange ten cards here.

161
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,496
First, one card at the top.

162
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:03,896
Next, put one by your side.

163
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:08,341
Put the next one below on the left.
Again, by your side.

164
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,043
Close your eyes and repeat after me.

165
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:19,846
Cards created by Clow,
answer my question.

166
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,455
Cards created by Clow,
answer my question.

167
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,323
Reveal the true form

168
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:28,892
of the one who stands in my path.

169
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:30,631
Reveal the true form

170
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,195
of the one who stands in my path.

171
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,939
Okay. Flip over the card at the top.

172
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,046
Windy .

173
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,212
Just as I thought!

174
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,174
Eh!

175
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,710
The cards are trying
to tell you somethin’!

176
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,149
What do you mean?

177
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:54,657
Windy is a card that represents
‘communications,’ and ‘information.’

178
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,025
It’s telling you that
a Card has noticed that

179
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,751
you’re collecting them.

180
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:05,167
The cards I’m going to capture
from now on, do they all know about me?

181
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:08,961
Probably except for those
that haven’t been awakened
and are still in form of cards.

182
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,642
Then, that girl is
a Clow Card, after all.

183
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,739
That’s highly possible.

184
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,150
Flip these 3 cards over.

185
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,352
That card can be associated
with these 3 cards.

186
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:34,796
Shadow. Watery. Illusion.

187
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,408
Go on!

188
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,924
Lastly, look at the very bottom
card in the remainin’ pile.

189
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,030
What is it gonna tell me?

190
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,031
What the card has its eyes on now.

191
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,136
Flower ?

192
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,441
Peach…

193
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,019
Peach blossom…

194
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:04,119
Touya!

195
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,903
Sakura?

196
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:22,270
You’re late.
Did you have club activities?

197
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:26,574
Sakura…?

198
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,115
But then why does it remind
you of your brother?

199
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:35,281
I don’t know!
It just came up in my head!

200
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,590
Do you know where
your brother is right now?

201
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,926
I don’t know.
But somehow, I think it’s this way!

202
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,494
Sakura’s magical power
has grown stronger again.

203
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,434
This way.

204
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,113
This is Touya’s bike.

205
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,782
All right. He’s nearby.

206
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:09,316
What is it that you dropped?

207
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:12,959
There’s nothing.

208
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:14,891
Go deeper.

209
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:21,499
Are you okay?

210
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:22,829
Yeah.

211
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,837
It’s further in.

212
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,034
What’s wrong?!

213
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:32,105
No!! I couldn’t sense
the card anymore!

214
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,939
But you could tell until just now!

215
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:37,780
Somehow, I sense
a lot of people around here.

216
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:39,816
But there’s no one around here.

217
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,850
I can feel something not very nice too.

218
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,322
Oh! Those must be ghosts…

219
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,396
Those ‘not very nice’ things

220
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,323
must be drowning out
the trace of the card.

221
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:51,358
What should I do?

222
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:56,966
It’s deeper inside.

223
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,803
Deeper.

224
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,286
What should I do… 
if anything happens to Touya…

225
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:18,420
Dammit.
If only I regain my original form,

226
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:21,256
then I can tell
its location right away.

227
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:22,829
Touya…

228
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:24,796
Sakura…

229
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,495
Hey brat,
what are you doin’ here?

230
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,106
I followed the trace
of the Clow Card here.

231
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:34,939
What’s wrong?

232
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,473
That’s…

233
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,776
That’s made to
look for Clow Cards, right?

234
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:42,107
Ye… Yeah.

235
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,317
Please!
Please use it to find Touya!

236
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:11,440
That way!

237
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,708
Touya, I’ll be right there.

238
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:22,523
So, where’s that thing you dropped?

239
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:25,589
You were looking for it, right?

240
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,196
I’m fine. I’ll keep you
company until you find it.

241
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:35,160
This is bad.
Looks like I can’t stand up.

242
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:41,609
Hey, I look for the thing
you dropped for you,

243
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:45,347
so I’m not gonna let
you use Sakura’s image.

244
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,782
It just doesn’t feel pleasant
for someone like her

245
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,379
to turn into ghost.

246
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:55,086
When did you find out
I’m not your sister?

247
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,221
At first, I thought
I’ve mistaken you for Sakura,

248
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,588
because you look
so much like her.

249
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,524
But soon, I realize you’re
not a living human being.

250
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:07,660
There are a lot of
them in this forest.

251
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,270
They probably still have things
to finish up in this world.

252
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,107
How about I keep you company until you
find the thing you dropped?

253
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:15,972
After you find it, you should go.

254
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:17,576
Go where?

255
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,480
My mother’s there too.

256
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,617
Say hi to her for me.

257
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:39,660
Down there!

258
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:41,963
Fly !

259
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,607
Touya!

260
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:50,679
He’s okay. He’s still alive.

261
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:52,079
He just lost consciousness.

262
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,345
You hurt my brother!

263
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,922
Windy!

264
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,263
Magic doesn’t work?!

265
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,603
Sakura, use an offensive card!

266
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,767
Watery !

267
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:23,574
Just as I thought,

268
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,243
neither restraining magic
or attack magic works…

269
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,608
That means,
it’s a special card!

270
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:32,218
Special card?

271
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,954
You can’t turn it back
with the common cards.

272
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:36,624
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:38,993
You have to guess right
the true form of the card.

274
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,394
For a special card,
if you name it correctly,

275
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,096
it loses its power and
turns back to a card.

276
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:57,673
Idiot!
That’s stupid of you to get close!

277
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,885
You are the sister.

278
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,088
That’s right.
You did cruel things to my brother.

279
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,720
Think what card it is!

280
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,670
Illusion. Watery. Shadow.

281
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,902
Keep thinking of those 3 cards…

282
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,044
She is imitating me?

283
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,641
Like Shadow,
it moves the same way with me.

284
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,418
Like Watery, it reflects many things.

285
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:43,048
But like Illusion,
it’s not the real thing.

286
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,457
You are…

287
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,222
You’re the card, Mirror,
aren’t you?

288
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,005
I’m sorry.

289
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,087
Return to thy form which thou should be!

290
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,062
Clow Card!

291
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:32,571
Touya!

292
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,015
But then, you did a good job
in recognizing it’s Mirror.

293
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,489
She imitated me.

294
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:52,361
It’s like she moved with me on purpose
to make me recognize it.

295
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:56,156
I guess she was sorry before she
was turned back to a card.

296
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,223
Yes.

297
00:18:58,401 --> 00:18:59,766
I could have walked
downstairs and eat.

298
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,298
No, because you hurt your foot too.

299
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,407
Hey, that guy.

300
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,145
Oh, um… this…

301
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,514
It was lonely making
food by myself,

302
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:17,180
so I brought the stuffed
doll with me…

303
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:22,854
Touya…

304
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:23,624
Eh!

305
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:24,788
I’m sorry.

306
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:28,426
Nothing. I’m just sorry.

307
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:34,565
Did she put something in here…

308
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:36,502
Hello!

309
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:39,832
Falling down a cliff,
it’s very unlike you.

310
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,172
Things happen.

311
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,103
You told me you always saw things

312
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,675
in that forest.

313
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,981
Is this because
of something you saw?

314
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,652
When I woke up,
it’s already gone.

315
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,520
I guess I just didn’t feel it.

316
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,351
That must be it.

317
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:56,521
You’re so nice.

318
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,089
Delicious! Did Sakura make it?

319
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:03,729
Just shut up.

320
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,203
That was too bad.

321
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,400
I missed out on shooting
your heroic epic.

322
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:13,737
It looks so good!

323
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,177
I wanna eat Tomoyo’s cake too!

324
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,039
Those cards that will stand
in my way trying to hurt me…

325
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,409
Even from now on,
they might still come out.

326
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:25,047
They might.

327
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,984
Hey, you told me when we first met,

328
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:31,460
‘When the seal of the
Clow Cards is broken,

329
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:33,960
a disaster will bestow upon this world.’

330
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:35,962
What is this disaster?

331
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,588
I don’t understand it,

332
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,533
but is it like bad things
will be awakened

333
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:41,596
And they will blast
away the earth?

334
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:44,172
No, no.
Things like that aren’t gonna happen.

335
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,767
Then, what kind of disaster is it?

336
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,210
To some people, it might not
even be any disaster at all.

337
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,472
I’m glad.

338
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,274
I’ll do my very best
to gather all the cards.

339
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,410
In order to prevent
the cards from doing bad things,

340
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,284
I’ll gather them all for sure!

341
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:00,516
If it’s you, Sakura,
it’ll be all right.

342
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,152
Let’s bring these to
Touya and Yukito.

343
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:05,893
Okay.

344
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,932
But to some people, when
compared to blastin’ away the earth,

345
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,400
it could be somethin’ even harsher.
