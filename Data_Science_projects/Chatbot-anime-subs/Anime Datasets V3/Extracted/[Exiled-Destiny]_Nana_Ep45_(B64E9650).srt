1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:04,742
I thought the way she talked was
like the way she sang.

2
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:10,562
That unique and annoying way Takumi
stretches the last word when he speaks

3
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,162
was practically identical
to Reira's rhythm.

4
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:19,262
It's like how I started to sound
like Ren before I even knew it.

5
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,402
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

6
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,272
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

7
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:33,112
Baby I'm standing alone

8
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,912
An unforgettable rainy day

9
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,922
Chasing after your shadow

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,792
And it's over, it's like sand now

11
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,092
I sigh every night

12
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:47,132
I scream like a child and cried

13
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,872
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

14
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,932
Please, please God, forgive my sins

15
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,672
I don't need to hide no more

16
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,612
Flowing toward the turquoise light

17
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:03,652
Just keep going on

18
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,252
You've got the chance now

19
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:06,452
You've got the power

20
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:08,952
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

21
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:10,592
I show you my life now

22
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,022
I show you my love now

23
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,252
I show you my everything yeah yeah

24
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:17,492
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

25
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:20,302
Don't ever change so be yourself

26
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,732
I'll show you my strength now

27
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,102
I'll show you my love now

28
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:26,372
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

29
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:30,402
Baby don't be afraid

30
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:34,042
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

31
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,742
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

32
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,512
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

33
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:42,422
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

34
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,342
Are those two sleeping together?

35
00:02:08,382 --> 00:02:10,082
I wouldn't be surprised,

36
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:12,242
no matter how many women
Takumi is with,

37
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,152
but if Reira were one of them,
I'd feel awful for Hachi,

38
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,522
who's preparing miso soup
and waiting for him at home.

39
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:21,482
Damn...

40
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:25,522
The scab deep in my heart
is peeling off again.

41
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:29,562
I was so close to escaping
those miserable days

42
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:31,432
of thinking only of Hachi.

43
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:33,372
I'm reminded of it

44
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:36,502
every time I look at the smug look
on Takumi's face.

45
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:42,382
How worthless I was
adding to Hachi's worries

46
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:47,752
when she was feeling
her most vulnerable.

47
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,622
The talk will last about three minutes.

48
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:54,092
Please start by introducing
the band members.

49
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:54,782
Okay.

50
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:57,692
After that, we'll ask about
your upcoming plans.

51
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,162
The questions will be what
we told you ahead of time.

52
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,122
Yes, I understand.

53
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,462
In fact...

54
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:06,192
Would you ask her what
she thinks of me?

55
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,262
Yes, we would definitely
like to ask that!

56
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,002
Shut up!
And stop talking in harmony!

57
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:16,102
Girl, you can't talk back to
the MCs like that!

58
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:18,052
Talk as little as possible
when you're on air.

59
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:18,982
And be cool, okay?

60
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,052
Like I care!

61
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:22,022
It's Ren's fault for making
such a stupid remark.

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,952
Aren't you eating, Nobu?

63
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,052
I'm surprised you can eat right
before the show.

64
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,992
Oh my, you're nervous?
You're such a weakling.

65
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,062
Leave me alone.

66
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,492
I get nervous just like anybody else

67
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,502
when I do something
I'm not accustomed to,

68
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,692
like stand in front of a TV camera.

69
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:38,132
Thirty seconds to the PR slot...

70
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,972
- When I think of how I will be exposed...
- before the show!

71
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,462
to the vast number of curious eyes,

72
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:45,132
it scares me.

73
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,602
Twenty seconds.

74
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:48,882
So I secretly imagine.

75
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:56,512
I imagine Hachi watching over me,
in that room before it became empty.

76
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:59,812
Ten seconds. Eight... seven...

77
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,552
It's a charm to get rid
of my anxiety.

78
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,722
Coming up, "Music Studio"!
Broadcast live!

79
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:13,702
There she is!
Nana looked right at me and smiled!

80
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:14,862
Did you see that, Jun-chan?

81
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:18,002
I don't think she was
specifically smiling at you.

82
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,272
I can't see with you sitting there.
Please move.

83
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,912
You know, your own husband's on
the show too, right?

84
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:27,612
Never mind Takumi.

85
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,222
I can see him any time,
and every inch of him too.

86
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:30,352
So you've seen enough of him?

87
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,392
WHY IS HE SUCH AN OLD PERVERT?
So you've seen enough of him?

88
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,322
You see, every time he appears
in front of the media,

89
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,522
he tries to be cool, and it's like
he's a different person.

90
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,322
I get embarrassed watching him.

91
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:40,992
But you were a great fan of
that guy acting cool.

92
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,932
You showing off the fact
you're close to him now?

93
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,602
Well, I can't help it!

94
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:48,092
Takumi's the closest person
to me now!

95
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,932
But on that same account,
you're really close to BLAST, too.

96
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,542
But you're just like an average fan

97
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,242
when it comes to the guru.

98
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,532
It's really annoying!

99
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:01,152
It's because I can only watch Nana
from a distance,

100
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:04,122
so I can't do any more than worry
about her and cheer her on.

101
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,822
Which puts me in practically
the same position as the fans.

102
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:06,992
SOB SOB
Which puts me in practically
the same position as the fans.

103
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:07,162
SOB SOB

104
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:08,222
SOB SOB
I find it lonely.

105
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:08,362
I find it lonely.

106
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:10,832
Well, I'm sure she's really busy,

107
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,122
so she's not likely to have any time
to be looking after you.

108
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,992
I don't need her to look after me.

109
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:20,332
I just feel lonely that
she doesn't rely on me.

110
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:24,862
They're starting the countdown
to the show.

111
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:29,882
I'm gonna let Hachi feel relieved
by being calm.

112
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:32,452
Good evening!
I'm your host, Chie Takahashi!

113
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:33,542
And I'm Tsuyoshi Morishita!

114
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,752
I hear that talent with the big boobs
and the announcer

115
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,222
are having an extramarital affair.

116
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,392
- Those boobs have gotta be silicone.
- For the next hour,

117
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,882
we're bringing to you a great lineup
of fabulous guests tonight!

118
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,122
You're gonna watch it here?

119
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:42,592
RECREATION ROOM

120
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,492
RECREATION ROOM
You have a TV
in your own room, Yuri.

121
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,962
- But I wanna see them on a big screen!
- Without further ado,

122
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,332
- You know, like Nobu.
- let us invite our guests onstage!

123
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,662
First up! In their first appearance,
welcome Black Stones!

124
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,462
Who's that?

125
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:55,772
Nobu's totally the coolest.

126
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,612
HE'S GOT
VILLAINOUS MAKEUP
TREMBLE TREMBLE
Nobu's totally the coolest.

127
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,242
Really? I think he looks the most normal.

128
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,282
Normally, all I see are
the street-smart guys,

129
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:07,212
so I'm really drawn to guys like Nobu
who look healthy and pure-hearted.

130
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:10,312
Don't teach him
any naughty games, Yuri.

131
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:11,852
The same with you, Myu.

132
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,952
You've done it with him, right?
How was he?

133
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:15,852
We haven't done anything.

134
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:22,552
But you two are always talking
like you're really close.

135
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:26,002
It's not like that.
That kid's still only twenty.

136
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,472
From my point of view,
he's still a kid.

137
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,042
He's only two years younger than me!

138
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,472
I thought he was younger.
This might work out.

139
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,542
Once the show started,

140
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,382
Ren's expression turned
exceedingly cool and mature.

141
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,082
I hear you're getting ready
to release an album.

142
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:43,912
More or less.

143
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:45,122
When will it go on sale?

144
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,352
- Of course...
- Within the year.

145
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,652
he didn't butt into my talk
with stupid remarks.

146
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:52,592
He's gotten used to playing
the role of Trapnest's Ren.

147
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:55,262
I don't want him fooling around,

148
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:57,822
but something about this is
so stupid and annoying.

149
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,532
Now then, please take the stage!

150
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:02,492
The Black Stones!

151
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,912
I wanna smash it to pieces.

152
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:12,242
Something...

153
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:14,812
Everything...

154
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,852
Trapnest's prim expressions...

155
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:21,922
Those smiles plastered on the MCs...

156
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,892
Their proper, polite questions
prepared ahead of time...

157
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:29,962
It's all a monkey show!
It's all a farce! Such a boring show!

158
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:32,432
But...

159
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:34,032
Even I...

160
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:37,472
I'm getting paid because
I play the role of BLAST's Nana

161
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,102
that the media created.

162
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:42,482
This world isn't so easy that
we can make an earning

163
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:44,312
just doing whatever we want.

164
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:50,442
My life has always been a B movie.

165
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:54,242
Go ahead and play up my dark past.

166
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,452
Spread all the rumors you want.

167
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,232
But...

168
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:07,872
I hafta be the one to write out...
a scenario for my bright future.

169
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:14,742
I'm no longer that helpless little girl
just standing there.

170
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,872
Marry me.

171
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,582
Marriage is such a formal concept.

172
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:27,012
It was never an issue
between us before...

173
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:29,962
but if we wanna remain together

174
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:32,052
while protecting
each other's present circumstances,

175
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,392
that may be our best option.

176
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:38,232
Marriage was probably
the best solution Ren came up with

177
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:39,562
after giving it considerable thought.

178
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,272
We'll make an announcement
to the public

179
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,802
that we really are in love,
and get married to prove it.

180
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,672
I'm sure there will be some die hard fans
that will go crazy with rage,

181
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:56,642
but most people will accept it as
a happy ending to a love story.

182
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:02,552
Everything has turned into a show now.

183
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,222
But I'm fine with that.

184
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:13,402
I can't stand not seeing him
for an eternity.

185
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:16,072
And now for our final guests!

186
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,802
Appearing after a long absence,
here's Trapnest!

187
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,772
Wow... Takumi!

188
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,282
I hear your new song,

189
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:25,312
"Shadow of Love" was written with
a theme about trust, is that right?

190
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:25,582
REALLY?
"Shadow of Love" was written with
a theme about trust, is that right?

191
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:25,852
REALLY?

192
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:26,282
REALLY?
Yes.

193
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,252
I've had the opportunity to listen to it.

194
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,012
Why are you always able to come up
with such beautiful lyrics?

195
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,182
Beautiful?

196
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:33,592
Trapnest's music is so dignified,
but their lyrics are pretty banal.

197
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:36,492
ALWAYS ABOUT LOVING AND LOSING
Trapnest's music is so dignified,
but their lyrics are pretty banal.

198
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:36,862
BANAL?
Trapnest's music is so dignified,
but their lyrics are pretty banal.

199
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:37,262
BANAL?

200
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:40,422
When I listen to the music,
images come pouring out all at once.

201
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:44,272
And then words come raining down
to match the melody,

202
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,062
so writing the lyrics becomes
a natural process.

203
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:46,702
Huh?

204
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,632
- That's amazing!
- I can't do it!

205
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,432
Well then, please stand by!

206
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,972
Aww, Takumi didn't even talk.

207
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,172
I wanted to see how he shows off
as he talks.

208
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,242
How disappointing.

209
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:02,052
Until then, I was so taken
by Reira's singing ability

210
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,042
that I never really paid attention
to her lyrics.

211
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,822
Since she talked about
her divine inspiration

212
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,062
with such a straight face,

213
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,622
I thought I'd pay attention
to the lyrics.

214
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,992
It was just another song about an affair.

215
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:19,592
The suspicion about Takumi and Reira
grew stronger and stronger within me,

216
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:20,902
so after the show,
I tracked Ren down and asked him.

217
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,472
BLACK STONES
MISS NANA
so after the show,
I tracked Ren down and asked him.

218
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:24,132
so after the show,
I tracked Ren down and asked him.

219
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,802
Nope. That's just not possible.

220
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,472
How can you be so sure?!

221
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:31,752
I dunno. But Takumi's the type
who will always keep his word,

222
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,082
and he practically said it's impossible.

223
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:35,782
I can't trust that!

224
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,372
There's nothing to worry about.

225
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,212
I've gotta get changed and
head out now.

226
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,852
We'll talk about that in length
some other time, okay?

227
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,252
When's "some other time"?

228
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:50,802
I dunno.

229
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,492
Are you really serious about
getting married?!

230
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,662
Huh? Then you'll marry me?

231
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,182
I'll discuss it with the agency.

232
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:09,552
You can't just do whatever
you want either, right?

233
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:17,132
Why should we need the consent
of those around us

234
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,122
and a certificate for two people
to love each other?

235
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,262
The human society is such a pain.

236
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:27,742
RECREATION ROOM

237
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:30,172
RECREATION ROOM
The two bands in the tabloids
met face to face,

238
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:30,512
The two bands in the tabloids
met face to face,

239
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:32,562
yet they didn't touch on
the subject one bit.

240
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:33,542
How boring!

241
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:36,602
Of course not.
This isn't one of those talk shows.

242
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,582
I wonder if the BLAST members
will be coming home late tonight.

243
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:40,812
Well, in particular, Nobu.

244
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,372
He did say this was all they had today.

245
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:46,722
Really? Then let's invite them
and play some mahjongg here!

246
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:47,452
Mahjongg?

247
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,392
I hear they all love it!

248
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,182
They said so in a magazine interview.

249
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:52,852
I love mahjongg!

250
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:54,162
Oh.

251
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,662
I don't mind, but your ulterior motives
are showing through, Yuri.

252
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,902
I won't lose to some sullen pervert
who casually records everything on video.

253
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,042
I ALWAYS GET WHAT I WANT!
I won't lose to some sullen pervert
who casually records everything on video.

254
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,102
They'll definitely be against it.

255
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:12,482
I said I'll talk to the agency,
but the president is scary,

256
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,712
and I can't compete against Ginpei
in either speech or strength.

257
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:19,122
Nana. When the contract money's wired
to your account from Gaia,

258
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,142
go and buy yourself a cell phone.

259
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,712
You should at least send a text message
to Ren from time to time.

260
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:27,252
But if I talk this over with Yasu,
I know he'll help me out.

261
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:31,462
I really can't do a thing
without Yasu.

262
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,942
Seriously, it's inconvenient for work,
so buy one!

263
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,632
Why don't you have one
in this day and age?!

264
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:38,202
What's the big fuss?

265
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,272
I'm sure it'll just be hard on Ren

266
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,042
to wait for a message from her
that only comes once in a while.

267
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,382
When you own a cell phone,
you just get whipped around.

268
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:48,302
By whom?

269
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:51,252
Hachi? Or that girl next door?

270
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:54,522
A social guy like
you can't hate cell phones, too.

271
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:58,892
I won't bug you anymore, so please,
just find someone and be happy.

272
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:04,322
Nana didn't appear to have
much energy tonight.

273
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,802
Really? She looked like she was beaming
with confidence to me.

274
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,372
But she looked spaced out
in the back row the whole time.

275
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,102
You're really observant!

276
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:14,802
I was more concerned about Nobu,
who didn't smile once.

277
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,612
Well, I guess if he's performing
on the same stage as Takumi,

278
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:18,342
there's not much to smile about.

279
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:22,282
I got an e-mail from Nobu
the other day.

280
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,472
Huh?! What did it say?!

281
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:26,252
He wanted to talk things
over properly with me.

282
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:30,212
I broke up with Nobu without
ever saying anything.

283
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,762
But I don't know how I should reply.

284
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,492
And it's already been a month now.

285
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,422
So you never ended it properly with him.

286
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,392
I figured as much.

287
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,772
But you were right not to reply.

288
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,542
If you inadvertently give him any hope,

289
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,802
it would only make things
worse for him.

290
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,642
But if he's been ignored to that extent,
he's probably given up and moved on.

291
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,652
But you know, Jun-chan.

292
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:57,082
To this day, whenever I remember Shoji,
it still hurts.

293
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,682
Why are we talking about Shoji
all of a sudden?!

294
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:05,192
When I look back and think calmly
about when he started two-timing us,

295
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,802
or what he was thinking at the time,

296
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:12,662
I realize I don't know anything.

297
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,242
And what good would knowing do
at this point?

298
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:18,132
It's not about what good it'll do
or anything!

299
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:19,942
I think it's because I remain
in the dark

300
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,142
that even the fun times I had
with Shoji are now just painful memories!

301
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:26,912
I don't know to
what point it was real,

302
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,682
and from where it
all became a lie.

303
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,752
It's not easy to erase the shock

304
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:33,742
of being betrayed
by someone you trusted.

305
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,392
So even if Nobu does date someone,

306
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:42,432
he may also be dragging painful
memories like me.

307
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:46,862
And he'll likely be seeing Takumi
from time to time.

308
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:53,302
I'm thinking,
the only way I can make amends

309
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,212
is to properly talk to Nobu
and have him understand that,

310
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:59,112
although I chose Takumi,
I did truly love him.

311
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,582
But maybe that would only
make me feel better.

312
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:03,882
Would I be hurting him even more?

313
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:05,352
What do you think, Jun-chan?

314
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:09,622
That's certainly a tough question.

315
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:13,092
I told her to do
what she felt was right,

316
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,322
but I'm kinda worried.

317
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:17,292
Come to think of it, Shoji did want
to explain things to her.

318
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,002
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped him.

319
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,662
Maybe not.

320
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,942
I know there isn't any right answer
in these situations,

321
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,572
but I have a tendency to give out
advice like I know everything.

322
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:29,532
I felt responsible,
and was kinda shocked.

323
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,552
From now on,
I'll be careful not to interfere

324
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:33,952
with other people's business.

325
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,682
I don't wanna turn into
some nosy old lady, after all.

326
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:39,352
You really have been acting like
an old lady lately.

327
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,852
You're acting like an old man
and it's rubbed off on me!

328
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,752
Kyosuke-Junko! You're here.

329
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:47,122
Saying it together makes them sound
like some comedy duo!

330
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,032
Well, well, speak of the devil.

331
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:50,772
Were you trash-talking me again?

332
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:52,732
It's unusual to see you coming
for a drink, Sachiko.

333
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:54,842
Mhm! I just got paid,

334
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,772
so I thought why not splurge
every once in a while?

335
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:57,632
Shoji!

336
00:15:57,912 --> 00:15:59,442
You go off spending unnecessarily,

337
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:01,142
yet you're making Sachiko
watch her spending?

338
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:03,612
You changed your hairstyle again,
and to such a stylish color.

339
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,442
How much did it cost?

340
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:07,982
I took him to the stylist. I'm sorry.

341
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,652
Don't mind what
the nosy old lady says.

342
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,192
Oh, by the way,

343
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:15,712
did you know there's a fireworks festival
tomorrow night at Tamagawa?

344
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,452
Huh? Fireworks in this season?

345
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,862
Remember? The one they were
planning in the summer

346
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:20,952
got canceled because of the typhoon.

347
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:21,692
Right.

348
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,832
There were so many requests
from the public to have it,

349
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,162
they decided to do it after all.

350
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:25,892
Oh?

351
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,632
They'll start the fireworks at 6:15.

352
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:29,772
If you're free,

353
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:30,912
what do you say the four of us
go see it together?

354
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,572
Sorry, I have work.

355
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:33,442
Me too.

356
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,412
That's good.

357
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,532
Then no one will be there to
get in our way.

358
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:37,182
But Nana seems to have
lots of time lately.

359
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,042
She might wanna go.

360
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,552
Don't tell her!

361
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,042
What if we bumped into each other?!

362
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:42,752
How should I know?

363
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:44,682
Think for yourself.

364
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,082
NANA KOMATSU

365
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:48,422
Ron!

366
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,352
Jun chan ryan pei kou.

367
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,392
JUN CHAN RYAN PEl KOU

368
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,392
No way!
How come you're so good?!

369
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:56,292
Oh my!

370
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,632
Maybe because I trained
for the role

371
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:02,332
of this mysterious, invincible woman
in the recent mahjongg movie.

372
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,932
So you do stuff like that to
get into your role!

373
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:06,972
That's awesome!

374
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:08,182
In my next video,

375
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:11,082
I star as the school nurse
in an all-boys high school.

376
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:13,072
Will you rehearse with me, Nobu?

377
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,182
Nurse uniform...

378
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:15,582
It's boring!

379
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,492
Hey, don't pout just because
you can't win.

380
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:19,182
What are you, a kid?

381
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:22,022
Go ahead, call me a kid.
Time for revenge, Yasu.

382
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:23,592
Aren't you gonna play, Nana?

383
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,792
- I will later. I'm at a good part.
- Does Yasu always sleep in a yukata?

384
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:26,932
Does he starch it himself?

385
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:28,302
- I don't know why,
- The more you know about Yasu,

386
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:30,032
- but Yuri's practically giving Nobuo...
- the more he becomes a mystery.

387
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,932
- a free pass to do it with her,
- It's best not to try and figure him out.

388
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,662
so I'd better stay outta this.

389
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,872
I can't butt in.

390
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,172
HACHI
OCTOBER 2622:31
TOMORROW FROM 6:15, THEY'RE
HAVING THE FIREWORKS FESTIVAL
AT TAMAGAWA THAT GOT
CANCELED LAST SUMMER
BECAUSE OF THE TYPHOON.
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM.
I WAS THINKING HOW GREAT
IT WOULD BE IF WE COULD ALL...

391
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:43,902
Hey Nobu, don't you have a girlfriend?

392
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,982
I had one, but she dumped me.

393
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:48,012
Really? Then you must be lonely.

394
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:48,712
Yes.

395
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,142
I'd sure like to comfort you.

396
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:52,652
POURING

397
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:52,922
DECLARING HIMSELF

398
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,922
DECLARING HIMSELF
I'm lonely too, Yuri.

399
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:54,992
DECLARING HIMSELF

400
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,222
DECLARING HIMSELF
What are you saying, baldy?!

401
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,822
I'm joking.

402
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:58,922
Well then, a threesome!

403
00:17:59,032 --> 00:17:59,822
No way!

404
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:00,462
No way!

405
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,402
NO WAY!
No way!

406
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,162
Hey, Nobuo.

407
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:06,062
Why are you talking like Hachiko?

408
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,232
Oh no...

409
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,502
The beautiful Yuri is starting
to look like Hachi.

410
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:10,002
Even her hairstyle is kinda similar.

411
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,042
HALLUCINATING?
Even her hairstyle is kinda similar.

412
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:11,712
AND SIMILAR PAJAMAS TOO...
Even her hairstyle is kinda similar.

413
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:11,942
AND SIMILAR PAJAMAS TOO...

414
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:11,972
AND SIMILAR PAJAMAS TOO...
Hey, Yasu. Do you know what
our schedule is for tomorrow?

415
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:14,532
Hey, Yasu. Do you know what
our schedule is for tomorrow?

416
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,882
Ginpei was telling us on
our way back, remember?

417
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,642
In the morning,
we're giving comments to be aired on TV.

418
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:22,342
In the afternoon,
there's a photo shoot for posters,

419
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,352
at six, we have a magazine interview,

420
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,412
and then at ten, we'll be on
a live radio show.

421
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:30,152
That sounds tough.
You should probably get to bed.

422
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,362
No, I won't let you win and run.

423
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,282
I'll exact Shin's revenge.

424
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:37,232
Talk big all you want
while you still can.

425
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:38,002
THEY'RE OUT OF CHARACTER

426
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,172
THEY'RE OUT OF CHARACTER
Can't we cancel that interview at six?

427
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:40,502
Can't we cancel that interview at six?

428
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:41,632
What are you saying?!

429
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,172
Can't we do it some other day?

430
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:43,802
Impossible!

431
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:48,502
But Hachi's just invited us all
to the fireworks festival.

432
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,312
Who's... this Hachi?

433
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,722
TOMORROW FROM 6:15,
THEY'RE HAVING THE FIREWORKS
FESTIVAL AT TAMAGAWA THAT
GOT CANCELED LAST SUMMER
BECAUSE OF THE TYPHOON.

434
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,782
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM.
I WAS THINKING HOW GREAT
IT WOULD BE IF WE COULD
ALL GO TOGETHER. BUT I GUESS
I AM DREAMING TO THINK THAT.

435
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:06,992
Nobuo!

436
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,962
You'll go, right? Or rather, we're going!

437
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,222
Nana, calm down.

438
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,432
You can't! You've got work, right?!

439
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:18,802
If it's a magazine interview,
I'm sure they'll reschedule if you ask.

440
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,812
But it doesn't seem like such
a good idea

441
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:22,212
for all of them to go out
in public.

442
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,372
It'll be fine if they disguise themselves.

443
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:26,282
Shin! Hurry and text her back!

444
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,622
BUT...
Shin! Hurry and text her back!

445
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:27,652
BUT...

446
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:27,982
BUT...
What should I say?

447
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:28,512
What should I say?

448
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,612
Six o'clock in room 707.

449
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:32,882
I haven't been home
in nearly two months.

450
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,092
Those mosquitoes would
surely have left by now.

451
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,732
RE: TOMORROW
WE'LL BE WAITING IN
ROOM 707 AT 6:00.
WE'LL ALL BE THERE.
LET'S HOPE THE SKY'S
CLEAR THIS TIME!

452
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,602
It's not a dream, Hachi.

453
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:56,802
We can spend time and laugh together
like we did back then.

454
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:58,972
We can start over.

455
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,642
Please let me start over.

456
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,352
We'll return to that summer day and

457
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:08,792
rewrite the scenario together
for our bright future!

458
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:14,722
Hey, Takumi...

459
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:15,892
Hm?

460
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,772
There's something I wanna ask you.

461
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:20,062
What?

462
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:21,602
Nana and I wanna...

463
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:22,332
Shit!

464
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,342
The damn thing froze on me!

465
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:27,602
I'm tired.

466
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:28,382
Something's coming out of you.

467
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:29,512
HIS SOUL? SHOO...
Something's coming out of you.

468
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,912
What did you wanna ask me?
Does it hafta be right now?

469
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,272
Actually, I think right now's
not such a good time.

470
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,282
Oh, but I do have one question.

471
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,222
What?

472
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,752
That ring you bought for Hachiko.

473
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,182
Where did you get it,
and what kind was it?

474
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:45,832
Hey, Hachi.

475
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,902
Who could've imagined
in their wildest dreams

476
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,802
that the day would come
when you and I,

477
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:52,432
with completely different tastes,

478
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,872
would each be wearing
a matching set of treasures?

479
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:59,032
I know you're fickle
and crave new things.

480
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,732
But I hope you still treasure it
even now...

481
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:06,952
That generic-looking ring from
a high-end jewelry store.

482
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:13,552
Alone and heartbroken

483
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:19,992
Tears falling down feel cold

484
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:25,932
A dark night lasting too long

485
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:30,772
Wakes up

486
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:37,542
It's too sad and painful

487
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,852
I gave up everything

488
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:48,482
But you loved me anyway

489
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:52,592
Kiss me and stay with me

490
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:56,192
A flower blooming forever

491
00:21:56,762 --> 00:22:01,722
Light, fragile, strong

492
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,542
How could you smile for me

493
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,802
I need nothing else

494
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:14,172
Just stand by me forever
