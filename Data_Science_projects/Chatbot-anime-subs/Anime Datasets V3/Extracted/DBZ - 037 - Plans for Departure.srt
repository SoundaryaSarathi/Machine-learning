00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,260
Yow!

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,262
" Science"

3
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,767
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, you're goin' to catch up
with everythin' that you've fallen behind on.

4
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,383
Anything but that!

5
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:07,626
What's the matter, Kuririn?
You're trembling.

6
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,560
I- it's nothing.

7
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:20,639
Oww!

8
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:24,905
All we're doing is changing his bandages.
What a loud patient this is.

9
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,986
On second thought, I shouldn't be here.
We have to find that Saiyan spaceship quickly.

10
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:39,991
Let Bulma handle that. You need to hurry
and recover from your injuries.

11
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,992
B- but...

12
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:44,329
We never know when that Saiyan
is going to attack again.

13
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,998
You need to completely
recover before that happens.

14
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,334
Gohan-<i>chan</i> is not havin'
anythin' to do with that anymore!

15
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:52,604
I'm not lettin' him get into any more
dangerous situations like that again!

16
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:54,606
Next, please.

17
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,609
M- my injuries aren't all
that serious, so...

18
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,270
Neither are mine!

19
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,210
Now, look here!

20
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,719
You've got to get treated properly,
or you're not goin' to get any better!

21
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,287
Come on, Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

22
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,380
No, anything but this!

23
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,564
Wow, we're lucky.

24
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:24,302
They said that after Gohan and I spend
three days in the hospital, we'll be fine.

25
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:28,973
You've got me beat. They said it would be
four months before my injuries heal.

26
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,743
They also said I might not
be back to my former self.

27
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:39,317
Hey, not to worry. In another month,
I'll have some new Senzu beans.

28
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:42,987
You know, you look
just like a mummy in there.

29
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:47,325
Tch! I went through all that nastiness,
and they ain't even gonna keep me here.

30
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,994
You're just after the
hospital's food, aren't you?

31
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:53,932
When Yajirobe thought he was going
to be done in by that Saiyan,

32
00:02:53,932 --> 00:03:00,605
he was like, " Sorry 'bout that! I got lotsa
respect for ya! Lemme be your friend!"

33
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,607
Why, you! What're ya talkin' 'bout!?

34
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:05,371
I was just sayin' that
to get him off his guard!

35
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:11,950
Well, in any case,
you all really done well!

36
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,287
Nothin' could make me happier. And everyone
who's dead is comin' back to life, too.

37
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:20,291
Mm-hmm, that is, if we can
get to Planet Namek.

38
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,294
It will be all right,
that's for sure!

39
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:26,229
Hey, everyone!
The TV! Watch the TV!

40
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:35,974
Oh, it's you, Bulma! I thought
you were some weird nurse.

41
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:39,978
Shut up, would you?
Here, watch the TV.

42
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:42,981
<i>According to those</i>
<i>who found it, this object,</i>

43
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,984
<i>which was discovered</i>
<i>in the devastation of Metro East,</i>

44
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:50,989
<i>appears to be a vehicle that came from space,</i>
<i>though that cannot be determined.</i>

45
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,257
That's the Saiyan's!

46
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,258
It sure is!

47
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,260
I- I can't see!

48
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,596
<i>Apparently, when this object</i>
<i>was found, there were two of them,</i>

49
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:02,267
<i>but soon after, one of them</i>
<i>suddenly flew away from the scene.</i>

50
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:07,272
This is bad. Those scientists
have already carried it away.

51
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:08,940
W- what do we do?

52
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,708
This should be interesting.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,946
Let's use the remote control that
Kuririn brought back, and call it here!

54
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,549
That will surprise them, I'm sure.

55
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,284
Are you sure
that's going to work?

56
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:25,290
What are you talking about? I'm a genius!
I thoroughly checked it out last night.

57
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,723
Watch this.

58
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:35,967
It's nice that we can watch it right here
on TV, huh? Okay, beep, beep, beep...

59
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,401
Ready? It's going to start moving...

60
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,739
I want to see, too!

61
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,588
<i>W</i>- <i>what in the world</i>
<i>could have happened here!?</i>

62
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,258
<i>T</i>- <i>the object suddenly</i>
<i>exploded! What happened?</i>

63
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>There is wreckage</i>
<i>from the object all over!</i>

64
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,355
It can't be!

65
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,203
W- why? Could that have been
the self-destruct switch?

66
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:22,213
What do we do!? Without that spaceship,
we can't go to Planet Namek!

67
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,215
Our last hope...

68
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,551
Completely wiped out.

69
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,214
I- it's hopeless now...

70
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:41,392
This <i>is</i> a problem. I probably couldn't
get there using Kinto Un, either.

71
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:53,177
This is your fault for picking up
strange remote controls!

72
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:57,181
Bulma-<i>san</i>, you're the one who was
hasty to push those switches.

73
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:58,516
Well...

74
00:05:58,516 --> 00:05:59,642
Hey.

75
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,524
Mister Popo!

76
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:07,684
Hey there.

77
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,359
W- what the!?

78
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,537
Someone come with me.
There is spaceship.

79
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:23,875
A- a spaceship?
You really have one, Popo-<i>san</i>?

80
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,878
Probably.

81
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:29,547
--W- who is that?
--Mister Popo.

82
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:31,549
Mister Popo?

83
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,551
He stays at Kami-<i>sama</i>'s place.

84
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:36,387
But he's been there at Kami's palace

85
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,379
since long before this current
Kami-<i>sama</i> was ever there.

86
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,228
Say, what do you mean, " probably" ?

87
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,718
Probably, it is...

88
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:53,171
...spaceship. But Mister Popo
not know for sure.

89
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:58,509
Someone come with me to check.
Mister Popo show way.

90
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,908
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

91
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:04,582
--Me!?
--Well, Bulma-<i>san</i>,

92
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:07,073
nobody else would know
if it's a spaceship.

93
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,426
Bulma-<i>san</i>?

94
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:29,433
Would I be all right? I mean, doesn't
that man have a dangerous look in his eye?

95
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,776
--What is that!?
--There's someone riding it!
--What is it!?

96
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,960
Bulma, what's taking you
so long? Hurry and hop on!

97
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:17,582
Oh, no! Save me!

98
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,858
I'm falling down!

99
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:23,759
I'm done for!
I'm going to die!

100
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,882
We're counting on you, Bulma!

101
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:50,221
Be careful. I'm not like
those guys. I'm delicate, okay?

102
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,889
Okay, we go.

103
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,619
Easy... easy, now...

104
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,231
H- how did he
do that just now?

105
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:05,897
Still, what kind of spaceship is it?
Could there really be one?

106
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:33,931
Here.

107
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,091
Already?

108
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,217
Get off.

109
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,618
W- where is this?
It's pretty cold.

110
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,224
Yunzabit Highlands.

111
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,794
Y- Yunzabit!?

112
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,562
That's the ends of the earth, you know!

113
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,566
You mean, we came this far
in that one instant?

114
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,235
Here, maybe...

115
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,238
This way, maybe...

116
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,069
W- wait up!

117
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,580
Say, do you mean there's
something like a spaceship here?

118
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,416
Hey, are you listening to me?

119
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,942
You haven't brought me here
to this far-flung place...

120
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,275
...for the purpose of doing
anything indecent to me, right?

121
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,884
H- hang on!

122
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,219
Hurry up.

123
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:04,382
Y- you're kidding, right?
I can't do that!

124
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:07,714
Geez...

125
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,395
This thing.

126
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,255
Is this spaceship?

127
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:39,416
I- I'll have to examine it...

128
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:52,203
What is this? It's not metal.
Could this be?

129
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:55,934
Hang on, what's going on?
Tell me what this is, exactly!

130
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,551
About 100 years ago, Kami-<i>sama</i>
told Mister Popo of old times.

131
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,553
Strange story.

132
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:15,893
Kami-<i>sama</i> said lived here in Yunzabit
when child. Mister Popo asked him...

133
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:21,899
" Yunzabit remote region. People
not live there, so why you there?"

134
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,238
I don't know why I was there.
I must have hit my head,

135
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,908
and lost all of my
memories up to that point.

136
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,576
Had no parents?

137
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:38,582
No, I didn't. All I had was a letter
that said they would be coming later.

138
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,919
What does that mean? I don't see
where this story is going.

139
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:49,593
Kami-<i>sama</i> as child waited long time for
parents. Not knew what happened, but waited.

140
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:52,863
I had my house there in Yunzabit, after all.

141
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,535
I trusted that my parents
would surely return there.

142
00:12:57,535 --> 00:13:03,541
However, no matter how long I waited,
nobody ever came. It was hard on me.

143
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:09,547
There was hardly anything there to eat,
either. How long did I wait there?

144
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:14,885
20 years? No, it must
have been 30 years.

145
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:19,890
Finally, I gave up, and, leaving
my house behind, I left Yunzabit.

146
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,895
Once in a while, I went back to see how it
was doing, but there was never any change.

147
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:28,899
So, what does that
have to do with this?

148
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,062
You impatient.
Here come point of story.

149
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:38,242
But you know, thinking back
on it now, it was a strange house.

150
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,745
I didn't realize it until I had
learned more about the world,

151
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,581
but that house was really quite unusual.

152
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:47,918
It was round, with four legs,
and looked almost like an insect.

153
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:53,190
Its door didn't have any knobs or locks,
but would open when a word was spoken to it.

154
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,420
" Piccolo."

155
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,022
An entrance!

156
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,036
Get up on there.

157
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,552
This is Kami-<i>sama</i>'s house?

158
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,554
Say again to close.

159
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,044
" Piccolo."

160
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:45,736
Look close. This not house,
but rather, spaceship?

161
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,914
That's right!
Kami-<i>sama</i> is a Namekian!

162
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,582
That Kaio person said that long ago,

163
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:55,186
Planet Namek went through some abnormal
weather, and they nearly died out.

164
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,589
Mister Popo also heard
Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s voice speaking.

165
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,858
Then remembered story of this house.

166
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,529
Thought " what if," came here
searching, and this here.

167
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,201
If this really is a spaceship, then your
story earlier would indeed be consistent.

168
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,870
When Planet Namek had bad time,

169
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,541
Kami-<i>sama</i>'s parents put child
Kami-<i>sama</i> aboard, sent to Earth.

170
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,545
His parents meant to escape afterward,
when they were able to,

171
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,547
but there was some kind of accident...

172
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,883
which is to say, they died...

173
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,888
That's it! After all, no matter how you look
at this thing, it doesn't seem like a house.

174
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,721
This has to be a spaceship!

175
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,897
But even if that's so,
can we use it or not?

176
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,901
The door moved, so it
has to have power, right?

177
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,903
Is this the main switch?

178
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,565
Nope. Well, what about this?

179
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,179
It's not this, either.

180
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:59,183
That's odd. I wonder if there's
a code number or something.

181
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:01,852
Sure, that's it. If it
worked as easily as that,

182
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:06,190
then when Kami-<i>sama</i> was a child,
he would have tried pushing them, too.

183
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,027
It looks like this thing
doesn't work using switches.

184
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:13,531
I wonder if Bulma-<i>san</i>
will really find anything for us.

185
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:16,200
All we can do now is pray.

186
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,862
<i>We're counting on you,</i>
<i>Bulma. This is for everyone.</i>

187
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,541
I don't get it.

188
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,544
Could it be some kind of sensor?

189
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:27,878
Voice?

190
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,881
Yes! Like with the entrance! Words!

191
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,217
Say what? " Piccolo" ?

192
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:37,888
Not that! After all, that's the password
you use for going in and out.

193
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:41,551
Work! Do you hear me?
Fly! Let me see you fly!

194
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:48,897
It's no use. The language is different.
You have to speak Namekian.

195
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,737
After all, back at that
Tenkaichi Tournament,

196
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:57,070
Kami-<i>sama</i> and Piccolo spoke
in that strange language.

197
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,518
That must be the Namekian language.

198
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:11,522
Supposing that Namekian language,
Mister Popo knows those words.

199
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:12,189
Really!?

200
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:19,530
Really. " Piccolo" means " other world"
in those words. That why password for door.

201
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,200
Why didn't you say so sooner?

202
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,539
So that's it. " Piccolo Daimao" means
the Demon King of Another World.

203
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,875
Try saying something
in Namekian. Tell it to fly.

204
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,544
Fly where?

205
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,546
Anywhere is fine!

206
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,946
I know, how about
around Jupiter for now?

207
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:43,452
It says " acknowledged."

208
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:10,078
What is this!? Doesn't this
spaceship have any safety belts!?

209
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,853
What is that thing!?

210
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:19,414
Just now, you said
"want to go toilet" in Namekian.

211
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,084
You said " safety belt," right?

212
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:28,430
This is all too complicated!
We have to be careful what we say!

213
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,269
" Complicated" means " time for bed."

214
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:09,232
Incredible! It's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

215
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:14,066
We did it!
We did it, we did it!

216
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,745
Thank goodness.
Now Kami-<i>sama</i> come back to life.

217
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,923
<i>A spaceship has been found.</i>

218
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:30,587
<i>Now all that remains</i>
<i>is a departure for Planet Namek.</i>
