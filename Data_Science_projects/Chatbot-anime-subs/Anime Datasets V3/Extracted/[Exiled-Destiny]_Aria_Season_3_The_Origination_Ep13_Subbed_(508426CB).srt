1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,100
That far off future was suddenly upon us...

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,370
And soon, it too will become a passing memory.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,540
Alicia, the future always has
a worried look on its face.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,010
So let's go greet it with a smile, together.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,680
Akari...

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,990
Alicia, good morning.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,490
My, good morning, Akari.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,230
Umm... I put on my uniform.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,190
My, my!

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,490
Yes, it looks great on you!

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,270
W-What is it?

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,910
I'm just happy, that's all.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,080
We heard!
We heard!

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,980
Ah, yeah. I've become a Prima, too.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,260
Ah, yeah, congratulations.

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,920
Really congratulations.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,690
Ehh? That's it?

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,260
This is no time for that!

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,230
Is it true that Alicia's retiring
because she's getting married?

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,760
Is it true?

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,260
Yeah.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,540
That's not the only reason
for her retirement, though.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,950
Apparently the Gondola Association has wanted
Alicia to be a Managing Director for a while now.

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,890
They said they'd like her to work
not only for the future of the Aria Company,

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,220
but for the future of the
entire Water Guide Industry.

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,190
But regardless of how amazing Alicia is,
it's impossible for her to hold both jobs.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,230
Apparently she asked them
to wait until I became a Prima.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,470
I was really surprised about her marriage, too.

29
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,570
I think she was waiting on that as well,
until I became a Prima.

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,280
If only I had been more dependable...

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,580
Ah, it's the phone.

32
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,820
Hello, this is the Aria...

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,620
Sideburns!!
Hello, this is the Aria...

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,120
Sideburns!!

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,660
Akatsuki...

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,860
Is A-A-A-Alicia really getting m-m-m-married?

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,900
It's not true, right? Please tell me it's not true!

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,060
It's true.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,940
We've been getting a storm of inquiries
by phone and email all morning.

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,570
I wonder where everyone
is hearing the news from?

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,380
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

42
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,690
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,840
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,610
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

45
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:11,150
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

46
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,380
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

47
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,960
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,340
As the days begin to swirl in brilliant colors
Azayaka ni mawaridashita hibi

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,480
Always and forever, they're filled with love
Itsumo itsudemo ai ga michiteita

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Surely, it's a spiral
Kitto supiraare

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:53,290
The days passed by, each one filled with warmth
Atataka na mainichi o kasanetara

52
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:02,400
And before I knew it, off in the distance...
Itsunomanika tooku ni

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,360
...there you were
Kiteita no ne

54
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,280
To That New Beginning...

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,120
So?

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,890
Are you all right?

57
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,820
Huh?

58
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,130
Ah, yeah.

59
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,120
Alicia said she'd stay until
things calm down at the company.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,200
And the association will be handling
her retirement ceremony, so...

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,910
That's not what we mean, Akari.
Are you all right?

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,680
We're really worried.

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah.

64
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,070
Thank you, Aika, Alice.

65
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm sure...

66
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,380
...I'll be fine.

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,310
Yes...

68
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm sure...

69
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,360
Ever since the day she
told me about her retirement,

70
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,040
I've been really busy with a lot of things.

71
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,100
The days have become really hectic.

72
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,510
But Alicia is always smiling.

73
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,720
Not one thing has changed about our days here.

74
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,360
Time is passing by like it always has.

75
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,820
These are gentle...

76
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,230
...and happy days.

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,590
Alicia is here.

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,900
President Aria is here.

79
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,240
And I'm here.

80
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,210
That's why I'll be all right.

81
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,750
Huh?

82
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
What did this number mean, again?

83
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm sorry, Alicia. About this document...

84
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,900
Alicia?

85
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,970
Alicia...

86
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,100
There was something in that document
I didn't understand, so I was looking for you.

87
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,560
A customer had brought me flowers, so...

88
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,770
I see...

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,070
Huh?

90
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,080
It's because no one wants you to retire.

91
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,950
Your customers... The people of this city...

92
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Everyone really... really loves you, Alicia!

93
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,270
You're one of the Three Great Water Fairies...

94
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,210
You're always kind...

95
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,840
You're everyone's Snow White...

96
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,980
That's why everyone wants you to stay...

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,750
Huh? I'm sorry.

98
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,590
I wonder why?

99
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,320
My tears... They won't stop...

100
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,900
Alicia...

101
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,800
The truth is...

102
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:08,940
The truth is, you've had the skill to
become a Prima for a long time now.

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,920
But I was afraid of losing the
cherished time I've spent with you.

104
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,760
As your mentor, I knew I had to be strong...

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,960
...and that I had to make up my mind.

106
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,830
I kept thinking that, but I couldn't do it.

107
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,860
This is all because of my selfishness.

108
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm so sorry.

109
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,340
Alicia...

110
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,770
I'm sorry, too.

111
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,960
So many things happened at once...

112
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,590
They're all such wonderful things,
and I should be really happy, but...

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,130
Akari.

114
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,740
I've always known that times
and places change, but...

115
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,740
...deep down, that thought has
always made me worried and afraid.

116
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,360
As we walked together, it always
felt like we were all on the same path.

118
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,730
But really, we were all on our
own separate paths, weren't we?

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,430
I...

120
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,040
I walked down my own path...

121
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,350
...came to Aqua...

122
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,370
...and here I met you, and everyone.

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,450
I...

124
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,750
I want to see everyone's wonderful
futures that await them down this path.

125
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,290
That's why...

126
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,360
...I have to see you off with a smile.

127
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,780
Thank you, Akari.

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,140
Let's do our best today too, President Aria!

129
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Our first booking today is a Mr. Namihei Anno.

130
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,210
Hey.

131
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,450
Huh?!

132
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,300
So that's your name, Mr. Postman.

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah.

134
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,800
Do you have the day off from work today?

135
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,840
Huh?

136
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,930
I've also retired from my post.

137
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,950
From now on, I'll be working
at the office as a supervisor.

138
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,910
I see.

139
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,650
Thank you for your hard work all these years.

140
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,960
It's delicious.

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,590
It's buckwheat tea.

142
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,120
Oh!

143
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,460
So your alias is Aquamarine?

144
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,450
Yes.

145
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,400
It's a good name.

146
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:19,370
I'm really happy that you're a Prima now,
and I can take a ride in your gondola!

147
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Are you lonely at all?

148
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,450
Alicia has stayed on this whole time
while I adjust to running the company.

149
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,110
I see.

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,520
But when tomorrow's retirement
ceremony is over, I really will be alone.

151
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,590
You'll be all right.

152
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,620
You have this entire city on your side.

153
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,620
Yes.

154
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,690
It's really delicious.

155
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,340
Thanks to Mr. Postman's recommendation,

156
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,080
I have a booking for tomorrow, as well.

157
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,510
My, my.

158
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,720
Also, the owner of Caffè Florian and
the Campanile caretaker recommended me,

159
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,620
so I received a few bookings from that, as well.

160
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,060
I see.

161
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,950
I feel like...

162
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,160
...I'm being helped in all sorts
of ways, by a lot of people.

163
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,270
Your Aria Company has
already begun, hasn't it?

164
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,770
My...

165
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,710
...Aria Company...

166
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,210
Alicia!

167
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,590
How's it going? Are you
done with the preparations?

168
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:54,000
I see you gazing up at the endless sky
Dokomademo tsuzuku kono sora nagameteru yokogao

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,340
I see you gazing up at the endless sky
Dokomademo tsuzuku kono sora nagameteru yokogao
It's time.

170
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,700
I see you gazing up at the endless sky
Dokomademo tsuzuku kono sora nagameteru yokogao

171
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,640
I see you gazing up at the endless sky
Dokomademo tsuzuku kono sora nagameteru yokogao
Yeah.

172
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:08,210
Your long hair brushes your cheeks as it sways in the wind
Hoho ni fureru nagai kami ga yureteiru

173
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,780
Though this heartache can't be expressed with words,
Setsunasa wa kotoba ni naranai keredo

174
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,960
As I always have, both now and forevermore...
Ano koro mo ima mo zutto

175
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,400
...here in this city, overflowing with light,
Hikari afureteru kono machi ni

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,810
I'll gather up these feelings that will never change
Itsumademo kawaranu omoi o yosete

177
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,650
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki

178
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,320
I can always feel the wind as it sweeps past
Fukinukeru kaze wa itsudemo

179
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:58,400
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

180
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,830
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita
Alicia... This can't be true!

181
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,900
Alicia... This can't be true!

182
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,170
Akatsukin, are you crying?

183
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,110
They're tears of joy, right?

184
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,510
Shut up!
They're tears of joy, right?

185
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,880
Shut up!

186
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,480

188
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:19,940
We spoke a little while ago, it was a moment full of smiles
Sakki made futari hanashita hohoemi no hitotoki

189
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:31,250
These nostalgic, happy days... I'm leaving them behind
Natsukashikute tanoshii hibi nokoshiteku

190
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,470
There's just one thing I'm praying for
Hitotsu dake negai o komete inoru no

191
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,600
A bridge to connect our hearts
Kokoro o tsunagu kake hashi

192
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,390
As you cross that bridge,
Ano sanbashi no mukougawa e

193
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,830
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi

194
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:09,270
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

195
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:18,580
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru

196
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,810
Of that I'm certain
Sou kitto

197
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:37,490
My heart races like the rhythm of the waves
Takanaru kodou wa namima o utau rizumu

198
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:48,130
As I discover that intangible certainty
Katachi no nai tashika na mono mitsukete

199
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,770
Congratulations on your
promotion to Prima, Alicia!

200
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,920
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki

201
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,590
I can always feel the wind as it sweeps past
Fukinukeru kaze wa itsudemo

202
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:17,810
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

203
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:26,080
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

204
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,350

Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
Snow?

205
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,450
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

206
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,250
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
But it's not the right season yet...

207
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,990
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
But it's not the right season yet...

208
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,820

Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
She truly is Snow White, isn't she?

209
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,190
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru

216
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,700
Good morning, President Aria.

217
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
Alicia...

218
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,620
Oh, it's been a while since I've had
hot cocoa with whipped cream!

219
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
I want extra cream on mine!

220
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,950
My, my.

221
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,430
You're really like a selfish little kid, Athena.

222
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,900
Okay, here comes the walnut bread!

223
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,960
The cookies are fresh out of the oven, too!

224
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,200
Why?

225
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,400
Everyone's here...

226
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,230
I see.

227
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:42,310
This place is still filled with
all those fun memories we shared.

228
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,620
Opening this shutter is my first task of the day.

229
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,460
If I open it now, my usual day will begin.

230
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,690
This precious mirage
will vanish in the morning air.

231
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,670
But...

232
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,370
...that's okay.

233
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,550
Because today is a new beginning!

234
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,790
"Dear Ai, shall I tell you
how everyone is doing?"

235
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,830
The gentle wind strokes my cheek
Hoho o naderu yasashii kaze

236
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,100
The gentle wind strokes my cheek
Hoho o naderu yasashii kaze
Good morning!

"Lately, Woody the Sylph has been bringing me
freshly laid eggs before he goes to work."

"Apparently he's started raising
chickens at his home in Ukijima."

Aika?

244
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,950
I sway among the sound of waves
Namioto ni yurarete

"she's adjusted to her position well,

"I heard Al was promoted recently,
so he's no longer an apprentice."

252
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,330
I close my eyes, and then I can see...
