1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,690
Something seems off.
It just somehow felt that way.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,340
And this one's... a left fly ball.
One out, with the score still seven to zero.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,740
And this one's... a left fly ball.
One out, with the score still seven to zero.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:11,840
And this one's... a left fly ball.
One out, with the score still seven to zero.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,810
And this one's... a left fly ball.
One out, with the score still seven to zero.
But I ended up
watching it anyways.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:12,910
But I ended up
watching it anyways.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,840
The gap between the
scores is big,
but I ended up
watching it anyways.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:13,940
The gap between the
scores is big,

9
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,010
The gap between the
scores is big,
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,110
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

11
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,280
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that

12
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,970

Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

13
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,320
The passionate voices cheering from the
third base bleachers have not died down.

14
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,590
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

15
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,860
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

16
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,260
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

17
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,420
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
I know, you don't have
to tell me.

18
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,860
I know, you don't have
to tell me.

19
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,990
That's true.
I know, you don't have
to tell me.

20
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,290
I know, you don't have
to tell me.

21
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,030
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.

After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.
Kyon, you're not doing
anything today, right?

24
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:36,700
Right.

25
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,170
Right.
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

26
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:38,270
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

27
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,870
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

Be sure to show up.

30
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,630
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

31
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,640
After last year's summer tournament, he
was chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

I didn't even

I didn't even
say anything...

34
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,740
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

36
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,450
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...

37
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,210
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
What?

38
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,310
And there's Suzuki

39
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,450
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

40
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,150
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

41
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,880
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

42
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,790
And be sure-

43
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,020
That was a good pitch.
And be sure-

44
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,120
That was a good pitch.

45
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,190
That was a good pitch.
To bring my bike, right?

46
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:58,290
To bring my bike, right?

47
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,720
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
To bring my bike, right?

48
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,460
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

49
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,660
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
That's right.
You've got it.

50
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:01,760
That's right.
You've got it.

51
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,290
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
That's right.
You've got it.

53
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,530
Perhaps he feels like

If you're late,
you're paying again.

54
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:04,630
If you're late,
you're paying again.

55
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,990
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
If you're late,
you're paying again.

56
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,100
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...

57
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,600
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
Why did I know about
the bike thing just now?

58
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,360
Why did I know about
the bike thing just now?

59
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,600
It's a hit!
And it's a big one!

60
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,100
It's headed for
left field...

61
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
It's headed for
left field...
I think that one's
going to make it.

62
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,910
And it's good!

63
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,100
And it's good!
See?

64
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,580
It's a single-run home run! And with this,
Jyonan's gotten their eighth run!

65
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,550
It's a single-run home run! And with this,
Jyonan's gotten their eighth run!
I wonder where
I put my swimsuit.

66
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,440
This gives them
yet another point.
Summer's almost over.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,340
Sorry I'm late.

89
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,410
I just got here, too.

90
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,810
Jeez. Show some more
motivation.

91
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,410
- Okay, we're all here, so let's go.
- Where are we going?

92
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

93
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,690
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

94
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,960
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

95
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,920
We can never get back
the time that we've lost!

96
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,400
And so we're going to do them now, in our
one and only summer as tenth graders.

97
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,240
- Hey, Kyon! Are you listening?
- Y-Yeah.

98
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,000
By the way, we're going
to the pool by bike.

99
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,870
Okay. Where did you
park your bikes?

100
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,570
No, the only two bikes we have
are yours and mine.

101
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,020
In other words. You're saying.
This is what you meant!?

102
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,590
Kyon, you'd better not lose
to Koizumi.

103
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,820
This train is leaving
the station!

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
You demon!
You fiend!

105
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,190
Come on, Kyon! We're about to go have
fun. This is no time to be exhausted.

106
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,530
Whose fault do you
think this is?

107
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,160
Yeah, look at all
the people.

108
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,930
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

109
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,870
Come on, let's find a place to
put our stuff and get swimming!

110
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:11,910
Hey, wait-

111
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,980
No diving
It's dangerous!
Hey, wait-

112
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,150
No diving
It's dangerous!

113
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,710
Can't she read the "no diving" signs
posted everywhere?

114
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,380
The water's warm
so it feels fine!

115
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,190
Mikuru! Yuki!
Get in here!

116
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,260
Please go on ahead. We'll never hear
the end of it if we leave her be.

117
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay, then...

118
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,490
Please wait up,
Miss Suzumiya!

119
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,300
Oh, you're so slow!

120
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,770
Oh, wait, please don't pull-

121
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,200
This just feels kind of peaceful,
you know?

122
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,010
I mean Miss Suzumiya.

123
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,550
She has some rather normal ways of
enjoying her time, don't you think?

124
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,350
Calling out of the blue to invite someone
out to do something and only giving

125
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,050
a general idea of what's going to
happen isn't what I'd call "normal".

126
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,460
In my opinion,
that's really nothing.

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,490
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

128
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,900
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

129
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,200
I hope that's the case...

130
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,230
What's wrong?

131
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,870
It's nothing...

132
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,210
It's probably just
my imagination.

133
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,580
Because so much has happened
since the beginning of spring,

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,380
I've become
a little paranoid.

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,890
That's weird.
Him, too?

136
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,370
Hey now, stop and let me
catch you already!

137
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,070
Yeesh.
Hey now, stop and let me
catch you already!

138
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,970
I think it would be better to call this place
a communal pool than a public pool.

139
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,280
That's where she's been?

140
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,820
What's she doing over there
by herself?

141
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,350
What the...

142
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,220
What is this feeling?

143
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,530
It feels like I've seen this scene...
Seen Nagato like this once before...

144
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,060
Kyon!

145
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,630
Haruhi...

146
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,400
Right, and then Haruhi
says this...

147
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,670
"These two are my brigade members.
They'll do anything you ask, so ask-"

148
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,440
For anything you want!

149
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,480
We're going to play water soccer.
Everyone has to join in. Yuki!

150
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,110
Have I gained precognitive powers
or something?

151
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,720
Here's the ball,
Kyon.

152
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,520
Doesn't seem that way.

153
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,060
I guess it happens every now and then.
Deja vu isn't all that uncommon.

154
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,570
I thought about what we'll be doing
from here on.

155
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,560
What is that?

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,300
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

157
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,870
- There're just two weeks of vacation left.
- All this, in under two weeks?

158
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,540
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,810
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping...

160
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,650
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

161
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,090
Pardon me
for a moment.

162
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,160
Thank you.

163
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay then,
we're starting tomorrow!

164
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,230
Is there a place nearby with a Bon festival?
A fireworks show works, too.

165
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll check around.
I'll contact you when I find out.

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,370
Don't forget about
the goldfish scooping!

167
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,240
It's Mikuru's one request,
after all.

168
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,310
I'm paying again?

169
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,880
I told you that you were going to pay
if you were late, didn't I?

170
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,420
All right, then, we're done
for today! Bye!

171
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,980
- If you'll excuse me.
- I have to go, too...

172
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,180
Okay.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,690
Nagato.

174
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,600
Umm... no, it's
nothing important, but...

175
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,780
How have you been?
Everything fine?

176
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,540
Fine.

177
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,250
I see.
That's good to hear.

178
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,610
Right.

179
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,290
Well, that was it.
Sorry for stopping you.

180
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,230
What the heck?

181
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,300
Why did I talk
to her?

182
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,110
The next morning,
I got another call from Haruhi.

183
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,780
They found a place that was
holding a Bon festival.

184
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,440
It seems to be happening tonight
at a public park.

185
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,850
Sorry to keep you
waiting!

186
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,420
About time!

187
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,680
You all look wonderful.

188
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,420
Of course!
I chose these yukata, after all.

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,460
Especially Mikuru! Just what you
would expect from my choice!

190
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,000
- Miss Asahina, you look great... just great!
- Oh, you're making me blush...

191
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,910
Hmm, I wonder where the things
we care about are.

192
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,480
What the? It feels like
I've been here recently.

193
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,690
That tower, those vendors,
I kind of remember them...

194
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,310
Oh, Mikuru!

195
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,590
Look, they have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

196
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,380
Let's catch a bunch!

197
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
M-Miss Suzumiya,
please wait!

198
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,890
Shall we play, too?

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
Nah, I'll pass.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,030
What about you, Nagato?
Want to eat something?

201
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,210
You're interested
in that stuff?

202
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,380
- Which one?
- It's all right.

203
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,040
- This one.
- Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.

204
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,680
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

205
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,190
...so I thought it would be appropriate
for me to at least buy her that, but...

206
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,860
Thirteen!

207
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,530
But I don't need so many,
so I just kept one for each of us.

208
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,140
You can have one,
but only one.

209
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,770
Thanks.

210
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,410
Huh? What's with
the mask, Yuki?

211
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,340
I bought it.

212
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,950
I see.

213
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,240
Now then, next up
is fireworks!

214
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,680
Let's launch some fireworks
to end the day!

215
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,580
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

216
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,820
That's why I wanted
to forget about it,

217
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,560
but there was one thing
lingering in my mind.

218
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,930
Tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs.

219
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,090
Haruhi.

220
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,430
It's fine to want to play around, but are
you finished with your summer homework?

221
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,670
Homework?

222
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,500
You can finish homework like that
in just three days.

223
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,540
Wha-

224
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,110
You get that stuff out of the way so you can
have fun without having to worry about it.

225
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,310
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation.

226
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,780
Why is heaven
so unfair?

227
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,480
Everyone, tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

228
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,180
And we're only going
to catch cicadas!

229
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,890
This will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,130
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

231
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,430
Yay! Wait up!
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

232
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,900
Yay! Wait up!

233
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,740
Yay! Wait up!
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

234
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,070
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

235
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,440
I said, wait! I'm gonna get you!
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

236
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,500
I said, wait! I'm gonna get you!

237
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,740
I said, wait! I'm gonna get you!
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

238
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,100
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

239
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,510
but of course, or something to that effect,
the winner ended up being Haruhi.

240
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,870
A catch and release attitude
is important, right?

241
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,820
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

242
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,220
What are you expecting from a
short-lived insect like a cicada?

243
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,960
For some reason, I kind of feel like
Pandora opening her box.

244
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,470
The next day, we met up, and even though
we had no idea what was going on,

245
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,440
we ended up wearing frog costumes
and passing out balloons

246
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,980
in front of a supermarket
as our part-time job.

247
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,980
Now I know how the Gundam Virtue
feels after it's released its armor.

248
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,780
Good work, everyone.

249
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,180
What's with this difference
in how we're being treated?

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,660
Thanks for the hard work.
The manager is thankful.

251
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,990
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

252
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,390
This is it.

253
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,490
I've wanted this
for a while.

254
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,030
The owner said that he'd
give it to us for Mikuru's sake.

255
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,140
We worked, sweat pouring down
our foreheads, for that?

256
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,170
Let's hang this up in the
clubroom as a memento.

257
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,110
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

258
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,780
Umm... well... thank you
very much.

259
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,760
That night, a single phone call
stole me away from my slumber.

260
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,360
Shut up...

261
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,110
Shut up... Dammit...

262
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,540
Yes?

263
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,680
Kyon...

264
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,410
Miss Asahina?

265
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,020
Yes, it's me...

266
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,060
Something... very not good has...

267
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,220
At this rate, I...

268
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,330
- Umm...
- Hello, this is Koizumi.

269
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,390
Why are you with
Miss Asahina?

270
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,330
Certain circumstances
came up.

271
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,060
Would it be possible for you
to come join us right now?

272
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,270
I'll be right there!
I'll be ri~ght there!

273
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,240
Miss Asahina!

274
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,240
What in the world happened?

275
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,080
K-Kyon...

276
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,020
I... can't go back to the future...

277
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,230
The... the... the future?
I... can't go back to the future...

278
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,450
I... can't go back to the future...

279
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
In other words,
this is what's going on.

280
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,700
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

281
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,400
Even if you can say something as impossible
as that with a smile on your face...

282
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,740
Koizumi, do you realize
what you're saying?

283
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,480
I do. Much more than
I wish I did.

284
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,350
I had just been speaking
with Miss Asahina.

285
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,220
Call me too, when you
have talks with her.

286
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,350
And as a result, what we realized
was that recently,

287
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,720
the flow of time
was a bit strange.

288
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,500
You might want to credit this
to Miss Asahina.

289
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,460
Thanks to her,
I was able to confirm it.

290
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,860
Confirm what?

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,030
That we have experienced the same
span of time numerous times.

292
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,610
You said that earlier.

293
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,370
To be precise, we've been repeating
the time from August 17th to the 31 st.

294
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,380
We're in the middle of an
endless summer vacation.

295
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,350
Well, it is
summer vacation, but...

296
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,420
It's a never-ending
endless summer.

297
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,090
This world has lost all time
after September 1 st.

298
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,160
That is why Miss Asahina
cannot go back to the future.

299
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,600
I suppose you could say
that it's natural.

300
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,570
What's natural about there
being no future?

301
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,770
Who'd believe it?

302
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,850
We'd like for you to believe it,
at the very least.

303
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Are we trapped inside one of
those closed spaces?

304
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,790
No, that's not it.

305
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
A single portion of time
has been torn away.

306
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,160
At exactly the point when it becomes
midnight on August 31 st,

307
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,530
everything resets, and we go back
to August 17th. That's the process.

308
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,140
So you mean that time does
that thing that you mentioned.

309
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,070
Well, we do have someone from the future
here, I guess it can't be helped.

310
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,270
Oh no, Miss Asahina
isn't involved in this.

311
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,740
Okay then,
what's the culprit?

312
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,970
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

313
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,520
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but somewhere inside of her...

314
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,420
is a desire to not let
summer vacation end.

315
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,530
What the heck? Do you mean she
feels regret over something?

316
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
That's what I believe.

317
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,630
Perhaps she feels that
there's something left...

318
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,300
that she wants to do
during our summer vacation?

319
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,330
So, what are you saying
I should do?

320
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,810
If we knew that, we would
have this problem solved.

321
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,010
You seem awfully cheerful
about this.

322
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,910
It's because we've finally
been able to solve...

323
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,180
the mystery of the frequent feelings
of deja vu that I've had lately.

324
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,050
Is it possible that other people
across the world feel this, too?

325
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,960
It doesn't seem that way.
You and I are a special case.

326
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,030
It appears that the people who
are closest to Miss Suzumiya...

327
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,190
are able to sense
this strangeness.

328
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,960
What about Haruhi? Does she
sense any of this at all?

329
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,570
Not at all, it seems. It would
probably be bad for us if she did.

330
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,110
However, I believe that there is one
person who remembers everything,

331
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,950
more than the deja vu
that we do.

332
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:12,720
That's an awfully unhappy thought.
And who would that be?

333
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,790
I think you know,
even without my saying.

334
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,400
I believe that the Thought Entity, which
transcends time and space, would.

335
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,930
- Is that right, Nagato?
- It is.

336
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,600
- You remember all of it?
- Right.

337
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,080
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

338
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,720
This is the 15,513th time.

339
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,560
15,513?

340
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,600
What do you mean by 15,513?
Nagato, what are you saying?

341
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,270
Are you serious?

342
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,900
I am.

343
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,210
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

344
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,840
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

345
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,780
Which means?

346
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,820
Out of 15,513 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

347
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,660
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

348
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,430
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

349
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,160
but did not go to a goldfish scooping
stand, occurred 437 times.

350
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,730
We've had a part-time job
9,031 times, and in those instances,

351
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,070
we have done six different
kinds of jobs.

352
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,870
In addition to handing out balloons,
we also worked as movers, cashiers,

353
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,540
handed out flyers, worked as call center-

354
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,980
I got it, that's enough.
Handed out flyers, worked as call center-

355
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,880
15,513 times.
That's what Nagato said.

356
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,230
Times two weeks, hmm,
that's around 594 years.

357
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,970
She alone has memories
of all that time,

358
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,110
repeating it all
over and over...

359
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,410
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that
same period of time over and over again?

360
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,790
I wonder if they exist.

361
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,320
Martians.

362
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,760
I kind of don't
want them to.

363
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,090
They're probably a reserved people,
living underground.

364
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,200
They're probably friendly.

365
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,100
There's no guarantee
of that.

366
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,570
I'm bored of this.
UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.

367
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,740
Exactly what does
she want to do?

368
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,310
Now what could
that be?

369
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,480
If we could figure that out,
this would all be solved...

370
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,990
Oh, how about
trying this out?

371
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,350
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden
embrace from behind,

372
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,320
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

373
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,990
And who would be
doing that?

374
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,830
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

375
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,170
I'm exercising my right to veto.
In other words, I'm not going to.

376
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,110
I guess it can't be helped.
All right, how about if I do it?

377
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,410
I'm kidding. I'm lacking a certain
something for the role.

378
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,680
And all that would do is cause unnecessary
confusion in Miss Suzumiya.

379
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,350
Hey, Nagato,

380
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,960
you were aware of this loop before
Miss Asahina said anything, right?

381
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,190
Yes.

382
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,800
If that's the case,
why didn't you say anything?

383
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,530
It's my job
to observe.

384
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
I see...

385
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
All right!

386
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,200
Look, I got a home run!
Yay! I did it!

387
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,280
We were always
doing something.

388
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,550
We went to a real
fireworks show,

389
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,980
and we even took part in
a goby fishing tournament.

390
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,380
We also did a test of courage,
went to the beach,

391
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,920
went bowling, sang karaoke,
and watched some movies.

392
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,850
Of course, I knew that this wasn't
going to satisfy Haruhi.

393
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,790
Even still, there wasn't anything
I could do about it,

394
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:19,030
...and the last days of our summer
vacation ticked away.

395
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,800
And so we ended up
at August 30th...

396
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,380
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

397
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,620
I wonder if this
was good enough.

398
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,150
But, hmm, well...
I guess this works.

399
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,820
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

400
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,730
That's fine, then.

401
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,360
We were able to do a lot this summer,
so that's enough, right?

402
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,400
No, it's not.
You're still not satisfied.

403
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,440
Okay, we're done
for today.

404
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,050
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

405
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,150
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

406
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,750
Wait...

407
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,860
Wait, Haruhi.

408
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,590
No, I can't let
you go!

409
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,640
If she goes, we'll end up repeating
these past two weeks

410
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,370
for the some-thousandth
time again.

411
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,250
But what should I do?
What should I say?

412
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,880
There must have been a hint
somewhere in what Haruhi said.

413
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,350
But what was it?

414
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,290
What has she said
up to this point?

415
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,690
It's no use.
I don't know...

416
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,130
Wait... wait...

417
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,790
Haruhi!

418
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,070
Thank you very much!

419
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,410
August 31 st. I haven't
touched my homework.

420
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,480
Whatever, it doesn't
matter anymore.

421
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,320
If we're just going to do it all over again,
then there's no point to doing it.

422
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,330
Whether tomorrow comes or not, I'll leave
it to the me at that time to deal with it.

423
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,950
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

424
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,680

that were made upon it

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,660
hitotsu no hoshi niwa

Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

426
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,550
yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

427
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,170

The image of you in my mind
has vanished

428
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,460

Can I say that
I remember you clearly?

429
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,970
Tomare!
Stop!

430
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,770
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs

431
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,180

Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

432
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,640

That's because

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,850

It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,680

We could see

Worrying about
