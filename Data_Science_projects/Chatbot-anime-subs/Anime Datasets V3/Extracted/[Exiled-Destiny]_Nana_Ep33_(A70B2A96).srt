1
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:06,813
I didn't have the energy to
come up with excuses

2
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:09,783
like the bed was too small
or that I forgot my wallet.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,113
When I was unbearably lonely,

4
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,143
it wasn't Ren...

5
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:18,853
who I wanted to have by my side.

6
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:35,743
Blinking eyes call the wind

7
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:43,383
A smile clears all the noise away

8
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:49,943
The angel in your eyes whispers

9
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:55,123
"Everything begins now"

10
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,363
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

11
00:00:57,363 --> 00:01:01,163
It's like being caught in a wave

12
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,333
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

13
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,803
Breath held, arms reaching out

14
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:14,043
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

15
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:18,683
You're the only one I can see

16
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:22,623
Baby my wish on a wing

17
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,593
This sky is torn

18
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:30,993
By a single overflowing word

19
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,143
Wow!

20
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:22,273
What a great vocalist!

21
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:23,713
Where'd you find her?

22
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,753
She's Ren's girl, isn't she?

23
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:29,183
Yeah. But before that,
she was Nobu's classmate, and...

24
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:30,223
She's great!

25
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,983
She's got the looks,
and a great voice. She is so cool.

26
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,053
I really think you've got a chance.

27
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:38,383
I finally understand what made you
decide to go pro, Yasu.

28
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:40,093
You had this secret weapon.

29
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:43,633
Well, I'm not so confident
we'll make it that big, but...

30
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:45,543
Well, depending on how it's done,

31
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,303
Nana's got potential to be
a great solo artist.

32
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,203
Are you at all serious
about doing this?

33
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:55,643
Who could it be this late at night?
Reira? A new scandal uncovered?!

34
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:57,743
Maybe it's a neighbor complaining
about the noise.

35
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,943
Huh? Isn't this place soundproof?

36
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,053
What's the point of having
your drums here then.

37
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:05,123
Hello. I'm sorry for making
all this noise.

38
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:06,923
Yasu, .,

39
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:09,553
Who is it?!

40
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:15,763
What's the matter?

41
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:26,333
Yasu, I'll be going home.

42
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:28,403
Yeah. Sorry.

43
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:29,843
No, it's okay.

44
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:31,613
Thanks for your time.

45
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:39,993
NAOKI
GREAT SCOOP!

46
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:41,193
NAOKI
GREAT SCOOP!
Great Scoop!

47
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:41,463
NAOKI
GREAT SCOOP!

48
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:41,663
REN's WOMAN CAME To
YASU'S PLACE CRYING!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
KYAAAAA! A PAPA-RAKKYO!!

49
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,833
REN'S WOMAN CAME TO
YASU'S PLACE CRYING!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
KYAAAAA! A PAPA-RAKKYO!!
Ren's woman came to
Yasu's place crying!

50
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:43,963
REN'S WOMAN CAME TO
YASU'S PLACE CRYING!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
KYAAAAA! A PAPA-RAKKYO!!

51
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:46,263
REN'S WOMAN CAME TO
YASU'S PLACE CRYING!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
KYAAAAA! A PAPA-RAKKYO!!
What's going on? Kyaaaaaaaa
A papa-rakkyo!!

52
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:50,333
Takumi got Hachi pregnant!
It's gotta be Takumi's kid!

53
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,103
Hachi said he would do it
without a condom!

54
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,673
What?! Doing it without
any protection is inexcusable!

55
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:55,273
DIZZY

56
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,543
DIZZY
She's being a tattletale.

57
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,613
It's open.

58
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,523
Nana, are you asleep?

59
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:22,133
Nana...

60
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,133
I'm coming in.

61
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:35,203
Nana!

62
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,743
Don't scare me like that, damn it!

63
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,733
I told you, I'm a sensitive man.

64
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:09,603
And where's Nobu?

65
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:32,503
HACHIKO & NOBUO

66
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,733
Do you love him that much?

67
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:46,013
Didn't you break up with him?

68
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:55,423
Please make up an excuse.

69
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,153
I don't care if it's a lie.
I'll believe you.

70
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:20,553
Who could it be at this hour?

71
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:23,053
I can only think of two insolent people

72
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,753
who would come by someone's place
in the middle of the night unannounced.

73
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,913
Yeah. I wonder which one it is.

74
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:29,963
Yes? Which one is it?

75
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,193
WHICH ONE?
Yes? Which one is it?

76
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:31,793
WHICH ONE?

77
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,023
Jun-chan.

78
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:39,603
I was suffering so badly...

79
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,663
I could barely breathe.

80
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:46,983
Before I knew it, I was here.

81
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,713
I poured my entire heart out,
but I'm not sure

82
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,013
whether or not I was able to
explain myself well enough.

83
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,923
Why do I want Hachi so much?

84
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:02,553
Why do I hate Takumi so much?

85
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,563
I don't even know myself.

86
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,733
Nobu said that I'm strange.

87
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,893
Am I strange?

88
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:23,343
What's a friend supposed to do
at a time like this?

89
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:25,573
I want to become...

90
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:29,183
normal friends with Hachi.

91
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,423
Yasu listened to everything
I said without saying a word.

92
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:46,223
He might've said something
to comfort me from time to time.

93
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:48,933
To be honest, I don't remember.

94
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,843
But I remember...

95
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,343
for some reason,

96
00:07:54,343 --> 00:08:00,653
being enveloped by the sweet smell
of Black Stone calmed me down.

97
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:06,553
Kyosuke, don't smoke!

98
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,823
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

99
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,663
I'm sorry, Kyosuke.

100
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:15,093
No, it's okay.
I mean, guys are pathetic.

101
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:17,473
We don't know what to do
at a time like this.

102
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,933
How come you're nervous?!

103
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:24,173
Well, you're right,
but it makes me feel bad.

104
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,773
On the other hand...
Takumi, was it?

105
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,613
From what I hear from you,

106
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:31,683
he seems to be almost too manly
and decisive about this.

107
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:32,813
I'm impressed.

108
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,283
Really? To me, he just sounds like
some coercive guy thinking only of himself!

109
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,213
You think so?

110
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,223
Think about it.

111
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,263
He used Nana's cell phone to
call Nobu out of the blue

112
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,223
and talk to him about this.

113
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,923
It's natural for Nobu to be
overly suspicious of Nana and quail.

114
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:47,633
He's trying to take away
Nobu's will to fight for Nana

115
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,893
and encourage him to withdraw.

116
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:52,433
On top of that, he locked himself
in Nana's room so she couldn't interfere.

117
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:56,203
If he was really thinking of Nana,
he wouldn't have taken such actions.

118
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,743
He's the type of person who would

119
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:01,233
manipulate others without thinking twice
about it if it's for his own good.

120
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,773
If he really planned all that
on the spur of the moment,

121
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,853
he's an extremely clever guy.

122
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:09,183
In a way, I'm impressed.

123
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:13,623
I'm pretty sure Takumi didn't give it
that much thought.

124
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:17,353
It's because I told him that
Nobu's my boyfriend,

125
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,203
so he simply did it outta jealousy.

126
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,263
Oh, isn't that nice.

127
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,133
It's just that he has a lot of pride.

128
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:26,703
You call that pride?

129
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:27,363
Huh?

130
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,273
If those are his true feelings,

131
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:31,943
then he's as immature as a kid
whose toy's been taken away.

132
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:33,613
- You may be right.
- Really?

133
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:34,743
SCALE
- You may be right.
- Really?

134
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:40,153
Oh well, in any case,
he's gotta be pretty serious about this

135
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,243
to say he'll be the child's guardian.

136
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:46,013
If he was a classmate of Yasu,
then that would make him 23 or 24, right?

137
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,913
Is he financially sound?
What does he do?

138
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,053
He's a musician.

139
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:55,933
Is that not a concern?!
Does he make any money?!

140
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,093
Why are you keeping quiet?

141
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:02,673
Well, if he said he'll be the guardian
without hesitation,

142
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:04,213
he's gotta be somewhat
financially sound.

143
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:08,043
I actually don't like the way
he used the word "guardian."

144
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,803
That's almost like saying,
"I'll pay child support."

145
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:12,673
But I think that's what he meant.

146
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:13,343
Huh?

147
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,753
What the hell?!
Why won't he marry you?!

148
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,153
Does he have a wife and kids?
Is this another extramarital affair?

149
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:24,163
No. But getting married would
be a great burden to him.

150
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,093
I couldn't impose on him like that.

151
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:29,063
I don't get you!
Are you okay with that?!

152
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,023
That's good enough for me.

153
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,803
So you wanna have this baby
that much?

154
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:44,553
At first, I hoped that it was
just my imagination.

155
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,713
I was escaping from myself,
trying not to think about it.

156
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,223
But there were signs,

157
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,583
so I became more and more anxious.

158
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:55,953
So when the test showed positive,

159
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,993
it scared me because it was like
I no longer had anywhere to escape.

160
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,393
I thought, if I really am pregnant,

161
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,363
I should get an abortion right away.

162
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,073
I could keep the abortion a secret
from everyone,

163
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:12,803
and continue on with my life...
as if nothing had happened.

164
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:17,383
But then at the hospital,

165
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,013
I realized that there was, in fact,
a child living inside me.

166
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,583
It was like reality suddenly
struck me.

167
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:23,593
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC

168
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:24,953
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC
I thought to myself that

169
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:27,493
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC
I would never wanna have an abortion
and pretend nothing happened.

170
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,063
I no longer had a sense of fear
or anxiety.

171
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:34,223
All I could think about then was
that I had to pull myself together.

172
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,263
I don't know how to say it, but...

173
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:47,103
like, I felt that I'm the only one who
can protect the life of the child inside me.

174
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,453
I thought about the possibility of
giving birth

175
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,243
and raising the child on my own.

176
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:56,523
But I don't have any money.

177
00:11:57,523 --> 00:12:00,113
In addition, I can't work because
my morning sickness is so bad.

178
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,933
I was at a complete loss,

179
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,863
thinking that there's no way
I'm gonna make it.

180
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:07,923
So when Takumi said
what he did to me,

181
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,963
it surprised me,
but it made me really happy.

182
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,203
Maybe I shouldn't be relying
on him, but...

183
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:18,273
No, there's nothing wrong with that.
It's most likely his child, right?

184
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,813
Nobu was using protection
at all times, right?

185
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,683
So chances of the child
being his are low.

186
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,183
It's a horrible situation, isn't it?

187
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,783
Nobu always used protection.

188
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:34,323
And he treated me like
I was so precious.

189
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,333
But I'm trampling all over that

190
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,093
and am running to Takumi
to have the baby.

191
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,393
Can someone so selfish be forgiven?

192
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,433
Well, Nobu may never forgive you.

193
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,573
Given the circumstances,
it appears that he believes

194
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,513
you were dating them both
at the same time.

195
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:58,043
No, I think she needs to resolve
this misunderstanding.

196
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:00,653
But how? There's no proof.

197
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,453
I don't think he'll believe
her explanations.

198
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,123
What I'm saying is,
from Nobu's perspective,

199
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:12,653
he probably wanted her to explain things
just to show that she cares.

200
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:15,263
That could even light a flame
to his fighting spirit,

201
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:16,863
and he'll say,
"I'll take care of everything."

202
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:20,493
For Nobu's sake, he may be better off
not having such a flame lit.

203
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:23,633
Because you can't raise a kid
on love alone.

204
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:26,973
He'd no longer be in a position
to dream about his band succeeding.

205
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:32,143
He might hafta give up his dream
and take over his family inn.

206
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:36,083
I'll do everything I can
to make you happy.

207
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,793
It's one thing if the child were his
without a doubt.

208
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,453
He's only twenty, right?

209
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,623
It would be too cruel to have
his future decided in this way.

210
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:51,223
And that's why you felt it's not right
to rely on Nobu, right, Nana?

211
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:53,433
I guess it's not something
you could say to him.

212
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:58,073
Nana, you really are seriously
in love with Nobu.

213
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:03,173
She's Nobu's girlfriend,
but she's also a follower of BLAST.

214
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:07,113
The success of the guru and her group
is her dream as well.

215
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,953
Life doesn't always go
as planned, does it?

216
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:15,563
Maybe there really is a Demon Lord.

217
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:16,923
What are you saying?!

218
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:20,123
It's Nana's fault for not insisting
on protection!

219
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:22,663
And also for doing it with Nobu right after
without any decent break in between!

220
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,673
Your tendency to get carried away
in your foolish actions

221
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:25,603
has finally caught up with you!

222
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,033
Do you understand that?!

223
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,143
This is not the time
to be lecturing her.

224
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:30,913
This is about the only time
Nana will listen to me!

225
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,913
DON'T SPOIL HER!
This is about the only time
Nana will listen to me!

226
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:37,613
Do you really understand that
you can't have a normal happy family

227
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,103
with a guy who won't marry you?

228
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:41,013
Uh-huh.

229
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:47,123
Then you'd better be faithful to
that man for the rest of your life.

230
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:52,453
You are prepared to properly break up
with Nobu and give him up, are you?

231
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:56,863
I want to hear your answer!

232
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:57,763
Yes!

233
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:00,643
Even if the child is Nobu's,

234
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:03,473
you will have no problem raising
the child as Takumi's, will you?

235
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,273
Keep in mind that even if Takumi
becomes the child's guardian,

236
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,573
whether he'll love the child or not
is a different issue.

237
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:11,513
Yes.

238
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:18,293
Okay. If you wanna have it that bad,

239
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,583
I won't stop you.

240
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,493
As long as you never forget
that determination you have.

241
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:23,553
Yes.

242
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,063
Now that you've made that commitment,

243
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,893
I don't wanna ever see you
crying over this.

244
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,623
I pity a kid who has to put up
with such a gloomy mother.

245
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,963
Try to be like your own mother.

246
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,783
Bye. I'm really grateful for everything,
Jun-chan, Kyosuke.

247
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,953
I feel much better now that I had
you hear what I had to say.

248
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,353
I'll be in touch.

249
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:54,853
At the least, take good care
of your body.

250
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,093
Stay well.

251
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:57,323
Mhm.

252
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,573
I wonder if she really plans to have it.

253
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,833
It not only affects the rest
of Nana's life,

254
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:12,173
this is also about the life of a child.

255
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:13,873
I'm so worried I'm getting
a stomachache.

256
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,203
But Nana came to
that decision herself,

257
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:21,183
so we really don't have the right
to interfere with that decision.

258
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,813
The best we can do now is
just to support her.

259
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:25,213
I guess you're right.

260
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,683
Nana's dream was to become
a normal housewife.

261
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,833
If she had an abortion and things
went well with Nobu,

262
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,723
her dream might have come true
in the near future.

263
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:40,703
But she's sacrificing that to
have this baby.

264
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:42,933
She must be really determined.

265
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:48,973
But as her father, I would've loved
to see Nana in a wedding dress.

266
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:49,183
Father, you say?

267
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:50,453
FATHER
Father, you say?

268
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:53,653
Why won't Takumi take Nana
as his wife?

269
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:57,413
Probably because Nana's harder
to take care of than the child.

270
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:58,613
I see.

271
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,183
Huh? My keys...

272
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:17,403
Nana!

273
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:21,683
Oops, I fell asleep.

274
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:23,683
Welcome home.

275
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:29,783
Where did you go leaving
the door unlocked?

276
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:31,643
I was worried.

277
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,413
Did you talk things over with Nobu?

278
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:35,783
Ah, yes.

279
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:38,793
Sorry. I thought you had gone home.

280
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:43,153
I went shopping.
Want some grapefruit juice?

281
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,033
Damn! I should've put it
in the fridge.

282
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:54,273
Yasu, you mind if I have one?

283
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,443
Go ahead.

284
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,783
Smoking's so tough to quit.

285
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,453
It's unlike me to try and
be stoic about it.

286
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,783
It's stressing me out in other areas.

287
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,663
That's right. There's not much meaning
for you to quit smoking,

288
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:07,553
so don't force yourself.

289
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,663
Isn't it more proper for you
to tell me to quit

290
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:10,683
because it's bad for my health?

291
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:13,863
I can't tell someone to do anything
I can't do myself.

292
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:22,503
Does it taste good?

293
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,663
It's terrible.

294
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,803
I should be heading back.
The first train will be running shortly.

295
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Huh?

296
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,453
Sorry for intruding when Naoki
was here.

297
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:33,753
Are you dating him?

298
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:34,343
No.

299
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,553
Somehow I think
he got the wrong idea,

300
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:37,643
but tell him I said hi.

301
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:41,053
Are you all right, Nana?

302
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,453
Huh? What about?

303
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:48,463
You idiot! I'm not that broken.

304
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,533
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

305
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:55,533
I don't really know
what a normal friendship is, but...

306
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,583
No matter what Hachi decides to do,

307
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,703
I won't get in the way
and I'll gently watch over her.

308
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,943
Exactly like you're doing with me.

309
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,883
It's not as easy as it sounds.

310
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,693
I'm sorry, Yasu. Thank you.

311
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,693
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

312
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,523
Because Hachi and I are both women.

313
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:28,233
But maybe that's why it's so difficult.

314
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,033
I begin recording today.

315
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,233
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:35,673
No, it's okay.
We start in the afternoon.

317
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,403
But we'll be confined to
the studio for at least a week.

318
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,953
So before I go, could you
let me know what you decided?

319
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,063
As things are, I'd feel so restless

320
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:48,353
I wouldn't be able to keep
my mind on work.

321
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,183
Sorry for being so pushy.

322
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:00,103
I wanna have this child and raise it
as your child, Takumi.

323
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:01,703
If it's okay with you.

324
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:09,603
Wanna get married?

325
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:11,043
Huh?

326
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,273
You don't wanna raise it
as an illegitimate child, do you?

327
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:18,153
If the public finds out, it'll look bad
no matter how we spin it.

328
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:21,683
But if we get married,
there shouldn't be a problem.

329
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,533
Besides, if I marry an ordinary girl

330
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,393
the media won't go too crazy
over this.

331
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:30,693
No?

332
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:46,013
No matter what path in life
you take with who,

333
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,653
as long as you're happy,
then that's fine with me.

334
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,423
I may never become a person

335
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,893
who can wish for that from
the bottom of my heart...

336
00:20:54,893 --> 00:21:00,063
But I wanted to appear strong
and graceful in your eyes.

337
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,393
Like a manga heroine,
who's too perfect to be real.

338
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:12,913
I can't count
how many nights

339
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:17,673
I wished tomorrow
would never come

340
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:24,453
To live as I am
without being fake

341
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:28,053
What do I need

342
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:36,193
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

343
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:41,363
The answer is
too close to see

344
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:47,603
Black tears are
falling down

345
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:54,553
I have nothing,
only sadness

346
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:59,643
I can't put it
into words

347
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:05,723
My whole body
starts to ache

348
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:11,133
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
