392
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:02,624
He is perfect.

393
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:04,894
He worked hard to stay that way.

394
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:08,062
It's unlikely that anyone
around him would deny that.

395
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,900
With his grades at school,
his character and personality...

397
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:16,445
Being "perfect" had become
part of his very being...

399
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:21,376
...but that was before
he came to know love.

401
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,324
That summer was hot.

402
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:35,825
After our first date ended in failure...

403
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,664
We made up for it by
going on a lot of dates.

405
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:41,737
Due to various circumstances, we hadn't been able
to be alone since we started going out...

406
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,398
...so you could say we
felt it was now or never.

407
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:45,403
Miyazawa !

408
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,642
Where was it again ?

409
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:49,443
That way, it's a bit of a walk.

410
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,474
It was fun being with Arima.

411
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,780
Since we had led lives of total
hard work and self control until then...

413
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,945
...it was fun being able to be reckless.

414
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,580
Seeing him outside like this,

415
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,082
I realized anew:

416
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,617
Arima is Pretty.

417
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,291
What is it ?

418
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:08,761
Oh, nothing.

419
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,155
Weren't you glaring at me just now ?

420
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,198
I see the epitome of beauty in him.

422
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,730
He's prettier than most girls...

423
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,439
...he's so calm and elegant...

424
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,741
...and on top of that he's
the smartest in our grade.

425
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,304
He's very athletic,

426
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:23,871
and from a wealthy family.

427
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:25,575
Everything he does he does right,

428
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,244
and he hangs out with me,

429
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,743
and he's nice to me...

430
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:31,500
...and it doesn't look like I have
to worry about him being unfaithful...

431
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,845
He's invulnerable !

432
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:33,813
Arima's the invulnerable man !

433
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:36,818
Now that we've got more time together...

434
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:43,499
I don't know anything besides "Afternoon tea."
*Earl Grey?*

437
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:46,869
But I still don't understand Arima.

438
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,234
I wonder what's inside
that polished shell of his.

439
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:50,731
What's he thinking,

440
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,902
what does he feel, what's in his heart...?

441
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,105
That's what I want to know.

442
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,907
I want to watch him forever.

443
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:00,645
I wonder what he's thinking.

445
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,878
Will I be able to know one day?

446
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,190
That summer was hot.

447
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:16,399
After our first date ended in failure...

448
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,265
We made up for it by
going on a lot of dates.

449
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,134
Even though it was unavoidable,
I still regret it.

451
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:25,636
That we weren't really able to be alone
together since we started going out...

453
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:28,200
...makes me ashamed of myself as a man.

454
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,445
So you could say we
felt it was now or never.

455
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,400
We may be a bit early.

456
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,682
Then why don't we go
this way for a bit ?

457
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,517
It was fun being with Miyazawa.

458
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:42,400
Since we had led lives of total
hard work and self control until then...

459
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,387
...it was fun being
able to be reckless.

461
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,827
Seeing her outside like this, I realized anew:

464
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,165
Miyazawa is Weird.

465
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,296
*Stare.*

466
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:56,998
What is it?

467
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,601
Oh, nothing.

468
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,137
Weren't you glaring at me just now?

470
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:04,412
I bet she's caught up in some
mysterious train of thought again.

471
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:08,446
I don't think I'll ever figure out
her thought patterns as long as I live.

473
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,419
Sure, I like her,
and I think she's cute...

475
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,624
But I've really gone and
fallen for a weird person.

476
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:17,460
She's really selfish,

477
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,019
her disposition's rotten to the core...

478
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:21,555
...her logic circuits are shot,

480
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:22,694
she's emotional,

481
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:23,998
she's scary when she gets mad...

482
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,934
...and she gave me the
precious experience...

483
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:30,295
...of getting a flying kick to the
stomach from the girl I liked.

485
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,999
It's also interesting how
she seriously agonizes on

486
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,536
and off about how weird she is.

487
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:37,609
Now that we've got more time together,

488
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:41,800
I never get bored gazing at her unique world.
*Sorry for serving English tea.*
*It's ok.*

489
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,347
*Glug glug.*
It's ok, I like tea.


492
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:49,487
I bet Miyazawa doesn't know that
I've got a complex towards her.

494
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,756
It's not fair that our grades are the same

495
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,261
and yet she's the one with all the individuality.

496
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:54,960
When I look at Miyazawa, 

497
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,191
I feel like I'm the most constricted,
nondescript person in the world.

499
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,697
I guess the only value I really
have is just "being smart" after all.

501
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,835
I thought I'd be able to

502
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:09,642
be happy if I were perfect...

503
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:23,815
Yo, Miyazawa.

504
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:25,825
Yo, Asaba.  Hallo.

505
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:26,820
Hallo.

506
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,396
You're getting more tanned every day.

507
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,800
I've been body boarding.

508
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:33,835
Body boarding...?

509
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,397
Not another fad...

510
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,840
Are you trying to pick up
girls on the beach this time ?

511
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,109
Swimsuit girls are awesome !

512
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,238
The ocean is a paradise for men !

513
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:45,810
I see...

514
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:46,977
How about you ?

515
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,941
You went on a date with
Arima yesterday, right?

516
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,748
How'd it go?

517
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,989
Heh heh heh!
YOU know...

519
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,422
Miyazawa, couldn't you respond
a bit more like a girl your age?

521
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:02,795
We went to the Shinagawa Aquarium...

522
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,033
...and Toshima Amusement Park...

523
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:05,492
...and we saw three movies...

524
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,266
...and the cake at Tops was really good !

525
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:08,897
Really ?

526
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:10,597
During summer vacation we're going to

527
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,032
Edo River or Sumida River to see the fireworks.

528
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:14,674
We're going to Disneyland, too.

529
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,169
Take me with you.

530
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,035
No way!

531
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:28,891
Yo, Arima.

532
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,084
Hideaki.

533
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,027
I just saw Miyazawa.

534
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,592
You're getting more tanned every day.

535
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,060
I've been

536
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,398
body boarding.

537
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,426
Finals are coming soon. Make sure to study.

538
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,034
Come on. You're the one

539
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,304
going on all those dates.

540
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:45,571
Sounds like fun.

541
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,509
I'm studying, so it's okay.

542
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,543
Miyazawa seemed really happy.

543
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,173
Yeah.

544
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,278
She gets to go on a date
with Arima! Lucky her!

545
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,315
I wanna go on one, too!

546
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,357
What're you talking about ?

547
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,653
It's not that fun being with me.

549
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,365
Three months have passed
since I met Miyazawa.

550
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,307
The first month was a one-sided love...

551
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,211
...the second, we became friends...

552
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,977
...and the third, we started going out.

553
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:28,878
I should've been able to change,
being with Miyazawa.

555
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:32,520
But I haven't really changed much, after all.

556
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,985
I keep suppressing my feelings.

557
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,449
Reason always comes before my emotions.

558
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,692
Sure, I'm human,

559
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,221
so occasionally I get emotional, but...

560
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,205
I always end up sealing those emotions away.

561
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,975
My emotions have a door,

562
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,246
and I can never open it.

563
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,378
It felt like only you keep changing...

564
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,545
...that someday I won't be able

565
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,887
to keep up with you anymore.

566
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:10,491
I'm sorry, Arima.

567
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,054
I've got student council business
today, so I can't walk home with you.

568
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,196
That's okay.

569
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,459
I'm really sorry.

570
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,831
Let's walk home together tomorrow, okay?

571
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:19,326
I'll wait for you, even if you'll be late.

572
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,328
Okay.

573
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,882
Dinnertime!

574
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,522
Hey, Sis, how far have you
gone with your boyfriend?

577
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,724
K...Kano!
N...n...n...now see here!

578
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,929
E...Early! It's too early!

579
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,926
It's all too early for high school students!

580
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:56,905
Daddy, you're behind the times.

581
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,334
With high school students
these days, anything goes.

583
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:05,444
A...anything?

584
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,042
Yeah.  Anything
*My daughter, of all people.*

586
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:19,026
Don't tell our daughters such things
*When I was young, necking was the most we did!*

588
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,125
Dear, times have changed.
*When I was young, necking was the most we did!*

589
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,658
Even you...

590
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,399
So, how's it going?

591
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:28,668
With your boyfriend?

592
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,937
N...n...n...n...nothing's going on!

593
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,645
Hmmmmmmmmmm...

594
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,040
Thought as much.

595
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:39,411
How boring.

596
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,052
The world's overflowing with the pleasures and
sorrows of the couples mass-produced
from the Athletics Festival, and yet...

599
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:48,716
Sis is the only one

600
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,456
going at her own pace.

601
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,827
Maybe it's just because Yuki's
out of sync with the world.

602
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:53,058
I'm so worried.

603
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,130
Your father doesn't mind !

604
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:56,464
It's better
if nothing's going on...

605
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,833
It would've been so entertaining

606
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:00,598
if she could cause a family discussion.

607
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:03,172
She's not that resourceful.

608
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,606
It's better that way,

609
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:07,671
better that way, Yukino.

610
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,009
Dear, could you pass me the soy sauce?

611
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,249
I can't believe this family !

612
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,987
By the way, Souichirou...

613
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:25,552
Yes?

614
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:27,928
Well, never mind.

615
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:29,756
Okay.

616
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:36,264
It's just like Kano said.

617
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,597
All those couples

618
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,372
have disappeared.

619
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:42,775
The freshness guarantee only runs one month...

620
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:44,940
Nothing lasts more than one summer.

621
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:46,471
For every meeting,

622
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,543
I guess there has to be a parting.

623
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,949
Ahh, where in the world is true love?

624
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:53,745
Hallo!

625
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,152
You're certainly a
bargain-full of cheap love.

628
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,920
Where in the world is Arima ?

629
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,800
Okay, five minute break.

630
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:13,904
I can't believe you!

631
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,175
Aw, c'mon.

632
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,175
Year 1 Class A

633
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:37,091
Is Miyazawa really having
fun being with me?

634
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:42,428
Am I actually a good enough guy for her?

636
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,750
Oh, sorry.
Did I wake you?

637
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,754
Was I asleep?

638
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:06,286
Yeah.

639
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,424
That's right. I'm supposed to
walk home with you today.

640
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,228
Yeah, but I'm sorry for being late.

641
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,400
Darn...And now it's raining.

642
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,143
This is the first time I've seen you sleeping.

643
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,182
You look so neat, even when you're asleep.

644
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,814
Really?

645
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:32,882
Tsukino kicks around.

646
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:36,757
And Kano has these sad dreams
sometimes and sobs in her sleep.

649
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,354
It's so cute.

650
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,763
Rain, huh?

651
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:44,094
Got an umbrella?

652
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:44,990
Nope.

653
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,026
Me neither.

654
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:50,706
What should we do?

655
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,565
Let's wait around a bit.

657
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,381
School feels so nice after
everyone's gone home.

658
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,421
Most people would say it's creepy.

660
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,056
Did you wait for me to wake up?

661
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:14,655
You should've just woken me.

662
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:16,895
But you were sleeping so soundly.

663
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,700
You're so busy with committees
and practice and all.

665
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:22,171
We don't see that much of each other,

666
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,071
so I just wanted to be with you.

667
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:29,578
I know that... 

668
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,068
I know that she only

670
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:35,649
smiles like this around me.

671
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,381
Miyazawa, you're like a little puppy.

672
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:38,879
Yeah.

675
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,419
I've always been an older sister, and I've been putting
on appearances by myself for so long...

676
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,828
...that this is the first time
I've ever let someone else take care of me.

677
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
It feels really good.

678
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:52,194
But I don't think I want anyone
besides you to take care of me.

679
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,633
I want to be with you...

680
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:57,436
I want to be with you...

681
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,966
I want to be with you...

682
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,434
I want to be with you...

683
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,637
Was that lightning just now ?

684
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:38,979
Yeah, it was.

685
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,649
Oh...umm....

686
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,386
Sorry, I'll go cool my head off.

687
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:17,978
Oh no, this music!
This intro is...!

688
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:26,652
Why do I have this song running
through my head at a critical time like this?!

691
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,629
It won't stop ringing in my ears!

692
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,193
The refrain just keeps going!

693
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:34,727
The song won't get out of my head!

694
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,004
I can't stand it!

695
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:42,376
It's awful! It's awful!
I can't stand it !

696
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,611
What have I done ?

697
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,719
I've done something indecent.

698
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:55,488
What the hell have I done?!

699
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,853
Now what?
How should I face Miyazawa...?

700
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,191
What do I do?!

701
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,356
U...um...Miyazawa, that was...

703
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,911
I just remembered what
I was going to say back then.

706
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,987
I was saying I didn't want
anyone besides you to take care of me.

708
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:03,950
Oh, right.

709
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,190
You can let me take care of you, too.

711
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:11,860
I was thinking that all those
years up through middle school...

712
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:15,961
...where I only showed off
and hid my true heart were pointless.

714
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,230
But maybe that's not true.

715
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:20,742
Maybe I could think of it this way:

716
00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:23,668
Maybe all the hard work

717
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,809
has given me the strength to support you.

719
00:16:27,149  --> 00:16:30,352
Then those years will be redeemed.

720
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,018
You don't have to tough it out.

721
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,285
It gets tiring to stand by yourself.

724
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,420
You want someone who'll support you.

725
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:07,987
Suddenly memory goes back to the past.

726
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,024
Memory returns to the past.
Before they met.

730
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:21,865
She strove to be perfect, for
vanity, for glory, to be the best.

731
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,034
He strove to be perfect,

732
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,671
because of his birth...

733
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:29,643
...for the uncle and aunt who raised him, 

734
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,944
for the family who scorned him.

735
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:33,377
You're amazing, Miyazawa!

736
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,683
I hear you came in first during finals again!

737
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,345
You've always been number one.

738
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,320
There's no one who can beat you.

739
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,690
Sis, there's something really neat on TV.

740
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,126
Come and watch with us.

741
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,320
I want to finish this study guide, so I'll pass.

742
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,797
Again? Is it that much fun
to come in 1st place?

744
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,731
Ha Ha Ha...

745
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:54,994
But

746
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:56,596
there's nothing else

747
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:57,938
that feels fun to me.

748
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,305
You're amazing, Arima!
I hear you came in first during finals again!

750
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:05,012
You've always been number one.
There's no one who can beat you.

751
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,106
Um, please take this.

752
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:08,849
I'm sorry. I can't accept it.

753
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:10,851
Are you going out with someone?

754
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:12,479
Is there someone you love?

755
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry.

756
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,700
I had never loved anybody.

757
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:20,823
There had been nothing
that stirred my heart.

759
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:23,500
But that was okay.

760
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
I'll become a decent person.

761
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,632
I'll become a decent person my
father and mother can be proud of.

762
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:34,269
As long as my parents
are happy, I'm happy.

764
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:39,311
Both of their worlds changed
greatly upon entering high school.

765
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:42,108
I know why

766
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:44,076
I love you so much.

767
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,687
You always change me.

768
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:48,954
We can support each other.

769
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:53,857
Miyazawa holds the key to
unlock the door to my heart.

771
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,829
Yo! Asaba!  Hallo!

772
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:00,862
Hallo!

774
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:03,897
You got tanned again.

775
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,365
You're a real stallion, aren't you?

776
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,775
Maybe I should use a UV treatment.

777
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:09,211
I'll get freckles.

778
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,803
Wasn't that lightning last night really loud?

779
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:14,514
Yeah. You going on another date this Sunday?

780
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:15,745
I hope it'll be sunny.

781
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,718
No problemo! It'll be
just fine, rain or shine.

783
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,188
Yo, Hideaki.

784
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:24,651
Arima!

785
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:27,489
You got tanned again?!
What about studying?

787
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,189
But, hey, wasn't that lightning
Last night really loud ?

788
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:32,362
Don't change the subject.

789
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,663
You going on another date this Sunday?

790
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,662
I hope it'll be sunny.

791
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:41,843
No problemo! It'll
be just fine, rain or shine.

793
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,002
Hmn !?

794
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,073
That's right. It'll be just fine, rain or shine.

795
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,717
We've got a lot ahead of us.

796
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:53,606
What'll happen next !

797
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:57,745
Sis gets in the habit of going on a LOT of dates
and is in a state of perfect happiness once again.

799
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:00,980
But a deep, yawning gulf was awaiting them!

801
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:03,500
There are pitfalls everywhere in life!

802
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,886
Next time on KareKano,

803
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:06,659
"The Couple's Estrangement!"
