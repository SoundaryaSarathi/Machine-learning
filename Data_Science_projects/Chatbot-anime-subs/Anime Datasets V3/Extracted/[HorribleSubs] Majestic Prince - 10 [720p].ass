Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.85,0:05:09.43,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So humans are one of the

Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.96,0:06:26.69,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,it turned into an organization bent \Non preparing for the upcoming war.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.51,0:06:33.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The MJP was chosen because our \Nresearch on human activity in space
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.84,0:06:35.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,was the most advanced at that time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.02,0:06:37.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The project was split into two.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.28,0:06:46.87,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Developing the AHSMB units \Nproved extremely difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.87,0:06:48.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,We had to modify alien
