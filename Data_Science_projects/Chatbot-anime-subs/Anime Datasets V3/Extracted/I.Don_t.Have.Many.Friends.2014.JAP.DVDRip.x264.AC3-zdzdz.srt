1
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,932
Can you hear it?

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,032
Can you hear my voice?

3
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,945
My name is...

4
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:39,175
Someone said this before...

5
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:42,917
There's <i>7</i> billion
people in this world,

6
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:47,121
whoever you can meet is destined.

7
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:55,058
And among these people,
those who become your friend...

8
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:58,095
...are a great miracle.

9
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:04,167
As the chances are one of <i>7</i> billion.

10
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:09,914
Indeed, it looks like a miracle.

11
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:14,921
However, though a lot of
people live in this world,

12
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:18,152
it's fairly insignificant.

13
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,023
As long as you live
like a normal person,

14
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:24,155
it's very easy to make friends.

15
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:30,096
As long as you live
like a normal person.

16
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:34,905
It's easy say, but I wonder...

17
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:43,047
...why I still don't
have many friends.

18
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:47,148
So, you're Hasegawa Kodaka?

19
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:56,121
You really like to
act cocky, don't you?

20
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:57,062
No...

21
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:01,934
I don't care who you are,

22
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:05,903
but there's a rule here.

23
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:08,930
Oh my.

24
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,976
Why must I imagine this?

25
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:57,184
You look cocky, but
you're really just a coward.

26
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:01,019
Anyway, just run!

27
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,203
Don't let him get away!
- Stop there!

28
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,983
Damn!

29
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,180
Be careful!

30
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:08,220
Stop right there!
- Don't let him get away!

31
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:41,917
Haganai

32
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:03,948
Ouch.

33
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:12,922
Hasegawa Kodaka, from Class
2-5, St. Chronica's Academy.

34
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:18,023
My father is Japanese,
and mother was English.

35
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:22,058
Therefore, my blond hair shows
that I'm different than others.

36
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,162
We've lived many places since
I was young,

37
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:28,038
we moved here to Touya
City just 3 months ago.

38
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,135
Only my weird younger sister
and I are staying together.

39
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,911
My servant, have you readied
the sacrifice for tonight?

40
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:40,978
And I only communicate with
my sister, Kobato, everyday.

41
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,049
I'm an introvert and terrible
in social situations.

42
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:50,154
Basically, I'm scared of
strangers and get nervous easily.

43
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,997
Also, my hair and
my eyes look vicious.

44
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,127
So, since I was younger...

45
00:05:56,124 --> 00:06:00,903
From now on, Hasegawa Kodaka
is going to be your friend.

46
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:06,003
So, Kodaka, please
introduce yourself.

47
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:10,939
Kodaka?

48
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,181
Are you alright?

49
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,953
What a miserable life.

50
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,929
Something also happened
on the day we moved here.

51
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:31,199
Hey, that hurt, you bastard!

52
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,002
Hey, you!

53
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:35,999
Damn it!

54
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,109
Ouch.

55
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,004
Are you alright?

56
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,113
Ever since that incident,

57
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,145
there's been rumors about a
violent person who moved...

58
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,955
...into the neighbourhood and
it's been spread around rapidly.

59
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:55,154
So, that is what's causing everything.

60
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,998
You really like to
act cocky, don't you?

61
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,026
Honestly, I'm quite good in sport.

62
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,063
But I never fight with others.

63
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,073
So, what I do... is run away.

64
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,974
Make way!

65
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,146
Since then, rumors
about me being a

66
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:15,011
gangster have been spread out, too.

67
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:23,922
Because of my introversion, this
is how others see me in school.

68
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:29,191
Well, it's very hard
to live like this.

69
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:34,923
Get ready, Kodaka.

70
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:35,195
Okay.

71
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,004
This will happen later..

72
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:42,964
And I'll be involved in it.

73
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:49,071
Anyway, that was my
short introduction of myself.

74
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,002
That day when we went to theme park,

75
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,993
someone was talking
with you, right, Tomo-chan?

76
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,132
Yeah. You're just too adorable, Tomo-chan.

77
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,074
Huh, who's that?

78
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:24,144
Mikazuki Yozora.
- Oh yeah, you told me before.

79
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,968
What're you doing?

80
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,971
I forgot my cell phone.

81
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,971
You... saw it?

82
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:00,179
Huh?

83
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,123
I'm asking you, did you see it?

84
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:04,988
Yes.

85
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,118
I see.

86
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,192
So, can you see ghosts?
- She's Tomo-chan!

87
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,190
Tomo-chan?

88
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:21,169
I'm chatting with my
air friend, Tomo-chan.

89
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,200
So dense...

90
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:31,913
Have you heard an air guitar
before? This is a friend version.

91
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,978
Does that mean... you imagine
there's a friend?

92
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,113
This is not imagination!

93
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:38,090
Tomo-chan is really here!

94
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,116
See, here! See?

95
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,958
I think she's crazy.

96
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:46,989
I'm so happy to chat with Tomo-chan...

97
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:50,002
And I always lose track of the time.

98
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,164
It's so nice to have a friend.

99
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,071
Beside Tomo-chan, do you
have other friends?

100
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,099
If I had any, then I wouldn't need
Tomo-chan.

101
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,110
You're right.

102
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:03,014
Well, aren't you the
lonely transfer student?

103
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,074
Transfer student?

104
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:07,177
Please don't say it like
that, it was 3 months ago.

105
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,987
Alright, Hasegawa Kodaka.

106
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,924
Well.

107
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:17,095
I always standby for
chances to talk with others,

108
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:21,123
so I have all our
classmates' names in my head.

109
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:25,103
However, no one talks to me
and I don't know why.

110
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,039
That's so sad.

111
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,167
The forever-alone Kodaka
has no right to criticize me.

112
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:32,007
So, now she calls me by my
first name directly?

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,971
Kodaka, were you alone
in your previous school, too?

114
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,143
Not only that school,

115
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:42,120
I've never have friends before.

116
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,087
Ever?

117
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,020
Yes.

118
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,990
Since small?

119
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:47,957
Yeah.

120
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:51,019
I see...

121
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:52,087
What's wrong?

122
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,121
Nothing.

123
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,092
Buy Why?

124
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:57,033
As you see, my appearance.

125
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:59,005
Plus I get nervous when talking to

126
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,166
others, so everyone
gets afraid of me.

127
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,004
Poor boy.

128
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,908
You have no right to say that,
you know.

129
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,913
Don't compare yourself with me!

130
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:11,008
Actually, I'm not really
looking to make friends.

131
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,019
What do you mean by that?

132
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,920
I don't mind if have no friends,

133
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,082
but I hate that they treat
me like some kind

134
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,955
of pittiful girl because
I don't have friends.

135
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,051
Or look down at me.

136
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:22,083
I see.

137
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:27,031
Are you the same?

138
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:32,994
I hope someday I can
have a true friend.

139
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,003
Foolish boy.

140
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,940
Just mind your own business.

141
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,105
Well, do you have any good ideas?

142
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:43,206
To make a real friend?

143
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:46,977
Maybe you can join a club?

144
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:47,986
No way!

145
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:48,147
Why?

146
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,048
It's too embarrassing!

147
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:50,954
Hey.

148
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,059
Just think of it.

149
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,118
Everyone in the club already
built up their relationships,

150
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:58,893
and then you suddenly
join in, it's too awkward.

151
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,194
You're right.

152
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,098
No, wait a minute.

153
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,162
I see.

154
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,132
A club...

155
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,943
See you.

156
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:19,947
What's wrong with her?

157
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:20,942
Kodaka.

158
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,016
You feel shy when
talking to others, right?

159
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:33,158
But now you can communicate
just like a normal person.

160
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:39,165
This is how we met
for the first time.

161
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,025
I'm back.

162
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:14,905
Finally, you're back, my servant.

163
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:18,102
I'm sorry, but she's
my younger sister.

164
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,134
I'll forgive you for now.

165
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:23,945
Come, offer your sacrifice to me!

166
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:27,147
Kobato, I'm sorry for coming
back late. Are you hungry now?

167
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:31,021
Kobato is just a fake name of mine.

168
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:36,051
My true name is Reists
V. Felicity Sumeragi.

169
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:39,190
A great ancient vampire!

170
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:45,972
I'm sorry, but she's
my younger sister.

171
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:51,068
Hasegawa Kobato, age 13.

172
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:55,013
A junior high student at
St. Chronica's Academy.

173
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:59,951
Due to the influence
of Iron Necromancer,

174
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,979
she's always wearing
such strange clothes.

175
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,925
Of course, she has no friends either.

176
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:13,190
And I can communicate with
her without any problems.

177
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,136
So I wonder why I get nervous
while communicating with others.

178
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:24,077
Maybe I feel nervous because
they're making judgements on me.

179
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:26,944
Are you listening?

180
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:32,142
I have no interest
in your boring topic.

181
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,084
Fill up the Virgin Blood for me.

182
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,986
It just a tomato juice.

183
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,957
Hey, eat your onion.

184
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,925
I hate onion.

185
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,151
Finish it, if not I'll
never cook dinner for you.

186
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:48,190
An-chan, you're a
bad guy! I hate onion!

187
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,972
Only gangsters dye their hair.

188
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,098
My hair isn't dyed.

189
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:55,938
Well, what is it if it's not.

190
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,135
This is nothing that concerns you.

191
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,044
But this really bothers me.

192
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,015
Stop bullying others!

193
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,193
Welcome to the city
shopping district,

194
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:23,158
I hope you can enjoy
your shopping here.

195
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:27,970
Hey, Kobato, this is dangerous.

196
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:32,138
Class stand.

197
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,011
Bow.

198
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,041
Thank you.

199
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:53,928
Hey, hey! Let's go to the snack counter!

200
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,173
So you're here.

201
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,987
Eating bento alone on the roof.

202
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,114
I can see how lonely you are.

203
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,091
Just mind your own business.

204
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,956
Come with me now.

205
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:23,929
I'm having my meal...

206
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:31,094
Hey, oh my. This is weird.

207
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,093
What're you looking at?
- See?

208
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:37,974
Oh my, isn't that Hasegawa?
- Oh gosh.

209
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,919
This is the place.

210
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:52,050
What's this?

211
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,081
Our club room.

212
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:58,963
All the procedures are done.

213
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,039
Welcome to the Neighbour's Club.

214
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,134
Neighbour's Club?

215
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:14,135
Yes, with the spirit
of Christianity,

216
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:17,149
we'll become our school
mates' friendly neighbour.

217
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,048
And strengthen our friendships.

218
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,182
This is a club where we can learn from
each other earnestly and sincerely.

219
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,953
This is very suspicious.

220
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,190
So, what's function of this club?

221
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:33,023
It's to make friends, of course.

222
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:36,001
I never thought of that before.

223
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,025
So, right now...

224
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:41,973
...we can avoid those who
judge us for being alone.

225
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,033
While we're making friends,

226
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:48,912
I believe that we can find our
true friends as you'd said, right?

227
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:52,043
What's this? Why are
you so confident?

228
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,108
Alright.

229
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,081
Go for it!

230
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:57,979
Why do you act like this has nothing

231
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,184
to do with you?
You're one of the members!

232
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,158
What?!

233
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:03,986
I completed your application.
Come on, appreciate it.

234
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,019
Buy Why?

235
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:11,059
Come, let's put up
these posters together.

236
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,997
I believe we can make this work.

237
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,975
What's this?

238
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:20,070
You can't read? This is the
poster for member recruitment.

239
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:25,050
But there's no activity
briefing written on it!

240
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:28,053
You're too dumb, Kodaka.

241
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,146
Read it diagonally.

242
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,050
I see.

243
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,124
Recruiting friends.

244
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:45,198
Yes. If someone really
wants to make friends,

245
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,004
then he should notice
this hidden message.

246
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:52,944
And how about the drawing below it?

247
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,139
Have you heard that
song that goes:

248
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:58,048
When you get 100 friends,
we'll eat onigiri at Mount Fuji.

249
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,177
So I drew that scenario.

250
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:02,882
But, your onigiri have legs!

251
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,050
I see, you only believe
in your own feelings.

252
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,026
Kodaka, it's hard to believe that
you're one of the main stream.

253
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:11,087
That has nothing to do with this!

254
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,122
Well, there's something that
really bothers me...

255
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,098
What?

256
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:19,165
You always call me "you", it's
annoying and I dislike it.

257
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,037
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,073
So, Mikazuki-san...

259
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:27,102
Yozora. Call me my first name
directly.

260
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,135
Yozora.

261
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,949
What's with that
creepy smile? Disgusting.

262
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,113
Do you have nickname? I feel awkward
calling you by your first name...

263
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:37,019
I do have...

264
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,113
No, I did have.

265
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,058
But I wouldn't tell you.

266
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:42,959
Why?

267
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:49,957
Because nicknames are only
to be used by friends.

268
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,037
So, put these up
during recess.

269
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:59,945
But I haven't agreed...
- Thank you, Kodaka-san.

270
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:16,122
Sometimes I feel lonely.

271
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:19,098
Like I should give up.

272
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,067
If I could let it be
like this forever...

273
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,094
Sometimes I'll think like that too.

274
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,970
I should give up.

275
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,036
Hasegawa Kodaka.

276
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:42,944
Seems you had an argument with
some other school students, right?

277
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,184
It's no big deal.

278
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:49,924
What kind of gratitude and
grudges you have with others...

279
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,931
...is nothing I should care about.

280
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:57,902
But, when this happen in
school, it's another story.

281
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:05,139
As a student council president, I have
the duty to keep our school at peace.

282
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:12,015
From now on, please report to me
if you intend to do something big.

283
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,111
Don't be afraid!

284
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:18,047
That's all I can say.

285
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:44,177
But you been there before, right?

286
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,151
Come on, you're free, aren't you?

287
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:49,211
Yeah, I'm free but...

288
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,155
You're late, Kodaka.

289
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,165
Sorry.

290
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,153
So, this is our club activity?

291
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:31,095
Just wait. Our priority
mission is to recruit members.

292
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:34,999
I think I should give up.

293
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,158
Coming!

294
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,172
Is this real?

295
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,133
Is this Neighbour's Club?

296
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,168
I want to join...
- No it's not!

297
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,078
Huh?

298
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,077
Keep recruiting.

299
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:56,145
Wait, she's a person who
wants to join our club, isn't she?

300
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:58,919
What the crap are you talking about?

301
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,926
Tomo-chan, what a weirdo he is, right?

302
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:01,119
Hey.

303
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,122
She's really crazy.

304
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,073
Hey, why'd you close the door?

305
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm here to join the club!

306
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,098
Go die!

307
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:21,003
Wait, why'd you close the door?

308
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,105
Open <i>up.</i>

309
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,978
Do you know that girl?

310
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,992
Nope, but I recognize her
face and know her name.

311
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,051
Kashiwazaki Sena from Class 2-3.

312
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,927
The wealthy daughter of
a city council member.

313
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,990
Every guy loves her very much.

314
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:43,194
But she's just a
spoiled little girl.

315
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,066
Huh?

316
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:49,973
She's pretty with a nice body,
good in sport as well as study.

317
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,068
Always gets first place
in academic rankings.

318
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,104
Damn that bitch, I hope she dies now!

319
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:59,948
Tomo-chan, you agree
with that too, right?

320
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,944
She's totally insane.

321
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,163
Why do you treat me so badly?

322
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,139
I said I want to join the club!

323
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,108
If you're here to sneer
at us, please go away!

324
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,201
I'm not!

325
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,038
I'm here because of that
friend recruitment poster!

326
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:29,945
Huh?

327
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:35,910
I want to make friends too!

328
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,965
Look at me, I'm perfect
in every way, right?

329
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,162
I'm smart and good at sports.

330
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:55,106
As you see now, I'm
a pretty young lady.

331
00:24:55,095 --> 00:25:00,067
I shall bestow you the right to complain
about this kind of injustice, my plebeians.

332
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,171
You're just a cheap milk cow.

333
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:06,014
What? What'd you say, flat-chest?

334
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,007
Well...

335
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:11,079
Kashiwazaki, you said you
want to make friends, right?

336
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:11,987
Yes.

337
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,961
But you're always surrounded by boys.

338
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,189
They're merely my servants.

339
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:20,961
What I want is same-sex friends.

340
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:25,027
For example, when we've been
assigned to form a group...

341
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,904
...for group study or field trips,

342
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:31,000
they're the friends who will form a
group with me without second thought.

343
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:36,175
I see, as I know, normally popular girls
will always get supplant by other girls.

344
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:40,982
You look like gangster
but know quite a bit.

345
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,955
Let me step on you, bow now!

346
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:46,151
Or you want to lick my shoes?

347
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,022
Why?

348
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:54,161
Normally boys in my class
will do it if I say so.

349
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,155
I see.

350
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,936
Are you intend to play
in more erotic way?

351
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,135
You're a gangster indeed.

352
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:09,171
I'll not agree to tie you up
with long stockings! You pervert!

353
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:12,116
I guess this is what I
can expect from the person

354
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,984
who can read the hidden
message of that poster.

355
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:18,013
Anyway, this is great.

356
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:22,059
As both of you can be friends.

357
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,026
What?

358
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,096
What're you talking about?

359
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:26,961
I see, my bad, your
classes are different.

360
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:29,058
So you two can't be together
during practical class.

361
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:32,094
That's not what I mean!

362
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:35,163
Why I must be friends
with this milk cow girl?

363
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,971
What're you saying, evil witch?

364
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,103
Get lost now.

365
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:40,008
No.

366
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,979
Go die now.

367
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:46,077
Why must you make it tough
the first time you two meet?

368
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,916
As this bitch has terrible attitude.

369
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,980
Yet it's still better than
someone who has a brain problem.

370
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:54,083
Excuse me, I'm always
the #1 in school rankings.

371
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:59,030
Yeah, well done for
a little milk cow.

372
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:03,194
Damn you, I'm going to tell
my Papa and make him expel you!

373
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,134
Papa?

374
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,896
How old are you now? Still calling Papa
and Mama, don't you feel embarrassed?

375
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,966
That's why you're a milk cow.

376
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,945
Nope, milk cow is too easy for you.

377
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,005
From now on, you're Meat.

378
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:17,913
Hey, Meat.

379
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:25,184
You really have terrible attitude.

380
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,956
Hey Yozora.

381
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,085
Gangster boy!

382
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:29,958
Yes.

383
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,154
Please call me Sena.

384
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,893
I allow you to call me that.

385
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:35,093
Why?

386
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:38,094
You can call this woman by her first
name, but call my last name instead.

387
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,039
That shows that I'm lower than her.

388
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,064
Meat's thinking is
really unreasonable.

389
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,201
Hurry up!

390
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,046
Sena.

391
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,991
That was so close.

392
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:16,134
Hey.

393
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,975
I see, it's my servant.

394
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:26,017
Are you enjoying school?

395
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,146
Such a thing is not
something that's enjoyable.

396
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:30,143
I see.

397
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,183
You didn't join any clubs, right?

398
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,022
Of course not.

399
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,017
I'd join one.

400
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:42,023
Although someone
forced me to join it.

401
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:46,903
Things like this always
happen in this world.

402
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:52,001
If you're free after school, you
can come and have fun with us.

403
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,003
If you feel lonely...

404
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:56,972
An-chan!

405
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:01,077
Be careful! Be careful!

406
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,159
That day, I had a dream.

407
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:20,200
Yozora and Sena were playing
around like normal friends.

408
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,070
Although I know that
it's impossible...

409
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:27,011
...for this to happen to both of them.

410
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,941
Kodaka.

411
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,915
Are you alright?

412
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,180
Open the window.

413
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,895
Are you hurt? I have to
take you to Nurse's Office.

414
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,094
I'm fine. Just let me lie
down here, and it'll be okay.

415
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,125
Are you sure?

416
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,034
Yes.

417
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,098
Thank you.

418
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,945
Then, I should go now.

419
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:25,929
What're you saying?

420
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,932
You're always lying!

421
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:30,925
But you never resist!

422
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,937
How dare you!

423
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:33,199
Annoying! Shut up!

424
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,173
You always abuse
me like I'm a idiot!

425
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,175
Mind your words!

426
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:39,974
But you already agreed
to lend this room to us!

427
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:40,910
You're a liar!

428
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,938
This is the place for me
to have an afternoon nap!

429
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,039
Shut up!

430
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:46,082
Get out if you want to quarrel!

431
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,951
Keep your mouth shut, Meat!

432
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,922
This is my room!

433
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:51,912
Well...

434
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,046
Kodaka.

435
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,955
Who's this girl?

436
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,961
Takayama Maria.

437
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:00,089
She's a school nun, also
our club's staff adviser.

438
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,121
Adviser?

439
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:02,155
This little girl?

440
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:03,964
I'm not little!

441
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,163
I'm your teacher, indeed!

442
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,160
How old are you?

443
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:08,172
10 years old!

444
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,139
I can see that.

445
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:13,009
Because I'm smart and clever, I
became a teacher at such a young age.

446
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:16,003
Compared with you all, my standard
is not on the same level as yours!

447
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,913
Bow to me, brats!

448
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:18,974
Shut up!

449
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,950
What happened?

450
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:26,084
This woman suddenly came to my place
and forced me to lend this room to her.

451
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:31,061
I disagreed, and then she
slapped on my right cheek!

452
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,121
Terrible!

453
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,092
Later, she forced me to advise
this club organization!

454
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,068
I apologized.

455
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,128
Let's have some potato
chips and change your mood.

456
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,071
Potato chips? Is it salty flavour?

457
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,063
Yes, it's salty flavour.

458
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:47,010
Hooray! Everything is
okay! I have a nice mood.

459
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,944
Here.

460
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,069
Up high!

461
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,045
Is she a child?

462
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,088
Hello...

463
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:14,070
I want to join this club.

464
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:23,914
Okay, start with a self introduction
and the purpose you join our club.

465
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:28,113
You're a girl, but why are
you wearing guy's uniform?

466
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,121
Special hobby?

467
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,054
Girl?

468
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,118
I'm truly a guy-

469
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,152
You're a guy?

470
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,184
Indeed.

471
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:44,128
I'm Kusunoki Yukimura
from Class 1-1.

472
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:49,064
So, why do you want to join our club?

473
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:54,010
I want to be
Kodaka-senpa's underling.

474
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,944
What?

475
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:58,105
What an interesting discovery.

476
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:01,142
Why would you choose this gangster?

477
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:05,021
Actually, I always
get bullied by others.

478
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,023
Bullied?

479
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,149
Therefore, I want to be
Kodaka-senpa's underling.

480
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:14,132
To learn how to become a masculine
and cool guy like Kodaka-senpai.

481
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,100
Masculine and cool?

482
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,035
He's just a gangster, you know?

483
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,901
He's always alone.

484
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,907
The romantic and cool way
he's living like the wind.

485
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,966
This is the ideal
look of a Japanese guy!

486
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:27,104
What? He just doesn't have any friends.

487
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,044
So annoying.

488
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:32,947
In another words, you want to
become a tough and strong guy...

489
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,179
...so that others
will not bully you?

490
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,051
That's it.

491
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,951
Just like Kodaka?

492
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:38,081
Yes.

493
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,022
Yozora, I...

494
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,890
Kusunoki Yukimura-san.

495
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,887
The way you face the difficulty
bravely with your strength,

496
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,160
is just splendid!

497
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,100
From now on, you're
going to stay along

498
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:52,125
with Kodaka and learn
the way to be a man!

499
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,163
What? How can you decide
this without asking him?

500
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,038
- Shut up, milk cow meat!

501
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:59,976
Hey, milk cow meat.

502
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:04,105
Yozora, you're an idiot!

503
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,182
That's all.

504
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:14,117
Thank you.

505
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,993
I'll work for this seriously.

506
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:19,930
What's your plan actually?

507
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,125
It's our loss if we
don't recruit this

508
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:23,134
interesting idiot,
so I want him to stay.

509
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,000
What a nasty girl you are.

510
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:26,971
I'm rescuing him.

511
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:33,968
Could you pretend nothing'd
happened if he got bullied?

512
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:38,939
Alright.

513
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,986
Well... Kodaka-senpai.

514
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:42,179
Yes?

515
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,147
Can I call you big brother?

516
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,152
Do as you wish.

517
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:05,169
Just let me take it for myself.

518
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:06,939
No way.

519
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:11,072
This is an underling's work.

520
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,182
Good morning.

521
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:19,990
Good morning.

522
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:31,958
Senpai.

523
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:33,198
What?

524
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:37,134
You're the girl from yesterday...

525
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:39,973
Thanks for yesterday.

526
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:44,176
I'm Shiguma Rika from Class 1-3.

527
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:48,078
Senpai, you're Rika's savior.

528
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:51,988
So Rika has to pay you back somehow.

529
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,015
So, was that deadly drug?

530
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:58,962
It was just a quick-effect sleeping
pill, it has no harm on human body.

531
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:02,092
In that case, I
shouldn't be a savior.

532
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:05,900
Indeed, that drug
brings no harm to Rika,

533
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:08,098
but if you didn't pass by there,

534
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:11,906
Rika might've fallen asleep inside
the science lab forever.

535
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,069
That might be true.

536
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:18,038
And then, if some
wild guy came passing by,

537
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,143
and found out that
Rika was falling asleep,

538
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:24,054
he might do something bad
while Rika lost consciousness.

539
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,057
Something bad?

540
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,988
Rika might get raped!

541
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:28,992
Raped?

542
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:29,958
Yes.

543
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,155
This is how the story goes
in Rika's favourite novels,

544
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:38,898
Guys are carnivore and
they will rape Rika non-stop,

545
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:41,963
put her through the wringer...

546
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,133
Okay, okay.

547
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:51,913
Rika has a weird feeling
after imagining it.

548
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,080
Anyway, thanks for
protecting Rika's chastity.

549
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:02,025
Rika's thinking to surrender
her chastity to you.

550
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:03,050
No, thanks.

551
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,119
You should take it.

552
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,155
During our first encounter,

553
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,930
it's Rika's first time bing
interested in a mammal.

554
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:12,959
Oh, Rika's coming!

555
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
Okay, I get it but no thanks.

556
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:17,132
See you.

557
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:34,949
How do I put this...
She's totally a weirdo.

558
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,019
Just like the rumor says.

559
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,031
You know her?

560
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,024
A genius inventor girl.
She's really talented.

561
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:45,161
Since primary school period,

562
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,070
she'd already invented many
drugs and computer programs.

563
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:51,065
Currently she's a technical
assistant in a company.

564
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:52,098
I see.

565
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:57,170
Thanks.

566
00:38:58,104 --> 00:39:01,176
Yukimura, why're you
dressed up like a maid?

567
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,950
As Yozora-neesan says,

568
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:10,189
a true man can show his
manliness no matter how he dresses.

569
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,958
Yozora...

570
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,065
Am I right, Tomo-chan?

571
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:19,933
Shiguma Rika!

572
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,964
Kodaka-senpai, so you really are here!

573
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:26,136
What's the matter?

574
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:32,116
Rika heard that senpai joined the
Neighbour's Club, so she wants to join too.

575
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:33,209
You too?!

576
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,145
This is Rika's application.

577
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,088
So, you're Shiguma Rika?

578
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,987
Yes.

579
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:44,960
This club is formed
for a noble reason.

580
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:48,022
So, there's a condition
to join our club.

581
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:53,061
The reason is to make friend, right?

582
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:55,097
How do you know it?

583
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:58,075
Rika saw a poster while
on the way here.

584
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:01,068
You can understand that poster?

585
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,173
Not because Rika's a prude, but
she also don't have many friends.

586
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:12,146
Besides, Rika's classmates jeer
at her that she's a pervert.

587
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:16,923
Seems like you fulfill the condition.

588
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:20,055
Okay, I approve your application.

589
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:22,033
That's great!

590
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,129
So, we can always be together!

591
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:29,129
Let's do everything together!

592
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:35,941
Hey, you're too close!

593
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:39,014
Yukimura, help me!

594
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:49,120
The relationship among the members of
the Neighbour's Club is very interesting.

595
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:54,064
We'll not say hi if we run across
each other in the corridors.

596
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:59,901
But after school, our relationship
changes into another form.

597
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:02,907
We gather in a same
space, but do nothing.

598
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,000
And that's when I realized...

599
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:12,176
It seems we're avoiding something,
thus we're gathering together.

600
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,173
This is crazy.

601
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:22,083
For the moment we have friends,

602
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:26,996
let's create a relay novel today!

603
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,940
Hasegawa Kodaka.

604
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,115
I heard that you'd
joined the Neighbour Club.

605
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:56,059
Seems there's some interesting
people gathered there.

606
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:59,086
When you and those isolated
people gather together,

607
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:02,031
will you comfort each other?

608
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:02,192
No.

609
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:12,109
I believe that place is your
only oasis in this world.

610
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:15,105
What're you trying to say?

611
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:21,074
Nothing, I just feel
pity for all of you.

612
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,181
So, see you.

613
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:42,962
Master?

614
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:59,080
How's life in school?

615
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,152
Are you happy?

616
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:07,995
Yes.

617
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:13,000
Good, as long as you're happy.

618
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:13,993
Listen.

619
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:18,975
I put a high hopes on you.

620
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:24,982
You just need to do
what you should do.

621
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:27,144
I'm sorry.

622
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,241
Thanks for the meal.

623
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:01,294
Okay, our classes end here.

624
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:02,489
Class stand.

625
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:04,490
Bow.

626
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:07,197
Thank you.

627
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:23,416
Thanks for the meal.

628
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:38,492
What's this?

629
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:46,331
What're you looking at?

630
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:53,244
Boys over there!
Clean all this stuff!

631
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,311
This looks delicious!

632
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,280
Thanks for the meal!

633
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:30,307
What's wrong, Takeshi?

634
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,385
What're you looking at?

635
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:44,453
Nothing.

636
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,394
Don't stare at me
if it's nothing.

637
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,334
Okay.

638
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:55,271
Hey, Sena.

639
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:56,241
What?

640
00:46:56,498 --> 00:47:00,310
Why did you jointhe  Neighbour's Club?

641
00:47:00,302 --> 00:47:03,340
I said I want to
make friends, didn't I?

642
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,476
You don't have any friends?

643
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,214
No way.

644
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:11,255
Friends... What
should they actually be?

645
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:14,453
If I really knew, then I
wouldn't feel pain now.

646
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:17,328
I understand.

647
00:47:18,286 --> 00:47:20,459
Oh yeah, about the nickname.

648
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:21,399
What?

649
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,232
Meat?

650
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:25,466
Yeah.

651
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:30,241
That fool named me
a terrible nickname.

652
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:35,238
But you accepted it eventually, right?

653
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:42,278
That's because this is first time
someone gave me a nickname.

654
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,311
Really?

655
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:50,286
You.. You can't tell Yozora!

656
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:54,196
Okay, roger that.

657
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:03,298
Everyone, we're going to
start our activity now.

658
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:11,247
Here? No, if someone see it...

659
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:17,288
Never mind, I'd locked the door.

660
00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:21,352
Can you listen to me a while?

661
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:30,334
Those people will go
for karaoke after school.

662
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:34,270
Together...

663
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,305
Karaoke...

664
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:39,207
What's karaoke?

665
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:45,378
At first, I planned to
go for karaoke alone.

666
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:49,321
But I feel this is weird.

667
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:53,284
Normally, they'll go there together.

668
00:48:53,315 --> 00:48:54,453
Together...

669
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,354
Karaoke...

670
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:57,390
Yes.

671
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,424
Karaoke...

672
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:02,463
What's that?

673
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:07,235
Yozora-senpai, as you see now,

674
00:49:07,229 --> 00:49:10,369
we nearly have nothing in common.

675
00:49:10,398 --> 00:49:16,371
This is one of the reasons that
we're not part of those people.

676
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:17,405
Indeed.

677
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:22,479
Therefore, do you still
want to go for karaoke?

678
00:49:22,477 --> 00:49:26,482
Yes, let's go for karaoke together.

679
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:35,198
Let's go for karaoke! Come on!

680
00:50:30,478 --> 00:50:31,354
No!

681
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:32,451
Why?

682
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:34,292
I don't want to go!

683
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,262
Come on, you're
happy to come, right?

684
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:36,422
No!

685
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:19,354
Summer Break is Coming Soon!

686
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:29,205
Dismiss us?!

687
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,440
Yes, please empty this
room within a week.

688
00:52:33,435 --> 00:52:35,437
What's this mean?

689
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,384
Well, you din't even do a
proper procedure for this.

690
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:43,288
So, you still want to
continue your club activity?

691
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:46,259
Have you gotten permission
from Sister Maria?

692
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:50,457
Sister Maria doesn't
have such right in hand.

693
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:57,392
According to our rules, the Neighbour's
Club cannot be an official school club.

694
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:02,374
Right now, you're illegally
occupying this room.

695
00:53:02,364 --> 00:53:05,368
Wait, what're you saying?

696
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,346
What's wrong?

697
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:09,406
Hasegawa Kodaka.

698
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:13,419
Finally, the love of a
gangster and president,

699
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:15,479
the fujoshi's
favourite play is here!

700
00:53:15,477 --> 00:53:19,254
Please kill each
other with your love!

701
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,386
What's the matter with her?

702
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:29,390
Rika can feel something
strange when she imagines it.

703
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,361
UNIVERSE!

704
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:45,274
So, we still can use this room
until end of this week, right?

705
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:49,379
Don't mind any of this.

706
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:57,328
Where else can I play this game?

707
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,320
You can play it at your home.

708
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:02,392
Sena really likes to play games.

709
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:04,301
This is not a game.

710
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:08,365
It's Galgame. Galgame, you know?

711
00:54:08,396 --> 00:54:13,277
I wish I could get into the game.

712
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,354
No, no. I'm just kidding.

713
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:28,292
I still can differentiate between
reality and the virtual world.

714
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:31,492
Actually you can get into the game.

715
00:54:31,486 --> 00:54:32,430
What?

716
00:54:35,323 --> 00:54:36,461
With this!

717
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:39,336
What's this?

718
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:41,432
This is a video game software...

719
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:43,340
...developed by between a company and Rika.

720
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:46,437
Romantic Saga Ver.1.34!

721
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:49,182
I think I've heard of it before.

722
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:50,444
Saga? Why is it Saga?

723
00:54:50,472 --> 00:54:53,248
HARD is produced in the
Saga prefecture!

724
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:55,346
So, what's with this game?

725
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:59,449
In short, this is a machine which
lets you play any Galgame in real form.

726
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:02,360
The electric current and
the nerve gas from it's

727
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,421
main processor will make
our brain feel excitement.

728
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,367
And then you can get
into the virtual world.

729
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,357
Really?

730
00:55:09,491 --> 00:55:15,339
First, let's install the data of this
school and city inside this processor.

731
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,241
So our school will
be the main stage,

732
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:22,238
and we can feel the
excitement of making friends.

733
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,218
So you're not merely a pervert.

734
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,451
At first, Rika invented this
to experience the real sex.

735
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:32,356
So you're totally a pervert.

736
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,384
Pervert is Rika's profession,
inventing things is just her hobby.

737
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:39,354
Put on the helmet and mask.

738
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,425
It's once in a blue moon,
so let's play it together.

739
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,301
Is this safe?

740
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:46,465
No problem!

741
00:55:46,494 --> 00:55:48,474
As we're just testing it,

742
00:55:48,463 --> 00:55:50,443
so Rika will set it into the easy mode.

743
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,206
How easy is it?

744
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,407
You can do anything you want.

745
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,437
This and that!

746
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:01,219
Anything in your mind, can be real!

747
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:02,483
That's awesome!

748
00:56:02,477 --> 00:56:06,323
You act like this is normal.

749
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:12,331
What's this?

750
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,433
Please be patient.

751
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,298
Get ready.

752
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:32,342
You'll feel sleepy.

753
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:34,444
Relax your body.

754
00:56:36,411 --> 00:56:39,324
Today is 17th July.

755
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:48,265
Next, Rika's going to take you
to 17th July of virtual world.

756
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:04,616
So we're now in the game?

757
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:06,448
This is so great!

758
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,545
Everything's just like
in the real world.

759
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:12,456
Hello... can you hear Rika?

760
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:14,619
Yes.

761
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:18,554
Seems you guys are safely logged in.

762
00:57:18,553 --> 00:57:20,499
Every pain you feel in this world...

763
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,592
...will effect on your real body.

764
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:27,437
So, please be careful
and don't get hurt.

765
00:57:27,428 --> 00:57:27,667
Ouch!

766
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:29,507
So, this is true.

767
00:57:29,497 --> 00:57:30,669
What're you doing?

768
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:35,408
So, please go to your
classroom as usual.

769
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:39,442
Class is going to start soon.

770
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:48,525
Due to the development
in countries like France,

771
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:51,462
the Catholic Church's
power is becoming stronger.

772
00:57:51,485 --> 00:57:54,466
Before the 3rd century,
churches had been built

773
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:57,469
all over the Roman Empire
and become stronger.

774
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:02,464
Rome, Constantinople,
Antioch, Jerusalem...

775
00:58:02,463 --> 00:58:04,534
So our class ends here.

776
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,476
Class stand.

777
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:07,572
Bow.

778
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:10,642
Thank you, teacher.

779
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:21,458
Here.

780
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,651
Thanks.

781
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:28,433
Kodaka, have you done the
homework for next period?

782
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,402
No... not yet.

783
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:34,531
Oh gosh, I planned to copy
your homework at first.

784
00:58:34,528 --> 00:58:35,472
Sorry.

785
00:58:35,463 --> 00:58:36,635
It's okay.

786
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,432
Yozora!

787
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:40,605
Are you free after school today?

788
00:58:40,635 --> 00:58:41,705
Anything?

789
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:45,483
Kayako found a really
nice cake shop!

790
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:47,510
It's a great place but not
everyone knows the place.

791
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,613
Let's go after school!

792
00:58:50,678 --> 00:58:53,659
Let me think about it.

793
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:55,456
Bye bye!

794
00:59:06,594 --> 00:59:08,574
For me, a high standard person,

795
00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:10,564
this thing can be easily solved.

796
00:59:10,598 --> 00:59:13,636
It's a piece of cake.

797
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:14,703
Awesome!

798
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:34,498
Thank you very much.

799
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,559
This game is really dangerous.

800
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:41,471
People will approach
you automatically.

801
00:59:41,462 --> 00:59:44,636
Although I made
friends this way,

802
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,643
I still feel like
I'm losing to myself.

803
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,646
I can't feel the excitement.

804
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,512
I'm so pissed off!

805
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:56,522
Kodaka, do you want to go for
karaoke with the girls from Class 2?

806
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,581
I'm kind of busy...

807
00:59:58,579 --> 00:59:59,580
I see.

808
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:01,490
Okay, maybe next time.

809
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,493
Sorry.

810
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:09,465
Kodaka, do you want to go for
karaoke with the girls from Class 2?

811
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,628
Kodaka !?!

812
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:23,649
What's wrong?

813
01:00:25,473 --> 01:00:32,482
There's an error, Rika
needs to stop this urgently.

814
01:00:32,646 --> 01:00:35,456
My head's in so much pain.

815
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,529
What's going on?

816
01:00:37,518 --> 01:00:40,499
Rika thinks the system is incomplete.

817
01:00:40,488 --> 01:00:43,435
I won't play this any longer!

818
01:00:43,424 --> 01:00:45,563
Why? Don't you think it's fun?

819
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,473
That's why you're Meat.

820
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:51,670
It's dangerous to
let this error happen.

821
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:54,578
Rika has to repair this system.

822
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,514
How long will it take?

823
01:00:56,504 --> 01:01:00,475
Maybe Rika can finish
it before she graduates.

824
01:01:00,508 --> 01:01:02,579
Before graduation?

825
01:01:04,478 --> 01:01:06,515
<i>5, 6, 7, 8!</i>

826
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:08,457
<i>1 ,2 ,3 ,4!</i>

827
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:25,477
It's rare seeing you here.

828
01:01:25,466 --> 01:01:26,467
Well...

829
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,472
This is not your special seat.

830
01:01:29,503 --> 01:01:30,447
Yeah.

831
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:39,455
They'd dismissed our Neighbour's
Club, so you, too, feel lonely.

832
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,427
Don't talk nonsense.

833
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,689
Nobody will feel sad
for that club...

834
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:48,429
Hey, you're the founder,
don't talk bad about your club.

835
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:49,628
Okay, fine.

836
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:51,567
Yes.

837
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:55,674
I'm the one who formed this club.

838
01:01:55,696 --> 01:01:59,542
It's bullshit if I don't feel sad.

839
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:00,477
Yeah.

840
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:13,456
Hey, Kodaka.

841
01:02:17,618 --> 01:02:22,590
What're you always looking at here?

842
01:02:23,557 --> 01:02:26,595
Nothing, just the sky.

843
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,444
I see, you never change.

844
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:35,607
Huh?

845
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,415
See you.

846
01:03:35,663 --> 01:03:37,438
Few days later that.

847
01:03:37,665 --> 01:03:41,545
The Neighbour's Club
has been dismissed.

848
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,537
Just like what Saionji said.

849
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:44,572
But for us,

850
01:03:44,605 --> 01:03:49,577
that place was like a meeting room.

851
01:03:51,512 --> 01:03:55,654
We've gone back to our daily lives.

852
01:03:55,649 --> 01:04:01,600
Since then, we never
talked to each other.

853
01:04:02,489 --> 01:04:06,494
Building up the bravery to step out,

854
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:10,566
but none of us have such a thing.

855
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:15,447
The thing that we wanted
but we still can't get it.

856
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:19,474
It's still shining like always.

857
01:04:26,413 --> 01:04:27,414
Kodaka.

858
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:29,424
Come here.

859
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:33,431
Big brother.

860
01:04:33,654 --> 01:04:34,655
Senpai.

861
01:04:34,688 --> 01:04:36,463
Long time no see.

862
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,436
Let's have the sex that
we've longing for!

863
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:39,495
Since when have we had sex before?

864
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:43,407
Rika always wears her
sexy panties for you.

865
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,500
This is harsh!

866
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:48,674
Take back all of your private stuff.

867
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:50,580
Hey, Kodaka.

868
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:52,617
Have you seen Meat today.

869
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:53,550
Nope.

870
01:04:54,508 --> 01:04:59,480
I heard that she's been sick for days.

871
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:03,427
Although all of her stuff is good,

872
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:05,658
but she still hasn't paid her club fees.

873
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,463
Is she really sick?

874
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:13,632
Could it be... The game processor
in the science lab is gone...

875
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,573
Could Sena...

876
01:05:18,432 --> 01:05:20,673
It's possible for Meat to do that.

877
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:24,444
Let's visit her later.

878
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:27,552
Alright, we'll pay her a visit.

879
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:32,456
But this is to claim
back the club fees.

880
01:05:32,446 --> 01:05:33,447
Well...

881
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:37,392
She stays in this bungalow.

882
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:41,560
Damn, she's nothing but a meat.

883
01:05:46,593 --> 01:05:49,699
I'm the butler, Stella.

884
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:53,577
What's wrong.

885
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:56,673
This scenario looks familiar.

886
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,618
Actually we want to meet Sena.

887
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:03,622
Thanks for coming here from afar,

888
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,489
but Miss Sena is resting.

889
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,481
Please.

890
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:10,688
We have an urgent meeting with her.

891
01:06:10,684 --> 01:06:12,425
Alright.

892
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,525
Please follow me.

893
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:31,513
This is her room.

894
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:34,517
There it is!

895
01:06:41,682 --> 01:06:44,663
She used it until she became like this!

896
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:47,632
This fellow's brain has
nothing but meat!

897
01:06:47,654 --> 01:06:50,658
It'll be very dangerous
if we let it be.

898
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:52,568
What'll happen to her.

899
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,631
She will never get out
from the game world.

900
01:06:55,662 --> 01:06:59,576
In another words, she'll
be paralyzed forever.

901
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:03,446
I think it's fine to let her be.

902
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:04,575
We can just pull off the switch.

903
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:05,549
Wait!

904
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:08,653
If you pull off like this,

905
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:11,452
it'll bring the system
to reboot forcibly.

906
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:14,652
It's more safe to reset
it inside the game world.

907
01:07:14,648 --> 01:07:17,595
Why do I have to do this for her?

908
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:19,393
What's there to do?

909
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,627
Do you want to go?

910
01:07:29,596 --> 01:07:32,543
Welcome to Touya City
shopping district.

911
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:39,451
Hoping you have a pleasant
day here and happy shopping.

912
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:42,579
This is so amazing no
matter when we come in here.

913
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:45,681
As it's exactly same as Touya City.

914
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:50,424
Big brother, do you heard something?

915
01:09:02,474 --> 01:09:04,511
Is she an idiot?

916
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:12,337
What're you doing here?

917
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:16,406
We're here to take you back.

918
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:17,280
No.

919
01:09:18,306 --> 01:09:20,183
I refuse to go back.

920
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,188
Are you a fool?

921
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:24,315
Do you feel happy in
this virtual world?

922
01:09:24,346 --> 01:09:25,324
<i>I</i> do!

923
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:30,194
Because this is my world.

924
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:35,292
I don't think we'll
stop here, Meat.

925
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,270
Just go back!

926
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:42,170
I'll not let you in my way.

927
01:09:57,379 --> 01:10:00,360
Ready to run, Kodaka.

928
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:04,423
That president is very dangerous.

929
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:08,196
You must come back now.

930
01:10:21,436 --> 01:10:24,315
I don't care her anymore.

931
01:10:24,306 --> 01:10:26,217
But we can't.

932
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:29,279
Why we have to
suffer because of her?

933
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:31,416
We're just here to
claim back club fees.

934
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:34,189
Well, let's go back now.

935
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:38,425
We'll think of another way later.

936
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:20,201
Hey, you dropped this.

937
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:21,262
Thanks.

938
01:11:31,206 --> 01:11:32,207
Kodaka.

939
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,412
Come with me now.

940
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,259
What's going on?

941
01:11:43,284 --> 01:11:46,163
Everything was recovered.

942
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:49,430
Even things inside the refrigerator!

943
01:11:49,457 --> 01:11:54,338
I already took this back home.

944
01:11:54,462 --> 01:11:56,408
Kodaka, is it you?

945
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:58,172
Not me!

946
01:12:01,336 --> 01:12:05,182
Could it be... no way...

947
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:13,154
Long time no see.

948
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:13,454
Meat?

949
01:12:14,315 --> 01:12:16,261
Are you okay?

950
01:12:16,284 --> 01:12:17,228
What?

951
01:12:17,352 --> 01:12:19,354
Romancing Saga.

952
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:22,360
That's just a game.

953
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:26,304
I already got bored of it.

954
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:46,281
An-chan, today is so scary.

955
01:12:53,455 --> 01:12:55,162
Yozora.

956
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:59,261
Kodaka, this is very strange.

957
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,295
What's wrong?

958
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:06,210
The shop lady who always
ignores me talked to me just now.

959
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:07,235
Well...

960
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,314
Maybe she's happy to talk to you.

961
01:13:11,306 --> 01:13:14,378
You just so unreliable!

962
01:13:30,325 --> 01:13:31,201
Yes?

963
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:36,437
Big brother, I have something
to discuss with you.

964
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:37,408
What?

965
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:45,281
I went back home just like usual
after the Neighbour Club's activity.

966
01:13:45,273 --> 01:13:49,415
I saw a stranger was staying
in my house once I stepped in.

967
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:51,287
Who was it?

968
01:13:51,346 --> 01:13:56,318
I'm not mature enough,
I can't understand this.

969
01:13:56,317 --> 01:14:00,265
So I thought, maybe Big brother
will know a way to solve this.

970
01:14:00,288 --> 01:14:01,392
I don't know, either.

971
01:14:01,422 --> 01:14:03,265
I'm sorry.

972
01:14:03,258 --> 01:14:07,365
Are you sure that it's your house?

973
01:14:07,395 --> 01:14:13,277
That's the place where I grew up,
yet my parents were not there, either.

974
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:17,147
I don't even know that Sato
family who staying in my house!

975
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:20,345
Could your family is
in some sort of trouble?

976
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,184
I don't know.

977
01:14:22,176 --> 01:14:24,417
I tried to figure it out,

978
01:14:24,445 --> 01:14:26,322
it's not kidnapping either,

979
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:32,423
so I tried to seek help from police, but
the officer said that's Sato's house.

980
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:37,199
So I'm here to discuss it with Big brother.

981
01:14:37,225 --> 01:14:40,263
Oh yeah, how do you know my house?

982
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:44,368
As I'd stalked you many times.

983
01:14:47,302 --> 01:14:52,274
You'll just stay in my place for tonight.

984
01:14:52,307 --> 01:14:55,288
Thank you very much.

985
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:22,179
Damn.

986
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:29,251
Are your parents sick?

987
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:32,315
Please protect my peaceful heart.

988
01:15:32,347 --> 01:15:36,193
I'm your god, your master.

989
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:38,356
I'm not specific.

990
01:15:38,353 --> 01:15:42,324
You can't create God's image.

991
01:15:42,357 --> 01:15:45,429
I'm your god, your master.

992
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,203
When you make an offer to your master,

993
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:52,336
please offer in the way I allow.

994
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,244
The meat that you offered,

995
01:15:54,268 --> 01:15:57,442
don't eat it on that
day or the next day.

996
01:15:57,438 --> 01:16:01,386
Burn it until the 3rd day.

997
01:16:02,443 --> 01:16:05,356
Boys and girls, good day.

998
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,329
Now we're going announce the result
for student council president election.

999
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:14,299
Please gather in the main hall.

1000
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:19,338
The result is...

1001
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,300
Our new student council president
is our top student, Kashiwazaki Sena!

1002
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:34,219
As a student council
president, I'll do my very best!

1003
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:37,315
Sena!?!

1004
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:50,302
What's going on here?

1005
01:16:50,324 --> 01:16:55,273
Something serious
is going to happen.

1006
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:56,434
How serious could it be?

1007
01:16:56,464 --> 01:17:00,378
The imagination is starting
to erode our daily life.

1008
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:02,278
How could this happen?

1009
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:06,184
Sena's reality and virtual
world have been mixed together.

1010
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:07,242
No way!

1011
01:17:17,285 --> 01:17:18,423
Sena!?!

1012
01:17:24,192 --> 01:17:26,331
Okay, that's enough.

1013
01:17:26,327 --> 01:17:28,204
Let's go back to the original world.

1014
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:31,301
How can we end this absurd thing?

1015
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:34,370
Destroy the software and
reboot it forcibly.

1016
01:17:34,402 --> 01:17:37,281
It should be able to bring
us back to normal world.

1017
01:17:37,271 --> 01:17:38,249
I see.

1018
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:43,186
So, this is one big bet.

1019
01:17:44,212 --> 01:17:46,158
What's this?

1020
01:17:58,326 --> 01:18:00,169
What's this?

1021
01:18:00,194 --> 01:18:01,264
Oh gosh.

1022
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:08,271
We have to find the software now.

1023
01:18:12,206 --> 01:18:15,380
The police can't do anything about this.

1024
01:18:15,409 --> 01:18:18,356
We'll go there together tomorrow.

1025
01:18:18,379 --> 01:18:20,416
Alright, thanks.

1026
01:18:21,415 --> 01:18:23,224
I said this is my house!

1027
01:18:23,251 --> 01:18:24,195
I said this is my house!

1028
01:18:24,218 --> 01:18:24,389
It's mine!

1029
01:18:24,418 --> 01:18:26,329
Enough, get out!

1030
01:18:26,354 --> 01:18:27,389
No way!

1031
01:18:27,421 --> 01:18:30,163
Enough, get out!

1032
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:32,296
This old man is talking nonsense!

1033
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:35,365
Who're you? Do you know this girl?

1034
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:37,171
Say something!

1035
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:37,403
This girl is too funny.

1036
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:39,308
You're talking nonsense, old man!

1037
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,404
What're you doing in my house?

1038
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:43,278
I told you this has always
been my house!

1039
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:44,215
Look!

1040
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:47,285
I'm calling the police.

1041
01:18:47,408 --> 01:18:51,151
And I'm not an old man!

1042
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,331
Kodaka.

1043
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:18,411
So, you're also facing
the same problem.

1044
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:20,419
Some strangers are staying there.

1045
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:22,182
Same here.

1046
01:19:23,177 --> 01:19:26,420
While on the way home, I saw
Maria was wandering at main gate.

1047
01:19:26,447 --> 01:19:28,324
So I took her in.

1048
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:31,421
The other sisters are gone.

1049
01:19:32,453 --> 01:19:36,162
What's going on here?

1050
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,199
Kodaka! Kodaka, wake up!

1051
01:20:09,223 --> 01:20:09,394
Yes.

1052
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:12,362
We have problem.

1053
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:37,288
Finally, the moment where we have no
room to advance or to retreat is here.

1054
01:20:37,318 --> 01:20:40,231
It's so quiet out there.

1055
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:42,359
This is the end.

1056
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:46,364
She's the one who imagined this game.

1057
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:51,241
What a terrible mine she has.

1058
01:20:53,434 --> 01:20:57,382
That came from our school!

1059
01:20:57,438 --> 01:21:00,214
I'm Red Team captain.

1060
01:21:00,207 --> 01:21:02,346
White Team, go for it!

1061
01:21:02,376 --> 01:21:05,357
Red Team is very fast, very fast.

1062
01:21:05,379 --> 01:21:09,156
White Team, don't lose!

1063
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:19,237
So Meat is here?

1064
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:23,140
If she is here,
what're you going to do?

1065
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:24,335
Punch her.

1066
01:21:25,232 --> 01:21:29,237
And then end this ridiculous world.

1067
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:32,376
Miss Sena wants to
stay in this world.

1068
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:34,443
Please go back.

1069
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,280
Let go of me, Kodaka!

1070
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:40,292
We're out-numbered.

1071
01:21:54,328 --> 01:21:57,241
The Neighbour's Club
members were here.

1072
01:21:57,264 --> 01:22:01,406
And they want to take you back.

1073
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,414
What's wrong with that sight?

1074
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:11,253
What're you looking at?

1075
01:22:11,278 --> 01:22:13,417
I have high hope on you.

1076
01:22:13,414 --> 01:22:19,365
You just need to do
what you should do.

1077
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:22,332
No! No! No!

1078
01:22:24,258 --> 01:22:27,239
I refuse to go back!

1079
01:22:28,362 --> 01:22:31,275
I want to be here!

1080
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,340
I don't want to go back
to the original world!

1081
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:51,387
Our school is here,

1082
01:22:51,385 --> 01:22:53,296
but our club room is here.

1083
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,163
What's happening?

1084
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,429
Senpai, look.

1085
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:59,396
We got lots of
food from the store.

1086
01:22:59,427 --> 01:23:02,340
That's enough for us for now.

1087
01:23:02,363 --> 01:23:03,239
Now?

1088
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:07,269
I will not stay here forever.

1089
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:09,406
What's situation on the
east side of the town?

1090
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:11,439
Nobody at all.

1091
01:23:12,306 --> 01:23:17,221
That Meat is doing something bad.

1092
01:23:18,446 --> 01:23:22,326
What should we do, if
this doesn't improve?

1093
01:23:22,349 --> 01:23:24,351
This is impossible.

1094
01:23:24,385 --> 01:23:26,331
But we at least
need a back-up plan.

1095
01:23:26,353 --> 01:23:29,232
What're you talking about?

1096
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:31,327
You don't want to leave this world?

1097
01:23:31,325 --> 01:23:32,360
I don't mean that.

1098
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:35,272
Then, please mind your words.

1099
01:23:35,262 --> 01:23:38,243
Don't make me angry.

1100
01:23:41,235 --> 01:23:45,377
Kobato and Maria are still asleep?

1101
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,284
Yeah, they're still sleeping.

1102
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:53,315
Pittiful girls. I think
they must be too tired.

1103
01:23:53,347 --> 01:23:57,352
We have to think of a way out.

1104
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,154
Can't sleep?

1105
01:24:27,448 --> 01:24:31,225
Yozora hasn't come back.

1106
01:24:31,252 --> 01:24:32,230
I see.

1107
01:24:46,267 --> 01:24:50,340
This is something very serious.

1108
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:52,181
Yes.

1109
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,286
Do you want to go back?

1110
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:04,192
Of course!

1111
01:25:05,186 --> 01:25:07,359
But you'll get bullied.

1112
01:25:07,388 --> 01:25:12,269
This has nothing to do with that.

1113
01:25:13,227 --> 01:25:18,438
I had seen you get
bullied many times.

1114
01:25:23,437 --> 01:25:24,415
I see.

1115
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,345
Why don't you fight back?

1116
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:32,323
Because I'm still immature.

1117
01:25:33,347 --> 01:25:36,419
One day I will have revenge.

1118
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:37,428
I see.

1119
01:25:41,388 --> 01:25:45,336
Big brother, will you fight back?

1120
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:54,401
I don't know.

1121
01:25:58,272 --> 01:25:59,250
I see.

1122
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:12,355
Sorry, I'm not only immature,
but also pessimistic.

1123
01:26:17,258 --> 01:26:18,134
Why?

1124
01:26:20,227 --> 01:26:26,337
Big brother, when you see I
get bullied by others,

1125
01:26:30,371 --> 01:26:35,377
you'll not come and save me, right?

1126
01:27:45,245 --> 01:27:46,246
Yozora.

1127
01:27:52,286 --> 01:27:55,165
What're you doing?

1128
01:27:55,255 --> 01:27:56,290
Nothing.

1129
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:06,433
Kodaka.

1130
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:15,420
What're you thinking,

1131
01:28:16,343 --> 01:28:20,382
after coming to this world?

1132
01:28:23,317 --> 01:28:29,290
What will we do if this world
continues becoming like this?

1133
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:30,427
Who knows.

1134
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:37,204
Actually you already
have the answer.

1135
01:28:42,169 --> 01:28:45,343
I don't think this is too bad.

1136
01:28:49,243 --> 01:28:50,415
That's it.

1137
01:28:51,445 --> 01:28:52,389
Yeah.

1138
01:28:56,350 --> 01:29:01,265
You really haven't changed at all.

1139
01:29:07,194 --> 01:29:13,167
Tomorrow I'm going
to invade the school.

1140
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:22,416
No matter what you think, I'm going
to end this boring world anyway.

1141
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:41,295
Yozora.

1142
01:29:47,234 --> 01:29:49,373
Long time no see.

1143
01:29:57,277 --> 01:29:58,255
I see.

1144
01:30:12,392 --> 01:30:15,373
Seems nobody is here.

1145
01:30:19,299 --> 01:30:20,243
Sena?

1146
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,342
I was chucked out.

1147
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:29,319
What?

1148
01:30:30,377 --> 01:30:34,223
They say they don't need me anymore.

1149
01:30:34,248 --> 01:30:36,421
What's going on here?

1150
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:40,193
Where's Yozora-senpai?

1151
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:44,334
This world... This world...

1152
01:31:05,312 --> 01:31:09,317
I have been waiting for you.

1153
01:31:11,318 --> 01:31:14,356
You can stay in this world with
everything you have now.

1154
01:31:14,354 --> 01:31:18,131
You're clumsy but kind,

1155
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:21,331
that's why you can't
survive in reality.

1156
01:31:21,328 --> 01:31:25,435
So, this is your world, Yozora.

1157
01:31:30,237 --> 01:31:32,274
Yozora's world.

1158
01:31:32,339 --> 01:31:33,215
Why?

1159
01:31:34,308 --> 01:31:37,221
Why isn't it mine?

1160
01:31:46,386 --> 01:31:50,232
He'd forgotten
everything. It's his bad.

1161
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:53,261
You helped him a lot.

1162
01:31:54,294 --> 01:31:55,272
Is it?

1163
01:31:56,296 --> 01:31:59,209
Then, just stay here forever.

1164
01:31:59,232 --> 01:32:03,271
So that you won't get hurt.

1165
01:32:16,316 --> 01:32:19,320
Big brother, I'm so sleepy.

1166
01:32:24,257 --> 01:32:25,327
Yukimura!

1167
01:32:26,426 --> 01:32:29,430
What'll happen to us?

1168
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:33,277
If this is Yozora-senpai's world,

1169
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:38,181
and her wish is getting
stronger, we'll be trapped here.

1170
01:32:38,205 --> 01:32:39,411
What's that?

1171
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:44,153
Which means, we'll be trapped
inside this world forever.

1172
01:32:44,177 --> 01:32:48,319
We'll fall asleep like Yukimura and
the others until our life ends.

1173
01:32:48,348 --> 01:32:50,191
Are you kidding me?

1174
01:32:50,217 --> 01:32:52,424
Why're we inside Yozora's world?

1175
01:32:52,452 --> 01:32:55,365
Maybe that's the software is over there.

1176
01:32:55,389 --> 01:32:57,300
Rika's going up to the roof.

1177
01:32:57,324 --> 01:33:03,275
Senpai, please go and
find Yozora-senpai.

1178
01:33:22,449 --> 01:33:24,156
Yozora!

1179
01:33:24,317 --> 01:33:27,321
Anything I can help you with?

1180
01:33:27,354 --> 01:33:31,325
I want to take Yozora back.

1181
01:33:33,226 --> 01:33:35,297
Are you serious?

1182
01:33:37,264 --> 01:33:42,338
Without Yozora, this
world will be ended too.

1183
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:50,186
Don't force yourself, just
stay in this world, okay?

1184
01:33:54,414 --> 01:33:57,293
I'll not let you interfere with us!

1185
01:33:57,317 --> 01:34:03,165
This is the world
which Yozora desires.

1186
01:34:05,225 --> 01:34:09,332
I wonder how many floors to go?

1187
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:14,310
Hey, it's a waste
to call you milk cow.

1188
01:34:14,334 --> 01:34:16,405
From now on, you're Meat.

1189
01:34:16,436 --> 01:34:18,313
Hey, Meat.

1190
01:34:20,273 --> 01:34:22,253
Stupid Yozora.

1191
01:34:29,449 --> 01:34:31,292
So boring?

1192
01:34:31,418 --> 01:34:34,399
Why you don't fight back?

1193
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:37,265
Don't want to hurt others?

1194
01:34:37,257 --> 01:34:39,294
No, I don't think so.

1195
01:34:39,326 --> 01:34:45,140
You just don't want
to hurt yourself.

1196
01:34:53,273 --> 01:34:56,413
They're living
according to their heart,

1197
01:34:56,409 --> 01:35:00,289
with no lies and no camouflage.

1198
01:35:01,448 --> 01:35:04,156
How about you?

1199
01:35:05,385 --> 01:35:09,162
Blaming everything on others!

1200
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:11,260
You never did anything wrong!

1201
01:35:11,258 --> 01:35:13,431
What's wrong is your
glare and your appearance!

1202
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:17,169
I'm the person so misunderstood!

1203
01:35:17,197 --> 01:35:19,199
I'm so angry!

1204
01:35:21,168 --> 01:35:22,408
Wake up now!

1205
01:35:23,236 --> 01:35:25,238
Only you know!?

1206
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:34,383
How well do you know this?

1207
01:35:38,351 --> 01:35:43,357
Of course I do, as
I'm part of this world.

1208
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:45,165
Come on!

1209
01:35:46,293 --> 01:35:49,137
Come! And hit me!

1210
01:35:53,433 --> 01:36:01,409
Not even able to save your
friend, are you even a man?

1211
01:36:05,212 --> 01:36:07,158
Sorry! Sorry!

1212
01:36:11,351 --> 01:36:13,331
Are you okay?

1213
01:36:14,287 --> 01:36:15,288
Thanks.

1214
01:36:19,226 --> 01:36:19,397
'Up-

1215
01:36:21,194 --> 01:36:24,368
My name is Kodaka,
you can call me Taka.

1216
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:26,344
My name is...

1217
01:36:27,334 --> 01:36:29,371
Yozora and I...

1218
01:36:33,306 --> 01:36:36,219
You can't change anything!

1219
01:36:36,243 --> 01:36:40,350
You can't protect anyone, Taka!

1220
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,261
Yo...zora...

1221
01:36:46,353 --> 01:36:49,232
It's useless, she'll never wake.

1222
01:36:49,289 --> 01:36:51,269
She chose to stay in this world...

1223
01:36:51,258 --> 01:36:55,206
...instead of facing the reality
that made her disappointed.

1224
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:56,229
Yozora!

1225
01:37:14,247 --> 01:37:16,352
What're you looking at?

1226
01:37:16,349 --> 01:37:17,384
Nothing.

1227
01:37:18,318 --> 01:37:21,356
Just looking at the sky.

1228
01:37:21,354 --> 01:37:28,272
I imagine there's something
there, and I feel happy.

1229
01:37:28,295 --> 01:37:32,266
I'll never forget you even when
I transfer to another school.

1230
01:37:32,299 --> 01:37:36,406
Next time when we meet,
I'll become stronger.

1231
01:37:36,436 --> 01:37:39,280
Next time I'll protect you.

1232
01:37:39,272 --> 01:37:40,376
Don't force yourself, Taka.

1233
01:37:40,407 --> 01:37:45,379
No, if I'm not able to protect
my friend, then I'm not a man.

1234
01:37:45,378 --> 01:37:49,224
We'll be friends forever.

1235
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:53,195
Yes.

1236
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:02,340
I'm Hasegawa Kodaka.

1237
01:38:33,426 --> 01:38:34,427
Yozora.

1238
01:38:40,367 --> 01:38:45,441
Let's go back. Back
to our original world.

1239
01:38:45,438 --> 01:38:49,386
It's okay, I'll stay here.

1240
01:38:50,443 --> 01:38:52,150
Yozora.

1241
01:38:54,214 --> 01:38:59,459
I don't want to feel
disappointed again.

1242
01:39:02,188 --> 01:39:04,225
Now I remember.

1243
01:39:06,192 --> 01:39:09,230
I remember it, Yozora.

1244
01:39:10,196 --> 01:39:15,168
It's useless, when
thing becomes like this.

1245
01:39:15,168 --> 01:39:16,340
It's my...

1246
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:21,276
It's my fault!

1247
01:39:22,308 --> 01:39:24,413
I'm sorry, I didn't
keep our promise.

1248
01:39:24,411 --> 01:39:26,413
You really didn't change at all.

1249
01:39:26,446 --> 01:39:34,228
Whether it's 10 years ago or
right now, you can't protect anyone.

1250
01:39:34,254 --> 01:39:36,291
It's my fault!

1251
01:39:36,423 --> 01:39:40,371
But you remember everything.

1252
01:39:41,394 --> 01:39:42,395
Yozora.

1253
01:39:42,462 --> 01:39:45,204
It's too late!

1254
01:39:51,204 --> 01:39:53,309
Can you hear it?

1255
01:39:54,307 --> 01:40:00,280
I'm Kashiwazaki Sena. I
have words for stupid Yozora.

1256
01:40:00,313 --> 01:40:04,261
How long are you're going to sleep?

1257
01:40:04,284 --> 01:40:07,265
Wake up now, stupid!

1258
01:40:08,254 --> 01:40:14,205
This world is not
mine! I hardly approve!

1259
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:19,209
I'll forgive you due
to our relationship.

1260
01:40:19,232 --> 01:40:23,408
But it's another story,
if you're not here.

1261
01:40:23,436 --> 01:40:28,283
If you're not here, who
else will call me Meat?

1262
01:40:28,341 --> 01:40:30,343
Come back now!

1263
01:40:31,311 --> 01:40:35,259
Please call me Meat again!

1264
01:40:36,249 --> 01:40:43,428
As this is the first time
someone gave me a nickname.

1265
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:51,433
Honestly, I hate you the most!

1266
01:40:51,464 --> 01:40:54,445
You have a bad personality
and hanging eyes!

1267
01:40:54,467 --> 01:40:58,313
You have a flat chest and you're
bad at singing!

1268
01:40:58,304 --> 01:41:01,217
Anyway, <i>I</i> hate you!

1269
01:41:03,243 --> 01:41:07,282
I won't be defeated by you!

1270
01:41:07,313 --> 01:41:13,320
The song that you sang during karaoke,
I can sing that better than you.

1271
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:15,196
Listen now!

1272
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:21,363
So wake up now! Stupid Yozora!

1273
01:42:39,272 --> 01:42:41,377
I'm your friend.

1274
01:42:43,209 --> 01:42:46,418
I'm Kodaka. Please call me Taka.

1275
01:42:46,446 --> 01:42:49,256
My name is Sora.

1276
01:42:57,257 --> 01:42:59,430
I'll protect you, Sora.

1277
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:09,278
Taka, do you know?

1278
01:43:10,403 --> 01:43:14,283
There's <i>7</i> billion
people in this world,

1279
01:43:14,307 --> 01:43:19,188
and whoever you can meet is destined.

1280
01:43:21,414 --> 01:43:25,260
And among these people,
those who become your friend...

1281
01:43:25,318 --> 01:43:28,356
...are a great miracle.

1282
01:43:29,255 --> 01:43:34,295
As the chances are one of <i>7</i> billion.

1283
01:43:51,344 --> 01:43:55,292
Can we create that miracle?

1284
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,259
Of course.

1285
01:44:25,345 --> 01:44:27,450
What's going on?

1286
01:44:34,287 --> 01:44:36,267
You're out of time.

1287
01:44:36,255 --> 01:44:40,226
This world is going to end.

1288
01:44:43,463 --> 01:44:46,307
Let's go, Yozora.

1289
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:49,345
Sora!

1290
01:45:12,225 --> 01:45:14,330
Can you hear it?

1291
01:45:14,327 --> 01:45:17,399
Can you hear my voice?

1292
01:45:29,175 --> 01:45:30,245
UNIVERSE!

1293
01:45:49,228 --> 01:45:51,265
Mikazuki Yozora.

1294
01:46:07,413 --> 01:46:10,394
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

1295
01:46:18,257 --> 01:46:20,168
What a relief!

1296
01:46:20,193 --> 01:46:22,366
What's going on here?

1297
01:46:22,361 --> 01:46:25,205
Are we coming back safely?

1298
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:25,437
Safe?

1299
01:46:26,365 --> 01:46:29,175
Of course you're safe now.

1300
01:46:29,168 --> 01:46:33,139
Since Rika couldn't reset it, she
used this to smash the software.

1301
01:46:33,172 --> 01:46:35,209
Where's Kobato?

1302
01:46:36,175 --> 01:46:38,246
Maria is not here, either.

1303
01:46:38,277 --> 01:46:44,284
What're you talking about?
Neither of them took part in this.

1304
01:46:44,317 --> 01:46:46,297
Big brother, look...

1305
01:46:50,289 --> 01:46:52,291
What's happening here?

1306
01:46:52,325 --> 01:46:57,365
Rika, how many times have
we played this game today?

1307
01:46:57,396 --> 01:47:02,345
Of course today is the first time.

1308
01:47:12,245 --> 01:47:17,251
Which means, we were playing that game...

1309
01:47:17,283 --> 01:47:20,196
Even after it ended the first time.

1310
01:47:20,219 --> 01:47:23,200
But Kobato and Maria were there too.

1311
01:47:23,222 --> 01:47:24,428
That's because...

1312
01:47:24,457 --> 01:47:31,272
...your memory created their
personality in the virtual world.

1313
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:32,242
I see.

1314
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:40,284
In another words, that world
is someone's dream world.

1315
01:47:40,306 --> 01:47:42,343
I wonder whose.

1316
01:47:46,379 --> 01:47:49,292
Maybe it's Sena's.

1317
01:47:55,421 --> 01:47:57,196
Run now!

1318
01:48:16,442 --> 01:48:19,321
Someone said this before...

1319
01:48:19,345 --> 01:48:22,326
There's <i>7</i> billion
people in this world,

1320
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:27,229
and whoever you can meet is destined.

1321
01:48:29,288 --> 01:48:34,431
And among these people,
those who can be your friend...

1322
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:38,203
...are a great miracle.

1323
01:49:10,329 --> 01:49:14,243
I thought I had dismissed your club!

1324
01:49:14,266 --> 01:49:17,304
Please leave here now!

1325
01:49:29,281 --> 01:49:31,352
Make... Friends...

1326
01:49:33,285 --> 01:49:38,325
As the chances are one of <i>7</i> billion.

1327
01:49:39,358 --> 01:49:41,395
With... Taka...?

1328
01:49:43,295 --> 01:49:44,171
Yes.

1329
01:49:44,363 --> 01:49:45,398
For me,

1330
01:49:51,437 --> 01:49:55,180
Make friends with Taka?

1331
01:49:55,341 --> 01:49:59,289
I don't have many friends.
