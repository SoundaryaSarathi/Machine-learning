1
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:07,692
Vivian, the Sex Pistols,
Seven Star cigarettes,

2
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:11,062
coffee with milk,
cake with a strawberry on top.

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,992
And the lotus flower.

4
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:16,302
The things Nana liked
were always the same.

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:21,242
I used to think that was cool because
I could never stick to one thing.

6
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,822
When I was darkness at that time

7
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:41,662
With trembling lips

8
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:44,752
In a corner of a room I cry

9
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,832
The more I struggle

10
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,672
The more this wound deepens

11
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:55,832
The broken promise hurt me

12
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,572
Nobody can save me

13
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:03,752
God, I have only one request

14
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:07,382
Stop tearing apart my love

15
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,722
I need your love

16
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,952
I'm a broken rose

17
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,892
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

18
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:19,062
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

19
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:21,832
I need your love

20
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,142
I'm a broken rose

21
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:28,072
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

22
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:32,032
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

23
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:35,012
I wanna need your love

24
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,242
I'm a broken rose

25
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:40,582
I wanna need your love

26
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,722
Is that all you got?

27
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:59,602
Yup. I've asked my Mom to send
the rest of my stuff for me by courier.

28
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:03,662
I'm going to buy new furniture
and anything else I need.

29
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:06,172
How about you, Nana?

30
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,512
I got my guitar and this.
That's it.

31
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,582
What about your other stuff?

32
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:11,382
Let's see...

33
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,052
Write everything you need
on a piece of paper.

34
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,612
I'll send them to you
when I get back.

35
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:16,682
Get back?

36
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,422
Yasu just came up
to sign the papers for me.

37
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:20,622
He lives back home.

38
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,052
Huh? He's your guarantor?

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,582
What about your parents?

40
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,532
- Here's the list, Yasu.
- That was fast.

41
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,092
Oh, I get it!
You ran away from home!

42
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:29,902
You seem like the type.

43
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,302
And what type is that?

44
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:33,572
You're really from a posh family

45
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,162
and your parents were against
you being in a rock band!

46
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:39,002
Nana from a posh family?

47
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:39,912
She isn't?

48
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:42,872
What are you laughing at?!

49
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:46,352
Let me see, three boxes and...
is that it?

50
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:47,622
It's not even worth
the trouble sending.

51
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:48,982
Don't change the subject!

52
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:52,892
What about the other apartment?
Are you going to leave it as is?

53
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:57,092
Don't ask me.
That's not my apartment.

54
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,962
Why don't you ask him?

55
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,332
But he's so busy,

56
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,802
it's almost impossible to
get a hold of him.

57
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:08,332
Then leave it alone.

58
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:12,202
He's the one that
keeps paying the rent.

59
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,512
But that was for you...

60
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:20,112
I never asked him to.
I was planning to pay my own rent.

61
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,852
Though I admit
it was helpful until now.

62
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,722
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

63
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:30,822
Just stuff like, you can never figure out
what rich people are up to.

64
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,832
Hey, that's not nice.

65
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,702
Well then, I guess it's time
for us poor folk

66
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,232
to go out shopping
for bare necessities.

67
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,902
Yes! We'll first need
an air conditioner.

68
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,802
A space heater will do us just fine.

69
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,342
Well, I guess I'll be going then.

70
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:51,272
Huh?! You leaving so soon?
Why don't you stay a night?

71
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,752
By all means. Please stay.

72
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,052
Although we can't provide
much hospitality.

73
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:58,752
Thanks. I'd really love to,

74
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,512
but I've got a lot of work
piled up.

75
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,922
Oh right. You are a lawyer, after all.

76
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:06,192
We'll see you off at the station
on our way out shopping.

77
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:10,432
No, that's okay.
I'll get a cab to the airport.

78
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,602
Suit yourself.

79
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,232
Nana, why don't you go
see him off at the airport?

80
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,472
I'll do the shopping.

81
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,512
Don't worry about seeing me off.

82
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,082
Well then. Hang in there.

83
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,072
Thanks a lot for everything, Yasu.

84
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:30,482
Call me if you need any help.
I'll be here in a flash.

85
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:38,962
I was sure that skinhead lawyer
Nana calls Yasu

86
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:45,872
was her boyfriend or something,
but Nana was sure quick to deny that.

87
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:51,402
Yasu was a member
of the band I was in back home.

88
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:55,582
He was the leader
and easy to rely on.

89
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:58,582
So I guess he's kind of like
an older brother to me.

90
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:05,012
But, he came all the way
to Tokyo to sign a piece of paper.

91
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,282
To me that spells love.

92
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:08,892
That spells love?

93
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,902
Yasu's like that with anyone.

94
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,922
Helping others along
is second nature to him.

95
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:18,132
I think he was born
to be a lawyer.

96
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,772
Then do you have
another boyfriend?

97
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,672
Hey there's a dollar store.
Let's get a bunch of stuff here.

98
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:27,042
Let's find a shop that has cute stuff.

99
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,242
Then we'll go our separate ways.

100
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,812
W-Wait!

101
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:41,182
Hey Nana, don't you think
these cups are super cute?

102
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:42,992
You'd never imagine
they're only a dollar each.

103
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:46,162
Strawberries?

104
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,092
No?

105
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,332
If you want it,
go ahead and buy it.

106
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:50,862
Forget it then.

107
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:51,862
Why?!

108
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,572
Because. If you're not interested,
I don't want it either.

109
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,332
I wanna use
the same things you do.

110
00:05:57,342 --> 00:06:00,332
I don't care what we use.
Let's just get the shopping done.

111
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,782
But you don't like this, do you?
The strawberries.

112
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,882
Ah, sure I love strawberries...

113
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:07,912
...to eat.

114
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:09,952
Then I'm getting these.

115
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:13,252
I feel for Shoji.

116
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:14,612
What's that supposed to mean?

117
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:17,052
Well, you're like... you know.

118
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:18,662
Kinda like a dog.

119
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:19,422
I am?

120
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:23,072
You kinda stick around friendly-like
and you're real sincere,

121
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,132
but you need a lot of caring.

122
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:27,742
Like, not that I mind,

123
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,332
I was thinking about
getting a pet anyway.

124
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:36,542
Hey Hachi,
want me to buy you a toy?

125
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:40,042
Hachi? Don't you have
a cuter name for me?

126
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:44,512
We got a lot of
stuff pretty close by.

127
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,622
There are a lot of
cute shops around here too,

128
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,432
and the station area
is pretty convenient,

129
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,292
considering we're on
the outskirts of town.

130
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,822
That's Tokyo for you.

131
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:56,372
All we need now are futons,
a space heater, lights, a fridge, and...

132
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:57,862
Hey! Who's gonna carry it all?

133
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:07,302
Look, this looks like
a nice furniture shop!

134
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,312
Let's check it out!

135
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,012
We'll check out furniture later.
Come along, Hachi.

136
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,352
Aw, but they got
cool lighting and stuff.

137
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,312
Oh? Then just a peek.

138
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:21,992
All this stuff is really cool!
And cheap!

139
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:23,832
Well done, Hachiko.

140
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,462
Yay! Found a cute space heater!

141
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,302
I'm getting this for my room.

142
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,862
That looks like a good one
for the living room, don't you think?

143
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:38,512
How cute!

144
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,942
Says it's made in the fifties.
Is it usable?

145
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:44,652
Not a problem.
It's been fixed up.

146
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:46,342
Feel free to look around.

147
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:50,952
Our merchandise is all used goods
from the fifties to the seventies.

148
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,082
I go overseas myself and
find the real bargains.

149
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,192
I recommend everything here.

150
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,162
Is that so? So that's why
everything's so reasonably priced!

151
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,462
Hey, you're speaking
in a different voice.

152
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,302
You can rest at ease.

153
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,202
There's nothing here
that's not of good value.

154
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,572
Normally these things would be
a lot more expensive.

155
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,442
It's just a matter of me
not making any profit.

156
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:12,342
Hey come on, quit the chatter
and make up your mind already.

157
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,402
But they're all so nice,
I can't decide.

158
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,112
Are you looking for
something in particular?

159
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:18,842
Oh, all kinds of things.

160
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,652
We just moved and
the apartment's still bare.

161
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,692
How about these folding chairs?
They're a set of two.

162
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:26,822
We'll take 'em!

163
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:29,252
Oh, and how about that?

164
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:31,692
It's cute and
suits your image perfectly.

165
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,262
Then I'll take it.

166
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,462
Look at it before you decide.

167
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:41,932
So you guys are Nana and Hachi?
What a combination.

168
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:45,842
Well actually,
my name is Nana too,

169
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,402
but it's confusing to have
the same name, so Nana...

170
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,242
Was that the reason?
It's because you're like a pet dog.

171
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,512
Come by again and
take a closer look around.

172
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,212
Yes sir! We'll definitely be back!

173
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:57,322
Come to think of it,

174
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:01,192
do you think we can get the refrigerator
and the washing machine delivered today?

175
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,192
If you don't mind it being late,

176
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,532
I can bring it over myself
after I close up.

177
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:06,492
You're not that far.

178
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,192
Are you sure? Thanks.

179
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,262
Then could ya bring
this other stuff with ya?

180
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:14,162
Nana, that's asking a bit much,
don't you think?

181
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:16,142
Don't worry about it.
I'm going anyway.

182
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,472
Oh, Mr. Mizukoshi,
you're too nice.

183
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:21,072
Is everyone in Tokyo this nice?

184
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,472
When did you get his name?

185
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,922
Tell you the truth, I'd like to go
while there's still daylight

186
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,982
and set up your lights for you.

187
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:32,222
But the kid watching shop for me quit,
so I can't get out. It's a problem...

188
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,722
If I can do the job,
I'll work for you!

189
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,432
Wow, am I ever lucky!

190
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,692
I never expected to land
a job so quickly!

191
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,342
It's like luck
has suddenly landed on me.

192
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,672
Thank you, Demon Lord!

193
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:50,702
You flirt.

194
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,282
D-Don't get me wrong!

195
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,412
The reason I said
I wanted to work there

196
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,082
was because I liked the shop,

197
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,452
not because Mr. Mizukoshi
is twenty-nine and cool,

198
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:00,882
not to mention single...

199
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,582
You checked him out?

200
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,992
But he doesn't look like
he's almost thirty, does he?

201
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,182
I was surprised!

202
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,692
I thought he was
in his early twenties.

203
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:13,232
Oh yeah,
you're the love-at-first-sight champion.

204
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,892
H-How do you know that?

205
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,962
You spilled it all out
on the train the other day.

206
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:21,162
M-Maybe I did...

207
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:26,232
But anyway, I have no idea
what you see in that Mizukoshi.

208
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,242
Then who's your type, Nana?

209
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,542
My type?

210
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,752
For example,
who's your favorite celebrity?

211
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:36,052
Sid Vicious!

212
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:37,812
Of the Sex Pistols?

213
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:42,022
So you know them.
You listen to the Sex Pistols?

214
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,452
No, but I saw the movie,
"Sid and Nancy."

215
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:49,532
Figures. There are bound
to be a few people like this.

216
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:52,232
Hey, Nana, the futons are
on the seventh floor.

217
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,892
Seven again?

218
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:58,002
Hey Nana, I was just thinking.

219
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,542
What is it, Hachi?

220
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,742
You know how we walk into
our apartment with our shoes on?

221
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,782
I mean,
Tokyo is not a foreign country.

222
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,382
So what's the big deal?

223
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:09,082
Well, doesn't it bother you
to lay futons on the floor?

224
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,952
Don't you think it's kinda dirty?

225
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,352
Well then, I guess we could go
with sleeping bags.

226
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:14,552
No! I won't go for that!

227
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:19,092
Mizukoshi! You got beds?!

228
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:19,922
Thanks for your patronage!

229
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,802
Oh great. Now we can start living.

230
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:29,902
And he gave us such a discount.
He's so kind, Mr. Mizukoshi.

231
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,602
Well, if you buy that much off of him,
it's to be expected.

232
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:36,642
Hello! Nana here!

233
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,282
You're Hachi, remember?

234
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:43,112
Hi Shoji! I'm out doing
some shopping with Nana.

235
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:47,722
I'm not being pushy.
We're getting along fine.

236
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:48,652
Oh yeah?

237
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,522
Shoji, are you still at work?

238
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:54,662
Yeah. But it looks like
I'm gonna get off early tonight,

239
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,332
so you wanna meet me
for dinner at Jackson?

240
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,372
You said you wanted
to go there once.

241
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:01,702
Oh that place you always go to?!
Sure, I'd love to go!

242
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:05,662
Nana, do you wanna join us?
Shoji's treating us to dinner!

243
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,142
Hey! I never said I was paying!

244
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:10,942
But Mizukoshi's coming over this evening,
so someone'd better be home.

245
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:11,782
Oh you're right.

246
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,352
Mizukoshi?

247
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:14,992
Hey no worries.

248
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:17,252
I'll just stay home,
so you go ahead on your date.

249
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:18,722
- But...
- Hey Nana!

250
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,922
Hmm... So you're gonna choose
Mizukoshi over Shoji?

251
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:25,052
Hello Shoji?
Where should I meet you, at what time?!

252
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:26,922
Who the heck is Mizukoshi?

253
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:29,802
Th-The old man at
the furniture shop!

254
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:36,002
Nana. Why'd you say that?
Shoji heard you.

255
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,812
I know he took it wrong.

256
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:40,542
And I'm going to be working
at Mizukoshi's starting tomorrow.

257
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:44,672
Well then, I suggest you not do
anything to make him suspicious.

258
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:45,782
Come on.

259
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,822
Hey Nana.
I've been looking for this CD.

260
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,322
Would you mind if
we look in that shop?

261
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:54,112
I don't mind,
but do you have a CD player?

262
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:57,532
Well, if you wanna use mine,
that's fine by me.

263
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:58,822
Thank you!

264
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,092
I hope they're not sold out.

265
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,912
Great, they still had a few left!

266
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:53,712
The new Trapnest album
went on sale today!

267
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,342
I just love them.

268
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:01,992
If you'd like,
you should listen to them, too.

269
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,392
They're super cool.

270
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,452
Hang on a minute while I go
and pay for this.

271
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,302
Thanks for waiting!

272
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,642
It came with a poster.

273
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:26,142
Don't tell me you're gonna put
that up in the apartment.

274
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,282
Why not? I'm going to put it
my own room anyway.

275
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:29,652
What are you?
A junior high school student?

276
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:32,092
But I like them so much,
I'm even a member of the fan club.

277
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:33,952
They're having a concert soon.

278
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,552
I bought two tickets. Wanna go?

279
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:37,792
Take Shoji.

280
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,332
That's what I first thought,
but on second thought,

281
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:43,822
I can't really stand next to Shoji
and scream for some other guy.

282
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,432
I like the guy on bass, Takumi, a lot.

283
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:47,272
Really.

284
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,132
Naoki on the drums is cool, too.

285
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:50,512
But you gotta admit.

286
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,632
The best thing about Trapnest
is the vocalist, Layla.

287
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,532
Her voice and her face are so pretty.
I so admire her.

288
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,242
Hey, what about the other guy?

289
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:58,612
Huh? The other guy?

290
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,612
You know, the guy on the guitar.
The most noticeable one.

291
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,052
- Oh, Ren?
- Just "oh"?

292
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:06,122
Sure Ren's cool and
he's the most popular,

293
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,692
but he doesn't say much
and he seems kinda scary.

294
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:09,022
I guess he's not really my type.

295
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,062
What? What's funny?

296
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,492
Oh, nothing.

297
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,292
Serves you right.

298
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:17,932
Hey, come to think of it,

299
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,062
Ren kinda looks like Sid from
the Sex Pistols, doesn't he?

300
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:23,402
You think so?
Sid's a million times cooler.

301
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,472
Nana, you dropped your lighter.

302
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:27,702
Oh, thanks.

303
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:34,912
Hey, Nana. Are you sure you don't mind
me going out and leaving you here?

304
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:38,282
Go ahead. You're gonna be out
all night anyway, right?

305
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,652
Don't you have dates or stuff
like that yourself?

306
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:41,852
Not at all.

307
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,252
Don't you have a boyfriend?

308
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,762
Not to speak of.

309
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:45,822
I thought so.

310
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:46,552
Huh?

311
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:49,992
Nana, you actually like Yasu, don't you?

312
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:53,602
You probably have
mixed feelings and stuff,

313
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:57,272
but if you hang on to that stiff upper lip,
you're gonna let happiness slip by.

314
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,642
Thanks for the wise words.

315
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:02,372
Okay then, I'm off.

316
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:08,052
Give my regards to Mr. Mizukoshi,
the 29-year-old!

317
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,592
Oh my, your door's wide open.

318
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,002
You'd wonder why we had locks
put on our doors.

319
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,392
If you hang on to that stiff upper lip,
you're gonna let happiness slip by.

320
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:49,252
You like this?

321
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:51,392
I got it from a street vendor.

322
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:54,032
It's a Sid Vicious pad lock.

323
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,432
And who are you? Nancy?

324
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:59,372
So what are you going to do
putting a lock on me?

325
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:07,442
Hey Ren. If I were to die,
would you die with me?

326
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:14,442
Okay.

327
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,862
I've spent my whole life feeling lonely.

328
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:29,292
I don't ever wanna be lonely again.

329
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:53,892
Thanks for a delicious meal!

330
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:55,852
Everything was so good.

331
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:59,092
You sure ate a lot!
You're gonna get fat.

332
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,162
But it was so good.

333
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,662
Especially the hamburger.
That was the best!

334
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:06,342
Nana. If you're gonna start working
at Sabrina's tomorrow,

335
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,392
come by for lunch.

336
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,062
Sure! I'll come every day.

337
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,802
Looking forward to seeing you,
Koichi Sato.

338
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:14,272
You just met the man and
it's like you're best of friends already.

339
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,912
The burgers here,

340
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,572
you can have them prepared
for take-out, too, right?

341
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:20,442
Can I get one to go?
A Jackson burger.

342
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,142
Okay.

343
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,442
You're gonna eat more?!

344
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,152
No, it's for Nana.

345
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,952
Oh, I see.

346
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,252
I'll make it right away.
Give me a minute.

347
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:34,762
Nana, are you thinking
of going home already?

348
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,322
It's only ten o'clock.

349
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:40,132
But I wanna get the burger
to Nana before it gets cold.

350
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,702
Then why don't you go and give it to her,
then come on over to my place.

351
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:46,072
Shoji, are you drunk?
I can see exactly what your motives are.

352
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:48,012
Come on, it's only once in awhile.

353
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:50,882
It's not once in awhile.
It's been every day since I arrived.

354
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,452
Yesterday, you said you were tired,
yet twice...

355
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,282
There's nothing wrong
with that, is there?

356
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,952
We're finally able to see
each other every day like this.

357
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:03,222
You're right. I still feel like
I'm in the middle of a dream.

358
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,152
But not today!

359
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:09,232
Taxi!

360
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:17,602
Why?

361
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:20,342
Nana's stuck in that empty room
all by herself.

362
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:21,372
She'll be lonely.

363
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:23,272
That girl's not the kind
to get lonely!

364
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,152
Besides what are you catching a cab for?
You live close by.

365
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:26,982
Let me walk you home.

366
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:29,582
I'll be all right!
I've got a job now!

367
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,852
I wanna get this hamburger home
while it's warm. Every minute counts.

368
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,182
Aren't you going a bit overboard?

369
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:35,052
See ya!

370
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,092
You may go now.

371
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,532
You mean to tell me
she's fallen in love with that girl?

372
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:46,762
I'm sorry, Shoji.

373
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,542
You can go to Sachiko's place tonight
if you want to.

374
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,852
I ran up the seven flights of stairs
as fast as I could.

375
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:35,122
When I opened the door, I could see
that the bedding and beds had arrived,

376
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:36,992
but there was Nana fast asleep
by the heater,

377
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,782
wrapped up in a single blanket.

378
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:48,002
Hey Nana. You were so cool,
strutting your stuff like a stray cat.

379
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,622
Free and proud.

380
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:52,402
But you always had that hurt
in you that could never heal.

381
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:57,102
Me? I was so footloose and fancy free,
I even thought that hurt was cool.

382
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,002
Not knowing how badly it hurt.

383
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:12,742
I reached into the sky

384
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:19,262
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

385
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:24,632
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

386
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:30,632
Like colorful balloons

387
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,742
I'm alone

388
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:36,472
My hand had no place to go

389
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:43,112
And gently you took it

390
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,292
Starless night

391
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:48,492
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

392
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:54,292
I want to feel your warmth

393
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:56,172
Tears are falling down

394
00:21:56,172 --> 00:22:00,302
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

395
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:06,772
Of your hand holding mine
