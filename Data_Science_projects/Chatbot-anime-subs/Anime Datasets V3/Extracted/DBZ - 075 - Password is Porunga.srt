00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,750
"Thou Who Hast Gathered the Seven
Balls... Now Speak Forth the Password"

2
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,920
I wonder if I look any stronger.

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,180
I bet if Mother-

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,260
or Piccolo-san were to see me in
this outfit, they'd be surprised.

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,400
But for some reason, I sure feel as though I'm stronger now!

6
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,330
I'm the strongest warrior in the universe, Son Gohan!

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,460
Hey, you there!

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,470
That pip-squeak friend of yours said
something about taking two hours
before he would return, right?

9
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,720
Yeah.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,350
All right, then.

11
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,070
Stand guard over those Dragonballs well, then.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,290
I'll be taking a nap inside the spaceship.
Wake me when he gets back.

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,750
A nap?

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,870
I haven't had any sleep now for quite a while.

15
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,430
Just sit tight, Gohan and Goku!

16
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,270
I'll find out how to summon Shenlong and be back soon.

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,020
That rotten creep!

18
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,990
I can't even be sure he hasn't already
killed the Grand Elder-san.

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,910
Please, let me be make it in time!

20
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,040
I have to tell Kuririn-san and the others
about the password as soon as possible!

21
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,260
There they are!

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,970
Strange.

23
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,690
I don't feel any Ki.

24
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm too late!

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,870
Kuririn-san!

26
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,550
It's not him!

27
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,970
Okay then, where is Kuririn-san?

28
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,740
Kakarrot.

29
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Once Freeza is out of the way, you're next.
Until then, I need you on my side.

30
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,360
I can't believe I've let myself come to this.

31
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,710
I'll sleep for thirty minutes.That should be enough
to allow me to count on my full power.

32
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,720
When I open my eyes again, I will be able
to obtain eternal life and youth for myself.

33
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,690
That should make for some pleasant dreams.

34
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,620
Freeza could show up at any minute.
He's got a lot of nerve going to sleep.

35
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,320
I am only using my left hand,
yet you have still done so poorly.

36
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,150
Surely now you see there is no way you can win.

37
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,580
How about speakin to me now? Tell me
how the Dragonballs grant my wish.

38
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,650
You have continued to expend
your energies so pointlessly.

39
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,780
Such actions cannot possibly work against me,
can they? Have you not fully realized this yet?

40
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,000
I cannot understand why you continue to defy me,
when you must certainly know you are beaten?

41
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,590
Is it because your friends have been killed?
Or perhaps, is it due to common stubbornness?

42
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,230
Let me make this my final warning. Tell
me how the Dragonballs grant wishes.

43
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,190
You will die, otherwise.

44
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,750
Even if you were to find out,
by now, it no longer matters.

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,840
Very soon, Dende will arrive at the...
location where the... Earthlings are.

46
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,680
He is there to tell them... the very
same password you're after!

47
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,430
What!?

48
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,470
Him?

49
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,650
Why you! You've just been buying time for him!?

50
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,160
The Ginyu Special Corps -I get no reading on them!

51
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,120
Can it be that all five of them have been eliminated?

52
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,500
In any case, something's happened between Vegeta,
the Earthlings, and the Ginyu Special Corps!

53
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,750
So what's happened to the Dragonballs!?

54
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,350
Rotten punks! It will be to me,
Freeza-sama, that that wish is granted!

55
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,230
It will not be to you lower life forms!

56
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:29,910
How regrettable that it must come to this.
I should have told the Earthlings the
password when I had the chance.

57
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,210
Now I've caused Nail to suffer so terribly.

58
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,520
Move swiftly, Dende.
It seems my end has drawn near.

59
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Kuririn-san!

60
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,690
Gohan-san!

61
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:35,320
I wonder if it really will take Kuririn-san two whole
hours to get to the Grand Elder-san and back.

62
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,700
What am I supposed to do if Freeza
comes back before then?

63
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,700
I hope Kuririn-san gets back soon.

64
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,860
A Ki!

65
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,610
Someone is flying towards Goku's direction.

66
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,360
I recognize this Ki.

67
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,170
I knew it! It's Dende!

68
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,880
HEY!

69
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,470
It's me, it's me! I'm just dressed this way is all.

70
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,550
Kuririn-san!

71
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,100
Thank goodness!

72
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,870
Hey, you...

73
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're that bad Ginyu fellow, who took over
my father's body and such, aren't you?

74
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,800
I knew it! Come here, you!

75
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,390
You can't do anymore bad stuff now.

76
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,590
This really saves our necks. We've gotten
all the Dragonballs together, but we
couldn't get Shenlong to appear,

77
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,640
So I was just on my way to the Grand Elder-san's
place to find out what the password is.

78
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,480
That's what I thought. I was told by the
Grand Elder-sama to find you and tell
you how to get your wish granted.

79
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,780
Oh, really? So, what is it were supposed to say?

80
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,950
The password must be spoken in the Namekian
language, or else the wish will not be granted.

81
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Namekian, huh? That makes sense.

82
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,080
The Grand Elder-san isn't very good
with people, or else he could have
told us that while we were there.

83
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,920
He must not have thought you were going
to be able to get all the Dragonballs
together, or he would have.

84
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe so.

85
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,800
Never mind that, we must hurry!
The Grand Elder-sama's life is nearly at an end.

86
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,970
Freeza might be on his way, as well.

87
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,550
Yeah, you're right.

88
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,560
Something's coming...

89
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,650
It's Kuririn-san... But I can feel two Ki...

90
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,490
He's hidden his Ki!

91
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,420
It really is Kuririn-san. But who's with him?

92
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,010
It's Dende-kun. Yea!

93
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,590
-We made it! It's Gohan! -Thank goodness!

94
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,560
That was incredibly fast! How did you manage it?

95
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,230
Easy. Dende here was asked by the
Grand Elder-san to come to us.

96
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,480
You mean, to tell us how to use the Dragonballs
and get our wish granted?

97
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,980
Right!

98
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,320
Now then, what's Vegeta up to?
I've been holding my Ki since before we got
here so he wouldn't realize we're back.

99
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,040
I don't think he's noticed. He said
something about not having slept recently,
and is napping inside the spaceship.

100
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,420
Great! This is working out nicely.

101
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,090
Okay, then. Very quietly, so Vegeta doesn't notice,
we'll carry the Dragonballs over to this area.

102
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,340
That way, even if he realizes that Shenlong has
appeared, well have bought some time.

103
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,170
Yahoo! We did it!

104
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,210
Okay, it's up to you now, Dende.

105
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,590
Right!

106
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,230
Kuririn-san, Something's coming this way. Very fast.

107
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,910
It's Freeza!

108
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,370
Hurry, Dende! Hurry and get our wish granted!

109
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,300
Nothing's happening.

110
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Hey, Dende, are you sure you
didn't goof up the password?

111
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,140
They're glowing!

112
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,900
The sky is getting dark!

113
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,110
Just like the Dragonballs on Earth!

114
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,330
What's this? Why has it suddenly become night?

115
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,080
It looks like the wish will soon be granted!

116
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,500
-They did it! -Yeah!

117
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,710
We can finally return to life!

118
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,000
Isn't this great, Ten-san?

119
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,400
He- he's huge! Far bigger than the one on Earth.

120
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,490
Is-is that Shenlong?

121
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,660
Here, he is called Porunga.
It means "God of Dreams''.

122
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,750
This is the first time I've seen him, too.

123
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,920
Thou who hast gathered the Dragonballs,
now speak thy wishes.

124
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,760
I shall grant thee any three wishes,
whichsoever art within my ability.

125
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,680
Three? Did he just say three?

126
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,890
That's right. You can have three wishes granted.

127
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,190
Really!? Looks like Nail-san was right!

128
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,150
What should we do? We have three wishes, three!

129
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,910
Porunga, the "Super" Shenlong finally appears.

130
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,920
What will Kuririn and the others
ask for with their three wishes?

131
