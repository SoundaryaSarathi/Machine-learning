1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,671
Oh, God, please save the soul of
this girl with a broken heart!

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,277
Zoisite, committing evil deeds
in a sacred place...

3
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:15,074
You're not getting away
with this anymore!

4
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:20,178
In the name of God,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

6
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

7
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,687
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

8
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

9
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:22,568
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

10
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
Nando mo meguriau

11
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:36,148
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

13
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560
Hi, I'm Usagi Tsukino.

15
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:02,972
As you know, I am the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

16
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,867
Sailor Moon!

17
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:09,080
At last, the fourth member
of our group appeared!

18
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,780
She's sweet and she's strong.

19
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,381
Makoto Kino is Sailor Jupiter!

20
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,724
With all four sailor warriors
together now,

21
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,817
it's like we're unbeatable now,
you know?

22
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:32,099
Bring A Smile To Naru's Face!
Usagi's Friendship

23
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:50,679
Quickly...

24
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:53,484
Quickly. Please find the Silver Crystal.

25
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,227
Please tell me!

26
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,958
What is the Silver Crystal?
Who in the world are you?

27
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:00,922
The Silver Crystal...

28
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:04,792
Once you find the
Silver Crystal, everything...

29
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:07,998
Once you find the
Silver Crystal, everything...

30
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,516
That same dream again!

31
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,086
Who is that princess?

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,460
Am I Tuxedo Mask?

33
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,530
The Silver Crystal...

34
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,466
If I can get my hands on it,
will it answer all my questions?

35
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,300
You have obtained one of the
rainbow crystals already.

36
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,608
But, Zoisite, what is your next plan?

37
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:49,114
Yes, my lady!

38
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,845
The Black Crystal already senses
another rainbow crystal.

39
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:11,634
The next rainbow crystal is
inside this man's body.

40
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,335
I shall leave it to you.

41
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:18,075
Juban Municipal Junior High School

42
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,552
Naru's absent again.

43
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,324
Mr. Nephrite...

44
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,226
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:44,326
I don't think we'll get to eat a
chocolate parfait together.

46
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,436
No...

47
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:57,049
No! You can't! You promised!

48
00:04:57,049 --> 00:05:01,110
You said we'd eat a chocolate
parfait together!

49
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:14,830
Mr. Nephrite!

50
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,568
Naru...

51
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,677
What?

52
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:26,845
You're going to visit Naru?

53
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:31,043
Yes, I am. She hasn't shown up
at school for a week now.

54
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,053
I bet she still hasn't been
able to recover.

55
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:34,820
What?

56
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,756
I thought Naru was out
because of a cold.

57
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:40,850
Honestly, you're just so dense!

58
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:47,099
Anyway, once we get to Naru's house,
make sure to cheer her up!

59
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,168
Of course, I will!

60
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,331
If that's what you want,
just leave it to me!

61
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,409
Jewelry

62
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,713
Sorry for showing up
without any warning.

63
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:03,682
We were just sort of wondering
how you were doing.

64
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:05,284
Well,

65
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,986
I was completely under the impression

66
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:08,887
that you were absent
because of a cold,

67
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:12,323
but could it be your heart was
broken or something?

68
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,757
You moron.

69
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,731
What was that all of a sudden?

70
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:21,100
Don't you have anything else to say?!

71
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,401
What?

72
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,602
Okay, then...

73
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:26,571
Then why don't we go somewhere
and eat a chocolate parfait?

74
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,574
Why you! You are just so...

75
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:29,274
Ouch...
Why you! You are just so...

76
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:29,908
Ouch...
Usagi.

77
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:30,567
Usagi.

78
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,502
You want to go out somewhere?

79
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,107
What?

80
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:39,707
And maybe have something
good to eat?

81
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:41,983
Naru...

82
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:44,757
Okay!

83
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,156
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,656
Hikawa Shrine

85
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,031
The power that could even
blow up a planet?

86
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:54,366
That's right! In other words,
apparently the Silver Crystal

87
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:57,636
has that much power,
depending on how you use it.

88
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:59,605
So, it has tremendous power.

89
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,775
So, where is this Silver Crystal?

90
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,010
I still don't know that yet.

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,214
But I found out that there are these
shards called rainbow crystals.

92
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,449
Shards?

93
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,520
That's right, the rainbow crystals are
pieces of the Silver Crystal.

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,455
Of course, that is a story
I heard a long time ago.

95
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,267
There were these bad guys
in the Dark Kingdom

96
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,734
called the Seven Monsters.

97
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:34,173
But apparently, someone
trapped them inside

98
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:37,040
the seven shards of the
legendary Silver Crystal.

99
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:43,048
With the rainbow crystals
dwelling inside of them,

100
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,017
the demons became
good-hearted humans

101
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,882
and came down to Earth.

102
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:53,792
And having become humans,
they led peaceful lives.

103
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:58,058
But Zoisite is trying to take the
rainbow crystals out of them.

104
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,499
If he can take the seven
rainbow crystals,

105
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,263
he can get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal!

106
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:06,338
On top of that, it also revives
an evil monster,

107
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:09,739
so the enemy is killing two birds
with one stone.

108
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,450
As long as I'm in this,

109
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,919
there's no way I'll let those
villains get their way.

110
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,790
That's what I was going to say.

111
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,294
But how do we find the people who
possess the rainbow crystals?

112
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:31,930
The wand that I gave Usagi
will respond to them!

113
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,329
What?!

114
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:39,805
In that case, I'm against letting
Usagi hang on to that wand!

115
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:40,739
Why?

116
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,442
You let her have it and she'll
just use it as a hammer

117
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,444
for some amateur carpentry!

118
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,312
I don't think even she
would go that far.

119
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:48,574
There!

120
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:52,305
But she may use it for
something close to that.

121
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,422
I trust Usagi!

122
00:08:57,422 --> 00:09:00,292
It's true that she completely
lacks a sense of duty,

123
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:01,927
and she's not dependable.

124
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:04,196
But that's why I want to give her
the status of the leader,

125
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:06,164
to give her more confidence!

126
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,233
Give her more confidence?

127
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:11,270
That's right! I think if she's given
an important role,

128
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,261
she'll gain a little more
sense of responsibility.

129
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,707
That will never happen!

130
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:18,310
Please! Give her a chance!

131
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,778
Please just acknowledge
her as the leader!

132
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,048
I'm still against it!

133
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,781
I think Usagi could...

134
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,217
I suppose. It'd be nice to see
how things go first.

135
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:43,001
I guess Usagi just doesn't inspire
people's trust in the end.

136
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:46,805
I still don't know much about her, so...

137
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:47,773
Of course!

138
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:51,709
Once you get to know Usagi better,
I'm sure you'll agree with me!

139
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,276
Hi hi!

140
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,405
Oh, Usagi?

141
00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:00,410
Everyone's here discussing something
important right now.

142
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,121
Would you mind coming over here?

143
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:07,559
Oh, sorry! But I have to go to
Chinatown in Yokohama

144
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,893
with Naru and Umino to eat tons
and tons of good food now.

145
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:14,857
Unbelievable! And at such
an important time!

146
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,736
Chinatown

147
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:28,336
Excuse me, but what's wrong
with you two?

148
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,609
You've been so quiet this whole time.

149
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,453
Chinatown is right over there.

150
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:37,251
Miss Usagi, you brought lots
of money with you, right?

151
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,917
There are so many tombs,

152
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:43,724
but I guess there isn't one
for Mr. Nephrite.

153
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:48,794
Naru...

154
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:52,471
I know! I want some Peking duck!

155
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,939
I've never had it before.

156
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:57,776
Wow! I can't wait!

157
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:01,213
I'll finally get to taste the Peking duck
I've always dreamed of!

158
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,983
I see! So, you want to become a
Peking duck that badly?!

159
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,247
No, I want to eat it.

160
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:10,923
Oh? Where's Naru?

161
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:13,483
What? Naru!

162
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,622
Father!

163
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,326
I want to you to tell me!
What should I do?

164
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:26,170
Someone very precious to me died...

165
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:46,747
He suffered so much,
but I couldn't help him.

166
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:50,862
You have a very beautiful heart.

167
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,432
I am sure that person's
soul was saved.

168
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:58,665
But now that I've lost him,
I have nothing left.

169
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:04,039
That is not true. Love will be right next
to you before you know it.

170
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:08,101
Turn around and you will find love.

171
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,973
If I turn around, there will be love?

172
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,216
You're...

173
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,122
My, my.

174
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:28,862
You're the person...

175
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:33,734
What a coincidence.
Fancy meeting you here.

176
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,788
Naru!

177
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,257
Naru!

178
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,798
Where in the world did she go?

179
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:11,177
What?!

180
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,780
Emergency! The wand is responding!

181
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,815
Luna! Why are you here?!

182
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,751
Never mind that! Hurry up and
take the wand out of your bag!

183
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,378
Okay!

184
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:27,450
That wand is telling us the location
of the seven rainbow crystals!

185
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,851
The seven rainbow crystals?

186
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,964
I'll explain everything later!

187
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,734
There's a chance a monster will appear
where the wand is pointing to!

188
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,668
What?!

189
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,829
Use the transmitter to call Mako!

190
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,232
Mako's around here, too?!

191
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,040
Chinatown
Okay, so the origin of the signal
is in the cemetery?

192
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,143
I will be right there!

193
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:51,184
The response is getting stronger.

194
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,552
Hurry!

195
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,153
Who are you?

196
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:58,180
Wouldn't you rather learn
more about yourself?

197
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,321
I am just a simple priest.

198
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:02,857
Do you really think so?

199
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:07,063
This Black Crystal here will
tell us who you really are.

200
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,770
That was Mr. Nephrite's... Don't!

201
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,304
Let go!

202
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,171
Please don't do any more bad things!
Let go!

203
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,297
Please don't do any more bad things!

204
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,570
Oh, no! Naru!

205
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,810
Wait until Mako comes!

206
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,870
Naru is in danger! I can't wait!

207
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,716
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

208
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,423
Stop this violence!

209
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:07,460
Why don't you worry about
yourself instead?

210
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,950
That's as far as you go!

211
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:10,793
Who's there?!

212
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,200
Sailor Moon!

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,068
Committing evil deeds
in a sacred place...

214
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,263
You're not getting away
with this anymore!

215
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:22,300
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

216
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,411
So, you've shown up.

217
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,881
But you're too late.
The rainbow crystal is mine!

218
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,143
Zoi!

219
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:39,880
Shoot!

220
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,336
That's...

221
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:53,533
I see it! Come forth, rainbow crystal!

222
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,373
Father!

223
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:03,449
A rainbow crystal...

224
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,713
Father!

225
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:08,010
Where is the rainbow crystal?

226
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,227
Father...

227
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:17,685
Wrong! I am not a priest!

228
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:24,398
That's right. I am the monster Boxsy!

229
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,431
You can't be...

230
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,940
I can hear the crowd cheering me on.

231
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,642
I am a champion! Wow!

232
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:44,122
Boxsy, knock out Sailor Moon!

233
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:47,526
Hey, wait! I'm not a boxer!

234
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:50,796
All right! We'll have a fight to see
who's the real champ!

235
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,959
I told you I'm not!

236
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,904
This can't be real!

237
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:02,704
I am a champion! Lovely punch!

238
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,010
Sailor Moon!

239
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,915
Mako, hurry up!

240
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,110
I am the king of kings!

241
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:18,151
Stop! Please, Father, go back
to being a normal priest!

242
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:21,584
Stop your babbling!

243
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:23,122
Naru!

244
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:27,426
Naru!

245
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:32,631
Umino...

246
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:36,542
I am a champion! Lovely punch!

247
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,010
Watch out, Sailor Moon!

248
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,281
Tuxedo Mask!

249
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,893
A true boxer would never hit
a beautiful young girl.

250
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:59,490
Instead, he would embrace her gently.

251
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,268
Boxsy! Knock out that snooty guy, too!

252
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,797
All right! Come, come!
A lovely punch!

253
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,586
I am a champion! Triple punch!

254
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:22,110
This is nothing!

255
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,646
This is...

256
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,352
Mako! Over here!

257
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,364
Okay!

258
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:34,458
Jupiter Power Makeup!

259
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,043
Sailor Jupiter!

260
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,585
I see, so you're my next opponent!

261
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:02,328
My guardian, Jupiter!

262
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:06,788
Brew a storm! Call the clouds!
Bring down the lightning!

263
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:14,661
Supreme Thunder!

264
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,219
Now! Sailor Moon!

265
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:28,277
Okay!

266
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:37,185
Moon Healing Escalation!

267
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,296
Refresh!

268
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:51,132
Do you believe in God?

269
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:56,604
I do. Love thy neighbors.

270
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,589
That is...

271
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,422
This rainbow crystal is mine!
Good-bye!

272
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:10,256
One day, I will take it back from you!

273
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,099
Sailor Moon! We have to get
that rainbow crystal back!

274
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,334
Tuxedo Mask...

275
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:40,818
I see. Now, I know my true identity.

276
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,194
I am Tuxedo Mask.

277
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:51,904
There!

278
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:53,339
Thank you so much.

279
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,007
Naru, that's...

280
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:59,612
It's okay, because Umino got hurt
trying to save me.

281
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:01,780
Oh, well...

282
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,681
Usagi, sorry for worrying you.

283
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,476
I'll go back to school starting
tomorrow.

284
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,614
Naru...

285
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,043
I'm sorry, Mako. I asked you to
come all the way out here

286
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,705
because I wanted to show you
Usagi's good side, but...

287
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:38,046
But at least I've found out she's
very caring about her friend.

288
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:40,313
Mako!

289
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:47,314
That sounds pretty.
Where did you get it?

290
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,061
Oh...

291
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:53,030
...just something I picked up.

292
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:13,386
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

293
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:19,985
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

294

Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

295

Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

Anata dake ki ni naru

297

Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne
