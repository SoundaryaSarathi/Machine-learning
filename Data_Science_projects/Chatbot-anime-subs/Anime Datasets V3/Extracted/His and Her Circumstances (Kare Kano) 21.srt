1
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:04,550
My fingertips tingle softly.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,089
It spreads throughout my
entire body like blood,

4
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:16,692
and bliss fills everything.

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:23,393
I know when he approaches without having to look.

7
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:25,001
Wherever he is,

8
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,697
I can always feel his presence.

9
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,573
Is the one with this special power...

10
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:32,770
...he who has me under his spell?

11
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:38,445
Or is it me, who loves him so?

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,685
Miyazawa.

13
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:52,095
Um, you're... Tonami-kun!

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,198
You sure are early.

15
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,059
You have practice or something?

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,061
No, I wasn't getting into my
morning studying,

17
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:00,803
so I thought I'd do it at school.

18
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:03,302
My, how ambitious...

19
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,906
Oh, yeah, I have a favor to ask.

20
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:07,307
What?

21
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:08,404
Miyazawa.

22
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,674
Are you friends with Sakura's gang in 1-D?

23
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,016
Yeah, I am.

24
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,353
If they ever ask you if I'm the same
Tonami who was in their middle school,

26
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,749
I want you to say you don't know.

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:19,816
Why?

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,958
Well you know, this and that.

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,164
How INTERESTING! What's going on?
Tell me! Tell me why!
(Text:Tell me! Tell me! Arrrrrrg)

32
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,299
Get away from me!

33
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,068
Women are always so nosy!

34
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,305
They want to know everything

35
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:36,266
Tell me! Tell me!

36
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,976
Let go! Let go of me now!

37
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,510
Oh, and one more thing.

38
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:44,440
Huh?

39
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,649
A weirdo like you doesn't suit Arima at all!

41
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:52,385
What?! Is that how you talk to
someone of whom you've asked a favor?!

42
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,286
I don't want to hear that from you!
You're the worst!

44
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:56,629
You don't suit Arima either!

45
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,182
Say, do you know where Miyazawa-san
and Isawa-san are?

46
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,721
Gee, they were just here a moment ago.

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,190
Oh, okay. Thanks.

48
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,628
They got away.

49
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:41,300
Sheesh, if she keeps coming by everyday
like this we can't sit peacefully in class.

51
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,142
Why me?

52
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:46,207
I wish she'd give up already.

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,013
What?! Is she here?!

54
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:50,840
Is she coming?!

55
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:53,250
Hey, wait! wait! wait!!

56
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:54,244
Aaaaah

57
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:55,248
Run for it!

58
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,257
Two unfinished drinks...

59
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,423
According to tips from outside sources,

60
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:05,692
there's no doubt they were here just now.

61
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:11,731
Considering their past trend in escape routes,

63
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:14,672
the place where they would
likely go to next is...

64
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:23,615
If we just stay here for a while...

65
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,850
Fancy meeting you in a place like this.

66
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,123
I won't do it.

67
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:32,989
A play is just unreasonable.

68
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,220
Come on, I'm not here for that today.

69
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:39,229
I just wanted to chat with you two.

70
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:40,658
Really?

71
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,125
Really

72
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,332
See, I don't have the screenplay
on me, do I?

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,679
I said no!

74
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,123
Wait! Wait up, Yukinon!

75
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:13,758
That's odd, where'd they go?

76
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,436
Hey, have you see Miyazawa-san?

77
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,275
Th-they went that way.

78
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:28,778
Thanks.

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,217
Yeah right!

80
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:32,814
I didn't think so.

81
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,116
Did you really think it would work?

82
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:42,424
Stop! Stop, I say!
You could at least listen!

83
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:45,020
In here!

84
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:45,989
No way?!

85
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,368
I wonder if we lost her.

86
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,828
She's really persistent today.

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,640
How can we get her to give up?

88
00:04:56,609 --> 00:05:00,000
I know, I could say I'll be busy on the Culture
Fair committee and I won't have the time.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,043
Not fair! Trying to save yourself?!
What about friendship?  Friendship?!

91
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,113
Forgive me...

92
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,281
Arima-kun's on the kendo team too.

93
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,513
Found you.

94
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,126
You found us.

95
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,000
The play.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,703
I finally cornered you today.
You keep sneaking around...

97
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,898
You're going to hear me out today.

98
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,438
We don't have to hear you out, we're not doing it.

99
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,874
You could at least listen!

100
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,346
You're lying!

101
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:39,278
Those eyes tell us you're trying
to snare us in by hook or by crook!

103
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,519
Acting in front of people isn't our style!

105
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:45,989
Style? Well that's strange, Yukinon.

106
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,991
Although you've come out of the closet,
are you saying that you,

107
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,858
the masked girl who acted as the beautiful
model student all these years,

109
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,923
can't act in front of people?

110
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:59,470
You must know the ecstacy you
feel of having others under your spell

111
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,831
the moment you become someone not yourself.

112
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,038
Have you really forgotten?

113
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:09,075
Can you forget those days full of
praise, in these mundane times?

114
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,543
You cannot go on living without acting!!

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,548
Shut up!

116
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,613
I'm not going to be tricked
by the magic of words!

117
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,423
No, no, no, I said no!

118
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,422
Tsubasa-chan,
you're not going to act either, right?

119
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:24,820
I don't mind.

120
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,293
What?!

121
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,061
She's been bought off...

122
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,465
It's not like she's in kindergarten any more...

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And so...

125
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,342
C'mon! Let's do it!

126
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:40,610
Share the sweet dream with me!

127
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:41,910
No!

128
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,748
If you want to do it so much, do it yourself!

129
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,744
But I don't fit the image for the story!

131
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,053
No, no, I won't do it!

132
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:58,327
So it's no use.

133
00:06:58,765 --> 00:06:59,595
No use, No use.

134
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,734
I knew that it was sudden too.

136
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,298
I'd really wanted to
see it live, with visuals.

137
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:07,930
Whew.

138
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,035
She finally gave up.

139
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,601
I wanted to see it too.

140
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:13,635
Everyone would have been perfect for it.

141
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:16,281
I wanted to make the costumes for
the professor and the android.

142
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:17,741
Professor?
Android?

143
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:22,553
I don't want to waste it, so I'll convert it
into a novel and have my editor take a look at it.

145
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,147
Want to read it anyway?

146
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,093
If we don't have to do it,
I'd really like to see it.

147
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,763
I was wondering what kind
of stories you write.

148
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,225
Being a student author is so cool!

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,826
Show me the books you've been
published in some time.

150
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,134
Sci-Fi?

151
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:42,302
Maybe.

152
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,767
It's Earth in the far future.

153
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:48,011
Androids have gone into mass
production and are living among us.

155
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,683
They do everything from making our food and doing
our work, and care for our lives in general.

157
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,678
But it's not at all strange.

158
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:59,455
The androids are what evolved out of our
current computers and security systems.

160
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,554
One of the characters is the Professor.

161
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:06,958
He's a genius scientist who created the
core of all the androids made on Earth.

163
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,660
And then there's Antique, an old
model robot he first created.

164
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:16,172
And finally there's Neomodel, the newest
android built upon series of advances.

167
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:20,645
The story begins when Neomodel
visits the Professor's house.

168
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:24,148
The Professor had left the forefront of
the field, and has been living for a long time

169
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:27,453
on a distant planet with Antique, without seeing anyone.

171
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:29,116
Why?

172
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:30,920
You get to read it and find out.

173
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,985
Wow, that's amazing.

174
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,259
How do you come up with this stuff?

175
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,826
I think I do well in school,

176
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,925
but I could never think up anything like that.

177
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:44,266
It's precisely because I don't
do as well in school as you.

179
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:49,102
People who can't get a living on grades
have to polish their redeeming features.

181
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,005
She says that,

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,344
but it's still amazing.

183
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,116
Neomodel is so cool.

184
00:08:58,751 --> 00:08:59,843
You're perfect for it.

185
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,878
Tsubasa-chan fits really well
as Antique too.

186
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:13,359
What do you want?

187
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,834
The gym's being used by the
sports teams now.

188
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:17,936
The other students are supposed
to keep out.

189
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,335
I joined the basketball team.

190
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,534
So I think we'll be seeing a
lot of each other from now on.

192
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,479
Nice to meetcha.

193
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,850
Whoa, Tsubaki!
Who was that guy?

195
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:36,917
He's so cool!

196
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:40,590
He's this dude named Tonami
who just transfered into 1-B.

198
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,897
But he sure seemed to know you well
for someone who just transferred.

200
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:45,855
Do you know him?

201
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:53,072
Hell no.
Never seen him before.

203
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,686
I'll buy it with my credit card!

204
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,888
Ha, Ha.
This is my dog, Christine!

206
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,552
Stop it! Stop it, Sakura!

207
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,864
Hey hey hey! Whatcha staring at?!

208
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,032
Don't tell me you're interested in me?!

209
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,980
What are they doing over there?

210
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:45,150
We can't practice like this, so stop it.

211
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,482
Yo, quit walking next to me.

212
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:17,011
You're hogging the damn hallway.

213
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,618
Why should I step aside for you?!

214
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,783
I'm going this way too.

215
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,627
Out of my way!

216
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,654
You get out of my way!

217
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,496
I want to walk with a cuter girl.

218
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,406
I want to walk with a girl too.

219
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,438
Why do I get stuck with this stinking...

221
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,654
H-hey, Tonami.

222
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:31,525
What.

223
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:33,759
Were you...

224
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,937
Were you...

225
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:45,373
What?

226
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,373
No way.

227
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,917
Never mind.

228
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,228
That's right. Notice me, notice me.

229
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:06,425
When you can't ignore me any more as someone who...

231
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:11,133
...you have no chance against is when I'll betray you.

233
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,376
Hey! Tonami-kun!

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,551
So, why do I have to hide the fact
that you went to the same junior high
as Tsubaki's gang? I really wanna know.

236
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:31,982
What's this?

237
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:33,956
He told me so this morning.

238
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:35,852
Well, I have my reasons.

239
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:40,763
Arima, could you not tell Sakura's
gang that I'm the same Tonami either?

241
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:41,890
Why?

242
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:45,597
Who do you think this is?

243
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,369
Which rich brat is this?

244
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,634
Hmm... Looks kind of familar?

245
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:51,643
It's me.

246
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,670
WHAT!?!

247
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:54,941
I knew that.

248
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,605
But, but...

249
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,845
Does he always carry these
pictures around?

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:14:03,550
I used to be slow, the stereotypical
kid who got picked on.

252
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:08,660
I especially took humiliating treatment
from Sakura as her personal servant.

254
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,686
She made me her go-fer,
bagboy, desk wiper, driver,

256
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:18,966
homework-boy, lunch-boy
(made me trade lunches with her).

259
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:26,234
she took my CDs, made me tape TV
shows for her, and measured my body fat!

262
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,114
How terrible...
I can just see her doing that.

263
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,709
Right? She's a demon!

264
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:38,448
When I transferred, I decided that I was
going to be a changed man when I came back.

266
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,000
That I would be a totally different person.

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,022
And that I was going to get
my revenge on Sakura!

268
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,597
Ooh, Edmond! Edmond Dantes!
(The Count of Monte Cristo)

270
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,863
I don't know about revenge
and calm down, Miyazawa.

272
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,700
My days of training were so harsh.

273
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:00,079
Early morning jogs, weights, swimming,

274
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,548
watching my diet, improving my grades,

275
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,344
revolutionizing my looks!

276
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:09,448
I sweated blood in order
to abandon the old me!

278
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,555
He sure reminds me of somebody...

279
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,427
How wonderful...

280
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,259
I feel like I know you.

281
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:24,728
So you are a person who polished
second class material into first
class through effort as well.

283
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,796
You too?
(Text:Friendship)

284
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:32,401
Ok. In deference to your hard work,

285
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,076
I'll pretend I don't know.

286
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:38,449
All right!
Just you wait, Sakura!

287
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,116
And I want to see their battle too.

288
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:44,120
I run 5 kilometers every morning.

289
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,788
Although I could easily pull 10 km.
I ran all the way to the next town.

290
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,508
Tonami-kun's a pretty interesting person.

291
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,611
This is the first time I've ever
met someone like me.

292
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,481
Although in my case, the motive was vanity.

293
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:13,746
I see.

294
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,318
Did you not like it that I was
friendly with someone else?

295
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,428
Did I leave you out?

296
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,429
Not really.

297
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:35,801
I know! Come this way.

298
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:37,604
Why?

299
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:38,813
Just come with me.

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,813
Sit, sit.

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay!

302
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,409
What're you going to-

303
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:52,515
What, what?!

304
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,957
Just sit still.

305
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,432
There there. I'm sorry.

306
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,001
I love you more than anyone.

307
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:12,841
You're a genius.

308
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,480
I'm the one who couldn't go anywhere without you.

310
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:23,488
Um, by the way, I'm okay now, you can...

311
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,848
Just a little more.

312
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,425
It feels so good holding your head.

314
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,327
Aw, I said that's enough!

315
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm the one who can't let go.

316
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,960
Sometimes I can't even tell myself.

317
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,296
Could it be that I'm an android too?

318
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,736
Maybe someone made me into a
machine after that accident,

320
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,301
and I'm the only one...

321
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,940
...who thinks I'm still human.

322
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:23,776
Thinking that, I slit my
wrists countless times.

323
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,347
I doubt even the androids,
which cannot be disloyal.

324
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:32,957
Suspicion, dissatisfaction, envy,
self-preservation,

325
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:37,825
discrimination, superiority,
self-consciousness, arrogance...

326
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,229
What I realized after I created the androids

327
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,396
is the figure of the creator
inferior to the androids.

329
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,007
I love you all with all my heart.

330
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,570
But I can't help hating you.

331
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:19,666
I dreamed about it.
Pure hearts and polluted hearts.

332
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,100
The mediocre life before becoming a genius,

334
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,602
and the life after becoming a genius.

335
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,809
Grittiness and equanimity.

336
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:31,244
The Professor's suffering, torn between
things that always oppose each other?

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,056
Damn, it makes me think it
would be fun to act it out...

341
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,990
Sis finally resigns herself and decides
to take part in Aya-chan's play.

342
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,890
But unrelated to that,

343
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,315
Tonami Takefumi's revenge was
progressing slowly but surely.

345
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:01,892
And the friendship between
him and Sis deepens.

346
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,500
And then Arima-?!
