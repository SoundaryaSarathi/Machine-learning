1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:05,019
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,889
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,997
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:10,288
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:15,482
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:19,558
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:23,865
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,020
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,179
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,018
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,220
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,950
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:42,568
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,267
Those clouds look so soft, don't they?

15
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:14,774
Like you could just jump down
and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap.

16
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,449
Maybe you should give it a try.

17
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,911
You're hilarious.

18
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,868
I'll try it!

19
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:24,947
Yehhhh!

20
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:33,536
Turns out clouds are made of water!

21
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:40,726
Hey, what is that?

22
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:46,494
It's like a scar.

23
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:54,473
Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.

24
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,302
Aang, are you okay?

25
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,361
Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for...

26
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,496
Shh!

27
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:06,801
What? I'm not allowed to be angry?

28
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:13,545
Why would anyone do this?
How could I let this happen?

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,734
Aang, you didn't let this happen.
It has nothing to do with you.

30
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:23,674
Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature.
But, I don't know how to do my job.

31
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,347
That's why we're going
to the North Pole to find you a teacher.

32
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,471
Yeh, a waterbending teacher,...

33
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,296
...but there's no one
who can teach me how to be the Avatar.

34
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:35,248
Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.

35
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,101
The Avatar before you?

36
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,774
He died over a hundred years ago,
how are you supposed to talk to him?

37
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,768
I don't know.

38
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,840
Uncle! It's time to leave!
Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

39
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,343
Over here.

40
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,548
Uncle?

41
00:02:54,662 --> 00:03:00,328
We need to move on, we're closing in
on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!

42
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,842
You look tired, Prince Zuko.

43
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:08,990
Why don't you join me in these hot springs
and soak away your troubles.

44
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,808
My troubles cannot be soaked away.
It's time to go!

45
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:17,663
You should take your teacher's advice
and relax a little.

46
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:26,127
The temperature's just right.
I heated it myself.

47
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:29,704
Enough! We need to leave now!
Get out of the water!

48
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,116
Very well.

49
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,222
On second thought,
why don't you take another few minutes,...

50
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,832
...but be back at the ship in half an hour
or I'm leaving without you.

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,227
Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?

52
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:46,076
No.

53
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,980
Hey, how was that cheering me up?

54
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:51,972
Cheered me up.

55
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:56,148
Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that.

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,424
These acorns are everywhere, Aang.
That means the forest will grow back.

57
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:04,017
Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday,...

58
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:09,224
...and all the birds and animals
that lived here will come back.

59
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:12,886
Thanks, Katara.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,350
Hey, who are you?

61
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:20,626
When I saw the flying bison,
I thought it was impossible,...

62
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:27,466
...but those markings... are you the Avatar child?

63
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:32,440
My village desperately needs your help.

64
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:48,411
This young person is the Avatar.

65
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:51,637
So the rumors of your return are true.

66
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:55,444
It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.

67
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,046
Nice to meet you too.

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,861
So... is there something I can help you with?

69
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,936
I'm not sure...

70
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:08,217
Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope.

71
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:14,542
For the last few days at sunset a spirit monster
comes and attacks our village.

72
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:18,758
He is Hei-Bai, the black and white spirit.

73
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,536
Why is it attacking you?

74
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:25,869
We do not know, but each of the last three nights
he has abducted one of our own.

75
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:29,703
We are especially fearful
because the winter solstice draws near.

76
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,183
What happens then?

77
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:35,764
As the solstice approaches,
the natural world and the spirit world...

78
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:42,105
...grow closer and closer
until the line between them is blurred completely.

79
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,567
Hei-Bai is already causing devastation and destruction.

80
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:49,842
Once the solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.

81
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,737
So, what do you want me to do exactly?

82
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:57,313
Who better to resolve a crisis
between our world and the spirit world...

83
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:03,933
...than the Avatar himself?
You are the great bridge between man and spirits.

84
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,299
Right... that's me.

85
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:11,658
Hey, great bridge guy',
can I talk to you over here for a second?

86
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,740
Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.

87
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,098
Yeh, that might be because
I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.

88
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,912
It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!

89
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:25,204
So, can you help these people?

90
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,548
I have to try, don't I?
Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.

91
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,534
I think you can do it, Aang.

92
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:41,341
Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.

93
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:51,758
Who's there?

94
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:59,905
A meadow vole! I should have known.
You startled me, little one.

95
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:05,357
Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline,...

96
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:11,121
...but it was a very sweet nap.

97
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,019
He's a Fire Nation soldier.

98
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:27,761
He's no ordinary soldier.
This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West,...

99
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:35,562
...the once great General Iroh,
but now, he's our prisoner.

100
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:50,557
Hello? Spirit, can you hear me?
This is the Avatar speaking.

101
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,455
I'm... here to try to help stuff.

102
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:54,637
This isn't right.

103
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:58,420
We can't sit here and cower
while Aang waits for some monster to show up.

104
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,960
If anyone can save us, he can.

105
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:05,515
He still shouldn't have to face this alone.

106
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:13,879
The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai?

107
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:22,263
Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you
to please leave this village in peace!

108
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:29,270
Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.

109
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,030
You must be the Hei-Bai spirit. My name is...

110
00:08:56,114 --> 00:09:02,834
My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar
and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!

111
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,964
The Avatar's methods are... unusual.

112
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,717
It doesn't seem too interested in
what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?

113
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:26,297
No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.

114
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,063
Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.

115
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,855
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?

116
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,558
I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge.

117
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:46,779
Excuse me, would you please turn around?
I command you to turn around now!

118
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,784
That's it! He needs help!

119
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,875
Sokka wait!

120
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,089
It's not safe!

121
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,222
Hei-Bai! Over here!

122
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,580
Sokka, go back!

123
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,415
We'll fight him together, Aang.

124
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:09,599
I don't wanna fight him unless I... huh!

125
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,296
Sokka!

126
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,652
Uncle! Uncle, where are you?

127
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:26,922
Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?

128
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:31,196
Something's not right here. That pile of rocks...

129
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:33,660
It looks like there's been a landslide, Sir.

130
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:38,706
Land doesn't slide uphill.
Those rocks didn't move naturally.

131
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:42,682
My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!

132
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:55,116
Aang, over here!

133
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:02,605
Help!

134
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,302
Hang on, Sokka!

135
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,853
Sokka!

136
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:28,585
I failed.

137
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,669
Where are you taking me?

138
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,797
We're taking you to face justice.

139
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:49,312
Right. But where, specifically?

140
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:52,006
A place you're quite familiar with, actually.

141
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:58,071
You once laid siege to it for 600 days,
but it would not yield to you.

142
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:02,330
Ah! The great city of Ba Sing Se.

143
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:05,098
It was greater than you were, apparently.

144
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,855
I acknowledged my defeat at Ba Sing Se!

145
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:18,122
After 600 days away from home,
my men were tired and I was tired,...

146
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,521
...and I'm still tired.

147
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,587
I'm sure they'll be back.

148
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,988
I know.

149
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,502
You should get some rest.

150
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:52,687
Everything's gonna be okay.

151
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:59,568
Your brother is in good hands.
I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him.

152
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:04,292
Katara, Katara I lost him.

153
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:10,317
The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.

154
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:14,206
What? No, I'm right here!

155
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,571
I'm in the spirit world!

156
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:36,379
Yup, that's Uncle Iroh.

157
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,109
I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise.

158
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:44,245
Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right?

159
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:51,668
All I have to do is... figure out
what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!

160
00:13:51,778 --> 00:14:00,214
Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here.
But, I guess you can't see me either.

161
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:03,998
It's ok, Appa. Dont' worry.
I'm sure they're on their way back.

162
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:09,384
I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.

163
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,451
What am I supposed to do?

164
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:16,990
Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

165
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,715
Sokka?

166
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:28,492
That's definitely not Sokka!

167
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:42,021
What? I can't airbend in the spirit world!

168
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,956
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

169
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:12,235
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide!
Like Appa is to me.

170
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,586
I need to save my friend and I don't know how.

171
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,110
Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?

172
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:28,308
I'll be back Katara. Take me to Roku!

173
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,046
What's the problem?

174
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:50,449
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

175
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:56,279
My old joints are feeling sore
and achy and these shackles are too loose.

176
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:57,624
Too loose?

177
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:02,917
That's right. The cuffs are loose
and they jangle around and bump my wrists.

178
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,110
It would help me if you would tighten them
so they wouldn't shake around so much.

179
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:13,736
Very well. Corporal,
tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.

180
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,303
Hey, what are you doing!?

181
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,943
I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.

182
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:10,060
Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about?
A comet? When can I talk to him?

183
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:39,977
It's a calendar,
and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!

184
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:43,904
So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?

185
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:49,428
But I can't wait that long.
I need to save Sokka now.

186
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:05,913
He is too dangerous, Captain.
We can't just carry him to the capital.

187
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,604
We have to do something now.

188
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:14,039
I agree. He must be dealt
with immediately and severely.

189
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,908
It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere.

190
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:24,002
Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.

191
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:32,021
The Avatar!

192
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,180
You're back!

193
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,829
Where's Sokka?

194
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:23,312
I'm not sure.

195
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:31,195
These dangerous hands must be crushed.

196
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:43,018
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

197
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:44,314
You taught me well.

198
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:49,474
Surrender yourselves, it's five against two.
You're clearly outnumbered.

199
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:56,330
Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!

200
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:35,510
Now would you please put on some clothes!

201
00:20:56,276 --> 00:21:00,501
Aang, what are you doing? Run!

202
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:20,527
You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand.

203
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:24,324
You're upset and angry
because your home was burned down.

204
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,525
When I saw the forest
had burned I was sad and upset.

205
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:32,924
But my friend gave me hope
that the forest would grow back.

206
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:53,080
Sokka!

207
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:54,602
What happened?

208
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:59,072
You were trapped in the Spirit world
for 24 hours. How are you feeling?

209
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:03,123
Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!

210
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:08,600
Thank you, Avatar.
If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.

211
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,452
You could give us some supplies and some money.

212
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,500
Sokka!

213
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,822
What? We need stuff.

214
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,832
It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.

215
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:23,033
I'm so proud of you, Aang.
You figured out what to do all on your own.

216
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:29,598
Actually, I did have a little help.
And there's something else.

217
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:31,760
What is it?

218
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:36,029
I need to talk to Roku and I think
I've found a way to contact his spirit.

219
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,211
That's great!

220
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,813
Creepy, but great.

221
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:41,316
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island,...

222
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,963
...and if I go there on the solstice
I'll be able to speak with him.

223
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,023
But, the solstice is tomorrow.

224
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:54,542
Yeh, and there's one more problem.
The island is in the Fire Nation.
