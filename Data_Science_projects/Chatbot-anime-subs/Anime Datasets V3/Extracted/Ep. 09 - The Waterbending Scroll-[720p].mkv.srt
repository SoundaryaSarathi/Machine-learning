1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:04,823
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:06,699
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,811
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:10,103
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:15,306
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:19,390
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,707
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,869
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:31,035
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:32,878
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,083
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:38,821
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:42,447
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:08,696
Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?

15
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,475
It's what Avatar Roku said.

16
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,848
I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.

17
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:14,769
Well, let's see,...

18
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,640
...you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years...

19
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,830
...I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.

20
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:25,895
I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole!

21
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,553
What am I gonna do!?

22
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:30,289
Calm down. It's going to be okay.

23
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,556
If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.

24
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,389
You'd do that?

25
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:38,566
We'll need to find a good source of water first.

26
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:43,623
Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,420
Nice puddle.

28
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,823
Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!

29
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,588
Remember the reason we're here.

30
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,613
Oh right, time to practice waterbending.

31
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:04,869
Great. So what am I supposed to do?

32
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,024
You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?

33
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:11,238
So, while you guys are playing in the water,...

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,936
...I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?

35
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,639
Mud and bugs!

36
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,683
Okay.

37
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:34,655
Someone's changing our course!

38
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:38,043
What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,288
Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.

40
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,214
Is it something to do with the Avatar?

41
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:53,696
Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.

42
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:54,953
Lotus tile?

43
00:02:55,048 --> 00:03:00,232
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant,...

44
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:05,645
...but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.

45
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,705
You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?

46
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:12,872
See, you, like most people, underestimate its value.

47
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:16,558
Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.

48
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:25,176
Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!

49
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:28,916
I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.

50
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:36,321
Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.

51
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:40,197
This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect,...

52
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,084
...so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away.

53
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,948
Just push and pull the water like this...

54
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:50,349
The key is getting the wrist movement right.

55
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:53,580
Like this?

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,167
That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually...

57
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,967
Hey, I'm bending it already!

58
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,953
Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.

59
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,213
It took me two months to learn that move.

60
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:10,066
Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.

61
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:11,312
Thanks.

62
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:12,607
So, what's next?

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,246
This is a more difficult move. I call it "streaming the water."

64
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:25,503
It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...

65
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:36,774
Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.

66
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,810
Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!

67
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:44,060
Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:52,795
I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...

69
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:59,005
So, like this?

70
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,312
Aang!

71
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,944
Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?

72
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:16,015
That's enough practicing for today.

73
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:19,975
Yeh, I'll say! You just practiced our supplies down the river!

74
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:24,885
Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.

75
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:30,628
Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender.

76
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:52,922
We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.

77
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,312
Let's spend it wisely.

78
00:05:54,408 --> 00:06:01,001
Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!

79
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,747
It doesn't even work.

80
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:09,555
See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.

81
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:15,566
No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.

82
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,493
Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation!

83
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:25,849
So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here!

84
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,095
Don't be shy, come one by!

85
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:34,710
Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you're world traveling types.

86
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,517
Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?

87
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:42,860
Sure! What are curios?

88
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:47,889
I'm not entirely sure, but we got 'em!

89
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,600
I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.

90
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:14,320
That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be, interested in bartering.

91
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:16,929
Momo's not for sale.

92
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:31,149
Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!

93
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:34,227
Where did you get a waterbending scroll?

94
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:42,521
Let's just say I got it up north at a most reasonable price. Free!

95
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:49,038
Waaait a minute "sea-loving traders" with suspiciously acquired merchandise...

96
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:53,756
...and pet reptile birds... You guys are pirates!

97
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:58,628
We prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.

98
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,646
So, how much for the, uh, "traded" scroll?

99
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:05,285
I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.

100
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:10,813
Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?

101
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:16,549
I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.

102
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:24,547
Watch and learn. What say to the price of... one copper piece!

103
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:31,255
The price is 200 gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.

104
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,177
Okay... two copper pieces!

105
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,015
It's not as amusing the second time, boy.

106
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,821
Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.

107
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:44,151
Aye, we be castin' off now!

108
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,941
What was that all about, Katara.

109
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,300
Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.

110
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,113
I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.

111
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,691
Hey you, get back here!

112
00:08:54,781 --> 00:09:02,967
Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.

113
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,395
There they are!

114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,433
Get 'em!

115
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:16,355
Nobody's goin' nowhere!

116
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,813
I... I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!

117
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,520
Get back here!

118
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:29,129
This way! Let's cut 'em off!

119
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:54,517
My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!

120
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:08,318
I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!

121
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,732
Now, who gets to take the steel of my blade first?

122
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,513
No thanks!

123
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:19,927
Hold on tight!

124
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:23,663
Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!

125
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,292
Just hang on!

126
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,172
I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.

127
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,670
I know, that's why I took... this!

128
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,724
No way.

129
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,091
Isn't it great?

130
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:46,192
No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll.

131
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,807
I prefer to think of it as "high-risk trading."

132
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,130
Good one, Katara.

133
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:56,971
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.

134
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,175
It doesn't matter.

135
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:02,870
You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!

136
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,656
These are real waterbending forms.

137
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:10,368
You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.

138
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:11,568
Whatever.

139
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,076
Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.

140
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:31,042
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.

141
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,630
It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!

142
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,466
Quite the contrary.

143
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:41,707
I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for,...

144
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:48,021
...is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!

145
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,938
You bought a sumki horn?

146
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:56,019
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

147
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:59,358
This place looks promising!

148
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:04,605
Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?

149
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:08,768
We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.

150
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,446
This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?

151
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:16,264
I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.

152
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:20,000
Here, hold on and open for me.

153
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:26,391
"The single water whip"... looks doable.

154
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,252
What's so funny?

155
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,149
I'm sorry, but you deserve that.

156
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:38,190
You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.

157
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,406
Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!

158
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,426
Why can't I get this stupid move!

159
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,729
You'll get it.

160
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:55,117
You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...

161
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,231
There. See, the key to bending is...

162
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,459
Will you please shut your air hole!

163
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:03,054
Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes.

164
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:09,021
Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!

165
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:10,604
What?

166
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:19,108
Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.

167
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,927
But, you know what, it won't happen again. Here, this is yours.

168
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,397
I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.

169
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,794
It's okay, Katara.

170
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,534
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.

171
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:31,969
I'm sorry Momo.

172
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,081
And... what about me? There was that time you...

173
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,883
No more apologies!

174
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,152
Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

175
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:53,500
We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?

176
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:57,497
Then they'll be on the water.

177
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:21,188
Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.

178
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:40,015
Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!

179
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:49,028
Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances... ugh!

180
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,382
No, let go of me!

181
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:01,711
I'll save you from the pirates.

182
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,868
Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.

183
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,909
Go jump in the river!

184
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,318
Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost.

185
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:24,903
My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.

186
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:28,689
My mother's necklace! How did you get that?

187
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,416
I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is.

188
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:34,404
No!

189
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:39,422
Enough of this necklace garbage. You promised the scroll!

190
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,956
I wonder how much money this is worth?

191
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,250
A lot, apparently.

192
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:50,610
Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy.

193
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,883
Search the woods for the boy and meet back here.

194
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:55,242
Fine.

195
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:03,761
Huh? Where did she go? I don't believe it.

196
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:04,761
What's wrong?

197
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,558
She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing.

198
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:12,805
It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep...

199
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,715
I got him, come on!

200
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:31,087
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap?

201
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,906
Nice work.

202
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,079
Aang, this is all my fault.

203
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,614
No, Katara it isn't.

204
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,314
Yeh, it kind of is.

205
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,932
Give me the boy.

206
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,475
You give us the scroll.

207
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,545
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!?

208
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:58,875
Don't listen to him! He's trying to turn us against each other.

209
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,505
Your friend is the Avatar?

210
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:06,273
Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll.

211
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:09,029
Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!

212
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,453
Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth...

213
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:15,078
I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense.

214
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:18,097
Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.

215
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,615
You guys would be set for life!

216
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,790
Keep the scroll! We can buy a hundred with the reward we will get for the kid.

217
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:30,817
You'll regret breaking a deal with me!

218
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:55,227
Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.

219
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,930
Aang, are you there?

220
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,184
I'm over here, follow my voice!

221
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,059
Where? I can't find you!

222
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm right here!

223
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:51,151
Uhh, never mind! I'll find you!

224
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,746
Run!

225
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:56,141
Katara! You're okay!

226
00:18:56,232 --> 00:19:01,247
Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!

227
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,663
We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.

228
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,664
A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders?

229
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,660
Everybody in!

230
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,224
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?

231
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,537
We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!

232
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,416
It's no proverb.

233
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,860
Bleeding hog-monkeys!

234
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:45,208
Hey! That's my boat!

235
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:47,416
Maybe it should be a proverb.

236
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,980
Come on, Uncle!

237
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,492
Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster?

238
00:19:54,582 --> 00:20:00,055
I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe.

239
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:17,129
Hey, you did the water whip!

240
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,005
I couldn't have done it without your help!

241
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:24,626
Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!

242
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:41,648
That's good!

243
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,286
Aang, look!

244
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,233
Oh, no!

245
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:10,111
Have you lost your mind!? This is no time for flute practice!

246
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,249
We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!

247
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:25,373
It's working! It's slowing down!

248
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,378
We're doing it!

249
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:36,022
But we have another problem!

250
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,050
I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.

251
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,302
Yeh, we owe ya one.

252
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,559
My boat!

253
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:16,171
Hehe, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.

254
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:22,364
The lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!

255
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:32,559
Aang, I still owe you an apology.

256
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,866
You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.

257
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:40,664
I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.

258
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,308
That's okay, Katara.

259
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,444
Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.

260
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,845
Is that really how you feel?

261
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,896
The scroll!

262
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:50,911
First, what did you learn?

263
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,026
Stealing is wrong.

264
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:57,251
Unless it's from pirates!

265
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:59,368
Good one, Katara.
