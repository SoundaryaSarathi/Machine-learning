[Ash] Oh, man, I'd love to cross the ocean
on a ship like this.

00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,531
Yeah, just think of all the Pokémon
we'd be able to see along the way.

Oh, for sure.

29
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,370
Just imagine, sunbathing on deck all day.

Just a nice, long, relaxing cruise.

-Oh.

-Cool, huh?
-[Misty] What?

39
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,362
These are tickets for the biggest party
ever, on board the St. Anne cruise liner.

40
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,322
The famous St. Anne?

41
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,283
-Cool.
-The coolest ship on the sea.

Everyone's going to be together

It'll be a radical party. All the most
radical Pokémon trainers will be there.

00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,593
Do you know anybody
who says "radical" anymore?

49
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,594
Uh-uh.

50
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,097
Okay, dudes, here are your tickets.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,432
We'd love to go
on the Pokémon trainer cruise,

52
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,434
but we really don't have the money
to pay for it.

53
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,478
Oh, whoa, like, you don't understand.

54
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,730
-Cool.
-They're totally free.

55
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,565
-Huh?
-Totally free.

56
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,526
Totally free.

57
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,986
For free? Why are you giving them away?

58
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,447
Well, like, we have to go out
with our boyfriends,

59
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,950
but we wanted to give our tickets
to cool Pokémon fans.

60
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,909
Cool.

61
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,537
We saw you and thought
you looked really cool.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,455
Just take these
and have a really cool time.

63
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,457
-Thanks a lot.
-No sweat.

64
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,419
-Cool.
-Have a nice day, for sure.

69
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,474
[Ash] Yeah and that Pokémon party.

70
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,644
I wonder which one of these ships
is the St. Anne.

71
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,229
-I think that's it.
-Huh?

72
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,648
[Brock] Wow. That's incredible.

73
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,483
[Misty] It's huge.

74
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,402
[Pikachu] Pika.

75
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,070

00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,551
[Meowth]
We got a call from the boss.

80
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,180
Greetings, sir.

81
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>So the team is all there.</i>

82
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,600

Meow! What's with the Persian?

85
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:38,236
Hey, boss, what about Meowth?
Ain't I your favorite anymore?

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,534
I'm totally disgusted watching you fail me
when I expect total perfection.

87
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:49,206
-Purr-fection like this beautiful Persian.
-[meows]

88
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,166
But... Meowth.

89
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
If you want to make me happy,

90
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,379
you can make sure
our latest plan succeeds.

91
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,380
Meow!

92
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,842
Have you handed out all of the tickets
to the St. Anne cruise?

93
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,010
[Jessie] Yes.

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:06,348
All of the Pokémon trainers
were delighted to take them.

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,310
Was it really all right for us
to give out all those tickets for free?

96
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,271
A small price to pay
for what I'll get in return.

97
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,481
[both] Oh.

98
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,442
My men have already secretly boarded
the St. Anne.

99
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,403
When I give them the signal,
they will take the Pokémon

100
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,490
from all of the trainers we tricked
into boarding the ship.

101
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,201
That's the boss for you, a real genius.

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,162
This time, failure is out of the question.

103
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,705
[both] Aye-aye, sir.

104
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,249
We can do it.

[evil chuckle]

106
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,963
[Ash] What an awesome ship.

107
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,634
[Misty] I'd like to travel around
the whole world in this.

Welcome aboard the St. Anne<i>.</i>

109

Wow! Look at this!

Come one, come all.

113
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,660
Oh. It's so cute.

114
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,954
It's like a giant Pokémon convention.

115
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,622
Everyone's a Pokémon trainer.

116
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,625
Take a look at the smooth skin
on my Charmander.

117
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,502
That shows how healthy it is.

118
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,588
Look at the flame on my Charmander.

119
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,132
There's orange mixed in with the red.
Cool, huh?

120
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,300
Check it out.

121
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,219
[chuckles] Wait, look how hard
the shell is on my Squirtle.

122
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,096
Tough, huh? [chuckles]

123
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,766
My Squirtle and my charmander
are much better than theirs are.

124
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,852
-[man] All right, bring them on.
-Hm?

125
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,942
Raticate, a jump kick.

126
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,235
Raticate!

127
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,362
All right, Starmie, spinning tackle.

129
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,408

-All right, they're having a battle.
-Pikachu.

132
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,417
Raticate, super fang attack, now.

133
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,501
Raticate!

136
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,220
Are you okay, Starmie?

137
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,263
[whimpers]

138
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,599
Ah, don't feel too badly, young man.

139
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,853
It was only a practice match anyhow,
and I just happened to be lucky.

140
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,024
My, how gracious.

141
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,943
Heh, not at all, miss.

142
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,905
Keep working on building
your Starmie's strength there.

143
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:32,369
Well, now, is anybody else brave enough
to challenge my Raticate?

144
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,580
[grunting] I can't wait.

145
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,500
How about battling my Butterfree?

146
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,793
As you wish.

147
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,504
Boy, I hope he knows what he's doing.

148
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,092
Say, Jessie, this place is packed.

149
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,219
Yes, and packed with Pokémon.

150
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,889
And soon all these Pokémon will be ours.

00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:58,853
[maniacal laughter]

152
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,188
All for us.

153
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,233
Shut up. They're not for us.
They're for the boss.

[both grunting]

160
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,039
Does Ash's Butterfree even stand a chance
against that Raticate?

161
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,624
Sure. It's a good match, really.

162
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,209
Finish it, Raticate.

163
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,003
Hyper fang attack.

164
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,170

170
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,973
All right. Now the whirlwind.

171
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,434
Well, that's enough.

172
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,393
Huh?

173
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,062
Why don't we just call it a draw?

174
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,523
But I was winning.

175
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,153

Boy, boy. Hey, you boy. Come here.

176
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,696
Are you addressing me?

177
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,740
I want you to have a look at this Pokémon.

178
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,782
Huh?

179
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,784
What is this thing?

180
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,580
The king of all carp. A Magikarp.

181
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,540
What do I do, eat it?

182
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,501
[chuckles] See how healthy it is.

183
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,463
Oh! It certainly is lively.

184
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,884
Just between you and me, this Magikarp
is like a Pokémon gold mine.

185
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,926
Gold mine?

186
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,513
Right.
A Magikarp lays 1,000 eggs at a time.

187
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,975
Each of those 1,000 baby Magikarp
lay 1,000 more.

188
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,978
One thousand times 1,000 makes
one million.

189
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,523
Every one of those one million
lays another 1,000.

190
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,859
That's a billion Pokémon.

191
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,110
A billion?

192
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,654
You can sell one Magikarp for $100.

193
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,990
In three generations,
you have tons of money.

194
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,076
Billions and billions.

195
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,535
Billions?

196
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,578
[laughing]

197
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,999
[salesman] You'll be so rich,
you can go on a Pokémon shopping spree.

198
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,459
Rich. Rich!

199
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,171
I normally charge $100, but for you,
I'll throw in an egg-laying set,

200
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,174
childcare set
and an education set for only $300.

201
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,635
-How about it? [chuckles]
-I'll take it.

202
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,011
I can tell. [chuckles]

203
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,098
You're going to be a very rich man.
A very rich man.

204
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,976
[crazed laughter]

205
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,781
[chomping and grunting]

206
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,868
So, are you having yourself a good time?

207
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,745
Yes, sir, We're having a great time.

208
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,998
You know, that Butterfree of yours
is quite extraordinary.

209
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,750
It's incredible.

210
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,215
She's beautiful.

211
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,633
Hello in there.

212
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,218
Beautiful.

213
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,928
Here we go again.

214
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,472
Well, I put a lot of work
into raising it.

215
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,432
What did you think of my Raticate?

216
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,144
It looked great,
and it really put up a tough fight.

217
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,062
In that case, I'll be direct.

218
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,355
Why don't we trade?

219
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,481
Trade Pokémon?

220
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,819
When two people find that they each like
the other's Pokémon, they trade.

221
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,072
-It's quite a common practice everywhere.
-Everywhere?

222
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,450
You see, friends who trade
then trade with their other friends

223
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,413
and so friendships grow deeper
and continue to spread wider and wider.

224
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,998
Trading and making new friends

225
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,167
is one of the best things
about having Pokémon.

226
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,087
That's how Pokémon friendships
get to spread all around the world.

227
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,130
Wow.

228
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,424
Friendship is wonderful, isn't it?

229
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,303
Yeah, yeah. Why don't you and I
start a friendship right now?

230
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,972
-Should I trade, Brock?
-Oh, yeah. You got to trade.

231
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,640
Everybody should trade.
Let's start trading.

232
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,602
Well, okay.

233
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,693
Here we go.

234
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,654
Hm.

235
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,086
Well, that's all there is to it.
Raticate is your new Pokémon.

236
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,051
You idiot!
Can't you see you were tricked?

237
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,510
What a dope.

238
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,097
But you don't understand.
Magikarp is a goldmine.

239
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,475
Even its Poké Ball is solid gold.

240
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,143
It's just gold-plated.

241
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,395
[screams]

242
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,316
Magikarp is a no-talent Pokémon
that can't do anything but flop around.

243
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,860
How could you possibly expect to sell it?

244
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,278
I was tricked.

245
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,988
How did you get the money for it?

246
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,241
Well, the advance on my salary
didn't quite cover it, so I--

247
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,826
So you did what?

248
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,578
I used the advance on your salary.

249
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,041
You go return that fish
and get my money back right now.

250
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,585
[ship's klaxon blares]

251
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,549
What's the matter, Ash?
You look so serious.

252
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,009
Uh, I was just thinking.

253
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,846
I wonder if that guy is going
to take good care of my Butterfree.

254
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,474
-Oh.
-I traded my Butterfree to some guy

255
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,936
I don't even know just because
he seemed to like trading so much.

256
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,022
I really don't even know
if he'll take care of it the way I did.

257
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,483
Look on the bright side,
you got a Raticate.

258
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:56,859
[sighs]

259
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,903
It's just when I was trading it away,

260
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,948
I remembered the time
when it evolved into Butterfree.

261
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,408
Pika.

262
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,704
[ship's klaxon blares]

263
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,923
[growls happily]

264
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,052
[man chuckles] It won't be long now.

265
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,053
[screeches]

266
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,307
-Hey!
-Pikachu?

267
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,976
[confused chatter]

268
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,270
[man] Who are they?

269
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:37,358
Hey, hombre, I want my... my money back!

270
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,651
[screams]

271
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,194
Are you crazy?

272
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,196
-But I--
-We've got work to do!

273
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,576
To protect the world from devastation...

274
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,287
To unite all peoples within our nation...

275
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,457
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

276
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,084
To extend our reach to the stars above...

277
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,754
-Jessie.
-James.

278
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,007
Team Rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

279
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,927
[sighs]
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

280
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,846
Meowth. That's right.

281
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,266
Team Rocket will now take possession
of your Pokémon.

282
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,435
-[man] My Pokémon?
-[boy] They can't do that.

283
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,271
[woman] What are they talking about?
Our Pokémon.

284
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,691
[all screaming]

285
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,154
-Give me your Pokémon.
-No way.

286
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,572
Don't make me take them.

287
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,157
Pikachu!

288
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,825
Chu!

289
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,578
[screaming]

290
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,456
If they're going
to try to rob our Pokémon,

291
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,041
we might as well make it a battle.

292
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,502
-Yeah, we can't just surrender.
-Let's fight back.

293
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,921
[all cheering]

294
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,131
[all] Go!

295
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,593
Suck them up. Suck them up.
Suck them all up!

296
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,851
Attaway to go, guys.
Keep sucking them up.

297
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,771
Make sure you get every last one.

298
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,148
Squirtle, go!

299
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,526
Squirtle.

300
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,029
We got to fight them together.

301
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,906
-Pikachu, go.
-Pika.

302
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,283
[all] Kachu! Kachu! Kachu...

303
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,744
Kachu! Kachu! Kachu!

304
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,957
Pikachu!

305
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,626
[screaming]

306
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,507
Charmander, I choose you.

307
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,592
Char!

308
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,720
[all] Char! Char! Char!

309
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,267
[all screaming]

310
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,105
Geodude, go!

311
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,067
Geodude.

312
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,028
[all] Geodude. Geodude. Geodude.

313
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,030
[screaming]

314
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,992
[all chattering]

315
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,453
[all screaming]

316
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,913
[trilling]

317
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,126
Now it's my turn. Go, Butterfree!

318
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,963
Raticate!

319
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,173
Huh?

320
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,925
-Ash, you traded it, remember?
-Oh, yeah.

321
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,387
[trilling]

322
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
Butterfree.

323
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,395
Oh!

324
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,443
[trills] Butterfree!

325
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,444
Oh!

326
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,863
[trills] Butterfree!

327
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,865
Yeah! All right!

328
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,499
I raised that Butterfree all by myself.

329
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,667
I have to get Butterfree back.

330
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,628
Hand over the Poké Balls.

331
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,007
Pidgeotto, I choose you.

332
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,968
[all] Pidgeo!

333
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,470
Pidgeotto, group gust!

334
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,431
[squawking]

335
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,317
Pikachu, all together, thunderbolt!

336
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,320
[all] Kachu! Kachu! Kachu!

337
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,573
Pikachu!

338
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,746
[all scream]

339
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,250
-[Ash] We did it! Great job!
-[all cheering]

340
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,211
I think we should all be very proud
of our Pokémon.

341
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,214
And we taught Team Rocket
a lesson they'll never forget.

342
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,175
I can't wait to get off this lousy bucket.

343
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,304
[all screaming]

344
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,643
Wait, there goes my salary advance!

345
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,812
-There goes my money too.
-Meowth.

346
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,733
[all gasping]

347
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,991
Oh, no, it's a big storm.

348
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,451
It'll be tough to get back
with waves like this.

349
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,287
What?

350
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,913
Hey, where's Ash?

351
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,124
So you want to go back on our trade?

352
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,460
Butterfree was the first Pokémon
I ever captured.

353
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,921
I worked very hard
training and raising it.

354
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,090
Please, can I have it back?

355
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,050
You leave me no choice.

356
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,511
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,764
Now, calm down.

358
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,767
These high seas have just pushed us
a little off course.

359
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,185
[man] A little off course?

360
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,313
There's nothing to worry about.

361
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:29,025
We're heading for port now,
and besides, this ship is unsinkable.

362
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,152
There's absolutely no need for alarm.

363
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,698
[all gasping]

364
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:40,161
Now, there's no reason to panic. I just
thought I'd test out one of the lifeboats.

365
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,288
[nervous chuckling]

366
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,084
[all clamoring]

367
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,047
[woman] Hey! Got to get off the ship!

368
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,508
Come on, Ash, we got to go.
The ship is sinking.

369
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,843
Hold on.

370
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,223
Butterfree, please forgive me.

371
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,644
[groans]

372
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,606
Butterfree!

373
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,857
Ash!

374
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,694
[James]
Wait, there goes my next paycheck!

375
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,614
Who cares about your paycheck?
What about mine?

376
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,157
[Meowth]
We got to get out of here.

377
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,787
-[man] Oh, what are we going to do?
-[nervous chatter]

378
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,497
[man] Oh, no.

379
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,456
[all panting]

380
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,957
I got you!

381
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,126

382
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,753

383

384
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,005
Got it!

385
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,382
[all sigh]

386
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,467
[all screaming]

387
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,141
[man]
Look, there goes the ship! It's sinking!

388
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,644
May I have your attention.

389
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,649
Anyone who didn't leave the ship safely,
please say aye.

390
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,069
Good. Well done. Everyone's safe, then.
