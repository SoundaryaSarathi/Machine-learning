1
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:07,327
All right! It cleared up

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:10,627
Really it’s like last night’s
rain was a lie

3
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:11,993
By the way Sakura

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,935
aren’t you up early for a Sunday?

5
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,373
Today I am having a picnic

6
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,506
with Tomoyo-chan at the wooded park

7
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,240
Why don’t you go along, Kero-chan?

8
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,840
If you are in the bag nobody can tell,

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,913
OK? OK?

10
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,080
I’m so glad the weather turned nice

11
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:38,786
[Sakura’s exhausting Sunday]

12
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,325
Good morning!

13
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,357
Good morning Sakura

14
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,065
You seem pretty happy monster

15
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,772
I’ll forgive you today

16
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,311
You really do seem
in a good mood Sakura

17
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:03,147
Today I am going out with Tomoyo-chan.

18
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:04,548
Eh?

19
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,659
Today’s chores are
all you aren’t they?

20
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:12,891
What?

21
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:15,729
You wrote it yourself last week and forgot?

22
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:18,596
Umm Umm

23
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:26,670
Rika-chan is having a piano recital

24
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,504
I was thinking I’d like to go cheer her on

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,609
Fine I’ll switch with you

26
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,210
Really?

27
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,619
In return next Sunday you are
doing all the household chores

28
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:41,850
OK!

29
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:45,791
Umm Umm…

30
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:48,494
Well I have work

31
00:01:49,864 --> 00:01:51,195
I’ll take care of it

32
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,992
It has been raining a lot lately

33
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,829
so this much built up

34
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,700
Shall I help you a bit?

35
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:01,969
You have a meeting today don’t you dad?

36
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,737
It’s OK I’ll do it

37
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:05,875
Sorry

38
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:06,975
Leave it to me

39
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,380
I’ll leave this by the washing machine

40
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:10,877
OK

41
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:11,946
I’m leaving

42
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,451
See you later

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,520
I’m leaving too

44
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,789
Yeah see you later

45
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:20,553
I’m off.

46
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,032
Umm… Umm…

47
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,224
So that’s it?

48
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:29,692
I’m sorry

49
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,234
I completely forgot I had chores today

50
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:35,870
There is no helping it

51
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:37,908
I’m really sorry

52
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:39,912
Don’t worry about it too much

53
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:41,940
Good luck with your chores

54
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:43,878
Yeah! Thanks

55
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,818
Well I’ll see you at school tomorrow

56
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,414
Yes until tomorrow

57
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:02,294
I’ll bring a letter of apology on Monday

58
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:07,103
Well then shall we get down to work

59
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,040
Kero-chan how’s it going?

60
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,652
Just because nobody else is home

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,153
Why do I have to do something like this?

62
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,746
Wood? A tree?

63
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,675
This is a Clow Card

64
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,544
Huh? It stopped

65
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,289
Kero-chan! Kero-chan!

66
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,961
Kero-chan I found a Clow card

67
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:03,727
Huh?

68
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,295
He’s not here

69
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,734
Oh well

70
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,203
I’ll brag about it later

71
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:19,671
I’m spinning a lot today

72
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:23,282
I quit I quit I quit

73
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,849
Why should I must do such silly thing?

74
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:27,680
Oh yeah!

75
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:31,084
When this is done
I’ll have some ice cream with Kero-chan

76
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:33,225
I guess there is no choice

77
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,659
I’ll help a little more

78
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,362
All right. This is the last place

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,313
It’s covered in ink

80
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,120
This is also a Clow Card

81
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,287
I’m lucky today

82
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:10,093
To find two cards

83
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:11,957
I have to wipe it off

84
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,735
Towel Towel A wet towel

85
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,367
The phone

86
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah yeah I’m answering now

87
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:26,537
Hello Kino

88
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:27,370
Sakura

89
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,011
Yes? Dad?

90
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:32,247
Can you check if there
is a blue folder on top of the kitchen table?

91
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,848
There is

92
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,414
Sorry can you bring
that to the bus stop?

93
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,053
All my materials for the meeting are in there

94
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:42,293
I’ll leave right away

95
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,494
Kero-chan I’m going out for a bit

96
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:53,998
What?

97
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,087
See you later

98
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,453
Thank you!

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,551
Sakura-chan

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,789
Yukito-san

101
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:21,700
That was your dad right now right?

102
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:23,196
An errand?

103
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,698
Yes he forgot something so

104
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,802
You delivered it?
How nice!

105
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,241
A uniform?

106
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,314
There was a basketball game today

107
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,111
I was helping out a bit

108
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,880
Yukito-san isn’t really in any club

109
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:43,551
But sometimes he gets asked to play

110
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:46,686
just in games

111
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,757
He’s smart and can do anything

112
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:51,897
It’s wonderful!

113
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:54,764
Say Sakura-chan

114
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:56,134
Have you had lunch yet?

115
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,162
No not yet.

116
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,903
Won’t you eat with me? Over there

117
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:06,546
Big brother

118
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,881
Thanks

119
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:17,715
Three plates large helping

120
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,057
He eats three times as much as I do

121
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:22,493
Th… Three times?

122
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:24,788
You don’t have to hold back

123
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,500
It is my treat

124
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:28,997
Kero-chan is waiting for me at home

125
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:30,834
Kero-chan?

126
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,833
No Uh

127
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,273
It’s good to eat a lot

128
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:38,610
health wise

129
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:40,905
It’s tough on the allowance though

130
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,310
Yukito-san

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,478
Thank you Dad

132
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,616
I was able to see Yukito-san

133
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,650
I’m home

134
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,031
Kero-chan!

135
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,505
Thanks

136
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,203
I can’t spin anymore

137
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,837
I’ll make lunch right away

138
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,750
Kero-chan Kero-chan! Hey Kero-chan!

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,289
What? Lunch time?

140
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:29,227
What is this sound?

141
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,155
Sound?

142
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:37,770
I wonder if it is a thief

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,672
Sounds like downstairs

144
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:42,974
It couldn’t be a monster could it?

145
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:44,708
Would they come out at day?

146
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,205
They might be there and come out

147
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:54,520
It’s from the basement

148
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:03,959
In here

149
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:05,895
Well.

150
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:08,999
Open…

151
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,700
What? I can’t really see

152
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,222
What was that just now?

153
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,020
This is the branch from a plant

154
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,997
Why would something like that
be coming in from the basement?

155
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:41,601
This is the work of Wood

156
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,900
A Clow Card? Now that you mention it today

157
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,108
You left a card you found out

158
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,776
without writing your name on it?

159
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,809
But when I found it it was just a card

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,310
I had to answer the phone

161
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:58,747
That’s not good

162
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,519
The cards first begin to listen

163
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,947
to what their owner says
when you write your name on them

164
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,949
But it was in the house all this time

165
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:07,523
nothing has happened until now

166
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,060
Wood is a peaceful card

167
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,858
I can’t think of her
doing anything bad

168
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:15,536
Then why?

169
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,062
Ah! Kero-chan don’t let go

170
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,510
Kero-chan what should we do?

171
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,370
I’m in trouble too

172
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,627
What should I do?

173
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,135
I wonder who it is

174
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,075
If you answer you will know

175
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:03,644
If they see this it will
become a rumor all over town

176
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,148
They might see that you are a stuffed animal

177
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:07,818
that can sell too

178
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:09,554
I don’t want that

179
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,455
Y Yes!

180
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,258
Why did you answer?

181
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:15,794
It just slipped out

182
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,666
For the time being I’ll

183
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:23,164
Kero-chan?

184
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:24,562
Don’t to stuffed animals

185
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,065
No fair!

186
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:49,022
Umm this is

187
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,259
Hello

188
00:11:58,973 --> 00:11:59,940
Oh my Tomoyo-chan

189
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:03,510
I was thinking I would help with your chores

190
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,113
Weeding the yard?

191
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:10,442
No

192
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,543
this is the work of the Clow Card Wood

193
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:13,646
Really?

194
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:16,885
My Sakura seal
it while you have the chance

195
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:23,393
OK, release!

196
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:32,866
Return to your rightful form

197
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:36,802
Clow Card!

198
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,251
How wonderful Sakura-chan

199
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,049
Oh!

200
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,758
Is something wrong?

201
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,261
There is no card

202
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:55,596
That can’t be

203
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:57,726
Isn’t it dropped
somewhere over there?

204
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,254
What about in the room over there

205
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,399
Oh yeah the basement

206
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,667
All right shall we go get the card?

207
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:11,734
Yeah

208
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,773
Sakura go up

209
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:20,582
Sakura!

210
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:56,253
It looks like it calmed down.

211
00:13:57,024 --> 00:14:00,118
It seems that it was satisfied
after getting into the sunlight

212
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:02,459
Just what we should expect from Wood

213
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,623
The laundry!

214
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:07,762
Umm… Umm…

215
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,400
I have to do it again
from the beginning

216
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,102
Don’t be so down

217
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,632
I’ll do it too OK?

218
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:15,906
Do it again

219
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:20,045
What should we do about this?

220
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,208
Even if we try to seal
it just returns to normal

221
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:24,778
Isn’t it obvious?

222
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:28,879
We go to where the card
is and completely seal it

223
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,314
You mean into the basement?

224
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,450
Exactly

225
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:35,353
What is this sound?

226
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,425
It sounds like elephants walking around

227
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,733
No, it’s the sound of the house creaking

228
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,862
Wood is still growing

229
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:44,996
Even though it just calmed down?

230
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:47,236
It knows that there is light outside

231
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,436
If Wood is trying to get
all the way outside

232
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,306
The house will be destroyed

233
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,938
No!

234
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,440
This is a job for Card Captor Sakura

235
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,226
Why did you bring these clothes?

236
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,790
Today I was planning on filming

237
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:16,865
an episode of Sakura explores the Jungle

238
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,666
So you prepared this lunch too?

239
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,554
Looks like you can make it through

240
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:41,561
This way

241
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,736
Just a little further

242
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,307
Let’s hurry

243
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:02,915
What is that noise?

244
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:05,948
I wonder

245
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,513
Water?

246
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,654
The Wood card doesn’t make water

247
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:13,752
So the other card?

248
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:16,493
What? There was a second card?

249
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,391
Which means

250
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,603
So Rain was there

251
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:29,943
Rain?

252
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,368
The card of rain

253
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,974
Rain and Wood affecting each others

254
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:35,308
And created this jungle

255
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:37,980
Hey Sakura

256
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:38,876
OK

257
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,444
At long last

258
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,088
Rain! Wood!

259
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,922
That’s far enough for your pranks

260
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:50,330
How wonderful

261
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:52,791
Sakura here it comes!

262
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,909
What? It’s nothing much

263
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,377
Umm… Um…

264
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:18,857
Sakura it is just playing

265
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,284
Hurry and seal it

266
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:22,087
But…

267
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,064
At this rate

268
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,727
That’s it, Sakura, Watery!

269
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:32,002
Watery will turn
its rain water against it

270
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,505
Watery? Oh yeah

271
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,369
Card made by Clow

272
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,178
lend power to my key

273
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,707
Magical power in the card
transfer to this key

274
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:45,983
Give me power

275
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,217
Watery!

276
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:04,836
Water! Become now the chains that bind!

277
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,171
All right we got it!

278
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,940
Return to your rightful form

279
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:18,578
Clow Card!

280
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:33,924
You did it

281
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,528
All that is left is

282
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,133
the one responsible for
trying to break the house

283
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:39,634
Wood!

284
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:40,531
Wait a second!

285
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:41,897
What?

286
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,309
Just like I said she is a nice card

287
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:27,146
I guess wood and rain
get along well after all

288
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,315
Look at that

289
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:31,649
It’s a rainbow

290
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,223
My how pretty

291
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,654
Sakura

292
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:39,224
Once you have done this

293
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:42,091
you first make a card your own

294
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:44,634
Yeah I will keep that in mind

295
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:46,964
Well I am going to sleep for a bit

296
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,837
Good night

297
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:50,969
Sorry about today

298
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:54,143
No I am happy it
became a much better video

299
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,210
than filing in the forest park

300
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,742
Really?

301
00:19:58,152 --> 00:19:59,346
Sakura! It’s terrible!

302
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:12,161
This means we have
to clean it all over

303
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,761
I’ll help too

304
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,198
Thank you!

305
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,728
Thank you so much!

306
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:22,566
I’m home

307
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:36,282
Good job on your chores today

308
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,255
We’ll eat cake later

309
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,316
If you don’t write your name on the cake

310
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:41,694
I’ll eat it

311
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:48,896
I did write my name
