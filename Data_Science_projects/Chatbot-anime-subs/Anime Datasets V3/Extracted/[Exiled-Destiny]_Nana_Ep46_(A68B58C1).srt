1
00:00:01,812 --> 00:00:04,912
The contract money Gaia transferred
into our accounts,

2
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:07,982
the expected monthly salaries
from the agency,

3
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:10,712
and estimated royalties
we'll be receiving from CD sales.

4
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,952
Our band is no longer
some humble amateur band.

5
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:20,192
I figured I could easily support
Hachi and her baby now.

6
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,592
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

7
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,472
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

8
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:36,312
Baby I'm standing alone

9
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:39,112
An unforgettable rainy day

10
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:42,122
Chasing after your shadow

11
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,992
And it's over, it's like sand now

12
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:47,292
I sigh every night

13
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:50,332
I scream like a child and cried

14
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:53,062
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

15
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:57,122
Please, please God, forgive my sins

16
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:59,862
I don't need to hide no more

17
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,802
Flowing toward the turquoise light

18
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:06,842
Just keep going on

19
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:08,442
You've got the chance now

20
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,652
You've got the power

21
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,152
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

22
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,782
I show you my life now

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,222
I show you my love now

24
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:18,452
I show you my everything yeah yeah

25
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:20,692
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

26
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,492
Don't ever change so be yourself

27
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,932
I'll show you my strength now

28
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:26,302
I'll show you my love now

29
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:29,562
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

30
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:33,592
Baby don't be afraid

31
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:37,242
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

32
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,942
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

33
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,712
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

34
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:45,612
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

35
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:31,632

43
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,372
And we took Yuri to her room since

44
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,102
- she could no longer walk on her own.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

45
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,332
- Don't you touch her!
- Right.

46
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:47,312
Good night! Let's do this again soon!

47
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:51,182
After listening closely to confirm that
she was retiring to bed,

48
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,812
I got into bed myself.

49
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,522
Even if it were casual,
if they end up doing it,

50
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:58,582
Nobu would get emotionally involved.

51
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:00,852
That's the kinda guy Nobu is.

52
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:05,962
Right now, I want him to
think only of Hachi.

53
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,932
I still want him to love only Hachi.

54
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,402
But I wanna stop saying
such selfish things.

55
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:19,002
God... Buddha... Demon Lord...

56
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:23,612
Please make Nobuo and Hachiko
get back together.

57
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,592
It's past eight.
You'd better get up, or you'll be late.

58
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,392
Sure... Huh?
What about my alarm?

59
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,492
- It went off.
- Sorry!

60
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,362
Do you find it noisy every morning?
Or do you find me noisy?

61
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:51,532
Yeah. Thanks to you,
I've been able to sleep really well lately.

62
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,542
Was she being sarcastic?

63
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,512
Maybe.

64
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,912
You're alone on the fourth floor,
aren't you?

65
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,112
You're not planning to
move here, are you?

66
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:04,652
Think why I fled from Room 603
after just one night.

67
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,952
Then what about the third floor?
Does anyone live there?

68
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,422
I've never seen anyone from there.

69
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,762
More importantly,
what are you gonna do today, Nobu?

70
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:14,032
Are you going to
the fireworks festival?

71
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,262
Yeah.

72
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,502
You're gonna get Hachi back!

73
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,132
Huh? Well...

74
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,442
You coward.

75
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:25,002
Hey! That's something
I should decide after I see her!

76
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,442
If she seems happy,
then that's good enough for me.

77
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,872
I don't wanna get her back
if it's gonna interfere with her happiness.

78
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:38,952
But... if she seems sad,
then I couldn't leave her like that.

79
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,502
No!

80
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,132
You seriously think
you can just cancel your interview

81
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,262
at the last minute for personal reasons?!

82
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:53,762
I never said anything
about canceling it!

83
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,172
I'm just asking you to move it
to another day!

84
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,172
Absolutely not!

85
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,672
Besides I can't let you loose
in a big crowd like that.

86
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,442
Don't worry about that.

87
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:04,452
Mika and Masaru said they'd help,
so our disguises will be perfect.

88
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:07,522
Oh my! You think you can
get away using

89
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,642
a professional hair stylist and
makeup artist for your personal business?!

90
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,592
But when we called and asked,

91
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,292
they both found it amusing and
were looking forward to it.

92
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,692
I wonder what kind of interesting outfits
they have planned for us.

93
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,562
Regardless, I won't allow it!

94
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:20,722
All right.

95
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:25,032
If you won't allow it,
I'll just hafta skip work.

96
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,262
What did you say?!

97
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,862
I'm so disappointed in you, Nana.

98
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,912
You've got a bad attitude,
and you're a lousy singer,

99
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,312
but at least I valued you for
your enthusiasm towards your work.

100
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:35,312
I'm lousy?!

101
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,042
Well, that's why, Ginpei.

102
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:40,022
I wish you'd understand that
for Nana to be insisting so much,

103
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,612
this has gotta be something
really important to her.

104
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,952
Yasu... I understand.

105
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,622
For you to say so, it's gotta be something
really important.

106
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:51,692
What the hell?!

107
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:53,822
I'll discuss it with the reporter.

108
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:56,602
He's really in love with him?

109
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,122
Oh, sure, that's fine.

110
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:59,502
We still have time before
the proofing deadline.

111
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,672
Monday? Not a problem at all.

Then I'll try to finish this game
and return to work before then.

114
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,502
What'd he say?

115
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,452
He was extremely troubled by it,

116
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,352
but has agreed to somehow adjust
his schedule to accommodate us.

117
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,552
All right!

118
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,292
I'm sorry for the trouble, Ginpei.

119
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,892
- It's okay.
- This is great! Isn't it, Nobu?!

120
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:20,592
I do have a heart, you know.

121
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,562
- That's good news, isn't it, Nana?
- Hey, come on! Aren't you happy?!

122
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:23,522
Y-Yeah...

123
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:27,952
Our band is becoming
more and more like a family.

124
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,602
You can't smoke!

125
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,232
- Ginpei's like the strong mama,
- Why just me?

126
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,502
- Yasu's the dependable oldest son,
- If you quit, Shin might quit too.

127
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:38,802
Nobu's the kind-hearted second son,
and Shin's the bratty baby of the family.

128
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,082
It's because I'm protected
by this family

129
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,312
that I can get away with being
so selfish and spoiled.

130
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:46,512
But then who's the dad?

131
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,222
If it's the president, that would make
this some gangster family.

132

If it's the president, that would make
this some gangster family.

133

BLACK STONES CLAN

134
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:55,392
I guess I'll settle on the raccoon guy.
At least he's better than the fox guy.

135
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:57,822
That's not bad.

136
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:03,292
I've always wanted to be part of
a big family like the ones on TV.

137
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:08,932
Now if Hachi would marry Nobu,
it would be perfect.

00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,072
The baby is growing well.

142
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:19,412
I've got a pretty good idea now
on the gender of the baby.

143
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:20,042
Huh?

144
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:22,982
Would you like to know now?

145
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:26,822
Or would you like to keep it a surprise
for when the baby's born?

146
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:29,762
I do want to know,

but perhaps it would be
more exciting to wait?

What should I do?

151
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,962
It's still an educated guess
at this point.

152
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:38,892
Yes.

153
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,742
It's good that your morning sickness
subsided fairly quickly,

154
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,762
but I am concerned about
your rapid weight gain.

155
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,472
If you gain too much,
it can be dangerous in many ways,

156
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:52,372
so try to focus on eating proper portions
of nutritionally balanced foods, okay?

157
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,992
Actually, from an appearance
point of view,

158
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:58,482
I don't wanna gain weight, either.

159
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,352
I ate too much at lunch.

160
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,422
I'll avoid the food stands
at the fireworks festival.

161
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:11,492
Did you say something, Sachiko?
Huh? You want a Jackson Burger?

00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:14,732
No, no. I have a bad feeling
about that place.

163
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:19,072
Maybe I shouldn't go to
the fireworks festival, after all.

164
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:21,812
Well, I'm sure it'll
be really crowded,

165
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,142
so your chances of seeing her
are minimal.

166
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:26,212
But what if I run into her?

167
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:29,312
Myself aside,
I'd feel bad for Sachiko.

168
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,992
Her evening of fun would be ruined.

169
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:36,622
I think it'd be worse not to take her
for those reasons.

170
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,762
That's why I'm in a bind!

171
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,562
- Damn you, Junko!
- Welcome!

172
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:43,532
It's been so long, Koichi Sato!

173
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,832
Nana...

174
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,932
My bad feelings have come true.
I've been led here by the Demon Lord.

175
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,042
If you had a revelation,
then don't come!

176
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,232
But Sachiko said she was hungry.

177
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,512
A Jackson Burger
and fresh orange juice.

178
00:08:58,882 --> 00:08:59,512
Sure.

179
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,622
Sachiko?

180
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,282
The baby in my tummy.
Four months now.

181
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:06,422
Why'd you name it that?!

182
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,422
- You're scaring me!
- Don't ask me!

183
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,822
I didn't wanna name her that, either!

184
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:09,892
Then don't!

185
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,732
But my husband has his heart
set on Sachiko.

186
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:16,622
By "husband," you mean
Takumi of Trapnest?

187
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:19,832
Jun-chan, you blabbermouth!

188
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,362
So it is!

189
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:24,642
No, it's okay. I won't tell anyone.

190
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,002
I swear to the Demon Lord himself.

191
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,042
Sure, I promise. I promise, so...

192
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:31,112
Can I get Reira's autograph?

193
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,082
You were a fan?

194
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,022
I thought I'd display it in
the alcove at my parents' place

195
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:36,312
and make it an heirloom.

196
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:39,652
I'm sure my grandma would appreciate it
and put her hands together every day.

197
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,182
Well, I guess so then.

198
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:44,692
I'll ask for you, but Reira's really busy
so I can't promise anything.

199
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:45,832
You're friends with her?!

200
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,532
Well, sorta.

201
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,762
That's amazing, Nana!

202
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:54,102
Until recently,
you were just a country girl.

203
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,932
I'm gonna call you
a celebrity from now on.

204
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:01,472
Stop it. I'm just
your average pregnant woman.

205
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:03,442
Okay, now you've got some attitude.

206
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,052
But seeing you now,

207
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,782
I guess running around doing as
you wish is a great skill in a way.

208
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,392
These days, being firm and modest

209
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,352
isn't enough to get you
on the winning team.

210
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,452
I've learned something new.
Congratulations, celebrity!

211
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:17,922
Keep climbing that social ladder!

212
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:21,462
Hey, Take.

213
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,632
It looks like Ren's decided
to marry Nana.

214
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:26,862
Huh? Marry her?!

215
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,232
So you persuaded him, Takumi?

216
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,802
No, he brought up
the subject himself.

217
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:34,512
And he doesn't seem to have
any ulterior motives.

218
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:35,812
That's good.

219
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,242
- What are you talking about?
- That's the best.

220
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,712
He's out buying the ring right now.

221
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,922
We should arrange for him to meet her,
so he can give it to her.

222
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:43,882
You're right.

223
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:48,152
With that ring, I'm sure even Nana
will accept it with joy.

224
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,122
We don't have to worry anymore.

225
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,832
You know,
that's a really big diamond.

226
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:57,672
A worthless guy like me
could never afford

227
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:58,862
to buy something like that
in my lifetime.

228
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,172
I'm happy for you, celebrity,
that you didn't settle with me.

229
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:02,802
You make it sound like
I'm some evil woman who dumped you.

230
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,342
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT
You make it sound like
I'm some evil woman who dumped you.

231
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:08,282
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT
But it's true!
You had me running in circles for you,

232
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,482
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT
and then in the end,
it's, "I don't want him!"

233
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:10,012
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT
- Was I your toy?
- You're the one who cheated on me!

234
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,112
- Was I your toy?
- You're the one who cheated on me!

235
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:11,982
IT'S NOT RIGHT!
- Was I your toy?
- You're the one who cheated on me!

236
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,382
Sorry.

237
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,682
So you think that apologizing now
will make it all right?!

238
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,292
I'm sorry, but it's in the past, isn't it?

239
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,152
I'm surprised you can be
so casual about it!

240
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:22,122
I'm just trying to say what
you wanna hear.

241
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,462
You kept saying how much
you loved me,

242
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:26,652
but it turned out that was all a lie!

243
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,752
I don't remember ever actually
saying that to you.

244
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,902
I could hear it!

245
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,462
I know!
And there's no way that was a lie!

246
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:36,372
You know very well
that I'm horrible at lying.

247
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:37,972
That's why when I cheated on you,
you found out right away,

248
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,202
and I confessed.

249
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:47,482
Right away? While we're at it,
tell me everything.

250
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:49,182
Why did you cheat on me?

251
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:53,182
I just gave in to temptation.
Maybe it was the Demon Lord.

252
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:55,682
But you were dating them both
for a good two weeks.

253
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:59,262
Hey, Master! If you're keeping track
of your customers' criminal records,

254
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:00,852
you'll get taken out someday.

255
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:02,122
Two weeks...

256
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:06,222
That's all? What a boring man.

257
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,062
Celebrity!

258
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,702
You've changed my opinion of you.

259
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,522
You were keeping Ren's
best interests in mind.

260
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,142
Huh?

261
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:25,182
Why, of course. I think about
his interests far more than you do.

262
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,412
I seriously worry about him, too!

263
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:33,092
But if he marries Nana and
she stays with him forever,

264
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,492
it'll cure his bad habits.

265
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:37,062
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

266
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:37,992
Huh?

267
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,132
It's okay.

268
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:45,032
He can quit whenever he wants to.
Ren just has no desire to.

269
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:46,432
You think so?

270
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:49,642
I think Ren wants to quit if he can.

271
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,572
Then he should quit.

272
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:56,122
But even you said you'd quit smoking
for the baby's sake,

273
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,282
yet you haven't been able to!

274
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:00,862
Nicotine creates a chemical dependency
in your body,

275
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,892
so quitting is not that easy.

276
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:06,052
But Ren's psychological dependency
is also an addiction!

277
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:09,432
Keep your voice down.
If word gets out about him,

278
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:10,762
the band's activities will be suspended.

279
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:14,102
I'm concerned about it too.
Don't get so worked up about it.

280
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:17,202
Be concerned for the sake of Ren himself.
Not the band.

281
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,472
That's not my role.

282
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:23,842
Is that why you're letting him
get married?

283
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,842
He's a burden to you,
so you want Nana to take on that role?

284
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:30,322
That's not it.
That's a different story.

285
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:32,682
Yes?

286
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,522
Ah, Mr. Narita.

287
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:35,892
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT

288
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:36,562
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT
Good afternoon.

289
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:37,762
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT

290
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:39,762
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT
How does it look?
I dyed it blonde.

291
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:39,992
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT

292
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:41,602
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT
At your age?! That's ridiculous!

293
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:42,002
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT

294
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:43,872
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT
Reira, even if he does look ridiculous,

295
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:46,032
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT
that's no way to talk to the president!

296
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:46,172
MITSURU NARITA (46)
PRESIDENT

297
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,432
What brings you here today?

298
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,672
We'll be meeting with the agency

299
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,372
- about Reira's commercial appearance.
- Sexual harassment!

300
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:52,872
We don't need you here!

301
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:56,772
Right, for the cosmetics.
That's great, Reira.

302
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,012
You'll be aspired even more by

303
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,112
- young girls across the country.
- I only wanna do jobs

304
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:01,482
that require singing!

305
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,782
Stop being selfish.

306
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:04,852
They'll be using our song
for the commercial.

307
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,922
Takumi, I heard about Ren.

308
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,252
The sooner we have
a press conference, the better.

309
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,392
We should try and move things
along quickly.

310
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:14,692
Bye!

311
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:16,962
BLAH

312
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,272
Takumi! Why does even the president
suddenly want

313
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:20,972
Ren and Nana to get married?

314
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,992
He's the one who suggested it
in the first place!

315
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,312
He wanted Ren to announce to
the press that he would protect Nana!

316
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,272
Why now?

317
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:32,642
He said he doesn't want Ren to look like
he was being used by a woman.

318
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,552
His thoughts are that,
by publicly declaring that they are lovers,

319
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,252
the public will be left with
the impression

320
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,022
that BLAST became popular
thanks to us.

321
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:42,012
That's ridiculous!

322
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:43,792
Well, he's not very smart.

323
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,992
Simply saying "we're getting married"

324
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:49,022
is more persuasive and
leaves a favorable impression.

325
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:54,202
Then Narita will be satisfied,
and we can put this silly party to rest.

326
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,872
So you want them to get married
for your own protection?!

327
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:58,042
Actually, you disgust me!

328
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,412
What does the way you feel about me

329
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:02,432
have anything to do
with Ren's problems?!

330
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:06,612
We're talking business here!
That's what I hate about you women!

331
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:16,352
Then I'll point this out strictly from
a business point of view.

332
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,262
The core of our fan base
is young women.

333
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:24,002
With that in mind, I don't think having
you and Ren getting married

334
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,432
one after the other is such
a great plan.

335
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:29,142
If you seriously think all fans
support us for our music only,

336
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,102
you're delusional.

337
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,742
I get it. Then it would be better
if just Ren got married, right?

338
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:46,192
Why is Sachiko working while
you're wandering around?

339
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,452
We work different shifts.

340
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:50,252
You've gotta work more
so she can take it easy!

341
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:53,152
But we split the bills fifty-fifty.

342
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:55,222
That's one very reliable housewife.

343
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,302
I'd say girls like you
who not only spend a lot,

344
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,272
but rely on the earnings of others
to pay for it are a lot less common.

345
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:04,302
I'm glad you found a guy
with deep pockets.

346
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:09,172
Hey, not that you'd know it,
but I've grown up a lot recently.

347
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:10,982
I know.

348
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:13,982
Jun-chan, you blabbermouth...

349
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,512
So Nana, who are you going
to the fireworks with?

350
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:17,882
That's a secret!

351
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,812
We celebrities have many secrets
that we cannot tell the commoners.

352
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,662
So even if we run into each other,
don't talk to me, okay?

353
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,222
And I'll do the same.

354
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,512
I really am sorry.

355
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:52,652
It's okay. I had many faults too.

356
00:16:56,162 --> 00:17:01,722
But thinking back, none of
your selfish whims were that bad.

357
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,972
This might annoy you for me to say this,

358
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:10,172
but I still enjoy talking with you.

359
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,332
I'm glad I could see you.

360
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,402
So I won't see you anymore.

361
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:21,382
Those with a record
must refrain, you know.

362
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,082
Bye.

363
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:39,972
Get going!

364
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,502
You go first. Where are you meeting?

365
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:48,032
It's a secret. I still have time,
so I think I'll wander around a bit.

366
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,312
You sure like wandering,
although you get lost easily.

367
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:55,312
I don't get lost anymore!
Hurry up and go!

368
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,682
Oh, by the way, when is she due?
Sachiko.

369
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:04,752
The end of April.

370
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,992
It's not possible that she'll be late
and arrive on May 5th, is it?

371
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,962
Why? It's perfectly possible.

372
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,902
If she were born on that day,
Children's Day,

373
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,932
it would be nice because
everyone would remember it!

374
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:16,942
Are you sure it's not
the Demon Lord's child?

375
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,572
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE BORN
ON MAY 5TH...
Are you sure it's not
the Demon Lord's child?

376
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,942
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE BORN
ON MAY 5TH...
How dare you say something
so ominous!

377
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:20,372
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE BORN
ON MAY 5TH...
AND SHE'LL HAVE 777
ETCHED ONTO HER HEAD!
How dare you say something
so ominous!

378
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,942
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE BORN
ON MAY 5TH...
AND SHE'LL HAVE 777
ETCHED ONTO HER HEAD!
Children of the Demon Lord
can only be born on July 7th.

379
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:23,812
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE BORN
ON MAY 5TH...
AND SHE'LL HAVE 777
ETCHED ONTO HER HEAD!
Let's hope so.

380
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,342
Well then, take care of yourself.

381
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,082
Give birth to a healthy human baby!

382
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,342
Hachiko's late, isn't she?

383
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,112
No, it's only five thirty.

384
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,212
She doesn't have a key,
so she won't be here until six o'clock.

385
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,352
What? She doesn't have a key?

386
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:08,452
Yasu, you're too funny!
I can't continue a conversation!

387
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,592
Mika and Masaru put all
that effort into it,

388
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:12,962
so you shouldn't be screwing around.

389
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:16,152
You're the one who put it on me.
You even paid for it.

390
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,472
With Yasu,
placing wigs on him is so easy!

391
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:22,972
Shin, quit talking like Misato.
You're seriously cute like that.

392
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:26,002
That long hair looks
surprisingly good on you.

393
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,802
I'll bet Hachi will fall in love
with you all over again.

394
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:30,142
But I don't want her to fall in love
with me for that reason.

395
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:34,282
It makes you look a bit like Shoji.
Though you're shorter.

396
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,612
I thought so, too. Petite Shoji?

397
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,952
Yeah, he does look like him.
Although Nobu's shorter.

398
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,752
Who is this Shoji?
And just how tall is he?

399
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:47,332
Shoji!

400
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,662
What's wrong? Your eyes are red.

401
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:00,142
Huh? My contact lenses are
giving me problems.

402
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,072
But you have twenty-twenty vision.

403
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,582
Maybe I'm just far-sighted.

404
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,312
The further away something is,
the better I can see it.

405
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:11,842
But once it gets close,
I lose sight of it.

406
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:16,382
That could be the same with everyone.

407
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,802
Let's hold hands all night tonight

408
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:27,502
so we don't lose each other
in the crowd.

409
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,102
Especially since you're tiny.

410
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:37,242
Hey, Hachi...

411
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:40,712
They say you don't realize

412
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:43,582
how much you care for someone
until after they're gone.

413
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:48,322
But I think it's when you come
face to face with that person once more

414
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,812
that you truly recognize
your feelings for them.

415
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:56,192
If I saw everyone again right now...

416
00:20:57,832 --> 00:21:00,102
I know that I'd depend on them
just as much as I did back then.

417
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:05,102
I'm scared of that.
That's why I can't move from this spot.

418
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:17,052
A dark night
lasting too long

419
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:21,992
Wakes up

420
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:28,632
It's too sad
and painful

421
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:31,832
I gave up everything

422
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:39,762
But you
loved me anyway

423
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:44,352
Kiss me
and stay with me

424
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:47,852
A flower
blooming forever

425
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:52,992
Light, fragile, strong

426
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:56,822
How could you
smile for me

427
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:59,962
I need nothing else

428
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:05,132
Just stand by me forever
