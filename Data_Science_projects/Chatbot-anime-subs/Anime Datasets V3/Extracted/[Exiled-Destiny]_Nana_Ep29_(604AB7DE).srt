1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:06,803
On the wall discolored by the sun,
the poster mark remained.

2
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:23,733
Blinking eyes call the wind

3
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:31,373
A smile clears all the noise away

4
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:37,933
The angel in your eyes whispers

5
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:43,113
"Everything begins now"

6
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,353
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

7
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:49,153
It's like being caught in a wave

8
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:51,323
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

9
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:54,793
Breath held, arms reaching out

10
00:00:54,793 --> 00:01:02,033
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

11
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:06,673
You're the only one I can see

12
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:10,613
Baby my wish on a wing

13
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:13,583
This sky is torn

14
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:18,983
By a single overflowing word

15
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:45,303
What?

16
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:47,113
You're an only child, Nobu?

17
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,783
Yeah. My parents must be
crying about now.

18
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:51,183
Or rather, they must be
really pissed off.

19
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:55,153
I see. I guess you were supposed to
take over your family inn, huh?

20
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:58,693
How big is it?

21
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,653
A SPOILED CHILD

22
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:04,293
You only remember things like that, huh?

23
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:05,423
What's going on in this head?

24
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,933
But when BLAST debuts officially,

25
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:12,873
I'll bet they'll be so thrilled
they'll forgive you right away.

26
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,733
So you've gotta do your best.

27
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:16,433
Yeah.

28
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,833
I'll do my best for your sake too, Hachi.

29
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,573
I told you, don't call me Hachi.

30
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,213
But if I call you "Nana,"

31
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:24,013
I can't help but picture
the face of that cat-eyed Queen.

32
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:26,883
Cat-eyed?

33
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:29,353
I've been calling her that
since the tenth grade,

34
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,853
so it's become second nature now.

35
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,583
So BLAST has been around
since you were in the tenth grade?

36
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,493
No, we started the band
during the summer

37
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:36,793
when I was in eleventh grade,

38
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:39,093
but Nana and I were classmates
in high school.

39
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,333
Really?

40
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,193
Hey, how was Nana in high school?

41
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:46,263
She never laughed,
she didn't talk much,

42
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:47,303
and she had this evil look
in her eyes.

43
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:48,433
She was totally isolated.

44
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,133
No way.

45
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,433
I was so sure she was really
popular in school!

46
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:52,273
What a shock.

47
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:54,283
No, she was so gloomy.

48
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:55,673
She's really pretty,

49
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,683
so even though she was quiet,
she did stand out in school.

50
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,243
But you could never tell
what she was thinking,

51
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:02,153
so everyone would be too scared
to get close to her.

52
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:05,783
But when you think about it
in a normal sense,

53
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:08,593
it must've been lonely for her,
having no friends.

54
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:13,703
So I tried blitzing her
with my "machine gun" talking,

55
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:16,863
but then she just ignored me,
which left me feeling lonely.

56
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,663
So then, the music-crazed youngster
Nobuo figured,

57
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:23,073
"if I can't communicate with her
through words, I'll do it through music."

58
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,843
So I made her borrow my CDs.
Ten of them, I think.

59
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,403
I tried to give her
different genres of music,

60
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,213
thinking there was bound
to be one she'd like.

61
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,383
Then she finally talked to me.

62
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:39,463
Terashima.

63
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,853
Thanks for these.

64
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:45,623
If you get some more good ones,
can I borrow them?

65
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,263
She smiled.

66
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:48,663
Miss Osaki spoke?

67
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,393
- So she can speak normally, after all.
- Oh wait, Osaki.

68
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:54,503
What's your favorite genre?
Which one of those did you like?

69
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,243
What was it?

70
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,673
The noisiest one with
the kinda erotic name.

71
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,143
The Sex Pistols?!

72
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:01,183
Yeah, that one.

73
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:04,013
My favorite's punk, too!
We have the same taste!

74
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,713
How annoying.

75
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:06,883
I was so happy.

76
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,943
It was like being liked by
a girl you have a crush on.

77
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:11,513
To me, that just sounds like
you were in love with her.

78
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,053
Maybe a little.

79
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,613
You fool!
I hate you!

80
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,993
But that happened in the past!

81
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,033
Besides, once we became friends,

82
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:26,033
I realized that I wasn't seeing her
as a woman.

83
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:30,203
Otherwise, I would never have
introduced her to Ren, right?

84
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,073
So you were the one
who brought the two together?

85
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:33,903
Yeah.

86
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:37,583
Nana had this dangerous, warped way
of thinking that no one could deal with.

87
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,843
I thought maybe Ren would
be an exception

88
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:40,883
and could do something about it.

89
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:45,353
For the young Nobuo,
Ren was an invincible hero.

90
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,533
It was a big success, huh?

91
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:52,693
But not quite what I expected.

92
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,453
What do you mean?

93
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,263
I realized little by little

94
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,273
that Ren wasn't the strong person
I thought he was.

95
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:03,663
Perhaps Ren was saved just
as much as Nana was in this encounter.

96
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,683
You know, when I was younger,

97
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,483
for no good reason, I thought that
guys had to protect their girls.

98
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,183
So I always acted tough
in front of my girlfriend.

99
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,623
But that may have been a big mistake.

100
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:25,293
Huh? Why was that a mistake?

101
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:29,373
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms.

102
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,433
FRAIL
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms.

103
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:30,473
FRAIL

104
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:30,973
FRAIL
Yes. Totally.

105
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,133
Yes. Totally.

106
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,003
It's impossible.

107
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:35,903
Ever since I fell in love
with you, Hachiko,

108
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:39,913
I realized just how much of
a weak shameless man I really am.

109
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:40,943
What do you mean?

110
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:43,413
Weren't you gonna do anything
to make me happy?

111
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:48,143
Sure I will. As long as you're always
by my side supporting me.

112
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:53,383
With you by my side,
I feel that I can do anything.

113
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:55,553
Sure.

114
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,423
Nobuo loves to be pampered.

115
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,453
That's a problem.

116
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:04,693
I'm the one who wants
to be pampered.

117
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:10,933
But what is this feeling?
It kinda feels really sweet.

118
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:15,403
I wanna be kind to him.
I wanna be by his side.

119
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,213
I wanna be of help to him.
I wanna hug him.

120
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,883
I wanna be able to do
everything he desires.

121
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:28,953
Until now, I've only thought of
being treated that way by men.

122
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:33,093
That may have been a big mistake.

123
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,563
Good morning.

124
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,173
Nana, you're back here again.
What about Ren?

125
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,473
He's busy with work right now,
so he's hardly ever home.

126
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:47,443
You left Misato all alone.

127
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,143
Who were you with
if it wasn't Takumi?

128
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,043
Wh-Where's Misato?

129
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,103
She's still sleeping.

130
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:54,823
I'd better explain
everything to her.

131
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,593
But how am I gonna explain
so that she'd understand?

132
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,883
It happened immediately after
I broke it off with Takumi.

133
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,093
It actually overlapped a little.

134
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,833
I'll think about it thoroughly today.

135
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:08,823
I'm working today,
so I'd better get changed and hurry off.

136
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,033
Oh, by the way...

137
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,503
Were you able to find
Nobu's workplace easily yesterday?

138
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,303
Yeah, thanks. I had to see him
about something urgent.

139
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:18,643
You two really get along,
don't you?

140
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:23,643
That guy's always been
a genuine, honest sorta guy,

141
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,683
so you two share the same values.

142
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,453
Well, from the rest of the world,

143
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:31,113
you're like two little dogs barking
for attention,

144
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,523
which is kind of annoying.

145
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,523
I'm sure Nana will understand me.

146
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,933
She had to be lonely having no friends.

147
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,993
Because Nana knows for sure

148
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:44,333
a lot more great things
about Nobu than I do.

149
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:46,833
Nana...

150
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:48,093
Huh?

151
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,373
You know, I... Nobu...

152
00:07:56,313 --> 00:08:00,153
It seems like I'm head over heels
in love with Nobu.

153
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:09,053
Isn't it natural?

154
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,023
Nana didn't ask me
any questions.

155
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,993
And if I said anything more,

156
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:17,793
it would've sounded like
an excuse so I didn't.

157
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,633
There's no need for me
to explain anything.

158
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,503
I just need to treasure Nobu.
That's all.

159
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,573
And Nana will always
be watching over us.

160
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,643
Hey, look, Kyosuke did this.

161
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:36,343
This is incredibly well done.
That's Mr. Kyosuke for you.

162
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:37,653
There's no need to add the "Mr."

163
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:38,713
He's the same age as you, after all.

164
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,483
But he just seems older than me.

165
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,293
Mr. Kyosuke's somewhat like
a father to you.

166
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:46,933
Let's leave it at older brother.

167
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,423
Look, that one over in that section.
That's Jun-chan's painting.

168
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,603
It's incredible! In many ways.

169
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:55,603
It's impossible to comprehend, Jun-chan.

170
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:56,973
What is it?
Can you explain it to me?

171
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,443
I'm the one who needs
an explanation.

172
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,513
Huh? Nana and Nobu?

173
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:06,213
Yeah. All lovey-dovey.
So much it's sickening.

174
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,273
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,343
But I thought she preferred Yasu.

176
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:11,653
Maybe he didn't pay
any attention to her.

177
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,983
But she could've told us sooner.

178
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:16,923
Why'd she hide it?

179
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,993
I think the guy she was hiding
from us was another guy.

180
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:22,163
I'll bet he broke her heart.

181
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,523
In any case, she was really hurt

182
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,193
about what happened with
her ex-boyfriend.

183
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:29,743
Maybe Nobu was kind to her then
and she went along with it.

184
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,503
Yeah. But it was like
she had completely forgotten

185
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,913
about her ex-boyfriend
a little while back.

186
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,243
That's true. I guess it just shows

187
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:40,083
that Nana's ex-boyfriend wasn't all
that important to her, after all.

188
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,153
So you're saying that

189
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:43,083
there are a lotta guys out there
who are much better than her ex.

190
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:46,053
Oh, Mr. Ex-boyfriend,
here's your Jackson Burger.

191
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:48,353
Cut it out with all
the "ex-boyfriend"!

192
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,723
Oh my, I didn't notice you there, Shoji.
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,053
You're the one that invited me
to come!

194
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,733
But we always find you here
whether we call you or not.

195
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,163
Even though you live farther away
since you moved.

196
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,463
Huh? When did that happen?

197
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,463
Didn't you tell me that

198
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,933
it wasn't gonna happen
because you didn't have any money?

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,773
Shoji left his apartment and
moved to Sachiko's place.

200
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:08,113
He made us help him move
although we were really busy.

201
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:09,643
So inconsiderate.

202
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:10,683
Hey, I never asked you to,

203
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,873
but you barged in because
you were curious.

204
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,213
Sachiko lives one train stop away
from you, right?

205
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,183
Yeah.

206
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,343
I'll continue coming here
from now on too,

207
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:18,983
so don't worry Koichi Sato.

208
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:20,493
- You don't hafta come.
- What?!

209
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:25,933
Nana no longer comes here
because you continue to hang out here.

210
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,403
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,763
Tell Nana, now that she has
a boyfriend that she's all lovey-dovey with,

212
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,033
she can come here again
without thinking about her ex.

213
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:35,603
I do wanna see
her new boyfriend.

214
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,373
Nobu hasn't been here before?

215
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,473
I believe he lives close by.

216
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,543
With his band and work,

217
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,443
I doubt he has the time to
sit back and enjoy a drink.

218
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:44,683
That guru hasn't been here either,
has she?

219
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:45,713
Guru?

220
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:46,843
Nana's roommate.

221
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:47,713
Oh...

222
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:48,983
Is her boyfriend good looking?

223
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,883
Average, I'd say.
But give him a guitar and he changes.

224
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:54,053
He becomes this super cool dude.
He's a mysterious guy.

225
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,593
I guess so.

226
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,923
He's normally this helpless guy,
much like her ex-boyfriend.

227
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,493
Now that you mention it,

228
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,463
don't you think that Nobu and
the ex-boyfriend are kinda similar?

229
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,363
Oh yeah, like the way they're idiots
when they speak.

230
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:07,163
You think so? I think her
new boyfriend is conceited.

231
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,863
Have you met him?

232
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:09,563
No, I haven't.

233
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:11,773
This is according to what
Nana told me about him.

234
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,433
Apparently, he's the heir
to a Japanese inn,

235
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:17,243
but he threw that all away to pursue
his dream and came to Tokyo.

236
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,653
That alone would be enough
to have Nana fall for him.

237
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,613
He said something like this
to the guru in a serious tone.

238
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,153
"I'm happy as long as
I can play the guitar."

239
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:28,613
"With you singing to it."

240
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:32,293
Not something you can just blurt out
in straight face.

241
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,993
That's why you wouldn't do.

242
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,033
That's so cold.

243
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:36,063
You're no good

244
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,193
because you can't bring the heat up
to where it isn't cold.

245
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:39,863
You're the type who would
bring down the temperature

246
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,203
to hide your shyness.

247
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:43,233
However, I understand now.

248
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:46,773
I fully understand why
Nana fell for Nobu.

249
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:49,443
That man surely knows how
to please her.

250
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:52,613
He'll normally be this good friend
who she can talk to about anything,

251
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:53,653
but when the time's right,

252
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,123
he'll say what a woman
wants to hear.

253
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,183
He's the ideal type as far as
Nana's concerned.

254
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:59,683
I guess there's more to it than just
Nana going along with the flow.

255
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:01,553
This may turn out well.

256
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:05,993
What do you think Shoji?

257
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:08,093
What do I think? I'm glad.

258
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,363
I wish for Nana's happiness
with all my heart.

259
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:12,293
Are you lonely?

260
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,643
Koichi Sato!
One more Jackson Burger.

261
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,673
I'm taking one to Sachiko.

262
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:17,803
Welcome home, Shoji.

263
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:18,673
A present for you.

264
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,403
You were at Jackson's again?

265
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,203
Thanks.

266
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,503
I'm sorry that it's not
a Louis Vuitton bag.

267
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,113
I'm hopeless, aren't I?

268
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:29,083
Actually, I prefer the Jackson Burger.

269
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,713
I wonder if we were too mean.

270
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,253
I don't think so.
We needed to put him in his place.

271
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:36,863
We sure did that, didn't we?

272
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:38,993
In his position,
Shoji's not about to blurt out

273
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:41,393
that he's lonely under
any circumstance,

274
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:42,833
but he's gotta be feeling lonely.

275
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:44,723
Men can be so selfish.

276
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:47,533
Although it would be annoying

277
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:48,703
if he didn't feel lonely at all.

278
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:52,203
Shoji did love Nana, after all.

279
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,113
He just loved Sachiko more.

280
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:57,243
But you know,

281
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,843
don't you feel that's because
Sachiko loved Shoji more than Nana?

282
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,053
You think so?

283
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:05,353
But didn't Nana love Shoji enough
that she couldn't live without him?

284
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:06,253
No.

285
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,093
Of course, there's no way
of comparing the weight of love

286
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,353
Nana and Sachiko had for Shoji.

287
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,293
Just, Shoji probably felt more love
from Sachiko.

288
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,623
Maybe it's a matter of how
they expressed their feelings.

289
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,693
Nana's is very one-sided,

290
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:17,823
so it's difficult to grasp exactly
what she feels.

291
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:22,173
Yeah. Come to think of it,
while Shoji went out with Nana,

292
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:24,763
he would often come to our place
to get drunk and complain about her.

293
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:29,413
"Nana doesn't love me for who I am.
She only loves the me that loves her."

294
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,573
"You're right!" I thought,
and I sympathized with him.

295
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,083
Well, although that likely
wasn't Nana's intention,

296
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:38,423
that's how it looked like to others.

297
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,093
So when she found out that
he was cheating on her

298
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,623
and she was quick to discard him,
saying she no longer wanted him,

299
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,683
that must've been
a big blow to Shoji.

300
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:46,733
It was the type of shock
where he's thinking,

301
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,263
"so that was the truth all along."

302
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,833
But Nana's actions were more
because she doesn't take pain well,

303
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:54,843
and so when she gets hurt,
the first thing she does is try to escape.

304
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:56,643
I think you're right.

305
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:58,703
She'll quickly run away,
and quickly put a lid on it.

306
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,833
She tries not to face her partner.

307
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,483
There's always that thing about her
that makes her seem like

308
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,673
she's having a conversation with herself,
even when she's talking to someone else.

309
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:10,853
But lately she no longer comes crying
to you like she used to.

310
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,653
Maybe she is able to face
her partner now.

311
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,123
Let's hope that's the case.

312
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,523
So if and when Nobu cheats on her,

313
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:20,323
I sure hope she shows enough passion
to go crying to him and not let him go.

314
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:22,893
Then if I cheat on you,

315
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,063
will you come crying to me
and not let me go?

316
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:27,003
No, I'll beat you to death.

317
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:28,773
I'm relieved, Junko.

318
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:29,073
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR US
I'm relieved, Junko.

319
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:29,103
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR US

320
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,113
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR US
Why?

321
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:30,573
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR US

322
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,673
It's all about how you
express your feelings, right?

323
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,043
NANA

324
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:39,413
This is the call center.

325
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:42,583
Please call again without withholding
your phone number.

326
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:47,153
So she suddenly doesn't accept calls
from unidentified numbers! Why?!

327
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,123
"I hate Takumi."

328
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,353
Ren, the next page.

329
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,053
Welcome back, Ren!
I have some big news!

330
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,363
Nobuo and Hachiko are together!

331
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,663
Huh? Then she's going out
with two guys?

332
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,233
Way to go, Hachiko.

333
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,273
What are you saying?

334
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,313
There's no way Hachiko could
manage two guys at once.

335
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:04,943
She broke up with Takumi, right?

336
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,743
Really? Well, she has good reason
to dump that guy.

337
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,473
All he thinks about is sex.

338
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:11,513
The same with you!

339
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,383
Just call her without hiding your number.

340
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,313
She'll just know even more not
to pick up if she knows it's me.

341
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:16,083
Oh, right.

342
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:18,783
Hachiko? I thought you two broke up.

343
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:21,553
Not really.
She's just pissed off at me.

344
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,223
By the way, where the hell
is the crew?

345
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,383
They're late!
What do they take us for?!

346
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:27,863
Takumi. We still have 10 minutes.

347
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:28,503
I'M STAYING OUT OF THIS
Takumi. We still have 10 minutes.

348
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,193
I'M STAYING OUT OF THIS

349
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,343
Stop reading erotic comics.

350
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:37,243
THINKING ABOUT SEX?
Stop reading erotic comics.

351
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:37,513
THINKING ABOUT SEX?

352
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:37,813
THINKING ABOUT SEX?
I just happened to be reading
that scene!

353
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,173
I just happened to be reading
that scene!

354
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,973
Is Hachiko not enough to satisfy you?

355
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:43,233
No, I am more than satisfied.

356
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:44,113
Is she that good?!

357
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,153
IN WHAT WAY?!
Is she that good?!

358
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:45,313
IN WHAT WAY?!

359
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:46,253
IN WHAT WAY?!
When I talk to you, I don't feel like
I'm talking to a woman.

360
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:47,943
When I talk to you, I don't feel like
I'm talking to a woman.

361
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,113
But I'm glad, Nobuo.

362
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,693
You succeeded in making Hachiko yours.

363
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,093
I am very grateful to you.

364
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:53,953
Huh?

365
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:57,583
I know that you were rooting for me.

366
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,163
I got this really warm feeling
of friendship from you.

367
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,763
So annoying.
It wasn't for your sake.

368
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,293
Of course! It was for Hachi then!

369
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,133
You thought that, of all people,
I could make Hachiko happy, right?

370
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,503
I sure will make her happy!

371
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,073
It's not like that.

372
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:15,543
I hate to say this, but I just used you.

373
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,073
As a way to get revenge against Takumi?

374
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:19,543
- It's not that.
- Then what?

375
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:24,453
So that Hachiko can run freely
without a leash in my yard.

376
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,053
So, keep an eye on her

377
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,423
so that she doesn't ever escape
to some other place.

378
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:35,693
Nobu!

379
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:37,663
Nana!

380
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:49,533
I guess a person's true nature
will never change.

381
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,253
She's still the same girl with
the same warped way of thinking.

382
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:55,773
I'd thought she became
softer because of Ren.

383
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:58,623
But Nana's desire to possess
is abnormally strong.

384
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,663
Even with regards to Ren.

385
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:02,923
I mean, with that padlock and all.

386
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:05,223
Huh? But that's because
she's a fan of Sid Vicious.

387
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,193
It's just a copy of that.
It's nothing more.

388
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,763
I think there is.

389
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,603
And she's even got a tattoo

390
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,403
that's a symbol of Ren's name
on her body.

391
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,403
No matter how much
she loves him,

392
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,273
don't you find that scary for her
to go that far?

393
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:19,003
And then for Ren to gladly accept that

394
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:22,413
and continue wearing that
for two years after they broke up?

395
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:25,003
I find him quite eccentric, as well.

396
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:28,383
But Hachi talks of them
as the ideal couple.

397
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:31,213
Perhaps I'm the one who has
a warped way of thinking.

398
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,093
So you're saying
Nana's met her soul mate?

399
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,623
Oh, I love such stories.

400
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,423
Keiko? Oh boy.
She can be a real sadist.

401
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:43,863
Huh?! Real sadist?!

402
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,973
I won't be coming back tonight.
Why not have Hachi come over again?

403
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:50,673
I am really happy that you
and Hachi are together.

404
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:53,743
But weren't you supporting us

405
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,673
because you wanted to keep her
in your yard as your pet?

406
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,143
You talked of me getting her back
as if she were a dog.

407
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,383
But you're wrong.
I just wanted you to show me the answer.

408
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:03,993
The answer?

409
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:06,183
"Men and women are
simply opposing creatures"

410
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:07,593
"driven toward each other by lust."

411
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:07,623
BY NOBU
"driven toward each other by lust."

412
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:07,723
BY NOBU

413
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,533
BY NOBU
"Can they be connected by love?"

414
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:11,823
But you two connected, didn't you?

415
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,793
Well, you're already having sex,

416
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,633
but that's natural between
two people that love each other.

417
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,463
So love does tie you together, right?

418
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,933
Try it yourself if you wanna find out.

419
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,443
It's impossible for me.

420
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,153
We will first have them
sign a temporary contract,

421
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,313
and once details of their first CD release
have been determined,

422
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,043
we'll switch to an official contract.

423
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:41,553
I will do my best to make sure we switch
to the official contract right away,

424
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,323
but it doesn't always go as I wish...

425
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:45,093
Never mind the details.

426
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,463
Anyway, I just need to put
my signature and seal

427
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,193
on this temporary contract, right?

428
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,173
Yes, well...

429
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,673
I entrust him to you.

430
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,473
Still, I'm a little worried about
the world of show business.

431
00:18:57,543 --> 00:18:59,563
I have children too,

432
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,303
so I understand your worries
about your precious son...

433
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,613
No, that's not it.

434
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:05,513
With show business,

435
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,383
the media tries to dig up everything
about a person's private life, right?

436
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:09,983
I don't want anything happening

437
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,423
that'll end up affecting
my elder son and me.

438
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:20,733
Well, we thought it best to keep
his real name and profile a secret,

439
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,393
and try to say he's eighteen.

440
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:25,633
That would be...

441
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:26,673
You can do anything you wish

442
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,533
as long as you keep
his true identity a secret.

443
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:31,273
I don't want the world to know
about the embarrassment of my family.

444
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:34,943
Also, could you mail me
the official contract?

445
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:39,043
I can't be wasting time
on something like this.

446
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:40,783
OKAZAKI

447
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,213
Now, if you'll excuse me...

448
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:43,423
Mr. Okazaki.

449
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,923
He may not be your flesh and blood,

450
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:49,013
but you did raise that child
for fifteen years.

451
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,493
Don't you have any feelings
of love for that child?

452
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:57,733
Unfortunately, I have never felt love
for Shinichi.

453
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,333
Not even once.

454
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:02,233
Although I tried my best.

455
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,313
Miss Hachiko,
we're almost out of paint.

456
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:17,883
Is it okay if I open a new one?

457
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:18,613
Sure.

458
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:21,513
Sorry for having you help
with this, Misato.

459
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,723
No, this is a lotta fun.

460
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,893
Painting the walls white makes
the whole room brighter. This is great.

461
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,063
All I wanna do is seal off my memories.

462
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:38,433
Why do I feel like some criminal
destroying evidence?

463
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:44,503
Am I still making another one
of my mistakes?

464
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:51,523
Hey, Nana...

465
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:56,923
Mistakes we made and the scars we have
aren't something that will disappear

466
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,223
by simply covering them up.

467
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:01,893
So I'm still calling your name, Nana.

468
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:06,533
No matter how much it hurts...
until you answer me.

469
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:13,433
I reached into the sky

470
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:19,953
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

471
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:25,323
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

472
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:31,323
Like colorful balloons

473
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,433
I'm alone

474
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:37,163
My hand had no place to go

475
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:43,793
And gently you took it

476
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:44,973
Starless night

477
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:49,173
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

478
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:54,973
I want to feel your warmth

479
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,853
Tears are falling down

480
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,953
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

481
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:07,453
Of your hand holding mine
