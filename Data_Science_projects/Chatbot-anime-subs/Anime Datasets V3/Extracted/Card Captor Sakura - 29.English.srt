1
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:09,335
What a nice aroma…

2
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,755
So let’s see if we did it right.

3
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:23,926
Yes, it’s just the right texture.

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,225
Let’s wait until it cools down,
then continue with next part.

5
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:31,195
OK!

6
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,930
Touya hasn’t come home yet, has he?

7
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:39,572
Um, um, I’ll go have a look!

8
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:44,837
Kero!

[Sakura’s Sweeeeeet Cooking]

10
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:56,986
What’s with coming back
with nothing but books about cakes?

11
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,792
We’re making cakes in Home Ec this week.

12
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,466
Now that Dad taught me a thing or two,
I want to learn more.

13
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:07,803
Making cakes at school? How nice!

14
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,773
If it’s any good, I’ll bring
some back for you, OK?

15
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:14,575
Sakura?

16
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:18,172
Anything wrong?

17
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,413
Nothing at all! I’ll be right there!

18
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,264
Here, you try it.

19
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:42,468
Yes.

20
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:47,274
Now what?

21
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,341
Don’t worry, it’s just practice.

22
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:03,526
It’s so big, we can’t just
eat it by ourselves, right?

23
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,389
Why don’t you take some to
your friends at school?

24
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,024
Sure, I’ll do that!

25
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:12,434
We’ll ask Touya, maybe Yukito
would like some tomorrow, too.

26
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,703
Yukito.

27
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,073
It’d be nice if I could make
one as good as yours, Dad…

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,549
I’m sure you’ll do fine.

29
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:29,783
So what’s the best way to
make a cake like this?

30
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:35,216
Make it with all your heart
…for the one you love.

31
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:39,157
The one you love…

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,597
Oh, please… It’s too embarrassing…

33
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,129
Sakura,

34
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,602
this cake tastes really good!

35
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,606
I had some failures before
making this one.

36
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,316
If you make one that tastes good,
anyone would want to eat it, right?

37
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,154
I wonder if we can make a good one today.

38
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:08,957
You’ll do fine.

39
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:13,024
You and Chiharu have Rika
in your group.

40
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:17,331
That’s right.
You’re really good at making cakes, Rika!

41
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,594
Oh, I’m not that good…

42
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,875
Would custard be alright?

43
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:30,043
It should be easy.

44
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,042
That’s right.

45
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,011
Hey, look, Shao Lan!
What about this kind of cake?

46
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,751
That’s a wedding cake, isn’t it?

47
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:41,120
Yep! With this kind of cake,

48
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,224
you and I together…

49
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,393
Would custard be alright?

50
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:51,664
Should be easy.

51
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,728
How about a strawberry shortcake?

52
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,434
I love those!

53
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,835
So our group has decided to make
a strawberry shortcake, right?

54
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:02,678
I can’t decide on what
kind of cake to make.

55
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:07,407
Chocolate cake…

56
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:08,910
Hey, that looks tasty.

57
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,414
Miss Mizuki!

58
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:14,782
Kinomoto,

59
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,352
do you like chocolate cakes, too?

60
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:17,523
I love them!

61
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:21,126
Me, too. You’re preparing
for Home Economics, right?

62
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,659
Yep! We’re making cakes
during tomorrow’s class.

63
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:26,894
Do your best.

64
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:30,633
I will! Oh, if it turns out alright,
I’ll bring you a piece.

65
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:33,103
That’ll be great! I’ll be
looking forward to it.

66
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,483
So we’re making chocolate cake?

67
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,080
Yep! That’s it!

68
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,651
Strange?

69
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,095
Eh!

70
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,206
Li-kun!

71
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,245
Studying cakes?

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,878
S… something like that…

73
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,047
What kind of cake is your group making?

74
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,053
Custard cream.

75
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,319
We’re making chocolate. Good luck!

76
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,123
Umm…

77
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:25,658
Yes.

78
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,592
Yukito!

79
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,493
Sakura, are you all here
to buy cakes, too?

80
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,963
No, tomorrow we’re
making cakes in Home Ec.

81
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:35,697
You came to study, huh?

82
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,273
You bought a lot!

83
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,042
Yes, these cakes are really good!

84
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:44,172
Really?

85
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:49,509
Um, Yukito, what kind
of cake do you like?

86
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:57,427
Let me see… Cheesecake, shortcake,
blueberry, banana cream pie…

87
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,423
I like all kinds of cakes!

88
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:02,995
What about chocolate?

89
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,258
Custard cream?

90
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:05,927
I love ‘em both!

91
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:11,600
Um, if it turns out all right,

92
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,000
would you like to have some?

93
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,337
Of course!
I’ll be looking forward to it.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,374
Great!

95
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,782
Why?!

96
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:03,951
I’m home.

97
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,260
Mei Lin, what happened?

98
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,857
Nothing at all…

99
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,061
There’s no way it’s nothing at all.

100
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:14,630
Nothing at all…

101
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,173
Let me see.

102
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,072
I just thought I’d surprise you

103
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,573
with a cake when you got home…

104
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,475
You surprised me.

105
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,148
Alright then!

106
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,215
Go back in the kitchen
and do it yourself!

107
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,720
Mei Lin, don’t get mad! Clean up!

108
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,306
Tomoyo, shall we switch?

109
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,246
Yes, thank you.

110
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:07,654
What’s wrong?

111
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:11,727
Tired? I’ll help you out.

112
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,692
T… that’s a little too much…

113
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:22,038
Sorry about that.

114
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:24,668
We can fix it, don’t worry.

115
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,504
Rika, it’s that ok?

116
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:31,310
Yes, repeat three times.

117
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,314
Rika, my arm is dying…

118
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,013
I’ll take over.

119
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,138
Is everyone all right?

120
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,571
After lunch, we’ll take
them out of the ovens, okay?

121
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:03,144
Alright!

122
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,168
But, Rika, you’re actually
quite good at making cakes, aren’t you?

123
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,897
My dad likes sweets,
so I make them fairly often.

124
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,469
Rika, your father is always
overseas for work, isn’t he?

125
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:38,604
Yes.
My dad really likes strawberry shortcake.

126
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:40,774
Just like Mister Terada.

127
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,544
Yes, I’ve always thought

128
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,049
Mister Terada was like my dad…

129
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,628
Since he likes cake, after it’s done,

130
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,156
you could take some to him.

131
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:57,398
That’s right!
Your cakes are always so delicious!

132
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,201
OK.

133
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,302
It turned out well today.

134
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,531
I’m glad.

135
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,008
Everyone did well today.

136
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,212
Well, let’s sample our work!

137
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:12,908
OK!

138
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,393
Too sweet!

139
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,205
It was REALLY sweet!

140
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,414
You sure you didn’t
just add too much sugar?

141
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:51,078
Tomoyo was careful
about how much she added.

142
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:54,219
Besides, it’s weird that everyone elses
cakes ended up too sweet, too.

143
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:57,090
Everyone makes mistakes…

144
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,289
I wonder if that’s it…

145
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,056
Anyway, since everyone blew it,

146
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,994
we’re doing it over again next week.

147
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,428
You’re pretty enthusiastic about that.

148
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,840
Because…

149
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,665
I’m going to give some to
Yukito and Miss Mizuki!

150
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:16,039
Don’t forget to save some for me…

151
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:39,034
Dinner time.

152
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:40,368
OK!

153
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,979
Chinese cooking I can master,

154
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:52,976
but why can’t I make cakes?

155
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,716
I wonder if I’ll ever make a good cake.

156
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,953
Oh well, I guess that’s one thing
I won’t be able to do.

157
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:05,454
W… what?

158
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,131
The cake failure wasn’t your fault.

159
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:20,438
Shao Lan’s such a nice guy.

160
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:24,842
Alright, better study up so
I can make one for Shao Lan to eat!

161
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,580
I will try my best.

162
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,066
It’d be great if
we could make something like this.

163
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,527
Yes, it would.

164
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,664
This time, we’ll get it right for sure!

165
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,205
Right!

166
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:55,376
Li-kun.

167
00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,107
More research?

168
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,482
Something like that.

169
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,857
About those cakes last time…

170
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,291
Why did they all get so sweet?

171
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,420
What? Didn’t you feel anything?

172
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:15,954
‘Anything?”

173
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,366
Hello there. Shopping?

174
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,465
Yes. You too, Miss Mizuki?

175
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:30,139
Yes, I was thinking I wanted
to eat something sweet.

176
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,573
Really?

177
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,075
Oh yes,

178
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,216
I heard you were going
to do the cakes over again.

179
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:40,719
Do your best.

180
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:42,490
We will!

181
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:46,890
Listen, listen!

182
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:48,260
The cakes another class made
in Home Ec yesterday…

183
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:52,057
They ALL turned out too sweet!

184
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:53,570
What?

185
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:55,502
What happened?

186
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,437
I wonder if something got in there.

187
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,233
Something?

188
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,274
It’s just an idea.

189
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,872
What kind of idea?

190
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:07,714
An idea, you know!

191
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,176
Like maybe someone went inside…

192
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,689
Could a Clow Card be responsible?

193
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:18,391
There!

194
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,724
Exactly 100 grams. No mistake.

195
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,504
Will that be too sweet today?

196
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,686
All these sweets look so good…

197
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,368
Sweet. Too sweet.

198
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,801
Could it be that the cakes
in Sakura’s class…

199
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:18,319
A Clow Card’s…

200
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:20,545
…aura is here.

201
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,991
Hello? Kero?

202
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:28,025
It was probably “Sweet” that

203
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,662
Made all your cakes that way.

204
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,259
“Sweet?”

205
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:35,534
Right. It makes food and
everything into sweets!

206
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:39,200
It loves things that are sweet
to begin with, so that’s why
it picked the cakes!

207
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,735
Anyway, it doesn’t cause much trouble.

208
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:45,272
Yes, it does! If the cakes turn out
too sweet again, that’ll be terrible!

209
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:49,450
Li-kun.

210
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,748
It really was the aura of a Clow Card.

211
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,089
Right.

212
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,031
It’s somewhere in this classroom.

213
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,633
We have to find it
before everyone comes back.

214
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,341
That’s…!

215
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:16,978
It’s doing something to the cake.

216
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:23,942
Close the doors!

217
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:25,513
Yes.

218
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,022
Stop that! You’re scaring it!

219
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:40,700
Li-kun…

220
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,398
Sweet!

221
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,177
What the…?

222
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:54,609
It’s chocolate!

223
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,253
This isn’t the time to be impressed!

224
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:11,798
What’re you doing?

225
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:14,094
I’ll trap it in here.

226
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:15,571
You can’t do that!

227
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:20,265
This is your group’s cake!

228
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,676
Everyone’ll be coming back soon!

229
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,315
So it loves things that
are sweet to begin with…

230
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,054
Salt? Why so much?

231
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:52,606
It’s running away!

232
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:01,482
Now!

233
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,356
Key which hides the power of darkness…

234
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,525
…reveal thy true form to me.

235
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,290
By the covenant, I, Sakura, command thee.

236
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,425
Release!

237
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:29,505
Return to thy true form,

238
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,775
Clow Card!

239
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:10,916
I think they’ll turn out
alright this time.

240
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,284
Yeah.

241
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:18,322
I wonder if Sakura will
bring back some cake for me…

242
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,223
So, let’s see if we
did it right this time.

243
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,197
Now, let’s eat some and try it out.

244
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:25,865
Let’s eat!

245
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:30,106
Delicious!

246
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:34,243
It really is!

247
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:39,973
Shao Lan! Try some of this cake I made!

248
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,312
You can be the first!

249
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:48,923
Dry!

250
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:50,650
It can’t be…

251
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:55,426
…dry!

252
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,159
You must have stirred
the batter too much.

253
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:07,541
Oh, how nice! Is this really for me?

254
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:09,309
Yes.

255
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,540
So it was a Clow Card’s doing?

256
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:15,881
Yep.

257
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,153
Delicious.

258
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,623
Sasaki, you’re a really good cook.

259
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,193
Oh, not really.

260
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:28,157
No, this cake is very good.

261
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,574
This is really good, Sakura.

262
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,469
Not bad for something a monster made.

263
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,740
Really, it’s good.

264
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,182
Thank you very much!

265
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,346
Good thing, huh?

266
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:53,187
Yes!

267
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,248
I’d eat this every day if I could.

268
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:57,657
Really?

269
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:06,662
Who is it?

270
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:08,104
It’s Mei Lin.

271
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,400
Wait, Shao Lan!

272
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,703
Let’s hurry home and make a cake!

273
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,610
I figured it out.
This time I’ll get it right!

274
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,606
It has to do with the stirring, right?

275
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,947
I stirred it too much last time,

276
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,455
so I just need to tone that down, right?

277
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:30,157
Hey, are you listening, Shao Lan?
