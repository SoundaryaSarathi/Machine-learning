1
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,513
Every weekday's tightly packed.

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,177
Madly dashing around
again since morning.

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:25,519
"Rat race?" "Looks like fun."
But surprisingly death-defying.

4
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,663
What I'd like is a slow lifestyle.

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,063
My wish made on a shootin' star.

6
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,803
But there's no mercy, 100÷3.

7
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,172
Full of things you can't divide.

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,231
Full of things you can't divide.
Genshiken

9
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:47,371
That's why I've carried
this in my hands...

10
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,507
...a limitless dream!

11
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:57,182
I jam-packed the "rest" with it...

12
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,091
...or at least I've tried to!

13
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:09,260
A modest happiness.
A shared joy!

14
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:16,241
We're about to etch them now
right into our youth.

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,642
So lonely to just walk on by.

16
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,204
So sad to have this frustration!

17
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:27,854
Let's take a break from today...

18
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:33,486
...and break into song!

19
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,067
Shiioh University

20
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,203
Shiioh University

21
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:43,770
Shiioh University
Hey there, Ogiue.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,794
Hey there, Ogiue.

23
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,567
Uh, hi...

24
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,674
Come eat with us.

25
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,638
Are you sure?

26
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,807
Positive.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,774
Have a seat.

28
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,413
Huh? You wear contacts?

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,552
Yes, well, since this spring.

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,883
How's your eyesight?

31
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,189
Somewhere around 20l200.

32
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,688
Huh. So because you got into a
Tokyo school, you changed your look.

33
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,362
You go, girl.

34
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,397
It isn't that big a deal.

35
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,399
Well, you should've also done
something about your hair.

36
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,369
It's cute though.

37
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,170
I did change it, actually...

38
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,470
I once up and gave myself a
perm. I looked way too old.

39
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,579
Hmm, what could it be?
Your clothes, maybe?

40
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,578
Huh?

41
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,546
My switch just flipped.

42
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,381
The retail clerk switch!

43
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,589
That's the one.

44
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,150
Today, the direct approach:
"Stand up for a second, miss."

45
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,491
Hmm, it's not your size.
Is this men's clothing?

46
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,761
Uh, this is... on purpose.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,167
I understand wanting to hide your
figure, but this's a little otaku-ish.

48
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,768
That's a little rude, you know?

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,938
But it's true.

50
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,917
Hmm, well, maybe it does look
bad, being the wrong size.

51
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,620
Although it used to be in style to barely
see your hands through your sleeves.

52
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,485
You went to the trouble of coming
to Tokyo. Why not do a little more?

53
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,764
You shouldn't treat
people like such hicks!

54
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,700
It might be less a hick thing and
more an overly self-conscious thing.

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,929
You're only making it worse, Saki.

56
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,802
Sorry, was I blunt?

57
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,169
Too blunt.

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,843
But hey, this is how I
get when I see people...

59
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,971
...who could do better or
who kinda miss the mark.

60
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,346
Hi!

61
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,608
Sorry.

62
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,814
This is just how Saki is.

63
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,784
Episode 14
I Am from the Planet Otaku

64
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,899
Like I said, those friends were
mundanes! I was being considerate.

65
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,371
That's a lie.

66
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,008
Ogiue was there too.

67
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,738
Like I could butt into a
conversation between girls!

68
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,939
Oh really. Then you admit
you averted your eyes.

69
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:08,878
Hey...

70
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,918
That's what they call ignoring,
you know. Ig-nor-ing!

71
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,748
I even waved to you.

72
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,483
Fine then, I was ignoring you!
But even if I spoke up...

73
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,492
...you'd probably make some
really annoyed face at me!

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,360
No, I wouldn't! First off, we
were talking about otaku fashion...

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,865
...so I wanted you to come over!

76
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,832
No thanks!

77
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,797
Um...

78
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,564
You know, everyone's already
aware that my boyfriend's an otaku.

79
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,332
And they know I frequent Genshiken!

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,907
Do not let it go to your head.

81
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,378
No amount of time will
make you an otaku...

82
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,349
...which proves you
are from another planet.

83
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,441
Shut up.

84
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,017
Someday you will break up with Kohsaka.

85
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,516
You piss me off, otaku!

86
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,389
I am from the planet Otaku.

87
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,627
I come in peace.

88
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,857
I come in peace.
Otaku, otaku, otaku, otaku, otaku!

89
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,766
Your glasses.

90
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,268
They're square!

91
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,667
You only just noticed?

92
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,843
S-square!

93
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,645
So, what? You're
suddenly trying for style?

94
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:26,050
Well, it was a change, and I was
starting to need a new prescription.

95
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,381
Do they suck?

96
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:32,087
Huh? They don't suck... but it's like...

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,965
Your laughing suggests they suck.

98
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,605
It's your clothes. I was
talking about it with Ogiue too.

99
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,435
Oh, right.

100
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,973
Do none of you care?

101
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,544
That's what they call
otaku fashion, huh?

102
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,779
Are you cool with hearing that?

103
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,913
Does it not make any difference?

104
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,443
Well, it's like, no, I don't care.
And I have no taste for it.

105
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,918
Not to mention money.

106
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,983
Suddenly you get defensive?
Does it sting that badly?

107
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,720
An otaku accepts no
challenge he can't win.

108
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:09,027
About that. Don't you two think it's
more indecent to dress stylishly?

109
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,000
"We don't bother."

110
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,972
"We're hardcore otaku!"

111
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,270
Like a reverse superiority complex...

112
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,835
Easy for you to say.

113
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,771
Yeah.

114
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,346
Kohsaka buys both clothes
and games, and he manages.

115
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,940
Kohsaka's...

116
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,348
True, he has different
substance and taste.

117
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,550
But it's okay even
if you have bad taste.

118
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,553
What's bad is giving up
and being all defiant.

119
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:38,363
You say it's outside your specialty
and don't even try to show interest.

120
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,161
I think that's the
biggest problem with otaku.

121
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,863
Huh?

122
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,700
S-square!

123
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,968
Just can't get past that, huh?

124
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,148
What am I doing in a place like this?

125
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,156
Well, I wanted a new
jacket and pants at least.

126
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,086
That's all this is.

127
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,958
I've never been in a store like that.

128
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,073
I tend to set ¥2,000 as an upper
limit and shop at cheap stores.

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,973
But I guess that's a mental block.

130
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,578
Expand your horizons some.

131
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,107
You know, I didn't even look at prices.

132
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,806
It was all I could do to even go in.

133
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,485
Pathetic...

134
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,058
One more time!

135
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,701
This time I'm looking at prices!

136
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,928
So laughable.

137
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,742
That's expensive,
Kasukabe! I could never!

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,988
DVD box sets go for this much...

139
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,515
...but why should a single piece
of clothing need this kind of price!

140
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,320
I can't buy anything expensive
anyway, so I'll go for all-out cheap!

141
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,799
What's bad is giving up
and being all defiant.

142
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,329
No, stop that. Don't panic.

143
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,301
No need to buy anything
exorbitant. Just something so-so.

144
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,238
I'll think about tops again
later. Right now, bottoms!

145
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,972
Where're pants...

146
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,537
Are you looking for anything?

147
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,610
Pa...

148
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,183
No! Not pants...

149
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,777
Uh, uh, underwear.

150
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:47,910
Aw, dammit!

151
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,985
On the second floor.

152
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,355
Th-thanks.

153
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,899
Forget it.

154
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,691
I lose. Total loss. But I guess I tried.

155
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,937
I don't think I've
compared this many prices...

156
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,236
...since dojin shops
during middle school.

157
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,840
Wait. That's right. I'm
shopping the wrong way!

158
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,883
Just comparing prices is meaningless.

159
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,855
The fun level of a game isn't
proportional to its price!

160
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,759
I'll draw my own conclusions!

161
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,191
If I think, "This is nice,"
I'll shell out for it.

162
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,767
I take pride in the things I've chosen.

163
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,896
Adult games, dojinshi,
clothes, it's all the same!

164
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,371
After all, that's what makes me, me!

165
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,904
Excuse me!

166
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,611
That's what it's all about, Kasukabe!

167
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,348
Not-even-close!

168
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,685
...is what she'll probably say.

169
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,958
Genshiken

170
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,893
Shinjuku Station

171
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,399
Hi, Kasukabe!

172
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,408
Uh, who's he?

173
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,052
A friend of my boyfriend's.

174
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,145
A friend of my boyfriend's.
Ahh, an otaku. I can tell.

175
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,020
What the hell. I knew
she'd just get annoyed.

176
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,958
Just like I said in the first place!

177
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,359
Oh. On your way home, Madarame?

178
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,661
Uh, yeah, I am.

179
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,699
Good timing then.

180
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,858
That's true.

181
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,935
We'll see you later then.

182
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,769
Then I'm headed home too.

183
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,840
Wha!

184
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,099
You are?

185
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,978
They've got things to do.

186
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,070
Oh...

187
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,205
What? Do you have plans?

188
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,805
No, no, I don't.

189
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,776
Weren't we having a fight?

190
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,715
Huh?

191
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:04,815
Huh?

192
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,126
You call that a fight!

193
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:07,751
You call that a fight!
Huh?

194
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,954
"Weren't we having a fight?"
Talk about overly self-conscious!

195
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,124
That's so otaku!

196
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,863
Okay, I get it now.

197
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,129
So, want to get some food?

198
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,705
Huh? Wh-why?

199
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,444
To "make up," of course.
I'm hungry, anyway.

200
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,111
Or will you say something otaku like, "I can't eat
with a friend's girlfriend."

201
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,085
Kaiten Sushigen

202
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,224
What?

203
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,451
Are you still mad? You could
at least enjoy some food.

204
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,163
You really do seem to
be from another planet.

205
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,794
Me otaku. No understand you.

206
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,332
That again?

207
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,933
Kohsaka's not going to mind
this, should he find out.

208
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,271
That's because he's from
another galaxy altogether.

209
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,777
How are we handling the bill?

210
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,041
Will we each take one?

211
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,216
Fatty tuna, please.

212
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,649
Fatty tuna, please.
You got it!

213
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,215
Apparently we're not.

214
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,183
Here's your fatty tuna.

215
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,195
Where are your new glasses?

216
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,091
Eh?

217
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,829
You paid money for them.

218
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,757
Oh, those...

219
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,804
Weren't they supposed
to go with all that?

220
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,533
I just figured it was
time to buy new stuff.

221
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,874
Sea urchin and steamed abalone, please.

222
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,310
What is it? Shirts?

223
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,345
Several things.

224
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,776
Wear them in the clubroom.

225
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,978
Won't you just trash talk them?

226
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,578
Of course.

227
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,792
But the thoughtless stuff you're
wearing now is unspeakable.

228
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,862
It's not even worth a comment.

229
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,365
Geez, you're harsh.

230
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,235
The day you put some thought
into choosing what you wear...

231
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,794
...is the day I grant
you a fair appraisal.

232
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,071
Grant me a fair appraisal, huh?

233
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,309
Want me to order anything for you?

234
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,075
No thanks, I wasted too much money.
I can't spend any on food now.

235
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,207
Here's your steamed abalone.

236
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:17,320
"Wasted money." I've never
heard you say that before.

237
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,920
When you're from the planet Otaku...

238
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,018
...everything but otaku
materials is a waste of funds.

239
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,422
Again? You keep coming
back to that otaku thing.

240
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,034
It doesn't really mean you're an alien.

241
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,603
That doesn't sound like you.

242
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,963
Don't you loathe otaku?

243
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:40,605
Lest you forget, I'm dating
Kohsaka. That Kohsaka!

244
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,115
Like it or not, I get used to otaku.

245
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,083
Like it or not, I get used to otaku.
I'm guessing not.

246
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,585
I've been making efforts lately too.

247
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,280
Oh? What kind?

248
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,282
Like keeping my distance
when it's anime and game time.

249
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,550
Isn't that you being neglected?

250
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,490
Shut up.

251
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,999
Oh, but the other day I
played a game with him some.

252
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,667
Well, how about that?

253
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,945
There's this prince guy.

254
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,945
Prince?

255
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,182
You roll this thing, and
it picks up other things.

256
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,548
Ahh, didn't part two come out recently?

257
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:24,247
Got me. But it's like, simple and
fun so I played for about an hour.

258
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,084
Wow... Uh, I mean...

259
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,653
Huh? This's quite a shock.

260
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,966
Uh, but in the end, I'm not
sure I wanted you to do that.

261
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,194
Huh? Why not?

262
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,538
Well, I'm totally cool
with you dating Kohsaka.

263
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,907
But it's like... I wanted
you to walk a thorny path.

264
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,409
That's creepy.

265
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,501
Aha.

266
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,205
Excuse me, sea bream, please.

267
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:54,381
To be honest, I'd just as soon
you were from another planet.

268
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:54,976
Huh?

269
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,321
What was that?

270
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,550
A little wish.

271
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,392
Looks like I'm the
one on the thorny path.

272
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,070
Ow, hot!

273
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,238
Well, what to say.

274
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,077
Here's your sea bream!

275
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,477
Shinjuku Station

276
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,312
Care to sit?

277
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,040
Huh?

278
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,114
I'm fine. You take it.

279
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,378
Ain't it indecent for
a man to sit down first?

280
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,285
Huh?

281
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,681
You're speaking otaku again.

282
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,220
Okay, then I will...

283
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,408
Well, there are no rude drunks around.

284
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:28,776
And she's more likely to take care
of things herself than ask for help.

285
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,579
Beautiful muscles

286
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,322
Welcome back.

287
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,260
Hi there.

288
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,085
So you had sushi?

289
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,096
Uh, yeah, we did.

290
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,563
I could've gone for that.

291
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:25,035
You said you were gaming all day.
Could you've made it to Shinjuku?

292
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,104
Guess not.

293
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,104
Did the new "Menma-chan" come out?

294
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,838
Oh, I didn't have time to check.

295
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,710
Oh, okay.

296
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,082
I'm going to Akihabara Saturday.
Want me to pick it up?

297
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,310
Would you mind?

298
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,515
Sure thing. M'kay, take it easy.

299
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,126
What should we do tonight?

300
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,391
Can I sleep at your place?

301
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,689
That'd be fine.

302
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,454
Okay!

303
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,561
Huh. That's not bad, is it?

304
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,730
¥18,000! Just for pants!

305
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,564
I never buy clothes above ¥3,000!

306
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,735
Even Kasukabe may
give her okay on these.

307
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,934
Uhh, but Saki's apparently fine with
spending about 100,000 at a time.

308
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,546
I see someone getting hit very hard!

309
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,874
Wait, that's me!

310
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,646
It doesn't really matter.
I just bought what I wanted to buy.

311
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,588
She who ridicules otaku is otaku.

312
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,162
Well said! What a great thing to say!

313
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,231
What's up?

314
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,423
She's here!

315
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,798
Welcome, crew of the Yamato.

316
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:13,842
Wow.

317
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,977
Nice. Looks good on you.

318
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,772
Yeah, I win!

319
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,678
Win what? That's so exaggerated.

320
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,811
Hey, well.

321
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,924
Are you a little surprised?

322
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,385
A little more open than expected, huh?

323
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,859
Not happy!

324
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,821
Well, you were so down on me before.

325
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,992
Aw, come on. You're thin,
but your shoulders are broad.

326
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,795
That look's in these days.

327
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,009
Aha. Maybe I'll buy something too.

328
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,569
There are sales next
month if you do it soon.

329
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,372
No, now is no time for us
to be following fashions!

330
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,764
Oh, do you need one too?

331
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,629
Oh, do you need one too?
You screwed up!

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,831
You didn't have to buy that!

333
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,662
Huh?

334
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:12,971
But...

335
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,667
At least change your hairstyle!

336
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,658
Oh, the Akihabara custom outfit.

337
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,751
Ta-da!

338
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,521
Now let's get going!

339
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,562
I-it's kinda sad how
it's not Ch-Char custom.

340
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:06,554
We took no detours or shortcuts...

341
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:16,997
...and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...

342
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:25,340
...as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.

343
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:35,442
Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.

344
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:45,330
We were simple
when we were young...

345
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:57,775
...with our endlessly
glistening marbles.

346
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:02,473
The time we spied from there...

347
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,143
...sparkled, even if
nothing big happened.

348
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,653
What is seen from the marbles...

349
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:17,423
...in our hands now is a little different...

350
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:26,097
...but they shine faintly nearby.

351
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,042
Preview

352
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,210
Preview

353
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,474
Preview
What's the worst meal you've had?

354
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,808
Like M-McDonald's?

355
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,645
I think that's pretty decent, actually.

356
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,447
Things like street-stall
udon or school rice balls.

357
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,454
Ah, those individually-packaged ones.

358
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,858
I know someone who put soy sauce on
tissues, toasted them, and ate them.

359
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,093
What? Is that good?

360
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,889
What? Is that good?
Dunno.

361
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,621
Can't you guys cook?

362
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,719
N-no.

363
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,788
I can boil water, at least.

364
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,163
Hey, Madarame. What's your shabby meal?

365
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,102
Shabby meal?

366
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,693
Shabby meal?
Right.

367
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,937
Episode 15
Then I'll Undress You! I don't eat them.

368
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,905
Episode 15
Then I'll Undress You! I don't eat them!
