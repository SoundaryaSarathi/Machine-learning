Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.10,0:07:13.39,main,,0000,0000,0000,,So for this, how about we say they aren't panties, but some kind of survival gear instead?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.39,0:07:20.33,main,,0000,0000,0000,,And lastly, for the credits, could you use "Super Original Work" instead of just "Original Work"?
