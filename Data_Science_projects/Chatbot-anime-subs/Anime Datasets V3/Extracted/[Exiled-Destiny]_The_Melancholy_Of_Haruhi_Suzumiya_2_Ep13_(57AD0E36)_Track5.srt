1
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,749
We're here.

2
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,349
Keep out

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,719
Keep out
Doesn't this mean that
we shouldn't go in?

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,889
Even a grade school kid wouldn't
choose this place for a shoot.

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,279
Not counting the really
crazy ones.

6
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:28,689
What are you guys doing?
Hurry up and climb over.

7
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:31,559
I forgot that she's
really crazy.

8
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:33,199
Hurry up, Mikuru.

9
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:41,079
This fence is a bit tall
to climb over.

10
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,139
Don't you think so?

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,349
Huh, I guess it was
pretty old.

12
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,079
Are we supposed to be playing
kappa or something?

13
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,019
This lake didn't have a fence
around it a long time ago.

14
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,529
People used to
fall in a lot.

15
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,029
Thank God they're
all so easy-going.

16
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:09,669
This scene is one where Mikuru is finally
backed into a sticky situation.

17
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,709
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya IV
This scene is one where Mikuru is finally
backed into a sticky situation.

18
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,069
This scene is one where Mikuru is finally
backed into a sticky situation.

19
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,069
Her blue-eyed beam has been
sealed away by Yuki.

20
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:21,309
Yeah, this looks good.
Here, you hold this.

21
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,439
Mikuru, are you ready?

22
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:26,579
Yes.

23
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,379
- Louder!
- Yes!

24
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,149
You have my sympathy.

25
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,229
Okay, here we go.
Ready...

26
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:34,519
Action!

27
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,729
S-Something like this
won't make me give up!

28
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,999
Y-Yuki, the bad alien...

29
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,869
...leave the Earth now
in a mysterious manner!

30
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:47,869
Cut!

31
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,439
He is of much
precious value.

32
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,679
As part of that, we will first
take over the Earth.

33
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:55,749
Cut!

34
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,249
I-I won't let you do so!
I'm willing to risk my life for this!

35
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,619
Cut!

36
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,849
You're starting to get the hang
of it, aren't you? Keep it up!

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,219
Oh yeah, Mikuru,
come here a second.

38
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,689
Yes?

39
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,769
It'd be best for us
to get out of here

40
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,269
before we become the talk of
the neighborhood, but...

41
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:20,539
So this is what video cameras
are like these days?

42
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,579
Huh... So there's a lot of
goofy footage of Mikuru in here?

43
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,309
It's nothing
to laugh about.

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,179
There's a lot of psychologically
damaging stuff in here.

45
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,379
What'll happen if Miss Asahina
stops coming to school?

46
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,649
We're back!

47
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,779
And now we're going
to get serious about this.

48
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,519
Take a look!

49
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,089
Oh God, what a nightmare.

50
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:46,459
Are we going to repeat what
happened yesterday again?

51
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,699
Okay, Mikuru. Make something
fantastic, it doesn't matter what,

52
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,469
come out of the
Miracle Mikuru Eye R and attack!

53
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,209
M-M-Miss Nagato-

54
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:01,269
Hey, Yuki! You're supposed
to be a witch!

55
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,369
You don't need to do any
pro wrestling here...

56
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,449
Well, I guess this works.
It'll probably get us some more viewers.

57
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,149
Kyon! Be sure to film this!
Yuki came up with this idea, after all!

58
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,559
It's not an idea.

59
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,389
Man, but this is risqué... I mean,
I don't mean to film this at all, but...

60
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,659
Center the target and press the record-
No, I mustn't. I mustn't!

61
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,109
Leave the Earth now!

62
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,939
Oh man, we lost
another contact.

63
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,879
I was careless.

64
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,549
I had made it so that she could
not fire off lasers anymore.

65
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,749
This time it was a high frequency
molecular cutter.

66
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,399
It looks like monofilament.

67
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,159
Umm... this time...
what did you inject into me?

68
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,099
I modulated the phase of your
dimensional vibratory cycle,

69
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,139
and generated a force field
on the surface of your body

70
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,649
capable of transposing
gravitational waves.

71
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,679
I see. So it's been
dealt with for now.

72
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,219
I have no idea what
that means.

73
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,949
As for the fence, the others seem to accept
the idea that it's old and decrepit.

74
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,319
And thankfully nothing
more important got damaged.

75
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,829
But what do we do?

76
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,019
I have the feeling that if we keep shooting,
something tragic is going to happen.

77
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,289
Even so,
we can't stop filming.

78
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,069
What do you think Miss Suzumiya will do
if we try to force a stop to the filming?

79
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,639
Who knows?

80
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,979
I'm sure there will be
some violence.

81
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,609
At the very least, from the
Colossi in closed spaces.

82
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,319
Right now, Miss Suzumiya is having so
much fun that she can't help herself.

83
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,319
After all, she gets to act
like God.

84
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:57,429
Miss Suzumiya is using the medium
of film to recreate a world.

85
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,759
Man, but what
a selfish woman.

86
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:03,339
Of course, Miss Suzumiya
doesn't realize this.

87
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,799
She thinks that she's only creating
a fictional world.

88
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:15,179
But I think that her passion is
subconsciously affecting the real world.

89
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,939
It's just fiction!

90
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,549
Either way, we get
a bad ending.

91
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,989
If we have to choose one over
the other, I would go with continuing.

92
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,159
Even if Miss Asahina
turns into Superwoman?

93
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,989
Compared to a Colossi appearing,
it would be a small price to pay.

94
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,239
Doesn't it seem that it would be
simpler to deal with

95
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,279
a single occurrence of
an abnormal phenomenon

96
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,469
rather than have the whole
world rebuilt from scratch?

97
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,709
It's all about
the same to me.

98
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,989
How about we hit Haruhi
from behind

99
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,579
and keep her unconscious until
the school festival is over?

100
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,689
That's a frightening thought.

101
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,689
Although if you took full responsibility
for it, I wouldn't stop you.

102
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:08,599
The weight of the world weighs
too heavily on my shoulders.

103
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:15,399
I'll be all right. I'll find a way
to deal with it.

104
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,079
I feel so unworthy of
her selflessness.

105
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,479
Normal people who are being
mind-controlled by Yuki, the evil alien

106
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,219
Normal people who are being
mind-controlled by Yuki, the evil alien
These are your roles!

107
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:22,509
These are your roles!

108
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,919
In other words, because Mikuru is a
hero, she can't hurt normal people.

109
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,359
Mikuru Yuki
Normal people

110
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:31,019
Mikuru Yuki
Normal people
Yuki knows this, and uses her magic to
control some normal people to attack her.

111
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,559
And so Mikuru, unable to
defend herself, gets beaten up.

112
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,489
So Mikuru gets
beat up, huh?

113
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,829
First, throw Mikuru
into the lake.

114
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,999
Hold on, into this lake? It might
be warm, but it's still autumn.

115
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,469
And I couldn't call that water clean,
even if I was trying to whitewash it.

116
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:54,639
M-M-Miss Suzumiya, could we
at least use a heated pool or...

117
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,269
This is a
pretty harsh shoot.

118
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:04,349
But Mikuru, in order to get the realism
we're aiming for, we have to pay this price!

119
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:08,219
And this is an obstacle that
you have to overcome, Mikuru!

120
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,159
This is a chance for you to take
a big step up as an actress!

121
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,499
Do you understand?
Now go get ready!

122
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:14,669
Hey!

123
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,999
U-Umm...

124
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,949
I'll do it!

125
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,739
That's great, Mikuru!

126
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,549
And that's why I chose you
to be in the brigade!

127
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,959
Miss Asahina...

128
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,219
One, two... three!

129
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,099
Lord have mercy.

130
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:44,399
What's wrong?
Please hold on to me.
Lord have mercy.

131
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,259
What's wrong?
Please hold on to me.

132
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,299
Good grief.

133
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,999
We have enough useless crap to open
a street shop, but not a single towel?

134
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,879
What's up with that?

135
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,709
Well, I guess this works as
the scene where they meet.

136
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,479
The sense of awkwardness between Itsuki
and Mikuru is pretty apparent.

137
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:09,379
Really? It just seemed like Koizumi
being his usual self to me.

138
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,989
Now it's time
for the next step.

139
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,859
We're going to shoot the scene
where Itsuki, having rescued Mikuru,

140
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,399
takes her back
to his own house.

141
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,699
Hold on. That doesn't
connect at all.

142
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,169
What happened to Nagato
or Taniguchi and the others?

143
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,709
The audience won't believe it
without some sort of explanation.

144
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,639
Oh, be quiet. They'll get it,
even if we don't shoot the scene.

145
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,769
Why you... did you just want to see
Miss Asahina dumped into the lake?

146
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,289
Hey, my house is nearby, and since it
looks like Mikuru might catch a cold,

147
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,689
would it be okay to get her
a change of clothes?

148
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,659
That's perfect!

149
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,689
Can we use
your place, Tsuru?

150
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,159
We can shoot the scene where they
get friendly with each other!

151
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,559
Yeah, that's cool.
Use my place!

152
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,669
What about us?

153
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,069
You can go home.

154
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,739
Good for you,
you've been let go.

155
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,339
It looks like you're about as important
to Haruhi as BBs that have been fired.

156
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,909
But that's a pretty happy
thing to be.

157
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,909
Okay, this is my place.

158
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,619
It's huge.

159
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,049
What kind of evil things do I have to do
to live in a place like this?

160
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,789
Okay, this is my room. Wait here
until Mikuru gets out of the bath.

161
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:27,529
I feel like my bedroom was made
for a cat compared to this.

162
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,799
This is a nice room.
It's a perfect location.

163
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:34,639
Oh, yeah. Tsuru, I just
thought of something...

164
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,619
Sorry to keep you waiting!

165
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,309
Thank you.

166
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,249
I'm sorry I'm late.

167
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,609
Here you go.

168
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:51,859
Thank you very much.

169
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:52,789
Thank you very much.
I'm really being tested
by my reason here.

170
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,659
I'm really being tested
by my reason here.

171
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,759
Miss Asahina, that outfit
is absolutely criminal.

172
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,929
Here you go.
Drink up.

173
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:01,899
Thanks.

174
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,399
Thank you very much.

175
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,479
Seeing her drink is another
direct hit to my libido.

176
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,509
Okay, let's get started.

177
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,769
And so we start shooting.

178
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,839
Koizumi carries Miss Asahina, who is
feigning unconsciousness, into his room.

179
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:20,849
He lays her on the futon which is already
spread out for some reason,

180
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:22,389
and tucks her in.

181
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,249
Mikuru, wake up now.

182
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,489
Are you awake?

183
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,959
Yes, umm... where is this?

184
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,829
This is my room.

185
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,099
Thank you very much.

186
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,499
She seems awfully sexy.
Is that acting?

187
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,169
Bring your faces
closer together, you two!

188
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,009
Mikuru, close your eyes!
Koizumi, put your arm around her!

189
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:50,149
All right, now push her down
and kiss her!

190
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:00,459
Hold on just
a second!

191
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,899
This is going too far
in so many ways.

192
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,959
More importantly, why is this scene
even happening?

193
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,259
What is this?

194
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,059
It's a love scene.

195
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,829
This is what you put in
to fill in time in movies.

196
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:14,499
Are you stupid? What is this,
a two-hour prime time drama?

197
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,309
And Koizumi, why are you
getting all into it?

198
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,839
If we showed this at the school festival,
your shoebox would be stuffed

199
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,539
with hundreds of letters
cursing you the next day.

200
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,079
I'd put one in, too!

201
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:28,219
Mikuru, you're so strange!

202
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:32,089
I'd like to say she's not...
but she is acting strange.

203
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,019
Her eyes look dull
and her cheeks are flushed.

204
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,799
And she looks like she'd let
Koizumi do anything he wants.

205
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,189
This is not funny.

206
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,329
Koisumi... my head
feels heavy...

207
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,799
Geez, has someone slipped her
some kind of drug?

208
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:55,309
I'm sorry! I mixed some
sweet sake into her juice.

209
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,749
I was told that it might open up
her range as an actress.

210
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,719
You shouldn't just slip something
like that into a person's drink.

211
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,059
Why not? Mikuru's so sexy
right now.

212
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,359
Don't mind him, just kiss her.
On the mouth, of course.

213
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,319
Don't do it, Koizumi!

214
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,199
Director, this is a bit much
for me.

215
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,909
And it looks like Miss Asahina's
at her limit.

216
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,609
I'm all wight!

217
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,579
Oh geez.

218
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,919
I can't believe that you're getting
this drunk off of sweet sake.

219
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:41,989
You're the one that
made her drink it.

220
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,049
Come on,
snap out of it.

221
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,369
That reaction's
no good.

222
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:53,929
You need to at least straighten out your
back when you get hit on the head.

223
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,299
Okay, one more time.

224
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,839
Practice.

225
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,149
Cut it out!

226
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,759
How is this practice? How is this
going to be used in the movie?

227
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,749
Hey, don't stop me.

228
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:20,329
There's no need for me to tell
you when this will be used.

229
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,339
You probably haven't even thought of it.
Stop making excuses.

230
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,299
Stop making assumptions.

231
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:32,639
You don't know what's going to be in
the movie, so stop being so selfish!

232
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,649
You're the one being selfish, you're
just hitting her because you want to.

233
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,449
You don't have the right.

234
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:44,959
Shut up. What do you know?
This is a vital part of my movie!

235
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,299
Vital to who? This is stupid.
Miss Asahina is not your toy.

236
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,329
I decided it was!
And Mikuru is my toy!

237
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:14,649
Wha-

238
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,859
What's with you!? What don't
you like about this?

239
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,319
You just have to do
what I tell you!

240
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,059
I'm the brigade leader!
I'm the director!

241
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,999
In any case... I won't allow
any insubordination!

242
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,469
Let me go, Koizumi.

243
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,979
It doesn't matter if it's
a person or an animal.

244
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,949
When they won't listen, you need
to scold them with a good smack.

245
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,079
If I don't, then she'll end up being
a crazy person that everyone avoids.

246
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,449
Prease stop.

247
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,799
You mustn't fight...
if you do...

248
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,829
Oh, this is
classified information...

249
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:14,909
I'm sorry, Kyon.
I got carried away.

250
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,919
Don't worry about Mikuru.

251
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,279
I'll take her home later, or she'll
stay here for the night.

252
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,059
I thought you were
a more rational person.

253
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,529
So did I.

254
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,699
It doesn't look like any
closed spaces have appeared.

255
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,099
It appears that Miss Suzumiya's
subconscious was able to control itself.

256
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,969
Good for you, I'm glad you
had less work to do.

257
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:46,009
By the way, there's a place
I'd like to take you to.

258
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,009
And if I said no?

259
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,909
This won't
take much time.

260
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,289
Do you remember what
Miss Suzumiya said yesterday?

261
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,149
How am I supposed to remember
all of her random comments?

262
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,189
You'll remember when
you see this.

263
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,359
They were already this way
this morning.

264
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,469
Did someone paint them
or something?

265
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,679
There's no mistaking it. These pigeons
all have their natural feathers.

266
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:21,909
I guess they were really scared
by the gunfire yesterday.

267
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,249
Even if that were
the case,

268
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,909
do you think this is what
would actually happen?

269
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,649
Yeah, I know.

270
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,289
I'd love it if these pigeons
were all completely white.

271
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,959
In this case,
I'll let the color slide.

272
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,329
She hasn't let it slide
at all.

273
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,189
This is what I think.

274
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:40,769
I think that Miss Suzumiya
is a special person

275
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,629
that someone has granted
godlike powers to.

276
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:51,069
The fact that Miss Suzumiya is part of
this world of ours is proof of that.

277
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,609
That's surprising.

278
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:58,249
And didn't you say that
"Haruhi is God" or something?

279
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,119
Oh, is that so?

280
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,349
Don't mess with me.

281
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,589
I'm kidding.

282
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,789
Miss Suzumiya is she who
can create the world

283
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,589
and at the same time,
the one who can destroy it.

284
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,029
This reality of ours
might be a failure.

285
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,799
And the one with the job of
fixing this failed world

286
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,039
might just be the one we
call Haruhi Suzumiya.

287
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,399
All right, and?

288
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,169
If that's the case, then we
might be the ones mistaken

289
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,839
about the fact that there is no
proof at all that Miss Suzumiya

290
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,679
has used her powers
up until now.

291
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,009
Hmph. And?

292
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,019
The problem is those of us who
might be mistaken about that.

293
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,259
When the world is remade into its
proper form by Miss Suzumiya,

294
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:46,189
will we still be able to
be part of that world?

295
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:50,159
Or will we be considered bugs
in the system and eliminated?

296
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,499
I don't know.

297
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,339
It's just... I quite like
this world of ours.

298
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,739
From ages past
until modern times,

299
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,779
this world has been built, piece by piece,
by so many different people.

300
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,049
I don't want it
to fall apart.

301
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,449
And that's why I try to do what I can
about Miss Suzumiya.

302
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,819
I wonder if this world
is worth all that.

303
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,989
Oh, I thought that
you felt it was.

304
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:22,729
Which is why you came back from the
closed space, but... was I wrong?

305
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,739
Well, I wonder.

306
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,579
It's not like me
to talk like this.

307
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,319
I'm making it sound like we're
protecting the world. I apologize.

308
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:04,139
It looks like Miss Suzumiya is too busy
feeling dejected to be angry.

309
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,549
Oh, why's that?

310
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:10,539
I thought you would know...
Okay, I'll explain.

311
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:14,279
Miss Suzumiya thought that
no matter what happened,

312
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,919
you would always
be on her side.

313
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,019
That no matter how much
you complained,

314
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,389
you alone would always
forgive her.

315
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,289
The only one that could forgive
her is a martyred saint.

316
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:29,329
Could you say something to
Miss Suzumiya to cheer her up?

317
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,609
If you don't, she might continue
to get depressed,

318
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,869
then something far worse than the
closed spaces might occur.

319
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:42,009
I can't even imagine how the world might
react to a depressed Miss Suzumiya.

320
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:44,479
So you're telling me
to cheer her up?

321
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,949
You just need to get
back with her again.

322
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:51,019
There was never a "with her"
to begin with.

323
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,389
Oh, I thought that your head
had cooled off by now,

324
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,389
but I guess
I was wrong.

325
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,829
The reason I was so angry yesterday
was because my kind heart

326
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:04,839
couldn't bear to watch the cruel things
happening to Miss Asahina.

327
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,629
But that can't be
the only reason.

328
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,439
I might have just been suffering
from a calcium deficiency.

329
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,979
After drinking around a liter of milk
before going to bed,

330
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,279
I was strangely calm.

331
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,219
That might just be
a placebo effect, though.

332
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,279
"Movie," what a joke.
That was a waste of my day.

333
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,719
Now, now.

334
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,519
He wanted to hang out with you
guys and Miss Suzumiya more.

335
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,819
He even canceled
his other plans.

336
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,449
Don't tell him that,
you jerk.

337
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:33,589
In any case.

338
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,239
I'm never going to get involved with
any of those stupid projects anymore.

339
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,069
A movie?
As if.

340
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,299
It'll just end up as garbage.
That's for sure.

341
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,809
You're the last person
I want to hear that from.

342
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,539
Even if he didn't say that,
I could imagine it.

343
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,279
Even so, hearing that
from him pisses me off.

344
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,979
At least Haruhi is doing something
for the school festival.

345
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,959
She's trying to be involved.
But what about you?

346
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,259
Even if it is stupid, at least Haruhi's
trying to make something.

347
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,889
All you're doing is sitting there
and complaining.

348
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,569
Man, that pisses me off.

349
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,299
Now, I wonder why that
pisses me off...

350
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:17,279
Have I suddenly found the passion
to make movies?

351
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,139
What's wrong, Kyon?

352
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,939
Miss Suzumiya seems upset, too...
Did something happen?

353
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,309
Maybe they had
a lovers' spat.

354
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,149
Oh, I see. I'm at Haruhi's beck and call,
even if I grumble about it.

355
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:36,489
What pisses me off,
in other words...

356
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,529
is the fact that there's no difference
between the me who

357
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,689
got pissed off at what Taniguchi said,
and Taniguchi himself.

358
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,799
Dammit.

359
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:47,599
Taniguchi, you bastard. Thanks to you,
I've come to a weird realization.

360
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,509
Dammit... now I have to do something
that I'm sure I'll regret.

361
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,149
Dammit! Dammit!

362
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,319
Hey, Haruhi.

363
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,349
What?

364
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,389
Let's finish this film,
no matter what.

365
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:25,639
Of course. I'm the director,
after all!

366
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,239
It's a given that it'll be finished.
You don't have to tell me that.

367
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,309
Man, but she's straightforward...

368
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,359
Well, if it would be strange to see an
unhappy Haruhi, then this is better.

369
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,719
Here we go!

370
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,159
Wasn't there anything else
you could have said to her?

371
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,329
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:52,439
She's not just back to how she was,
now she's even more powerful.

373
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:53,599
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,939
There's no way we'll be able
to cover this up now.

375
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,809
Oh, but this works out
so well!

376
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,849
I was just thinking that I wanted
a scene with cherry blossoms.

377
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,779
What great timing for
some strange weather!

378
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,449
Okay, now take your
victory pose!

379
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,189
Oh yeah!
Let's get a cat!

380
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,089
A cat?

381
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,629
A witch needs a familiar. And a cat
would be the best fit for that!

382
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,859
Is there a black cat
around here somewhere?

383
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,059
Wasn't Nagato originally
set to be an evil alien?

384
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,639
Never mind that, we need a cat!
That's how it's set in my mind now.

385
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,039
Hey Yuki, do you know anyplace
with lots of cats? Strays are okay.

386
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,659
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

387
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,359
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

388
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,929
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

389
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,169
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

390
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,839
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

391
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,009
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

392
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,549
Tomare!
Stop!

393
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,319
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

394
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,089
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

395
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,219
Nazenara
That's because

396
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:20,459
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

397
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,229
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

398
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,669
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

399
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:30,539
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

400
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,409
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

401
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,109
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

402
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,199
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
