1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,347
Tomoyo-chan, is your leg okay?

2
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:09,482
I just sprained it a little, so…

3
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:10,924
Doesn’t it hurt?

4
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:12,414
Well, now,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,556
but the teacher told me

6
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,261
not to enter the Marathon Competition.

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:18,559
That’s too bad.

8
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:19,755
Yes…

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:22,858
But with this,

10
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:27,503
I’ll be able to take as much video
footage of Sakura running as I like!

11
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:29,641
Last lap!

12
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,635
Okay!

13
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:37,143
[Sakura’s Long Marathon Contest]

14
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,981
Sakura-chan’s really fast, huh?

15
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:46,450
Tomorrow,
Sakura-chan will win

16
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,419
this year’s Marathon
Competiton too.

17
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,189
That won’t happen.

18
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,825
This year’s Marathon
Competition will be

19
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,430
Shao Lan and my one-two finish.

20
00:00:58,072 --> 00:00:59,630
At school in Hong Kong,

21
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:01,905
the top two were always
me and Shao Lan.

22
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:22,355
It seems the first and second will be
from our class this year.

23
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:25,091
You’re fast, Li-kun!

24
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,093
Shao Lan!

25
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,299
Mei Li.

26
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:29,669
It looks like we’ll be number one

27
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,971
in the Marathon Competition!

28
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:34,435
Mei Li-chan, you’re good at marathons,
then?

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,611
Who told you I was good at it?

30
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:45,683
You’re going to be crying and
running way behind me, you know.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,712
Why am I going to cry?

32
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:48,986
Crying because you’re jealous.

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,824
But, Mei Li have you ever
run long distance before?

34
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,795
Just like the previous group,
it’s 5 times around the track.

35
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:08,207
Make sure to set your
own pace as you run.

36
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:09,571
Yes!

37
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,704
Then get ready.

38
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:14,303
Set!

39
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,247
Start!

40
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:18,874
Fast!

41
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,379
You.

42
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,282
You’re seeing me run
and you’re amazed, aren’t you?

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,018
Did it!

44
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:10,666
Mei Li-chan!

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,505
No more…

46
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,204
Feels good!

47
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:21,171
Here.

48
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:21,946
Thank you.

49
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,216
Are you okay, Mei Li-chan?

50
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,249
It’s just that I’m not
in the best of health today.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,221
I’ve never lost to anyone

52
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,057
but Shao Lan in a race until now.

53
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,463
Race? But you’ve only run a
100m race until now.

54
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,424
Huh?

55
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:42,802
Between a 100m

56
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,771
and a marathon,
even the way you run is different.

57
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,331
Why? It’s the same race.

58
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:53,944
How do you get fast

59
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,749
like Sakura-chan and Yamazaki-kun?

60
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:59,179
It’s definitely training.

61
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:04,321
Marathon training is ideal
at high elevations.

62
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,490
High elevations?
You mean like a tall mountain?

63
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,756
A marathon runner
trains on high mountains

64
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,222
like Fuji-san.

65
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,396
The tallest mountains
in the world

66
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,904
were first scaled by
marathon runners in training.

67
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:19,599
Eh?

68
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,843
There aren’t any tall mountains

69
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,130
like that in Tomoeda-cho.

70
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:27,273
World-class marathon runners are also
world-class mountain climbers, too.

71
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:30,047
It begins again.
Yamazaki-kun’s lies.

72
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:31,713
Is it a lie?

73
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,211
But training is important.

74
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:35,385
Uh huh! I’ll work on it.

75
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,357
Training, huh?

76
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,093
Gochisousama!

77
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:48,299
That reminds me, this Friday

78
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,467
is Sakura-san’s Marathon Competiton,
isn’t it?

79
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:50,436
Yes.

80
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,436
And you won last year, didn’t you?

81
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,672
What’s the start time for your grade?

82
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,443
Right after lunch recess ends.

83
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,336
That so?
Then maybe I’ll go watch, too.

84
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:01,371
Huh?

85
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,182
That day I only have
class during the morning.

86
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,208
Will Yukito-san come watch, too?

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,485
He’s in the same class,
so he doesn’t have class, either.

88
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,118
Where are you running?

89
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,358
Um, first once around the school,

90
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,293
then into Penguin Park,

91
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:19,763
then outside the park,
around the Sakura tree,

92
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,001
we pass next to the library,

93
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,931
then through the park again,
and back to school.

94
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:27,397
That’s a lot.

95
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,103
The whole way is 2.5km,

96
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,441
but I like running, so…

97
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:35,311
In your case, Sakura,
you train everyday, so…

98
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:36,410
Eh!

99
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:39,682
Don’t you run as fast as
you can every morning to school?

100
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,486
I slept in too late!
You say.

101
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,389
Yuki was impressed, too.

102
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,084
After all, you catch up to my bike.

103
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,395
Goshisousama.

104
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:56,266
Where are you going?

105
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,034
Marathon training!

106
00:05:58,505 --> 00:05:59,267
You shouldn’t.

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,163
What?

108
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:01,505
Shao Lan,

109
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,071
don’t you want to win with me?

110
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:04,940
Mei Li-sama,

111
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,175
it’s better if you don’t exercise
vigorously right after a meal.

112
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:08,879
Eh!

113
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,542
You’ll get a stomachache.

114
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,252
I’ll be fine, already!

115
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,584
Stupid Shao Lan!

116
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:24,861
Sneeze!

117
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:33,730
My tummy hurts.

118
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:41,908
You’ll get cold.

119
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:44,741
Breathing method?

120
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,916
Rhythmically, like ‘su-su-ha-ha’.

121
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:51,282
And then, maybe you should
run more leisurely…

122
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,785
Leisurely?

123
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,996
Leave a little energy for the finish.

124
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:58,522
When you see the goal,

125
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,892
then use all that saved energy at once.

126
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,564
Thank you, Wei.
I’ll try it.

127
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,637
Give your thanks to Shao Lan-sama.

128
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,806
Shao Lan-sama wanted Mei Li-sama

129
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:14,874
to learn the methods of
long distance running.

130
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:18,644
Shao Lan.

131
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:27,651
I think I’ll be able to do it.

132
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,095
The top fourth grader has come in!

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,999
The top runners are

134
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:38,030
Shao Lan Li and Mei Li-san
of the 2nd group!

135
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:40,535
Shao Lan.

136
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:41,733
Mei Li.

137
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,820
Shao Lan-kun and Mei Li-san,
a very friendly one-two finish!

138
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:38,562
Kinomoto-san.

139
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,662
Today I’m a different me
from the one of last time.

140
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:47,597
I wonder if you can
keep up with my speed?

141
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,403
That’s some confidence, isn’t it?

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,411
I wonder is she has some kind of plan?

143
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:56,275
Sakura-chan!

144
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:58,814
Yukito-san!

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,384
Good luck!

146
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,181
I’ll cheer really hard for you.

147
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,251
Thank you very much!

148
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,489
Fourth graders… 
Please report to the starting line.

149
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,358
Then we’ll be at the turning point.

150
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,360
Do your best!

151
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,233
Okay!

152
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,194
Don’t give up in the middle!

153
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:26,374
Good luck

154
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:27,404
Okay?

155
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:28,573
Yes!

156
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,049
Let’s go.

157
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,643
What’s wrong, Shao Lan?

158
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:35,321
Don’t run too fast
at the beginning.

159
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:37,818
Speed up at the turning point.

160
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,121
Okay.
It’s a one-two finish, okay?

161
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:41,016
Yes.

162
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,231
It’s almost start time.

163
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,666
How does it look from there?

164
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,939
Yes, this is ‘Air Above Tomoeda-cho’.

165
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:57,971
It’s good weather,
and the temperatures low.

166
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,835
It’s perfect for a marathon!

167
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,273
Then, let’s go!

168
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,011
Get ready!

169
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,153
Set!

170
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,215
The top’s the brat and that wench?

171
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,388
What are you doing Sakura?

172
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:48,989
Hurry up and drop them!

173
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,316
I’m not tired at all today.

174
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:13,616
This must be
because of the training.

175
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:15,483
And…

176
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,219
I’m with Shao Lan.

177
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:29,498
They’re not here yet?

178
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:30,734
Should be pretty soon.

179
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,743
This side is perfect!

180
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:43,847
Air Kero-chan, who’s top right now?

181
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,481
It’s that brat! Then that wench,

182
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,584
and Sakura is third!

183
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,851
Sakura! Go for it!

184
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:18,709
I can’t see them at all.

185
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:21,277
Too bad. I’ll wait at the park.

186
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,470
Sakura-chan! Go!

187
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,408
Weren’t they running way fast?

188
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,178
It was quite a fast pace.

189
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,479
She’ll falter at the end…

190
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,759
Go, Naoko-chan!

191
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:13,864
Well, let’s go after them.

192
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:14,964
Yes.

193
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:22,943
Wired?

194
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,329
Don’t you think it’s strange?

195
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:45,395
Yeah.

196
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:46,769
What’s wrong?

197
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,538
It’s been a while
since we turned around,

198
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,372
but no one’s going the other way.

199
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,110
Everyone’s so slow!

200
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:56,574
I don’t think we’ve
that much of a lead, though…

201
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,882
Me and Shao Lan are just too fast.

202
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,249
We have a tag along, too,

203
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:03,552
but…

204
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
They should be here soon.
She better be the top this time!

205
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:11,691
There they are!

206
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:19,234
What?

207
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:25,007
Sakura-chan and them have
already passed me twice.

208
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,572
That means that they have
turned around, then.

209
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:32,284
Yes, but both times they were
running in the same direction.

210
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,247
What?

211
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,324
Hey, was this road so long?

212
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:00,874
Mei Li!

213
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,248
Ouch!

214
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:03,071
Are you okay?

215
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,075
Sakura-chan!

216
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:07,381
Tomoyo-chan?

217
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,085
Why are you coming
from that direction?

218
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:11,990
Well, you won’t
be able to run now.

219
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:13,822
That’s not true!

220
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,264
The teacher’s supposed
to be riding a bicycle behind everyone.

221
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,826
Why don’t you have him
give you a ride?

222
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:25,297
No! I don’t want that! I’m going to
have my one-two finish with Shao Lan!

223
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:26,830
Hello!

224
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,467
That’s it.
I’ll wait here with you.

225
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,312
I’m sorry, but the teacher
already went on ahead.

226
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,211
But, the teacher on the bike

227
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:39,082
is supposed to be behind the last person
going back to school, right?

228
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,183
Yes, but just
a while ago the last person,

229
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,852
Naoko-chan, passed by.

230
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:45,488
What do you mean?

231
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,356
This is…

232
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:53,395
This poster, I thought…

233
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:59,004
I saw you run the same way twice,
Sakura-chan.

234
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,871
Is this a Clow Card?

235
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,910
I can feel it.

236
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,512
I do feel the presence of a Card, but…

237
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:12,047
Where is it?

238
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:15,416
It should be real close.

239
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:28,358
Here.

240
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:30,399
LOOP?

241
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,533
That’s right, it’s LOOP’s trick.

242
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:37,009
He connected your route and
made it into a circle, Sakura.

243
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,767
So it is a Card.

244
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,702
But I can’t see anything!

245
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,708
If you don’t figure him out,
LOOP won’t show himself.

246
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,246
Then we won’t be able to find him!

247
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,045
Even if we can’t see him,
there’s a way to find him.

248
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,350
You brought it with you?

249
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,250
Of course.

250
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:56,323
That’s Shao Lan!

251
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,998
Yokuteiyuchoku.
Shinkenshiho.

252
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:04,233
Kinmokusuika.
Raihushinchyoku.

253
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:09,574
Keimakuhiruki.
Denkoutai. Kyukyunoritsuga!

254
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,073
Oh, wow!

255
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,878
Moron! What are you admiring?

256
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,239
But!

257
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,812
Find it! There should be a seam
in the road somewhere!

258
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,154
It you cut that

259
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,081
then LOOP will show up!

260
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:25,252
Seam?

261
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,649
There has to be an unnatural place!

262
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:29,652
Even if you say that…

263
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:30,924
I’ll help you.

264
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,061
It’s there!

265
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:39,572
Umm…

266
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:46,441
Why is there a seam here?

267
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:52,407
Wired!

268
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,825
Found it!

269
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:09,227
Did you find it?

270
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:10,001
Yep!

271
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,529
You have to cut it with something.

272
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:13,162
When LOOP shows up,

273
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,667
you capture him before
he connects the road again!

274
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:17,368
But even if you say cut…

275
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:20,842
That’s it!

276
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,822
Key that holds the power of the dark,

277
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,383
show your true form to me!

278
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:38,921
This, Sakura commands!

279
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,429
RELEASE!

280
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:54,943
SWORD!

281
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:13,422
Return to thy true form!

282
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,062
CLOW CARD!

283
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,134
Did you do it?

284
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,002
Shao Lan was faster!

285
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,924
But Shao Lan was
definitely faster!

286
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,256
Sakura-chan and her
friends sure are late…

287
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:51,330
Maybe they took a wrong street?

288
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,163
No!

289
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,098
Even if you say no,
you still can’t run on that leg!

290
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,404
I’m fine!

291
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,945
I’ll stay with her,

292
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:04,178
so if you have someone come pick her up…

293
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:05,844
I’ll wait with you.

294
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,080
No! NO! NO!

295
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,582
Shao Lan and I are going
to do a one-two finish!

296
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,450
Mei Li.

297
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:17,294
Here.

298
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:18,992
Shao Lan.

299
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,191
The last fourth grade runner has come in!

300
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,730
Let’s greet them with a warm applause!

301
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:54,528
Shao Lan.

302
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:56,657
Thank you.

303
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,511
This time, I got hurt,

304
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,313
but if it’s just based on ability,
I would’ve won, ok?

305
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:11,344
Eh!

306
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:14,448
And even the Clow Card,
Shao Lan really captured it.

307
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,078
Next time there’s a race,

308
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:19,084
We’ll definitely beat you!

309
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,360
Then it’ll be a one-two finish
with me and Shao Lan!

310
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,456
The fight has just begun!

311
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:28,129
You’re troubled face is wonderful,
too, Sakura-chan!

312
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,163
I WON’T lose!

313
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,264
 Eh?
