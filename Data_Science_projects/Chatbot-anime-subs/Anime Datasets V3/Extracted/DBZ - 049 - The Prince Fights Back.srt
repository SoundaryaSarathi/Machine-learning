00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,808
Why, you-!

2
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,649
Where did you go, dammit!?

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,310
Damn you...

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,153
Where are you!?
Come on out!

5
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,663
Damn...

6
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,452
It's okay. There's no way he'll find us.

7
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:05,123
Having that old timer destroy those
Scouter things really did save us.

8
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:09,958
If he still had one, he'd be able to locate
even that little kid's <i>Ki</i>, after all.

9
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:18,292
Damn. How am I supposed to find those
tiny little guys!? This is infuriating!

10
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:26,808
Thank goodness. He's
giving up and going back.

11
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,651
I'll blow them away!

12
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:46,323
See you in hell!

13
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:17,618
Take that. That's what you get
for giving me a hard time.

14
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,973
Freeza-<i>sama</i> told me
to bring them back,

15
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,809
but I guess this is better
than letting them get away.

16
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:35,480
Still, I never did find out
who those little brats really were.

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,316
They weren't any ordinary folks. But I
suppose it doesn't make any difference now.

18
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,650
We're saved!

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,098
For now, let's get back
to where Bulma-<i>san</i> is, okay?

20
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,498
Are you able to fly?

21
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,458
Yes.

22
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:09,781
T- thank you for saving me.

23
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,283
Say your thanks to Gohan here.

24
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:15,453
I was so fazed that I didn't
even want to try saving you.

25
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:20,618
But if you hadn't helped,
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, both of us would be dead.

26
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,297
Well, at any rate,
come along with us.

27
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:29,289
It's not like there's
anything shady about us.

28
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:39,807
Okay.

29
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,929
There <i>are</i> Dragon Balls here, but there are
these strange guys gathering them all up,

30
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,598
" Occupied by Bulma-<i>chan</i>!
Do not open! Do not touch!"
There <i>are</i> Dragon Balls here, but there are
these strange guys gathering them all up,

31
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:02,600
and if they make off
with all of them like this,

32
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,437
then it doesn't make any sense
why a delicate young lady like myself...

33
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:09,771
...has risked all of this danger to come
to this planet, does it? Am I right?

34
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,112
Hey, are you listening to me, Dad!?

35
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:19,284
<i>Yeah, l'm listening to every word.</i>
<i>So, what's the matter?</i>

36
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:22,787
It's just that this whole situation
is just in the worst state it could be in.

37
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:27,952
Our spaceship was wrecked by these weirdos,
so there's no way we can come back home.

38
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,805
You're coming back home?

39
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:43,475
Well, isn't that going to cause trouble?

40
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:48,079
I mean, Goku has just
barely left to head there.

41
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,810
Won't it be a shame
if you two miss each other?

42
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,755
Son-<i>kun</i>? Son-<i>kun</i> is coming
here to Planet Namek?

43
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,426
Really, really, really he is?

44
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:06,591
<i>Yeah, that's right. According to schedule,</i>
<i>he should get there in six days.</i>

45
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,594
Hooray!

46
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,934
<i>But there is one thing</i>
<i>that has me concerned...</i>

47
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,613
Huh? What?

48
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,283
<i>He took off without having</i>
<i>the speakers installed.</i>

49
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,616
<i>Does Goku not listen</i>
<i>to music and such?</i>

50
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:03,584
I've been training too seriously,
and now I'm hungry!

51
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,587
Aw, is this all there is?

52
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,772
Just this much ain't
going to be enough.

53
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:49,958
Ah, I'm full, I'm full!

54
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,314
Oh, whoops. The gravity
device is still turned on.

55
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:24,326
Still, without Scouters, it's going to be
a pain looking for the last two Dragon Balls.

56
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, this isn't all
that large a planet.

57
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,077
V- Vegeta! Why, you-!

58
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:11,082
Yo, it's been quite a long
while, huh, Dodoria-<i>san</i>?

59
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:15,420
You're the one who hit me when I
wasn't looking, aren't you, Vegeta!?

60
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,324
You and Zarbon are always palling
around with Freeza, after all.

61
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,986
I've been waiting until
you were all on your own.

62
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:29,165
I should be able to take you, as long
as Freeza isn't around, you see.

63
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:35,668
What? A Saiyan like you!? You've got
some nerve saying that, don't you!?

64
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,648
Vegeta, hand over that Scouter
to me quietly, and get lost.

65
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:22,487
If you do so, I'll let you
slide this one time.

66
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:27,492
You will? I thought something had happened
when the sound suddenly cut out.

67
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,655
It looks like you guys have lost
all your Scouters, all right.

68
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,835
This is great. Now you won't be able
to tell when I come up to you guys.

69
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,496
What did you say!?

70
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:51,012
It will take several days for you to go
get more Scouters from Planet Freeza.

71
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,510
I'll bet you want this.

72
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,134
You've decided to hand it over, huh?

73
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:13,126
It's about time you realized
the terror of your situation.

74
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:21,305
Now, if you're lucky, you just might
at least have your life spared.

75
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:39,986
H- how could you do that, Vegeta!?

76
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,990
Why the hell did you break it!?

77
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,442
I didn't have any further need of it.

78
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,512
W- what? Without that thing,

79
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:57,782
you can't tell where Freeza-<i>sama</i>
or the Namekians are, either!

80
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:02,787
Sorry to disappoint you, but when
I was fighting the Earthlings,

81
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,122
I found out that they could determine

82
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,614
an opponent's strength
and location without a Scouter.

83
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:16,791
Also, there was a Saiyan, like myself,
there on Earth, who had this ability.

84
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,972
Which meant that I should
be able to do it as well.

85
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,151
Once you learn how to do it, it's easy.

86
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,821
But then, for those
like yourselves or Freeza,

87
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,825
who only set their sights on power,
it would be impossible.

88
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,488
Although, up until now,
I was the same way.

89
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,434
I see now. Those runts I was chasing
earlier were Earthlings, weren't they!?

90
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,103
Earthlings, you say?

91
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:55,773
You joined forces with
the Earthlings, didn't you!?

92
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,942
What kind of nonsense is that?

93
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:01,779
There's no way that Earthlings
could come all the way here.

94
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,284
And if they were here, the first thing
I would do is go dispose of them.

95
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:11,122
None of that makes any difference!
You just get out of here!

96
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:14,114
Unless you want
to get killed, that is!

97
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:24,468
I'm offering to let you go.
You should be grateful!

98
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:29,132
What are you so frightened for?
Why don't you come at me, already?

99
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,310
I know why you don't.

100
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:39,483
You found out during my fight with Kewie
that I've become far stronger than before,

101
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,815
and you're afraid of me!

102
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:48,326
What happened, Zarbon?

103
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:51,162
I- I think it was a malfunction,

104
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:56,434
but the rating on my Scouter, which was set
on Vegeta, had just risen above 22,000...

105
00:12:56,434 --> 00:13:01,269
What? 22,000, you say? That has
to be a malfunction, you fool.

106
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:07,445
You saw it on your Scouter, right?

107
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:10,114
My battle power?

108
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:14,785
T- that rating was wrong!
A malfunction in the Scouter!

109
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:19,119
Don't you belittle me!

110
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,305
<i>You're</i> the one who's belittling <i>me</i>.

111
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:37,138
There's no way that technique
is going to work on me, you know!

112
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:54,987
We Saiyans grow stronger
every time we fight.

113
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:04,435
The stronger my opponent is,
the more my own strength increases,

114
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:09,774
so after nearly dying on Earth,
I have powered up considerably.

115
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:13,266
Such is the warrior race, the Saiyans.

116
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:28,125
This is what happens to you for letting
that power you're so proud of go neglected.

117
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,462
Die, and come back next time
as a harder worker!

118
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:36,801
Wait, Vegeta! If you let me go now,
I'll let you in on a secret!

119
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:40,471
I- it's about your world,
Planet Vegeta!

120
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:41,631
What?

121
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,745
Did you say Planet Vegeta?
What secret is there about Planet Vegeta!?

122
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,976
Let go! Let go of me,
and I'll tell you!

123
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:08,432
Y- you're not planning to kill me
right after I tell you, are you?

124
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:11,769
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you
right now! Start talking!

125
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,440
Y- you Saiyans' Planet Vegeta

126
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:24,048
wasn't wiped out when a giant meteor
struck it, like Freeza-<i>sama</i> said.

127
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,538
What!?

128
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:17,434
Individually, the Saiyans' powers
were a far cry from Freeza-<i>sama</i>'s,

129
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,271
but if a large number of Saiyans
were to unite together,

130
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,603
it would become fairly troublesome.

131
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,781
What's more, there were small groups
of Saiyans being born, like yourself,

132
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,615
who were outstanding warriors,
and their numbers were increasing.

133
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,790
Figuring that once you started
having such extraordinary power,

134
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,127
you weren't the sort of race that would just
go on obediently following orders forever,

135
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:49,066
so Freeza-<i>sama</i> decided that it was
necessary to take measures as of right then.

136
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,795
And so...

137
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:18,429
And so, Freeza-<i>sama</i> himself obliterated
Planet Vegeta, along with all the Saiyans.

138
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,433
However, Vegeta, you should
be grateful to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

139
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:28,005
He thought he could use the prodigious
talents of you, the prince of Planet Vegeta,

140
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:33,170
so Freeza-<i>sama</i> went to the trouble of going
after the planet when you were not on it.

141
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:41,352
Looks like this comes
as a great shock, all right.

142
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,689
I'm going to use the chance
it gives me to return to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

143
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,852
Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

144
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,733
I don't care about the planet,
or my pals, or my parents.

145
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,635
I'm just furious at myself
for not knowing this,

146
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:03,301
and allowing myself to be used according
to your whims ever since I was a kid!

147
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,802
Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

148
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:33,335
Freeza fears the bottomless
potential of the Saiyans.

149
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:55,020
I've got to hurry and conquer
this 20-times gravity quickly.

150
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,970
Okay... guess I'll get started.
One... two... one... two...

151
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,140
one... two... one... two...

152
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,973
<i>Goku is full of energy.</i>

153
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:20,317
<i>Vegeta keeps on gaining more power.</i>

154
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:24,981
<i>The time when these two</i>
<i>will once again clash is near.</i>
