1
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:13,543
I figured if they could not
become pro after this,

2
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,003
there's something seriously wrong
with this world.

3
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:32,663
Blinking eyes call the wind

4
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:40,303
A smile clears all the noise away

5
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:46,873
The angel in your eyes whispers

6
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:52,053
"Everything begins now"

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,293
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

8
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:58,093
It's like being caught in a wave

9
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:00,263
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

10
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:03,733
Breath held, arms reaching out

11
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:10,963
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

12
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:15,613
You're the only one I can see

13
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:19,543
Baby my wish on a wing

14
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:22,513
This sky is torn

15
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:27,923
By a single overflowing word

16
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:57,603
That day was BLAST's third time
on the stage in the big city.

17
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,953
It was at the same venue as usual.

18
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,123
They were the opening act and
played for 40 minutes.

19
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,003
BLAST is really popular!

20
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,963
The line was all the way to
the convenience store.

21
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,343
Misato told me excitedly as
she returned from buying some juice.

22
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:20,743
She had passed the line of people waiting
since before the concert hall opened,

23
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,233
hoping to get seats close
to the front.

24
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,513
That was the right decision
to come early.

25
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:30,473
You might wanna tell
Junko and Kyosuke to hurry.

26
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,223
But Jun-chan was a bit pissed off
at the concert the other day,

27
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,723
being pushed around by the crowd.

28
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:37,023
She said she would watch
from the back today.

29
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,523
Don't push! I'm dying here!

30
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,493
Huh? Why? That life risking feeling
is what makes it so special!

31
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,363
It never gets that heated
at the concerts back home.

32
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,663
I was so excited,
I almost passed out.

33
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:55,043
Almost passed out?

34
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,813
It was only their third concert,

35
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:01,983
but they opened the hall earlier than
scheduled because of the long line up,

36
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,713
and in a blink of an eye,
the place was packed.

37
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,513
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

38
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:10,153
Jun-chan and Kyosuke might not
be able to get in.

39
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,593
What?! Tickets are sold out?!

40
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,693
Wow. Incredible.

41
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,063
We're all standing anyway.
Can't you squeeze in just two more?

42
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,563
But we're already way
past capacity.

43
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:23,333
I beg you. Our friends are
performing from seven.

44
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:25,743
You're friends?
You on the guest list?

45
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,343
- I dunno.
- Your names?

46
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,973
Saotome and Takakura.

47
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,083
That's fine. Go ahead.

48
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,573
If you don't mind standing in
the hallway way up in the back.

49
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,743
Hey, do you have tickets?

50
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:37,513
No.

51
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:39,613
Then give up.
The show is sold out.

52
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:40,883
- What?!
- What?!

53
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:45,753
No way! We came all the way out
to Tokyo just to come to this concert!

54
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,163
See? I told you
we should've left earlier.

55
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:50,723
It's your fault for insisting
on attending those classes!

56
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:53,133
But the teacher said he wouldn't
let me graduate high school

57
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,473
unless I attended those classes!

58
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,903
Well, that's your fault for
not studying hard enough!

59
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,403
I beg of you, please let us in!

60
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:02,043
Impossible! Any more people and
we'd be facing safety issues!

61
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,413
Some concert isn't worth
losing your life over!

62
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,813
- It sure is!
- Like I said, it's impossible.

63
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,113
Nana! Nana!

64
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,343
Crying isn't gonna help.

65
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:15,483
Listen... Let these girls go in
instead of us.

66
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:21,053
The enthusiasm of the crowd increased
with each concert.

67
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,993
I started feeling dizzy from it.

68
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:27,233
It's okay.

70
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:28,663
Excuse me.

71
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,663
But, thank goodness
we got in, Akiko.

72
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,073
Fortunately, our expensive
plane tickets didn't go to waste.

73
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:37,273
Say, the people of Tokyo
are surprisingly kind.

74
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:40,033
I wish we could get down there.

75
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,173
But even the stairway is packed with
people, so I guess it's impossible.

76
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:43,413
But this is kinda nice.

77
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,413
We can see better from here,
and we don't hafta risk our lives.

78
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:48,493
Anyway, what's up with all
these people right from the beginning?

79
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,683
Impressive, don't you think?

80
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,353
It's because they're good.

81
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,153
This makes me feel lonely,
in a strange way.

82
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:56,283
With this popularity,
Nana may have forgotten about us.

83
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,603
But she's sent me a postcard
to notify me

84
00:04:58,603 --> 00:04:59,793
every time she has
a concert coming up.

85
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,633
That was a good call to hand her
that paper with your address on it.

86
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,573
You know, from next time,
I say we skip school and work,

87
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,733
and come to all the concerts.

88
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,103
Even if we must hitchhike!

89
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:08,443
I agree! Even if we need
to camp out!

90
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,273
Now, now...
I agree! Even if we need
to camp out!

91
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:10,503
I agree! Even if we need
to camp out!

92
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:16,143
That'll give us the strength to
work hard with other stuff.

93
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:21,153
Exactly at seven o'clock,
the starting time of the concert,

94
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:25,083
the first one to appear on stage...
was Nana.

95
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:42,463
Absorbed in the cheers that got louder
with each concert,

96
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,083
I felt that I was disappearing
into the crowd.

97
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,603
Good evening. We're BLAST.

98
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,553
Damn it, it's begun!

99
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:58,353
Hey, I can hear it.
They sure play loud!

100
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,793
I wanna go in!

101
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:02,023
BLAST should play in
a bigger place!

102
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,793
Do you know what the population
of Tokyo is?!

103
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,123
We should have purchased
our tickets ahead of time.

104
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:11,873
We'll wait around and catch
the band on their way out.

105
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:13,403
Who do you wanna see?

106
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,333
Yasu.

107
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:15,803
He has great technique.

108
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,533
No way! Yasu's mine!

109
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,413
I'm guessing,
it's summer vacation,

110
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,283
so many people have come out here
from the suburbs,

111
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,353
causing this situation.

112
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,253
Even so, this level
of enthusiasm is crazy.

113
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:27,713
What is this?

114
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,053
Whaddaya wanna do?

115
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:31,553
Wanna go for a coffee until
the concert's over?

116
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,723
Sure.

117
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:33,923
We've come all the way here.

118
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,763
Let's stick around and meet up
with Nana later.

119
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,933
But with so many followers,

120
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,623
they should be able to go pro
without any problem.

121
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,203
That's it! They're followers!

122
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,803
Misato's one, and Nana has a bit
of that towards her roommate.

123
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,403
Yeah, you're right.

124
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:51,083
Maybe the reason she no longer
talks about the Demon Lord

125
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,483
is not because she's matured,

126
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,643
but because she's switched over
to the religion of BLAST.

127
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,143
Bottom line, she needs something
to depend on.

128
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:58,853
Well, at least she's more positive
about things now

129
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,553
than back when she'd blame everything
on the Demon Lord.

130
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,283
Besides, BLAST is really cool.

131
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,823
I can see why they have
such devoted followers.

132
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,923
Their presence on stage is
out of the ordinary.

133
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,093
You're right.
Especially that vocalist.

134
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,833
You know, I was thinking.

135
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:24,103
You know how with musicians,
talent alone doesn't guarantee success?

136
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:27,183
Well, of course you've gotta
be above a certain level

137
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:29,173
if you're gonna go pro.

138
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,023
But from that point on, it's not really
about how good or bad you are.

139
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,363
Charisma.

140

Your band has that.

143
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,123
Your band has that.

144
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,893
Your musical performance and
your songs are exceptional.

145
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,993
It was a wonderful show.

146
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:53,273
I've been in this business
for a long time,

147
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,643
but I haven't been so moved
to this extent for ages.

148
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,883
There's a lot for us to discuss.

149
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,813
Rather than just talk things over here,
why don't I...

150
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,843
take you out for sushi?

151
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,253
Yay! Sushi!

152
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:10,013
Shin.

153
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,353
What? You didn't go meet
them backstage?

154
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,633
No. They were seeing a guy from
a record company.

155
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,963
It would be distracting to have outsiders
there while they're trying to talk business.

156
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,103
We'll be seeing everyone
at home later, anyway.

157
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,363
Oh, a post-live party?

158
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:27,763
Then we're going straight
to your place, Nana?

159
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:32,773
Mhm... I figured tonight will be a night
to celebrate, so I prepared lots of food.

160
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,383
So please come.

161
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,013
Sorry.

162
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,973
We're kinda busy now.

163
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:40,513
We've gotta get home right away.

164
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,283
Huh? Why? It's summer vacation.

165
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,683
We have a group exhibition
starting next week.

166
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:47,323
Six of us have rented a gallery,

167
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,923
us and some friends from
the Art College.

168
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,323
We're super busy for the exhibition.

169
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,593
Is that so? A group exhibition?

170
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,693
Like a true art student.

171
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,243
I feel sorry that you couldn't
see the concert

172
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,863
after coming out here during
a very busy time.

173
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:05,243
It's not as bad as those who came
all the way to Tokyo from a different city

174
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,503
and weren't able to get in.

175
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:07,743
Indeed.

176
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,843
Here. It's a pamphlet with information
on our group exhibition.

177
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,553
Come by if you have time.

Jun-chan and Kyosuke are working
diligently in their own world.

181
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,463
I feel an even stronger sense
that they're leaving me behind.

182
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,263
Miss Hachiko,
your cell phone's ringing.

183
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:35,503
Hello, Nana here.

184
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,813
Oh, Nana?

185
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:39,573
Good job with the live concert.
We're back home.

186
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,203
We got a ride home.

187
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,773
What about you guys, Nana?
What time can you get here?

188
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:47,313
Sorry. It doesn't look like
we're gonna be able to make it.

189
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,553
We've been invited to have dinner
with the guy from Gaia.

190
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,683
I imagine we'll be pretty late.

191
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,523
Did you by chance already make
preparations for our post-live party?

192
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:01,233
No, not yet! We just got home!

193
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,333
I'm really sorry.

194
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,193
Not to worry.

195
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:09,233
It's okay, don't worry about us. Go.

196
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,543
This waste of time happens often.

197
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:16,343
I'm working tomorrow evening,
but I'll stop by during the day.

198
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,583
Oh, but I have work from
the morning tomorrow.

199
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,353
What about Misato?
Let me talk to her for a bit.

200
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:23,813
It's Nana.

201
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:25,983
Hello?

202
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,753
Yes. Nana, it was
an awesome performance.

203
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:32,253
Huh?

204
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,063
Oh? Is that so?

205
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,663
No, let's hope they bring up
the subject of a contract.

206
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,393
Huh? Tomorrow?

207
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:43,373
What about me?

208
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,473
Yes, I'll be waiting for you at home.

209
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,983
Hey, Nana, what about me?

210
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,453
Nana, Mr. Kawano's
called for a taxi. Let's go.

211
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,883
They're waiting in the street...

212
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,233
Oops. Sorry, you're on the phone.

213
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,653
Sorry, Misato, I have to go now.

214
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,523
Say bye to Hachiko for me, okay?

215
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,833
Huh? Oh, go ahead.

216
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,163
Feel free to stay in my room.
The room's not locked.

217
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:16,303
Mhm. Bye.

218
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:19,973
Was that Misato?
What about Hachi?

219
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,103
She said not to worry and go.

220
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:27,223
Misato and Hachiko should come
and join us for sushi.

221
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,783
You idiot. Let's go.

222
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:30,683
Idiot?

223
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:35,723
Good job.

224
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:36,583
Oh!

225
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,053
Nana!

226
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:42,933
I live, encouraged by
the songs you sing.

227
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,173
DEAR NANA,
I BOUGHT THE CD
YOU RELEASED YOURSELVES.
IT'S THE GREATEST!
I LIVE, ENCOURAGED BY
THE SONGS YOU SING.
I live, encouraged by
the songs you sing.

228
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:45,843
YOUR LYRICS REALLY HIT HOME.
I'D LIKE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO
HAVE THE CHANCE TO LISTEN
TO YOU. BUT I MAY GET LONELY IF
YOU BECOME FAMOUS. YOU KNOW
HOW REN'S ALREADY
BECOME REALLY POPULAR...
I live, encouraged by
the songs you sing.

229
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,533
YOUR LYRICS REALLY HIT HOME.
I'D LIKE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO
HAVE THE CHANCE TO LISTEN
TO YOU. BUT I MAY GET LONELY IF
YOU BECOME FAMOUS. YOU KNOW
HOW REN'S ALREADY
BECOME REALLY POPULAR...

230
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,313
It's only natural for Nana
to treat Misato,

231
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:52,743
who pursues Nana with
passion and

232
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:55,653
makes the effort to come all the way
to Tokyo for every concert,

233
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:57,173
more importantly than
she treats me.

234
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:00,853
It's only natural for Nana to place
a higher priority on talks

235
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,553
with a record label than any promise
she made with me.

236
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,053
And it's also only natural that

237
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,953
she would choose to be with Ren
than live with me.

238
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,633
It all makes sense.

239
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:18,023
But if that's the case...
she no longer needs me.

240
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:24,473
It's such a shame, Miss Hachiko.
After making all this food.

241
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,473
Huh?

242
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:28,243
Oh, right!

243
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:29,513
It can't be helped,
given the circumstances.

244
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,353
Don't feel pressured into eating more
than you want, Misato.

245
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:35,183
But everything's so delicious.
It would be hard not to overeat.

246
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:39,783
You're a very good cook,
Miss Hachiko. I'm impressed.

247
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:44,793
Misato is such a nice girl.

248
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:48,233
She is so much in love with Nana,

249
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,933
yet will never show hostile sentiments
to those around her.

250
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,433
And she was honestly happy
about Nana and Ren.

251
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,113
She's a really cute, good girl.

252
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:01,283
Which exhausts me all the more
with my tendency to be cynical.

253
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,713
I wonder if we can get along
for a full month.

256
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:17,493
A FRIEND WILL BE STAYING WITH ME
DURING SUMMER VACATION, SO
DON'T COME BY MY PLACE, OKAY?
NANA

257
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:22,033
This is like telling him that I can't see him
until summer vacation is over.

258
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,773
Well, I guess that's fine.

259
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:27,003
Since with him, I'm never sure whether
or not I'll ever see him again anyway.

260
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,773
I ended up never seeing
Nobu again as well.

261
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,943
And while he was on stage,

262
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,313
I purposely tried not to
look over to him.

263
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:46,253
Nana...

264
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:56,063
This isn't good.
What should I do?

265
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,303
I'm feeling so lonely.

266
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:08,943
Is your friend a woman?

267
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,413
Of course!

268
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:15,183
Really? Then that's fine.

269
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:16,553
Good night.

270
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:31,263
Yes.

271
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:32,573
Takumi, .,

272
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:35,403
I wanna see you.

273
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,983
Oh, Miss Hachiko,
thank you for letting me take a bath.

274
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,983
I'm sorry, Misato.
I'm going out for a bit.

275
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,313
Huh? At this hour?
Did something happen?

276
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,893
No. It's nothing important,
but I won't be coming home tonight.

277
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,793
I'll be going straight to work
from there tomorrow.

278
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,393
I'll leave my keys with you,

279
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,623
so leave it in the mailbox
downstairs when you go out.

280
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,093
Sorry to leave you alone.

281
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:10,433
But I just couldn't make it
through the night tonight.

282
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:14,483
Bye, Takumi. I'll come pick you up
tomorrow morning at ten.

283
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,783
Don't you dare leave
your room until then.

284
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,813
Yes. Thank you, Take.

285
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,453
Drop by my place and bring me
a change of clothes, okay?

286
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:22,243
Sure.

287
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:35,033
Sorry to keep you waiting, Reira.

288
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,133
Take.

289
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:36,763
Huh?

290
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,533
Get a room for me too.
I'm feeling carsick.

291
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:47,173
The price on the meter
is getting pretty high.

292
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,543
By the time I get there, it could be
as high as my wages for tomorrow.

293
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,553
ROOM 2015 JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT A SUITE.
THOSE ARE SPECIAL FOR
FIRST AND LAST STAYS ONLY.

294
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,023
Which means this isn't
the last time, right?

295
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,633
Nobu, you were more popular
than me tonight.

296
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,903
- Thank you very much, Mr. Kawano.
- I don't understand.

297
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,703
The meal was exceptional.

298
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,773
How about another drink
somewhere around here?

299
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,313
No thank you, I have to go
to work tomorrow.

300
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,873
Right, you're working at
a law firm, right?

301
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,213
What are you gonna do about that?

302
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,453
I'll give it some serious thought along
with this issue about our contract.

303
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,083
I see. I'm hoping for
a positive reply.

304
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,363
TAXI STOP

305
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,163
TAXI STOP
Yasu, I'm gonna take a taxi with
Nobu and Shin.

306
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:36,563
Yasu, I'm gonna take a taxi with
Nobu and Shin.

307
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,863
Hachiko said she's working
from the morning tomorrow,

308
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:41,693
so I'll drop by to see her tonight.

309
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:43,423
Yeah, that would be good.

310
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,403
Send her my apologies for
not being able to make it

311
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,493
to the after-party.

312
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:54,213
Mr. Kawano is such a laid-back
type of man, don't you think?

313
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,913
At this rate, it's gonna take us
one hundred years before our debut.

314
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,383
Does a man like that really understand
the likes of rock and punk?

315
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,083
Sure, he said that he was moved, but...

316
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:08,423
Still, he gave us money for the cab,
so I'm sure he's a good man.

317
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:12,253
I'm not sure if that determines
whether or not he's a good man.

318
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,533
Let's split the change.

319
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,593
Excuse me! Stop here!

320
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,303
What is it?!

321
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:24,573
Work? Where do you get
all that energy?

322
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,383
Say hi to Hachi for me, Nobu.

323
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,653
Are you planning on coming too?

324
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,143
I'm not.

325
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:37,383
I give up. There are lots
of women out there.

326
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,953
And I'm pretty popular with the girls.

327
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:41,383
At least grow your hair, Nobuo.

328
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,793
I'll get no pleasure winning
her over in that department!

329
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,463
Actually I don't think
it'll look good on you.

330
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:46,463
Then don't say it!

331
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,103
I'm back.

332
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:55,273
Sorry for waking you.

333
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,713
I forgot my key at
my friend's place.

334
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:58,173
Ren's place?
I forgot my key at
my friend's place.

335
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:58,943
Ren's place?

336
00:17:58,943 --> 00:17:59,183
Ren's place?
No, it's fine. I was still awake.

337
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,013
No, it's fine. I was still awake.

338
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,553
What about Hachi?
Has she gone to bed?

339
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:03,173
Ah...

340
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:07,283
Miss Hachiko went out
a short while ago.

341
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,683
Huh? Where could she have gone
at this hour?

342
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:13,223
I'm not sure but she suddenly left
in a flurry,

343
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,883
saying she wouldn't be
returning tonight.

344
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,633
I might've done something
to upset her again.

345
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,993
No, it's not that.
I'm sure it's a guy.

346
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:27,333
I'll bet she went to
see her boyfriend.

347
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:28,603
Don't worry.

348
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:29,193
Huh?

349
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:30,303
Is the beer cold?

350
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,003
Yes.

351
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:35,283
So, Miss Hachiko has a boyfriend?

352
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,573
Why? Does it surprise you?

353
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:38,513
Yes!

354
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:39,653
"Yes," she says.

355
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,883
Because to me, it seemed that
Miss Hachiko thinks only of you, Nana.

356
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,623
There's no way.

357
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:50,153
But I think only of you, Nana.

358
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,823
Making remarks like that as if
it were impossible hurts my feelings.

359
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,823
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,473
What's this?

361
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,203
Oh, it's a microwave.

362
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:02,973
Well, I can tell that by
looking at it, but...

363
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:04,773
She said she got a loan to buy it.

364
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,403
Apparently that was the only place
she could put it.

365
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:10,513
If she had that kinda money,
why not get an air conditioner?

366
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:12,243
Geez, that Hachi.

367
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,733
Say, what's with this mountain
of leftovers in the fridge?

368
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:34,703
That... Actually, Miss Hachiko figured
tonight would be a night to celebrate,

369
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:37,613
and she had already prepared this
before I arrived here.

370
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,773
Did you already make preparations
for our after-party?

371
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,443
No, not yet.
Don't worry about us and go.

372
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:50,083
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:52,753
No, you couldn't help it, Nana.

374
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:56,453
Um, so how did it go with
the record company?

375
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:15,833
Hey, Nana...

376
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,213
For instance, if we were lovers,

377
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,423
would we have been able to fill
the gap between us with a hug?

378
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:35,733
Or... does everyone endure
this loneliness?

379
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,523
It's not that I wanted to
keep you all to myself, Nana.

380
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,123
I just wanted to be needed by you.

381
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:12,593
I reached into the sky

382
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:19,113
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

383
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:24,483
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

384
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:30,483
Like colorful balloons

385
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,593
I'm alone

386
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:36,323
My hand had no place to go

387
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:42,963
And gently you took it

388
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:44,133
Starless night

389
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:48,333
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

390
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:54,133
I want to feel your warmth

391
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,013
Tears are falling down

392
00:21:56,013 --> 00:22:00,113
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

393
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:06,613
Of your hand holding mine
