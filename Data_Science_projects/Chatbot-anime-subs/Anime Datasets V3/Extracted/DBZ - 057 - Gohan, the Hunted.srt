00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,779
G- Goku!

2
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,514
No matter how strong Goku-<i>san</i> may be,

3
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:01,786
if it takes an hour to get through
that magnetic storm, he won't last!

4
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,346
Can't you do something?

5
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,629
I'm completely like this.

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,290
Huh?

7
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,964
I give up.

8
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:26,974
<i>l</i>- <i>l'll cut the chain!</i>

9
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:11,786
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

10
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,119
Go, <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!

11
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,441
T- this is the worst!

12
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,276
How is this the worst?

13
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:07,437
He's a pretty nice-looking man, isn't he?

14
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,451
P- please don't go judging people
by their faces at a time like this!

15
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,788
But usually, the handsome guy
fights for justice.

16
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:19,457
This isn't Earth, it's Planet Namek.

17
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,459
Yeah, I understand that.

18
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,792
Bulma-<i>san</i>, you don't understand anything.

19
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:41,472
You've managed to mock me pretty good,
haven't you, Vegeta-<i>san</i>?

20
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,482
I see.

21
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:49,146
I recall seeing that runt over there
holding the Dragon Ball before.

22
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,759
You guys have joined forces, have you?

23
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,094
Yoo-hoo!

24
00:03:56,094 --> 00:04:00,765
Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo!
Beat up Vegeta!

25
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,434
I don't care about them.

26
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,602
None of that matters.

27
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:09,441
Vegeta, where have you hidden
the remaining Dragon Balls?

28
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:14,446
You're going to stand
before Freeza and tell us.

29
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,437
Try and make me.

30
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:19,451
You'll never learn.

31
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,787
Come on, why don't you transform, already?

32
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,122
What!?

33
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:27,625
Zarbon, until you change into
that hideous form of yours,

34
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,462
you can't fight toe-to-toe with me.

35
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,797
To someone like myself,
who prefers beauty,

36
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:36,134
those words are the greatest insult!

37
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:40,805
Vegeta, you have gotten me
genuinely angry.

38
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,140
But you can relax.

39
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,811
Freeza ordered me to
bring you back alive.

40
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,646
You're too soft, Zarbon.

41
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:52,480
That softness is what has
restored me back to life.

42
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,488
Shut up!

43
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,764
How handsome!

44
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,425
Bulma-<i>san</i>...

45
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,785
Bulma-<i>san</i>, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

46
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,455
But he said he'd
kill us if we ran!

47
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,946
He'll kill us even
if we <i>don't</i> run!

48
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,452
I won't let you do that!

49
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,299
Damn! He doesn't
miss a single thing!

50
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,128
Don't you sell me short!

51
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,760
You are prepared to answer
for this, yes?

52
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:20,102
If you are unable to bring
Vegeta back here in one hour...

53
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,111
<i>lf this keeps up...</i>

54
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,783
You've finally made up
your mind, have you?

55
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,757
H- he's a villain, all right!

56
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,760
W- what was that!?
He turned into a monster!

57
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,429
What's more, his power
shot up like mad!

58
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:22,490
Vegeta, you're the only one
who has seen this form twice!

59
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:31,442
I wonder why it was at
the bottom of that lake.

60
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:35,780
I know! The villagers might
have been in a rush to hide it.

61
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,448
There are two incredible <i>Ki</i>!

62
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,348
They're coming from where
Bulma-<i>san</i> is waiting!

63
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:55,027
Whichever one of them wins,
it's bad news for us.

64
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,033
S- Son-<i>kun</i>, hurry and get here!

65
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:09,638
What are you doing,
Goku!? Stop that!

66
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,812
I ain't about... to die here!

67
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,427
Goku, it's no use!
You can't cut that chain!

68
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,428
G- Goku!

69
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,157
Goku-<i>san</i>!

70
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:43,509
It's designed so that it won't
break when you do that!

71
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,826
<i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

72
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:53,507
He did it! He did it!
What a guy! That was amazing!

73
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:44,168
Damn... that's 100-times
gravity for you...

74
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:48,832
The bones throughout my body
are broken to pieces...

75
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,138
<i>Goku! Goku!</i>

76
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,475
<i>Goku-san! Goku-san!</i>

77
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:29,139
<i>l know... I can't die here...</i>

78
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,807
<i>l've got bones broken all over...</i>

79
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,990
<i>Vegeta, just you wait!</i>

80
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,454
Goku-<i>san</i>!

81
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:11,122
Goku!

82
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:14,614
Goku! Don't worry about your face!
Hang in there!

83
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,816
He did it! He did it!
He did it!

84
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,985
Whew, that was a close one.

85
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:44,488
A little bit more, and
I would have been dead.

86
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,157
But still, I did it.

87
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:49,827
I experienced 100-times gravity.

88
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,660
At this point, I can go right
to training at 100-times.

89
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,827
<i>You fell for it, Zarbon.</i>

90
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,783
Dammit!

91
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,314
You planned that!

92
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,660
Vegeta! How dare you!

93
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,769
Looks like that hurt pretty bad.

94
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,772
Your strength has dropped
quite a bit, hasn't it?

95
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:11,108
Zarbon-<i>san</i>, it appears
your death is near.

96
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,939
My death is near!?

97
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,613
Don't make me laugh!

98
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:18,115
My battle power is higher than yours!

99
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:24,281
Zarbon-<i>san</i>, aren't you supposed
to be well informed about Saiyans?

100
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:30,461
Carelessly treating me after I was
near death was a bad idea, huh?

101
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,689
Isn't that right?

102
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,814
<i>lt's a good thing</i>
<i>l brought these Senzu...</i>

103
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:52,977
<i>l'll have to thank Yajirobe...</i>

104
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:33,113
Yahoo!

105
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,289
Ups-a-daisy!

106
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:44,465
All right, I'm back to my old self!
Now for some 100-times training-

107
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,133
Before I do, maybe I'll go
have something to eat.

108
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,419
Saiyans are able to increase
their battle power dramatically...

109
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,081
...every time we recover
from the brink of death!

110
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,924
So that's it.

111
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,762
Now that he mentions it, Goku got stronger
every time he had a fierce battle.

112
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,766
Damn, so that's the reason why
Vegeta's <i>Ki</i> has risen like crazy, huh?

113
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,103
Listen, even if your
battle power has risen,

114
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,605
there's still no way you can
beat me after I've transformed,

115
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,266
and can exhibit my true power!

116
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,442
The Saiyans are a fighting race!
Don't underestimate us!

117
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,484
V- Vegeta... I was only acting
under orders from Freeza-<i>sama</i>...

118
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,421
Let me go... please...

119
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,990
After as much as you've
worked me to the bone,

120
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,759
don't you dare go asking
for anything for yourself!

121
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,431
I know... The two of us
could team up... If we did...

122
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:23,161
...we could even beat Freeza...

123
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,184
If I could defeat Freeza
just by teaming up with you,

124
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,786
it wouldn't be very sporting.

125
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,185
Now then...

126
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,196
I don't know how you did it,

127
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,189
but you've raised your battle power a bit
since we were on Earth, haven't you?

128
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:03,073
But you're still not at the level where
you can fight me on even terms, are you?

129
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:07,077
What will it be? Would you be inclined
to hand over that Dragon Ball to me nicely?

130
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:11,081
I- I doubt it will do any good
to make any agreements with you,

131
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:15,419
but if I hand this over, do you promise
to leave here without any trouble?

132
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,422
A promise, huh?
Well, all right.

133
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,491
As long as I have the Dragon Ball,

134
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,761
there's no sense in playing
around with you, small fry.

135
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,763
Y- you mean it?

136
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:29,166
What a pest. If that's how
badly you want to live,

137
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,999
then hand it over before
I change my mind.

138
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,768
K- Kuririn...

139
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,015
You guys are lucky.

140
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:49,119
I'm in a good mood, since I have now
found all of the Dragon Balls.

141
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,088
Now I can attain eternal life,

142
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:56,856
which will allow me to rule the
entire universe, instead of Freeza!

143
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:09,128
<i>W</i>- <i>we're not about to let</i>
<i>Vegeta get all seven of them!</i>
