1
00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:02,693
What's happened so far!

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,960
Our sister, the masked honor
student Miyazawa Yukino, is the
ultimate Queen of Vanity.

4
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:09,426
The one who changed her, Arima Souichirou,
is an industrious model student who tries
to bear all his sorrows by himself.

6
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:14,907
The two, being affected by each
others lives, decide to live for
their own real happiness.

9
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,039
We're so happy for you, Sis!

10
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:19,871
But all sorts of problems
were waiting for them.

12
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,873
Yeah, but they solved them one after the other.

13
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,478
She doesn't easily get discouraged, after all.

14
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:26,317
And at long last, it's the first
summer vacation of high school!

16
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:30,214
Sis went off to have fun with the
friends she made for the first time!

18
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,491
They manage the standard menu such
as tea,  karaoke, and window shopping.

19
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,795
It was finally Sis's debut
into the world of friends,

21
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:38,590
but as it turned out before we knew it

22
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,228
she was mixed up in another
family's private problems!

23
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm home.

24
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,606
Tsubasa, could you try this on?

25
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:51,009
Definitely cute.

26
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,414
I'm glad I have such a good model at home.

27
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,678
All I have to do is come up
with clothes I want you to wear.

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,547
Say, can I have this dress?

29
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,350
I want to go out somewhere with it on.

30
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:02,516
You like it? Okay,
shall we go for a drive tonight?

31
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,548
We can go to a Chinese
restaurant in Yokohama.

32
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:09,525
Why?

33
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:11,929
Why are you talking about
remarriage all of a sudden?

34
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,127
I could cook and clean and do laundry.

36
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:17,871
I could do everything by myself.

37
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,107
Why are you bringing up
"family" all of a sudden?

39
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:24,678
Am I not enough support for you?

40
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:31,046
Morning.

41
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:32,316
Morning.

42
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:34,955
Breakfast is almost ready.

43
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:36,518
Oh, let me help with that.

44
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:38,750
Let's eat!

45
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,723
This is really nice.

46
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:48,893
It's breakfast as usual...

47
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,597
...and yet having so many girls

48
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:52,198
around makes the atmosphere more festive.

49
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:57,675
You know...
Maybe I should have two
or three more children...

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,777
I.. I don't want any more siblings!

53
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:01,911
I want an older brother...

54
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:05,712
Please don't talk about
family planning during breakfast.

56
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,589
Besides, there's no guarantee
that they'd be all daughters.

57
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,216
You might get three sons.

58
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,222
Then I'd make a baseball team.

59
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,423
We have Yukino(snow),
Tsukino(moon), and Kano(flower), 

60
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:16,763
so their names would have to match.

61
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,429
Like Riku (land), Kai (sea), and Kuu (air)?

62
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,198
Like Justice, Friendship, and Victory!

63
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,895
I want twin boys,

64
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,268
Kouichi-kun and Tsuyoshi-kun!
(The Kinki-Kids)

65
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,502
Or if they're a girl and a boy, "Love and Faith."

66
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:27,702
Flowers and Dreams!

67
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:28,667
Heaven and Earth!

68
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:29,771
The Old Man and the Sea!

69
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:30,710
Romeo and Juliet!

70
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:31,874
Beauty and the Beast!

71
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,804
I can't believe them...

72
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:35,315
Jack and the Beanstalk!

73
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:36,542
Fit 'n Trim!

75
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:38,585
Floor and Matt!

76
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:39,780
Abbott and Costello!

77
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,014
See you later!

78
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,726
Well, I guess I'll do some studying.

79
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,594
Then I'll study too.

80
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,631
Can I use a desk?
Here, use Tsukino's.

81
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,529
Ok.

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,333
I'm going home.

83
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:03,607
Yes!

84
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:05,511
I'm sorry I was so selfish.

85
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:09,548
It's not like anything would happen
by holing myself up here any longer.

87
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:12,314
But... are you sure?

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,500
Yeah.

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,593
My indulgent dad refused
to give in to me this time.
So I have to give up.

92
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,214
Tsubasa!

93
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:54,423
I'm home.

94
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,063
I'm so glad you came back.

95
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:02,092
I'm sorry,

96
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,267
I should have considered
your feelings more...

97
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,061
It's okay.

98
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,870
I just wanted to be a little selfish.

99
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,534
I'm fine now.

100
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,112
You can do whatever you want.

101
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,750
Th..Thank you.

102
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:24,589
Oh well. If my hopes can't be fulfilled,

103
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,687
I don't want anything to begin with.

104
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:31,454
I don't care anymore. I don't care.

105
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,207
You've never met her son?!

106
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:46,436
You were so gung-ho about the remarriage...

107
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,111
...so I'd thought you had
taken care of all that already.

108
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,981
You have no sense of planning.

109
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,877
You're a grownup so get it together!

110
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,646
But, but...

111
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:58,651
I wanted your understanding
first before anything else.

112
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,352
My son isn't one to worry about details like that.

113
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,219
He was rather indifferent

114
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,621
when I said I wanted to get remarried.

115
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,095
Ah...

116
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,209
I'm getting nervous.

117
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,440
I wonder if he'll like me?

118
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,707
Hey, calm down.

120
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,950
I have to show him I'm a r..reliable man,

121
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,942
as his f..f..father...

122
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,355
You don't have to worry so much...

123
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:30,688
Oops! I spilled it!

124
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,319
Here, wipe it with this.

125
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,724
I can't take you anywhere.

126
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,756
I'm sorry I'm late.

127
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,337
I'm her son, Kazuma.

128
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,178
Yes! Kazuma.

129
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,308
So, you play music?

130
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,908
You must be really serious
about it. Quite impressive.

131
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:59,679
I'm still just dabbling in it,

132
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:00,851
so I'm not that good.

133
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,091
Why does the guy who might become
my brother have to be

135
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,121
some rock dude?

136
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,527
I'm unlucky through to the core.

137
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:12,656
Even if I've given up already,

139
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,666
how am I supposed to deal with a guy like this?

140
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,138
Uh-ah.

141
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,404
Well, none of it matters anymore.

142
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:28,849
So, Kazuma-kun, which high
school do you go to?

143
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:29,706
Yes?

144
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:34,582
What was that... just now...

145
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,348
Uh-oh.

146
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,689
Maybe he fell in love with me at first sight.

148
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:41,925
Oh no! What should I do?

149
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,354
If they get married we'll be
living in the same house!

150
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:47,066
What should I do if he eyes me strangely?

151
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:48,692
It happens on TV all the time!

152
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,637
While the parents are out...

153
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:03,217
...and stuff!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

154
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:06,983
Am I really THAT unlucky?!

155
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:08,783
Oh, dessert.

156
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:15,387
Have mine.

157
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:18,623
What?

158
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,000
Hey Mom, you've found a nice guy.

159
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,869
I wasn't going to care since it's all up to you,

160
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:24,562
but he's a really nice guy.

161
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,399
I think this is a good idea.

162
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,604
R.. really? Thank you,
that really makes me happy.

163
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,903
Plus, I'll get such a cute little sister!

164
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:38,200
Seventh grade, huh?
How adorable.

165
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,052
I'm so happy I can have such a cute little sister.

167
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,284
I'd heard she was a kid my age so frankly,

168
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:44,613
I didn't know what to think...

169
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,016
...but I guess I'd heard wrong.

170
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,752
This is great.

171
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:50,130
I want you to get married right away.

172
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:56,567
U.. um, Kazuma-kun...

173
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,404
Tsubasa's not in seventh grade.

174
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,300
What? Younger?

175
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:03,074
She sure has it together
well for a grade schooler.

176
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:08,614
Well, although she doesn't look it
she's really in tenth grade.
Her birthday is before yours.

179
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,641
She's your BIG sister.

180
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:12,444
Say what?!

181
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:15,188
Oh no!

183
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:45,962
Tsubasa snapped!
And we're at a first-class hotel too...!

184
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,940
That was SO rude.

185
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:21,250
I don't know if I could
remarry after that...

188
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:28,528
Damn straight!

189
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,563
Well well, how scary.

190
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:35,196
What are you upset about, little girl?

191
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,331
My, you're so cute.

192
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,334
Hey come on, I'll give
you some spending money,...

193
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:46,542
...so come and play with me.

194
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:47,672
No way.

195
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:49,677
Come on, just for a little bit.

196
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,217
Quit pestering me!

197
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,787
Um, I'll catch you later guys.

198
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:56,013
Kazuma?

199
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,957
Come on, 30,000Y?

200
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:01,026
How about 50,000Y?

202
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:08,391
Hey man...

204
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,596
Quit being so shameful.

205
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:16,877
You okay?
*Officer, this way!*

206
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,606
Where's the girl who's getting abducted?!

207
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:22,243
You can't do that sort of thing!

209
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,541
It's you, isn't it?!

210
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:25,883
Freeze, right there!

211
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:31,987
You better come with us!

212
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:33,551
S.. say what?!

213
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:36,459
Don't resist!

214
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,623
You've got it all wrong! I didn't...

215
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,867
That's what they all say!

216
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,325
We'll get the details at the station.

217
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,828
Hey! Wait a minute...!

218
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,814
Man, that was a close one.
I nearly got hauled downtown.

219
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:56,916
Thanks for saving me.

220
00:10:58,652 --> 00:10:59,277
Well...

221
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:02,315
you're the one who saved me.

222
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,224
It must be hard being that cute.

223
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:09,253
There are lots of weirdos around lately.

224
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,232
I'm glad I got to see you again.

225
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:19,773
We split up on a really
bad note last time...

227
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:21,468
...and I'd been wanting to apologize.

228
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:25,674
I've always wanted siblings...

229
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,037
so I guess I just jumped to conclusions.

230
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:29,306
You want siblings?

231
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:30,579
Yeah.

232
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:33,349
It's not like I can just get
them by asking for them,

233
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:35,417
so I never told Mom...

234
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,449
I wonder why...

235
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,689
I've envied relationships where

236
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,096
you can harass and support each other.

237
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:46,990
Because we were alone.

238
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,867
And then, POW there's this cute
little girl right in front of my eyes.

240
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:52,464
I thought, this had to be it.

241
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,964
I'm really sorry.

242
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:59,577
Well, that's all. Iwanted to
apologize for myself...

244
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,577
...and not because of any ulterior
motive to gain favors for my mom.

245
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,654
I hope I'll see you again.

246
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:08,348
Later.

247
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,967
I want to talk some more.

248
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:22,365
Can't we talk?

249
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,261
Okay, want to go to my place?

250
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:26,931
It's a short train ride away.

251
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:02,737
Let's get some ice cream at the minimart.

252
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:09,908
What'll it be?

253
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:13,751
Let's see... a Hagen-Daaz.

254
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,882
Are you siblings? What a cute little sister!

255
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:18,850
Please come again.

256
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:24,293
"Siblings", she said.

257
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:25,254
Come on! Come on!

258
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,132
Yes!

259
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,860
Man, it's hot in here.

260
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:37,538
Gotta open the window!

261
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,117
Come on in!

262
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,551
Pretty small, isn't it. Surprised?

263
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:48,782
Uh-uh.

264
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,184
Aw shit! I left the miso soup out!

265
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,954
Oh man, it smells funky!

266
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,463
Hang on a sec while I do the laundry.

267
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:00,165
It's my turn today.

268
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,362
Oww..

269
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,380
I wanted to go home somewhere.

270
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:25,053
The homesickness pierces my heart.

271
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,093
Is that good?

272
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:39,502
How about yours?

273
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:41,802
Want a taste?

274
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:51,846
See you later!

275
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:53,150
Okay, bye-bye! 

276
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,111
Later...

277
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:02,252
I can really relax with you around.

278
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,425
I wonder why? We've only just met.

279
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,467
Well, it's natural.

280
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:14,906
We've led the same lives up until now.

281
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,569
Opening the door to find nobody there.

282
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,938
We both experienced that loneliness.

283
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,474
We know that without having to say it.

284
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,143
Because we're the same.

285
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:30,123
I see.

286
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,827
Then we're already like siblings.

288
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:40,692
Yeah. Like siblings.

289
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,400
For the first time, I
understood what Daddy meant.

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Someone who could understand is by my side.

291
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,775
It would be so reassuring to have
someone like that waiting for you at home.

294
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,411
It was a lie to say
that all I needed was Daddy.

295
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,314
I know that now.

296
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,849
I was lonely all by myself.

297
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,754
I was lonely... Dad.

298
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:21,872
I'm home!
Hey, something smells good!

300
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:25,710
You hardly ever have dinner
ready. What were you...?

301
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:27,205
Welcome back.

302
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,545
Hello.

303
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,175
Tsubasa-chan!

304
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:32,542
We bumped into each other in town.

305
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,753
So I came to visit.

306
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,295
O.. Oh no! You came into this filthy house?!

307
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,853
We hadn't even cleaned it!

308
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,726
Tsubasa-chan's a young
lady from Yamanote!

310
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:50,666
What's a little roach like you
doing inviting her over, you idiot!

312
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,028
OW!

313
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,366
Look at these clothes lying all over the place!

314
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:59,075
And the closet open for the world to see!

316
00:16:59,713 --> 00:17:01,305
The garbage didn't get taken out...

317
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:02,579
It was your turn!

318
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:04,540
No it wasn't!

319
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:09,917
You've done nothing but
embarass me from the beginning!

321
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,058
Is it on purpose!? Are you doing it on purpose?!
[Kids... umm... Mothers, don't do this at home.]

322
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,324
I didn't do swuat, ow! Uncle, uncle!

323
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,200
ho ho ho ho

324
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,867
O..oh, pardon me. How unbecoming.

325
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,172
Have you been pretending
to be reserved all this time?

326
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:34,209
Well, yes but...

328
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:35,612
Oh, don't get the wrong idea!

329
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,640
I act like myself
in front of Toshiharu-san.

331
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,480
I really wanted a little girl...

332
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,217
...and you're so cute...
I wanted to be your mother so badly...

333
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:48,693
Have I disappointed you?
[You saying you don't want a son?!!]

334
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,366
No. You're just like a friend of mine.

335
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:07,171
Is it true that Tsubasa is over here?

337
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:08,308
Oh, Daddy.

338
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:09,271
Toshiharu-san.

339
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,881
Good evening.

340
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:20,318
See ya.

341
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,262
Next time let me come over to your place.

342
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:25,931
I want to see what a Yamanote house is like.

343
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,367
Sure. I want to introduce you to my friends too.

344
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,408
I think you would be
perfect for a naive...

347
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:45,181
...unworldly guy like my dad.
Take good care of him.

348
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:47,683
Does that mean...

349
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Now then...

350
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,427
Let's all be happy.

351
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:02,761
The next day, the two

352
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:04,761
were happily registered.

353
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,706
And shortly after the four of
them began living together.

354
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,170
Yo, Kazuma!

355
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,404
We heard your old lady got remarried!

356
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,907
Happy Marriage!

357
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,607
We came to help you move.

358
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,353
Oh shit! Tsubasa, hide!

359
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,457
LOVELY!

360
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:28,691
L..L..LOVEL Y!

361
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:31,087
Quit it!

362
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,488
Whoa, LOVELY! Smooooch!

363
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,432
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

364
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,104
Your face is covered in dirt!

365
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:43,203
Let me clean it off for you - smooooch!

366
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,304
I wonder if that's
really just brotherly love?

368
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,338
Can stepchildren get married?

369
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:49,441
What?

370
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:53,501
What'll happen next!

371
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:55,234
Our program, "His and Her Circumstances,"

372
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:57,631
which has gotten favorable reviews,...

373
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,933
...has finally come to the midpoint of the series!

374
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,970
So we'd like to look back on
the path we've come so far!

375
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,413
Next time on KareKano:
What's Happened So Far.

376
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,181
With our deepest gratitude!
