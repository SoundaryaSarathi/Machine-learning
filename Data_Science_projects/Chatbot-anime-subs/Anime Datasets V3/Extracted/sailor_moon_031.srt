1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,004
Autumn, it is the season for maidens.

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,505
That goes for earthworms,
mole crickets,

3
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,507
pond skaters, and even Rei.

4
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,476
Everyone! Everyone falls in love!

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:14,613
Anyone who gets in the way of human
love, or rather, animal love...

6
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:19,516
In the name of SPCA, Sailor
Moon will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

8
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

10
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,327
Guided by the light of the moon

12
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

13
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:35,807
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

17
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,501
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of
love and justice, Sailor Moon.

18
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,277
But it's not easy, you know.

19
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:08,214
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

20
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,216
before the bad guys get it,

21
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:14,880
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

22
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,525
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

23
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,356
so it'll work out somehow.

24
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:32,260
Loved and Chased!
Luna's Worst Day Ever

25
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,414
No need for Heaven and Earth

26
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,901
Rhett Butler!

27
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,340
Rhett Butler!

28
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,747
I was so worried about you!

29
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,317
He definitely doesn't look
like a Rhett Butler.

30
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,357
Well, well...

31
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:41,299
So, this little girl possesses
a rainbow crystal?

32
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:46,662
The seventh rainbow crystal
should be easy to obtain.

33
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:02,354
You certainly got dragged
into a terrible mess.

34
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:03,389
No kidding.

35
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,326
I've got nothing to do with turf
wars among stray cats.

36
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,816
Hi there!

37
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,828
Thanks for waiting.

38
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,165
Oh? Where's Rei?

39
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:14,833
What? Oh, well...

40
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,734
She said she wanted to go on
a date because it's Sunday.

41
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,640
What?!

42
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:29,806
Hello, this is Chiba.

43
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,844
Hello? It's Rei!

44
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:34,987
I am not at home right now.

45
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:35,821
Please leave a message
after the beep.

46
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:37,288
Oh, no...
Please leave a message
after the beep.

47
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,827
Oh, hello? This is Rei.

48
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:46,265
Well, actually I found a very unusual
cake at a certain shop,

49
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,133
and I was wondering if you'd
want to try it with me.

50
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,602
The cake is called tiramisu.

51
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,303
I might not look it, and
I don't mean to brag,

52
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:51,704
The seventh rainbow crystal...
I might not look it, and
I don't mean to brag,

53
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:53,439
The seventh rainbow crystal...
but I'm very hip and know what's new.

54
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,803
But I'm very hip and know what's new.

55
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,775
I will get it no matter what.
Oh, what am I saying?
I'm just so nervous.

56
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:57,605
Oh, what am I saying?
I'm just so nervous.

57
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:01,743
What in the world are you doing?

58
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:04,806
I'm looking for the seventh
rainbow crystal.

59
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,687
What? The Crescent Moon Wand
hasn't responded at all.

60
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,490
That's why we're using the
computer to narrow down

61
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,492
where the seventh crystal might be.

62
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,154
We finally got the data to do that.

63
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:17,896
Really!

64
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:18,397
Luna!
Really!

65
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:19,398
Luna!
Oh!

66
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:19,598
Oh!

67
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,429
The data input has finished.

68
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,541
This is where the seventh
rainbow crystal must be.

69
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,008
What?

70
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:39,985
So, the rainbow crystal is somewhere
near that house?

71
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,475
Yes, it should be.

72
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:54,057
Oh, I didn't know that cat
lived at this house.

73
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,001
Okay, let's go.

74
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,537
Oh, I'll just wait here.

75
00:06:58,537 --> 00:06:59,505
What's wrong?

76
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:00,039
Well...
What's wrong?

77
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:00,971
Well...

78
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,876
Luna, this is an important mission!

79
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,178
You should be more aware of that!

80
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,415
Excuse me. I am not that ugly.

81
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,883
Ugly...

82
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,718
Oh, it doesn't really matter.

83
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,454
I'm sure even Luna has days when
she doesn't feel up to it.

84
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,183
Oh, fine, meow.

85
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,725
Then, wait there for a bit, okay?

86
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,760
Don't go anywhere!

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,227
Yes, Ma'am.

88
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:28,355
Honestly! Usagi takes every
opportunity she can...

89
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:48,821
Oh, no!

90
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,550
Tadahisa Kohara
Mimi
Anna

91
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,927
Yes?

92
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:55,661
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Is your mother or father home?
Yes?

93
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,994
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Is your mother or father home?

94
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:02,627
Both of them won't be home
until the evening.

95
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,403
The Wand is responding.

96
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,635
That little girl is a monster?

97
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,879
Oh, no, you can't!

98
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,778
Come back, Rhett Butler!

99
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,987
Rhett Butler?

100
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:33,456
Under Construction

101
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:39,259
Now, time to take the rainbow crystal.

102
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,444
Why?! Why isn't the rainbow
crystal appearing?!

103
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,119
Shoot!

104
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,679
So, that ugly cat is the monster!

105
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,424
I cannot believe I missed that!

106
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:11,163
The final great Monster wasn't
reborn as a human!

107
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:12,653
That's as far as you go!

108
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,503
Now that we're here, we won't
let you have your way!

109
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:20,097
We won't let such an innocent young
girl become a monster!

110
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:23,642
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

111
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:24,977
Quiet!

112
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,444
Zoi!

113
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,738
Bubble...

114
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:30,816
Sailor Moon, you're in my way!

115
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:33,046
What do you want me to do?

116
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:35,353
I changed my mind.

117
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,414
I'm too busy to play with you guys.

118
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,760
You're not getting away!

119
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,161
Supreme...

120
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,463
Wait a minute!

121
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,431
We'll all be electrocuted!

122
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:00,642
What is this rotten smell?

123
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,883
Is that ugly cat really somewhere
around here?

124
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:08,053
This is why I hate monsters
that aren't human.

125
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,487
Oh, no!

126
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:15,281
This may be the toughest ordeal
I have ever faced!

127
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,856
But where has Luna gone?

128
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:50,496
Yeah! She's so undependable!

129
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,399
Where in the world is she goofing
off at this critical time?!

130
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,768
Knowing Luna, I'm sure that's not it.

131
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,171
Maybe something's happened to her.

132
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,036
Oh!

133
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:04,438
There's a cartridge of the Sailor V
game over here!

134
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,278
Usagi...

135
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:10,350
Right when Zoisite could be back
any moment to attack us.

136
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,354
But I can't believe such a little
girl has a rainbow crystal.

137
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,788
We absolutely cannot let this
girl turn into a monster.

138
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,899
It's close. It's getting close.

139
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,493
That ugly cat is very close by.

140
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,631
It's warm...

141
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,150
It's a horde of rats!

142
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,859
Jubancho Shopping District

143
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:59,253
Oh, where could Mamoru have gone?

144
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,934
It's such a nice Sunday, too.

145
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,401
Miss Rei!

146
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,172
Yuichiro!

147
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:06,572
Japanese Boy
I Am Beautiful
Yuichiro!

148
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,809
Japanese Boy
I Am Beautiful
Oh, that's right. You're off
today, too, aren't you?

149
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:10,276
Oh, that's right. You're off
today, too, aren't you?

150
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,278
Yes, but I have nothing to do.

151
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:13,146
Now's Your Chance!
Yes, but I have nothing to do.

152
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:14,347
Now's Your Chance!
How about going for tea or
something together?

153
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:14,614
How about going for tea or
something together?

154
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:14,947
Autumn Fragrance
How about going for tea or
something together?

155
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,382
Autumn Fragrance
What?!

156
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:19,552
Autumn Fragrance
Oh, well, I don't know.

157
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:20,484
Autumn Fragrance

158
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:21,721
You're Going To Take That?!

159
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,256
You're Going To Take That?!
What was I thinking?

160
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:24,791
You're Going To Take That?!
Of course, a wonderful girl like you

161
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,693
You're Going To Take That?!
Wouldn't have lots of spare
time on her hands.

162
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:27,591
Wouldn't have lots of spare
time on her hands.

163
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,992
Well, something like that.

164
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,433
I understand. Well, I'll be going then.

165
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,230
Oh, excuse me...

166
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:39,772
What was that? He's so restless.

167
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:42,400
It's like "Gone with the Wind."

168
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:47,507
There's no exit anywhere!

169
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,879
Today is not my lucky day!
It's all because you...

170
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:02,125
What's this? You hurt your leg.

171
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:06,930
Did you hurt yourself while
you were saving me?

172
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:12,462
You went through all that
just to save me?

173
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,203
Do you have a crush on
me or something?

174
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:19,344
Hey, now...

175
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,349
That's...

176
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,794
Zoisite!

177
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:39,398
I've found you! The seventh
great Monster!

178
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:43,391
What?! You have one of
the rainbow crystals?!

179
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:49,575
Hurry! He won't be able
to follow us in here!

180
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,600
You're not getting away from me!

181
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,411
What is that?!

182
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,391
The rainbow crystal is mine!

183
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,969
Oh, no! Run faster!

184
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:35,282
It's the exit!

185
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,155
I should've gone on a date
with Yuichiro.

186
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,329
It's Luna.

187
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:47,260
With her boyfriend, I see.
Well, great for her.

188
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,169
Gag! What the hell is that?!

189
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:01,180
Oh! The Crescent Moon Wand
isn't responding!

190
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,377
Why didn't I notice this earlier?

191
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:08,416
That means this girl isn't involved.

192
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:12,921
Then, why was it responding earlier?

193
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,596
Could it be...

194
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:19,690
That's right! It was responding
to that cat!

195
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,662
It's game over!

196
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,740
Run faster!

197
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:41,449
Turn a misfortune into a blessing.

198
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:45,579
Hi. All's well that ends well, I guess.

199
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,861
Fire Soul!

200
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,436
I'm a sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Mars!

201
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,306
I have arrived!

202
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,917
I won't let you interfere
with their love!

203
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,985
Even if they're cats,
love is still love!

204
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,452
No!

205
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:19,151
The fire of passion is burning!
The fire of justice is burning!

206
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:21,827
Anybody who gets in the way of love,

207
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:25,024
or rather, the love between beasts...

208
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:28,857
In the name of Mars, Sailor
Mars will chastise you!

209
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:31,936
You're such a dummy.

210
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,774
Zoi!

211
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:40,204
Consider the situation before
you start posing!

212
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,886
This time, I will be sure to take
the rainbow crystal!

213
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,947
Rhett Butler!

214
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,652
Rhett Butler!

215
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,466
Now, finish them off, great Monster!

216
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,301
There aren't so many of them today,

217
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,201
so it should be an easy victory!

218
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:40,762
Oh, ouch!

219
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:47,179
The last rainbow crystal is mine.
Good-bye.

220
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:52,951
Damn you, Tuxedo Mask!
Stop right there!

221
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,421
I said, stop!

222
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:57,390
Oh, no, it's heading towards the town!

223
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,324
No!

224
00:18:58,324 --> 00:18:58,891
Luna!
No!

225
00:18:58,891 --> 00:18:59,325
Luna!

226
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:03,728
No, no, no, no! No!
Please stay there!

227
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,724
I'll get you back to the way you
were soon, I promise!

228
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,930
Luna!

229
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:29,153
Rhett Butler...

230
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:39,965
Don't worry.

231
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:43,162
Usagi will restore you to
the way you were.

232
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,374
So, they are lovers,
just as I thought.

233
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,141
Bubble

234
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,484
Spray!

235
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:07,323
No! How could she ruin the mood?!

236
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,006
Sailor Jupiter!

237
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,867
Thank you for waiting!

238
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:28,247
What were you doing?! You're late!

239
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,016
I'm sorry, it's because I wasn't
paying attention.

240
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,385
Oh, it has nothing to
do with the fact

241
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,488
that Usagi was playing a video game!

242
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:38,524
That's right! It wasn't
Usagi's fault at all!

243
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:41,823
Oh, boy. You're not helping at all.

244
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:45,631
Hey, this is no time for
stand-up comedy!

245
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,031
Oh, right. Okay!

246
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:59,001
Moon Healing Escalation!

247
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,315
Refresh!

248
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,785
Good grief.

249
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,168
I was so worried about you,
Rhett Butler!

250
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:23,235
She looks so happy.
I was so worried about you,
Rhett Butler!

251
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:25,004
She looks so happy.

252
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:28,440
Luna, are you sure you don't need to
say good-bye to your boyfriend?

253
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,177
What?! Luna has hooked
up with that cat?!

254
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:33,646
Don't be ridiculous!

255
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,114
Woohoo! You go, Luna!

256
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,886
Honestly! Not you, too, Usagi.

257
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:43,354
Don't just make things up, okay?

258
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,207
Hey, now...

259
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,809
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

260
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:18,425
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

261
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:26,161
It's a world no one knows about

262
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:30,063
With white shoes clicking

263
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:33,873
Cross the white moon bridge

264
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:41,973
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

265
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:48,617
Offer a prayer to the moon

266
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:57,358
It will surely bring you happiness

267
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:04,566
Go round and round, the moon's
merry-go-round

268
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:12,841
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

269
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:20,387
She's always watching over us

270
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:26,883
Moon, moon princess
