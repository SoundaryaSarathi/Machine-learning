wagging its tail.

it'll put the flame out.

00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,935
[Brock] Hold on!
You can make it, Charmander.

172
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,818
[door opens]

173
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,237
Joy, please help us.

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,613
[Joy] What is it? What's wrong?

175
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,325
-This Charmander is in bad shape.
-The flame on its tail...

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,162
[gasps There's not much time.

177
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,498
[wind whooshing]

178
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:28,169
[machine bleeping]

179
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,173
-[Brock] Will it survive?
-[Joy] Charmander is very weak.

180
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,843
How could you let it get
into this condition?

181
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,971
It's not our fault.
Damian's the one who abandoned it.

182
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,930
What?

183
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,392
Well, Damian promised Charmander
to come back for it.

184
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,395
Charmander's loyal to Damian,
so it believed him.

185
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,896
Poor Charmander.

186
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,232
And Damian just left
with the rest of them.

187
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,610
Joy, I'm begging you.
Please, save it.

188
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,821
Charmander has got to get better.

189
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,782
I'll do whatever I can.

190
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,050
[wind whooshing]

191
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,845
[in mind]
<i>Charmander, you've got to hold on.</i>

192
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,014
<i>Please, keep your flame burning.</i>

193
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,435
[dings]

194
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,895
[all] Huh?

195
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,773
Mm.

196
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,525
[all sigh]

197
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,237
Charmander's recovering.
It should be fine by morning.

198
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,200
[in mind]
<i>That's the spirit, Charmander.</i>

199
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,585
[all snoring]

200
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,841
[grunts]

201
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,261
-[Brock] Wake up, everybody!
-Ah! [grunts]

202
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,472
-What's up, Brock?
-Yeah, what's the matter?

203
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,765
Pikachu?

204
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,936
It's Charmander.
Charmander has disappeared from the ER!

205
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,145
[Ash] But how?

206
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,111
I bet it went back to
that rock to wait for Damian.

207
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,822
-We got to go back.
-But that's no use.

208
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,866
We can't force Charmander
to come with us

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,578
if it wants to wait for Damian,
even if he is a lying creep.

210
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:30,291
She's right. There's nothing you can do
until Charmander realizes the truth.

211
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,018
Oh, I thought Charmander understood
that we cared about it.

212
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,523
Brock, Charmander knew that we cared
but don't you see?

213
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,068
It couldn't forget about Damian.
It's still loyal to him.

214
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,195
-Chu.
-That's why it went back.

215
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,989
Hmm. Unh!

216
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,950
Come on!
Route 24 is just ahead.

217
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,912
Once we get to Vermilion City,
there will be plenty of Pokémon.

218
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,038
[Brock sighs]

219
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,211
To protect the world from devastation...

220
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,422
To unite all peoples within our nation...

221
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,133
[both] To denounce the evils
of truth and love,

222
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,385
to extend our reach
to the stars above.

223
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,722
-Jessie.
-James.

224
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,182
Mm, mind if I cut in?

225
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,685
Huddle up!
They're going to be here soon.

226
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,646
Finally, a foolproof plan
to capture Pikachu.

227
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,939
I'm so excited.

228
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:39,527
I can't wait to test our new automatic,
high-speed, super-duper, whatchamacallit!

229
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,112
[Jessie and James] Start it up.

230
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,035
So, what does this thing do, anyway?

231
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,165
[clanking and whirring]

232
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,919
Not another hole driller!
We tried that already!

233
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,380
If at first you don't succeed...

234
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,383
This time, we'll remember
where the hole is.

235
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,308
Are you sure you're going to remember
where the trap is?

236
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,811
Meowth, don't you think
we're smarter than that?

237
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,396
[sighs]

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,273
-Our trap is set.
-Huh?

239
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,193
Hey, here they come now!

240
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:27,992
[bleeping]

241
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,373
Hm, they're getting warm.

242
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,042
-[chuckles] Warmer...
-They're burning up.

243
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,340
It's too strong.
You used too many tree branches.

244
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,801
Me? You're the one
who covered it with too much dirt.

245
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,843
[growls]

246
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,844
Meowth!

247
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,389
Quiet.

248
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,102
-Whoa, you feel something?
-I did.

249
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,311
Huh? Feel what?

250
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,438
[rumbling]

251
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,898
[all yell]

252
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,361
Pikachu.

253
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,823
[all groaning]

254
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,825
Pika, pika?

255
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,784
[squeaks]

256
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,494
[Meowth] I can't believe they fell for it.

257
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
[Jessie] Our invention worked.
We're geniuses!

258
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,166
-Pi.
-Come with us, Pikachu.

259
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,211
-You belong to us now.
-[Pikachu] Chu!

260
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,755
[James]
Rubber won't conduct electricity.

261
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,758
[Jessie] Just another example
of our incredible genius at work.

262
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:30,304
You have to be a rocket scientist to
outsmart us, the team rocket scientists.

263
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,057
We call these our anti-Pikachu suits.

264
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,642
We made them ourselves.

265
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,228
I must admit, I don't think
this is really my color at all.

266
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,565
Enough talk! Let's just grab
the Pikachu and get out of here!

267
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,108
[gasps]

268
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,361
[James] We'll use our anti-Pikachu
rubber balloon bazooka.

269
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,864
Ready. Aim. Fire!

270
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,329
[whimpers]

271
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,416
[pants]

272
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:06,090
[pants]

273
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,472
Chu!

274
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,058
[all] Pikachu, Pikachu!

275
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,437
Pikachu!

276
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,771
Pikachu!

277
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,903
[grunts]

278
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,739
Come on, you guys, get up!
We got to do something!

279
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,701
We'd love to get up Ash.
Unfortunately, you're standing on us.

280
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,662
[Jessie cackles]

281
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,999
Hello down there.
Thank you so much for dropping in.

282
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,128
Don't worry. Pikachu is safe with us.
We won't lose it like you did.

283
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,838
Chu.

284
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,633
-Pikachu.
-Let's get out of here.

285
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,218
[Charmander] Charmander!

286
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,054
[Jessie] What is that thing?

287
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,681
Charmander.

288
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,393
It's saying you better give Pikachu
back to those guys right now.

289
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,229
It's got to be kidding.

290
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,023
Now, step aside,
you insolent little firebug.

291
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,566
We haven't got time to play with you.

292
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,028
Team rocket plays rough
so get moving.

293
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,408
[all] Huh?

294
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,870
Char!

295
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,289
[all groan]

296
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,582
[all scream]

297
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,545
You see, didn't I tell you
we needed fireproof uniforms?

298
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,046
Shut up and keep running!

299
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,965
Some geniuses. Meowth!

300
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,218
[Team Rocket] Looks like
Team Rocket's blasting off again!

301
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,719
Charmander beat them?

302
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,808
Unh! Wow!
Thanks for the help, Charmander.

303
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,394
You see, Brock?
Charmander knew we cared.

304
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
-That's why it's here.
-Way to go.

305
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,066
Charmander, how'd you like
to join up with us?

306
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,152
I'm afraid your trainer
isn't going to be coming back.

307
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,364
Hi, Charmander. Been looking
all over for you.

308
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,577
-Damian, it's you!
-What do you want, Damian?

309
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,580
I came back for Charmander
just like I promised.

310
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,747
[all gasp]

311
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,457
So let's go.

312
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,709
[whimpering]

313
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,673
Careful. This trainer's already
abandoned you once before.

314
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,385
Charmander is mine.
I'm the one who caught it, remember?

315
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,555
Damian, you bragged about
how you abandoned it.

316
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,266
Good thing I did.
That toughened it up.

317
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,269
Besides, what's wrong with dumping
off a weak Pokémon'

318
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,562
[gasps]

319
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,772
I wasn't going to come back for it,

320
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:31,527
but now that I've seen what it can do,
I'm real glad I ran into you guys.

321
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,531
The best thing is, I didn't have to
raise it myself!

322
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,574
That's terrible.

323
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,784
Raising a Pokémon
is the best part of being a trainer.

324
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,121
You wish!
It's the most boring part of the job.

325
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,498
How dare you call yourself
a Pokémon trainer!

326
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,126
You see?
He doesn't care about you.

327
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,837
He just wants to use you
to win matches.

328
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,672
-Charmander.
-Charmander.

329
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,634
Charmander, return!

330
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,135
[squeaks]

331
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,722
Ah! [groans]

332
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,475
[all gasp]

333
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,647
That does it! I'll crush you
with every Pokémon I've got!

334
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,565
Char!

335
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,610
Chu!

336
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:17,114
[yelling]

337
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,450
[sobs] Mommy!

338
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,079
-[Brock] Way to go, Charmander!
-[Ash] Yeah, good work.

339
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,340
Go ahead, Ash. You get Charmander.
It'll be a great Pokémon.

340
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,718
But, Brock, you saved it,
so you deserve it, I guess.

341
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,597
Right, but don't forget, you're the one
who kept the flame on its tail lit.
