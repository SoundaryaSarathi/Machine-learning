Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.68,0:03:10.21,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.21,0:03:14.42,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Mangas appear in Jack by order of popularity, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.32,0:03:17.52,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,It isn't entirely in order by popularity,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.52,0:03:19.05,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,but if you exclude gag manga,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.05,0:03:21.45,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,well, I guess you could say the more popular mangas are farther forward
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.45,0:03:24.64,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,and the less popular mangas are more towards the back.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.64,0:03:26.25,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Why do they do that?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.25,0:03:28.81,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Why? Even most other magazines do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.81,0:03:31.61,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,I just think it's unfair.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.13,0:03:37.61,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,The print order gives the readers a preconception that some mangas are popular and some aren't.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.63,0:03:41.28,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,There must be a lot of kids who feel they have to read the same mangas as everyone else.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.28,0:03:44.41,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,I think making the order a rotation would be more fair.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.15,0:03:44.41,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}What're you saying, Fukuda-san?{\i0} {This is said over Fukuda's last line.}
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.94,0:03:48.45,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,That way, you can be sure the questionnaire results will subtly change.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.45,0:03:51.71,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Appearance order creates a disparity in the manga.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.71,0:03:52.85,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Tell you what...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.85,0:03:56.37,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,you can say all the self-righteous things you want once you've been serialized and taken the world by storm!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.37,0:03:58.67,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Please just calm down and listen to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.67,0:04:01.59,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,I'm only giving you an opinion.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.59,0:04:04.34,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,What's more, I'm not happy about how it's just the questionnaire results
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.34,0:04:06.55,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,that determine which mangas are popular and which get canceled.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.15,0:04:09.75,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,The editorial department should decide which mangas are popular and which aren't themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.75,0:04:13.81,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Doing it this way is like saying you have no ability to do it yourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.73,0:04:18.44,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Fu–Fukuda-kun, you'd better make sure not to say things like that at the editorial department.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.20,0:04:22.70,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I think everyone has potential, so I'll hear you out, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.70,0:04:24.69,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Then listen up.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.70,0:04:28.12,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,If a manga doesn't get flashy from the start, particularly if it doesn't reach a climax in chapter one,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.12,0:04:29.36,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,then it ends up on the course to cancellation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.01,0:04:32.65,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,That's because cancellation could already be decided as soon as chapter three.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.19,0:04:37.87,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Therefore, everyone is too scared to draw a manga that starts out subdued and gradually gets more interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.87,0:04:41.00,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,That results in every work having somewhat the same flavor as all the others.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.63,0:04:44.77,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,If the editorial department had enough confidence in it to start it as a new series,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.77,0:04:48.88,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,then don't you think they should at least watch over it until there's a collected volume of it out?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.88,0:04:54.02,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,If we gave that sort of leeway to every new series, no more than five new series would start per year.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.02,0:04:56.12,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,But I think there are ones like that;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.12,0:04:59.23,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,mangas that start out subdued, but get gradually more interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.17,0:05:03.33,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Like where the protagonist starts out completely unskilled but works really hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.83,0:05:07.07,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,With the current system, you can't get popular by starting out that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.10,0:05:10.46,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, well even in that type of manga,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.46,0:05:13.54,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,you need to come up with something to interesting before it gets canceled.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.26,0:05:17.15,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Say, Fukuda-kun, are you drawing one like that now?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.15,0:05:17.96,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,Ah,no.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.08,0:05:23.44,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,I'm writing a name in which the protagonist wins right from chapter one, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.44,0:05:29.47,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,Then all you're saying is if you get serialized, you'd like us to be patient with you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.50,0:05:33.61,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,I won't say that looking objectively at how the magazine does things is bad,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.61,0:05:36.18,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,but that's the editorial department's job.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.18,0:05:39.56,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,You should be concentrating on your own work first and foremost.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.56,0:05:40.60,Main,Yuujirou,0000,0000,0000,,So long.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.40,0:05:43.78,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,Fukuda-sensei!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.78,0:05:46.47,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,You've moved me!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.47,0:05:48.42,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,Especially the order rotation!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.42,0:05:49.25,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,It's good!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.25,0:05:50.32,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,It's fair!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.34,0:05:52.45,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,I never would  have thought of something like that!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.45,0:05:56.75,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,It kind of sounds like everyone's only concerned with doing well in the questionnaires.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.30,0:05:59.21,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,That's not good for manga.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.21,0:06:02.46,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,If you draw manga only for the sake of questionnaire results, your manga will end.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.46,0:06:03.33,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,I know, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.33,0:06:06.46,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,In Jack, my favorite manga is {\i1}To Love-Ru{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.46,0:06:07.67,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Eh?! I didn't expect that!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.07,0:06:10.02,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,But it does really badly in the questionnaires.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.02,0:06:11.30,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Ah, I know what you're talking about!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.30,0:06:12.55,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.55,0:06:14.16,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,It's kinda ecchi,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.16,0:06:18.06,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,so most people don't want anyone to know it would be one they choose in their "three most interesting".
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.52,0:06:20.21,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,There are times when...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.21,0:06:23.32,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,even I've sent in questionnaires without writing in the numbers for mangas I liked, such as{\i1} Ichigo 100%{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.31,0:06:26.23,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,{\i1}He's sent in questionnaires...{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.23,0:06:31.05,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,There are probably even grade schoolers who ask their parents to mail the questionnaires for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.25,0:06:34.13,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,So it must be hard for them to choose To Love-Ru!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.13,0:06:35.00,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I understand!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.00,0:06:36.66,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,Mm, because it's so ecchi.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.66,0:06:41.56,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,But {\i1}To Love-Ru{\i0} is a man's shounen manga.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.90,0:06:46.00,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,But I think with {\i1}To Love-Ru{\i0}, they take that into consideration.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.98,0:06:53.53,Main,Eiji,0000,0000,0000,,Where?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.53,0:06:57.09,Main,Fukuda,0000,0000,0000,,If it sells, I want them to pump out more color pages and stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.09,0:07:00.56,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Well, if there are too many ecchi images on the cover, the magazine's image will—
