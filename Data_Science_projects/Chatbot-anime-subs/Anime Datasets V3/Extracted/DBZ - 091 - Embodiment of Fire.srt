00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,710
"Showdown!! The Embodiment of Flame
in a 20x Kaio-ken Kamehame-Ha"

2
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,020
That's our Freeza-sama! He's just
playing with Goku! Such composure!

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,990
W- Who the hell are you!?

4
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,670
W- Who, me?

5
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,340
He's a frog! A frog, I tell you!

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,020
CHAN-GE!!

7
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,040
T- Then, this frog is...

8
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,370
B- Bulma-san?

9
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,650
Haven't I been saying so all this time!?

10
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,650
I'll send you all to hell!

11
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,350
I'll never get anywhere like this.

12
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,350
Your body is mine!

13
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,360
CHAN-GE!

14
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,020
What!?

15
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,350
Piccolo, watch out!

16
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,700
I... I can't... move... !

17
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,870
Piccolo-san!

18
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,840
P- Piccolo-san...

19
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,680
W- What happened?

20
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:55,030
My hands... my feet... my body...
My cheek... !

21
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,930
Yea! Yea, yea! I'm back in
my original body!

22
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Ow, ow! T- Thank goodness, Bulma-san, but it's very
dangerous here! If you don't take cover soon...

23
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,690
Enough already!

24
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,350
Bulma-san!

25
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,020
Get over here and save me!

26
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,350
This is getting ridiculous. You can
entertain me a little bit more, if you like.

27
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,010
What a technique!

28
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,020
As I told you, If I had to, I could destroy
this whole planet.

29
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,680
I am the one who destroyed
Planet Vegeta.

30
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,360
l- I've had it.

31
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,700
I can't win.

32
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,050
W- What did he do?

33
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,720
H- He's cut the whole planet!

34
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,560
N- Never mind that, I have to wonder
if Goku is planning something.

35
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,720
It looks like he's starting to take a
one-sided beating!

36
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,290
- He's got no plan!

37
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,740
- The fact is, Freeza's power is greater
than we could have thought!

38
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,370
You don't have to worry. I wouldn't kill
you instantly with something like that.

39
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,700
D- Dammit...

40
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to
placate my anger.

41
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,390
So, how about Goku?

42
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:23,840
Even using his upper limit of a 10x Kaio-ken,
is Son being defeated, Kaio-sama?

43
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,000
On top of that, Freeza seems to only
be using half of his power!

44
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,250
T- That can't be!

45
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,350
This is why I told him that no matter
what happens, he must not
set his hand to Freeza.

46
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,360
He has lost!

47
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,370
So, then...

48
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,700
What can I do to cause you the most pain?

49
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,370
Should I break your arm? Rip off your
ears? Or perhaps I'll slit your throat.

50
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,550
T- The only thing I can do is pull up to a
20x Kaio-ken somehow!

51
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,380
My body may not be able to
handle it, though.

52
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:38,730
But if, like he says, he really is only
using fifty percent of his power now,
there ain't nothing else I can do...

53
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,730
It's much too late for you to start
agonizing. You're the one who
started this, after all.

54
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,740
You will become my toy, until I
grow tired of you!

55
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
What's the matter? If you don't resist a little for me,
I will find you unresponsive and get bored!

56
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,950
Hey, hey, the fun is just beginning!

57
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,230
It's much too soon for you to
be going to bed!

58
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,220
It's no use!

59
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,250
How does it feel to become a fish?

60
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,260
Kuririn!

61
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:08,940
- Goku-sa!
- G- Goku!

62
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:19,480
- Chichi! Where are you!?
- Old Man Turtle Hermit! Oolong!

63
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,880
O- Old Timer!

64
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,220
Chichi!

65
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,890
Goku-sa! ...Goku-sa! ...

66
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,560
- Father!
- Gohan!

67
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,230
Father!

68
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,560
W- What!?

69
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,740
- Father!
- G- Goku!

70
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,660
For the future of Gohan, Chichi, Earth,
and Planet Namek...

71
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,660
I absolutely must not lose!!

72
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:27,700
Fifty percent power, he says... Whether
those words are a bluff, or whether they ain't,

73
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,210
all I can do is stake everything on a
20x Kaio-ken!

74
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,130
Ka... me...

75
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,140
ha... me...

76
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,300
HA!!

77
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,090
Damn it to hell... !

78
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:38,600
Now that even his twenty-fold Kaio-ken was of no use,
is there any chance of victory left for Goku?
