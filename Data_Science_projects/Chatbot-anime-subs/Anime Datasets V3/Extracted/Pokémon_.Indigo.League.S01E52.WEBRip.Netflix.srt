<i>Todd, their photographer friend,</i>

14
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,698
[chuckles]

15
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,324
Come on. Turn around, Togepi.

16
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,742
[purrs]

17
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:20,330
-Now, don’t be shy. Turn and say Togepi.
-Togepi.

18
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,584
Great! That was a cool shot!

19
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,795
-[woman] <i>Now a Pokémon weather update.</i>
-Huh?

20
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:31,550
<i>Our area will remain clear and sunny today</i>
<i>with highs in the upper 70s so get...</i>

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,844
-Sounds like good weather.
-Pikachu.

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,971
It should be great for taking pictures.

23
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>Pokémon love power!</i>

24
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,269
<i>Find it at our five-star breeding center,</i>

25

<i>where every Pokémon</i>
<i>is treated like a loved one!</i>

00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,569
<i>and then into a Charizard</i>
<i>in just a few short days.</i>

28
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,072
<i>At the five-star breeding center,</i>
<i>a little pampering goes a long way.</i>

29
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,826
<i>Let our experts provide your Pokémon</i>
<i>with our loving care.</i>

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,331
<i>So, why go through all the fuss when you</i>
<i>can bring your Pokémon to us, huh?</i>

31
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,665
What’s that?

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,335
Looks like somebody just opened up
a new breeding center.

33
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,337
-Breeding center?
-The newest thing!

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,465
Breeding centers raise Pokémon
for kids who can’t themselves.

35
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,091
It’s like a Pokémon spa.

36
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,428
A really excellent breeding center
can even help your Pokémon evolve.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,640
Wow! Let’s check it out.

38
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:32,194
There’s no need to push. We have plenty
of rooms left in our luxury suites.

39
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:37,949
We guarantee your Pokémon will soon be
like new and some may even evolve.

40
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,993
She seems really nice.

41
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,912
[gibbers nervously]

42
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,708
And do you know why we’re so popular?
It’s because we believe in love.

43
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,169
We feel every Pokémon is lovable.

44
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,130
-We believe in Pokémon love power.
-Love power.

45
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,215
[both] Yay!

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,634
Love power.

47
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,678
Wow, she sure knows
how to attract customers.

48
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,889
Yeah.

49
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,352
-Our next guest.
-Right this way, please.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,481
-I have a Pokémon, too!
-Well, you’re in the right place.

51
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,109
So, what do I have to do to check
my Pokémon in here?

52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,779
-Misty, you’re leaving one here?
-Yup, I’ll give it a try.

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,365
But which Pokémon?
Not your Staryu.

54
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,825
Togepi’s too young.

55
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,453
My Psyduck. I want to leave
my Psyduck here with you!

56
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,873
It’s so cute.
Don’t you just adore those eyes.

57
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,626
They’re bright and bouncy
as ping-pong balls.

58
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,670
Yeah and I wish I had a paddle.

59
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,923
So, then, is there anything special
you’d like us to do?

60
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,802
For starters, you might try knocking some
common sense into its big, empty head.

61
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,388
There’s an awful lot of unused space
in here.

62
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,016
Hmm, that’s strange.
It looks intelligent to me.

63
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,976
[all grunt]

64
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,312
And you have to change
this clueless-looking face.

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,733
-That’d take a miracle.
-Funny you should say that.

66
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,693
The motto here at our breeding center is:

67
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,404
"A little Pokémon love power
works miracles."

68
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,200
-[Ash] Have fun, Psyduck.
-Bye, Psyduck. Good luck.

69
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,119
Psy.

70
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,164
Psyduck’ll prove
if that place is any good.

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,126
I bet you’re going to just leave
Psyduck there and never go back.

72
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,755
No way!
I’d never abandon Psyduck like that.

73
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,340
Well, I think Psyduck
has some good points.

74
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,009
Want me to take it off your hands?

75
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,178
I caught Psyduck and I plan to keep it,

76
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,638
even if it’s still annoying
when I get it back.

77
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,223
[Todd] That looks tasty.

78
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,225
Hey, it’s a restaurant.

79
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,562
-Come to think of it, I’m really starving.
-Hey, look at this.

80
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,025
[Misty] All-you-can-eat-for free.
All right!

81
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,153
I’m heading straight for the dessert bar.
[chuckles]

82
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,780
It can’t really be free, can it?

83
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,617
There’s got to be a catch, like you got
to order ten dinners to get one free.

84
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,329
Well, I’d eat ten dinners
if they came with ten desserts.

85
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,539
-Ah!
-[man laughs]

86
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,709
No need to eat that much
unless y’all really want to.

87
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,795
The buffet is free on one condition.

88
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,463
[all] What’s the condition?

89
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,132
Well, just show me
my favorite Pokémon

90
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,176
and I’ll treat you to
all the food you can eat,

91
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,470
plus all the deserts
you can eat, too.

92
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,890
-Yeah!
-I’m sure one of us has your favorite.

93
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,185
Okay! Come out, everybody!

94
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,481
Mm, hmm.

95
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,775
[all] Hm.

96
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,777
None of these.

97
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,237
[all] Ah!

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,449
-Well, how about Pikachu?
-Pikachu!

99
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,660
Mm, I’m afraid not.

100
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,786
[groaning]

101
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,416
Maybe your favorite’s Onyx, or Geodude,
or Zubat, or maybe it’s Vulpix.

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,669
Uh-uh.

103
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:41,716
Well, how about Goldeen, Staryu, Starmie,
Horsea or maybe my Togepi?

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,010
None of them is my favorite.

105
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,428
[all] Aw!

106
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,264
But that’s all of our Pokémon.

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,599
Maybe it’s a Pokémon
we haven’t caught yet.

108
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,770
My favorite Pokémon is this one.

109
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,314
[all] Huh? Psyduck?

110
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,941
[Brock] You’re a Psyduck fan?

111
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,610
[Todd]
Hey, that looks like a picture I took.

112
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,948
I think Psyduck is the greatest thing
since the invention of the microwave oven.

113
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,326
I’m such a big fan that whenever
a customer brings in a Psyduck,

114
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,661
I let them eat for free.

115
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,956
Sir, if we come back in a couple minutes,
will you be here?

116
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,544
Sure. I’ve got to wait here for
a delivery of 50 gallons of ice cream.

117
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,589
Yay, yay, yay!
Heh, back in a flash!

118
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,467
That’s typical. It figures Psyduck isn’t
around the one time I really need it.

119
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,303
You’re the one
who left it at that center.

120
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,764
[Misty] Ah, it’s already closed!

121
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,975
Ah, guess we’ll have to come
back tomorrow.

122
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,644
We won’t get that free buffet today.

123
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,480
No way!
I’m getting into that dessert bar now!

124
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,774
There might not be any ice cream
left tomorrow!

125
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,736
Let’s go see if there’s a back way.
[growls]

126
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,240
Hello! Anybody there?
I need to get the Pokémon I left here.

127
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,369
Please come open the door
so I can get back to that dessert buffet.

128
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,830
Huh? It’s open.

129
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,292
Hello? Is there anybody
who can get my Pokémon?

130
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,294
Is there anybody who can help me?

131
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,133
There’s nobody here.

132
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,430
Is there anyone here who can help us?
It’s so dark. I can’t see.

133
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,265
Hey, I got a light.

134
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,069
-Ah, what is this?
-It’s the Pokémon. Oh.

135
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,404
This doesn’t look like
a luxury hotel to me.

136
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,115
This is cruel.
They’re crammed into cages.

137
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,825
Pika.

138
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,537
These Pokémon don’t look like
they want to smile for the camera.

139
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,832
Huh? Hey, here’s your Psyduck.

140
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,796
I have to say, it looks a little smarter
than when I dropped it off.

141
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,050
Take a closer look.
They just pulled its eyes back with tape.

142
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,346
-[Misty] That’s terrible!
-Psy-ay.

143
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,890
[Misty] Huh?

144
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,313
[Ash] What’s that?

145
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,484
[man]
The next Pokémon's a Sandshrew.

146
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,612
[woman] Hm, looks like this one
is in pretty good shape.

147
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,449
It could be very useful, as long as
we can teach it to use fury swipes.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,453
We’ve got an awful lot of Pokémon
piled up in this dump.

149
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,416
Yeah, just goes to prove that
a lot of Pokémon trainers are suckers.

150
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,544
Now all we have to do is pick out
the choice Pokémon

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,131
-and ship them out to the boss.
-We’ll be his absolute favorites.

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,552
-And we’ll be in for a big bonus.
-This breeding center was a great idea.

153
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,015
[both] We believe in love power.
That’s because we love power.

154
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,601
[both laughing]

155
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,523
-[Ash] So it’s all a big fake.
-We’ve got to do something to stop them.

156
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,067
We can’t let them treat Pokémon like this.

157
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,362
-Hey, I think I have an idea.
-Pika, pika?

158
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,699
I’ll take pictures of this place
so everyone can see what’s happening.

159
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,617
Yeah, that’s a great idea.

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,580
<i>So tell me, how is the breeding center</i>
<i>scam going?</i>

161
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:03,209
Very well. As planned, we’ve collected
lots of promising Pokémon.

162
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,587
<i>Excellent. Send them to me immediately.</i>

163
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,131
<i>I want to pick the choice ones for myself.</i>

164
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
[both] Yes, sir.

165
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,303
<i>I want to congratulate the two of you</i>
<i>on your splendid work on this project,</i>

166
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,056
<i>unlike those other blundering idiots.</i>

167
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,515
Just doing our job.

168
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,311
But I don’t know how you put up with
that Jessie or her stupid partner James.

169
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,854
They’re an embarrassment.

170
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,939
<i>They are completely unreliable.</i>

171
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:29,152
<i>It’s a good thing we didn’t tell them</i>
<i>about this plan. They would’ve ruined it.</i>

172
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,238
Butch, Cassidy,
you know I’m counting on you.

173
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,740
[both] Yes, sir.

174
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,076
We won’t disappoint you.

175
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,036
[chuckles]

176
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,791
[camera shutter clicking]

177
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,212
-Todd, take a picture of that. There.
-Huh?

178
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,422
[Todd] Okay.

179
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,593
-Huh?
-What, Butch? Something wrong?

180
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,887
I thought I saw something back there.

181
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,598
-It looked like a flash.
-[all] Oh.

182
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,558
I better go check it out.

183
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,310
[all shudder]

184
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:20,370
[Pikachu] Chu! Pikachu! Chu!

185
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
The light was only from this Pikachu.

186
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,254
-You pulled it off, Pikachu.
-Pika.

187
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,589
[Todd] I think I have all the shots
I’m going to need.

188
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,758
Good. We better get out of here quick.

189
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,345
-Wait, we can’t. Psyduck.
-What’s wrong?

190
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,766
The cage is locked. I can’t just leave
Psyduck trapped in this awful place.

191
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,017
Psyduck.

192
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,686
[rattling]

193
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,647
[Ash] Uh, what’s that?

194
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,607
[all grunt]

195
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,238
-[Jessie] Be quiet as a mouse.
-[Meowth] Did you say Meowth?

196
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,740
[Jessie groans]

197
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,868
This way.

198
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,496
This is so exciting!

199
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,166
-Ugh.
-Keep it quiet, James Bond.

200
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:12,338
Breaking into this breeding center
was genius. It’s a burglar’s dream.

201
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,092
I told you this place was going
to be packed with Pokémon.

202
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,928
And we’re going to steal every last one.

203
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,306
That’ll put us back
on the boss’s good side.

204
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,059
But we’ve never been on
his good side before.

205
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,936
[James] Almost got it.

206
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,731
[Meowth]
All the Pokémon we could ever want.

207
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,316
-[Ash] Hey!
-[all] Huh?

208
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,860
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,446
I put that very same question to you.

210
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,615
Keep it down.
You’ll get us all in trouble.

211
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
How did you get in here anyway?

212
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,454
Don’t tell me you goody-goodies finally
decided to become baddy-baddies.

213
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,956
You’d better not try to take
over our territory.

214
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,167
I knew all along we couldn’t trust you.

215
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,377
Will you shut up! Ah!

216
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,379
This time,
you’re in way over your heads.

217
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,967
She’s right. We better get these Pokémon
out of here fast or we’re all in danger.

218
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,886
I know what you’re doing.

219
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,973
You’re trying to trick us into helping you
steal all these Pokémon for yourselves.

220
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,476
[Misty] Fine, believe what you want.

221
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,518
[all] Huh?

222
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,938
[Cassidy] I knew there was something
rotten back here.

223
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,066
And I was right.
Looks like rats have snuck in.

224
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,652
-What should we do?
-We’ll exterminate them.

225
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,030
-We’re not afraid of creeps like you.
-Let’s mix it up.

226
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,326
-You don’t know who you’re dealing with.
-But we’ll be glad to show you.

227
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,579
[both]
Prepare for trouble and make it double.

228
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,875
-To infect the world with devastation.
-To blight all peoples in every nation.

229
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,628
To denounce the goodness
of truth and love.

230
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,964
To extend our wrath to the stars above.

231
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,424
-Cassidy.
-Butch.

232
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,469
We’re Team Rocket,
circling earth all day and night.

233
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,056
Surrender to us now
or you’ll surely lose the fight.

234
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,557
That’s right.

235
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,017
[snarls]

236
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,310
Copycat!

237
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,980
Does this mean
you belong to Team Rocket, too?

238
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,190
Jessie, it’s been a while.

239
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,316
[grumbles]

240
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,361
-Do you know that girl?
-She used to hang around with me.

241
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,905
She was jealous because I’m so beautiful.

242
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,033
You haven’t changed a bit,
unfortunately for you.

243
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,745
And you’re still a selfish little brat.
How dare you use that motto.

244
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,499
It’s an outrage! It took us months
to find a motto we could swipe!

245
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,126
Steal your own slogan.

246
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,839
Save your arguments for the boss when
he finds out you’re stealing his Pokémon.

247
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,174
-[all gasp]
-We’re in trouble.

248
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,052
The boss is really ticked off
that he hasn’t heard from you.

249
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,303
He thinks it’s insulting!

250
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,432
But we can’t call him
till we do something wrong right.

251
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,767
-He might throw us off the team.
-Ugh.

252
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,895
We got this mission
because the boss can’t trust you.

253
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,523
When he finds out
that you managed to bungle it anyway,

254
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,775
well, I hate to think
what might happen to you,

255
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,779
but I suppose getting thrown off the team
is the best you could hope for after this.

256
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,239
Isn’t that right, Jess?

257
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,033
[growls and yells]

258
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,911
[Meowth] We’d be infernally grateful
if you could forget this ever happened.

259
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,039
Heh, what’s it worth to you?

260
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,416
-Not so fast, children.
-Ugh.

261
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,003
Now that you know our little secret,
I’m afraid we can’t let you leave.

262
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,505
We don’t know anything
about any secrets!

263
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,467
We were just trying to get
a free all-you-can-eat buffet!

264
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,055
You kids can’t get away from me.
I’m not a little pushover like Jessie.

265
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,931
Let’s make a run for it.

266
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,391
[grunts and mumbles]

267
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,434
What’s the matter?

268
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,646
This is the breeding center
where I left my Weepinbell the other day.

269
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,940
[gasps]

270
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:22,904
It evolved into a Victreebell!
Isn’t that just... [screams]

271
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,865
I just wish his brain would
evolve a little.

272
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,743
[both scream]

273
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,163
-There’s the exit!
-Pikachu!

274
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,874
[all gasp]

275
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,211
-We’re trapped!
-What do we do?

276
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,715
-Misty, you better hide.
-Okay. Pikachu, come on!

277
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,801
Our rat trap worked.

278
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,220
You crooks better let us out of here.

279
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,764
-What’s that?
-It’s mine!

280
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,724
You won’t be needing this.

281
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,893
[growling]

282
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,397
Burglars! Oh, I’m still shaking
like a leaf, Officer.

283
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,234
Thank goodness our security system stopped
them before they hurt the Pokémon, oh.

284
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,986
Don’t worry. We’ll make sure
these thieves are punished.

285
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,114
Thanks to you, our city’s a little safer.

286
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,575
I’m telling you, you’re arresting
the wrong guys. We’re innocent.

287
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,162
-Those guys are the crooks, not us.
-Hey, speak for yourself.

288
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,373
Look in the warehouse.
Ugh, then you’ll see.

289
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,085
Save your story for the station house.

290
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,006
This is the low point, turned in not by
these brats but by our own teammates.

291
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,008
Great, now we’re going to jail.

292
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,927
[siren wailing]

293
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,015
Oh, no, now we’ve got to find some way
to convince Jenny that they’re innocent.

294
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,601
-Pika.
-[Misty] Think, Misty.

295
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,063
There’s got to be some way.
Ah, I’ve got it!

296
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,358
All we have to do is show Jenny
some of the pictures that Todd took.

297
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,069
-Pikachu.
-Togepi.

298
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,535
[Misty] Excuse me.
I left a Psyduck here yesterday.

299
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,204
We have a two-day holding policy.

300
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,583
Ugh, but you see,
I have to take an emergency trip

301
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,002
and I really need my Psyduck
to come with me.

302
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,131
[Cassidy] I understand.
Just a moment, please.

303
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,342
-Okay, Pikachu.
-Pika.

304
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,264
-Toge.
-You stay here.

305
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,225
Pi, pi. Pika, pika.

306
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,688
Pikachu sure is taking a long time.
I wish it would hurry.

307
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,274
-[Cassidy] Miss.
-Yes?

308
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,859
Pika.

309
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,113
Pika!

310
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,617
I’m afraid there wasn’t time
to give your Psyduck a proper facial,

311
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,869
so there hasn’t been
much improvement.

312
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,662
[groans]

313
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,831
-Don’t you have to leave?
-Huh?

314
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:43,252
[Misty] Uh, well, I’m not in that much
of a hurry. [laughs nervously]

315
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,047
-Huh?
-Pika.

316
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,840
-Ah!
-[Cassidy] Is something wrong?

317
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,094
On second thought, I got to run. Bye!

318
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,891
Let us out. We’re not the crooks!

319
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,185
[Brock] Those two at that breeding center
are the criminals!

320
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,523
-That’s right! Not us!
-[Ash] Just go there and see for yourself.

321
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,442
Wow, it grew into
a fabulous Victreebell.

322
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,862
It’s so big and strong
and healthy-looking. Friendly. too.

323
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,988
[muffled scream]

324
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,241
If you’re trying to win sympathy,
it won’t work.

325
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,494
The judge is going to throw the book
at you Pokémon snatchers.

326
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,703
[all groan]

327
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,206
-You’re making a mistake.
-Pika, pika!

328
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,165
[purrs]

329
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,834
Misty! Pikachu!

330
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,587
These guys have been telling the truth,
Officer Jenny,

331
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,548
and these photographs prove it.

332
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,468
-Ah, what a cute little Pikachu.
-Huh?

333
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
Ah, wrong pictures. Look at these.

334
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,140
[gasps] Oh, no, that’s terrible.

335
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,142
[Misty]
That place isn’t a real a breeding center.

336
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,478
They just steal the best Pokémon
that are brought in.

337
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,940
Those two told me the center
was like a Pokémon spa.

338
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,943
-That was a lie.
-They cram the Pokémon into cages.

339
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,444
Pika, pika.

340
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,446
That’s why they told you
we were the crooks

341
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,449
-because we found out about their plans.
-They tricked me?

342
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,203
When we heard what those crooks
were up to, we went to stop them too.

343
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,164
-It’s true. Honest.
-Yeah, we’re good guys.

344
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:06,127
Please. They broke into the breeding
center just to steal Pokémon.

345
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,212
[Team Rocket groan]

346
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,007
[siren wailing]

347
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,551
So you thought
you could frame these kids

348
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,720
when it was you
who were really stealing Pokémon.

349
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,804
You’re under arrest!

350
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,973
-But we’re not--
-[Jenny] We already know everything.

351
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,017
There’s no use resisting.

352
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,810
Raticate, go!

353
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,856
Go, Pikachu!

354
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,608
[both grunting]

355
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,031
-Raticate got fried.
-Tough break.

356
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,241
-[Cassidy] Let’s go.
-Ugh.

357
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,870
-Bulbasaur, I choose you!
-Bulbasaur!

358
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,998
-Bulbasaur, it’s vine whip time!
-Bulba.

359
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,586
[both grunting]

360
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,047
[both] Love power?

361
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,758
Pikachu’s the one
who snuck into the breeding center

362
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,761
-and got the camera back.
-Pikachu, you’re the best.

363
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,012
Pika.

364
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,930
Heh, good thing Todd takes
great pictures.

365
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:00,973
Yeah!

366
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,808
You all did a great job.

367
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,686
Now we’ll return all the Pokémon
to their rightful owners.

368
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,063
That’s great, Jenny.

369
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,982
-[Jenny] Anybody hungry?
-[all] Huh?

370
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,653
-More ice cream!
-Take it easy.

371
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,947
-Yeah, leave some for the other customers.
-Pikachu, pi.

372
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,326
Don’t worry.
There’s plenty of ice cream left, Misty.

373
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,702
And all of it’s free,

374
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,914
since you brought this cute little Psyduck
to visit my restaurant.

375
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,875
You have good taste. [munches]

376
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,546
[Jessie] I can’t stand it here.
There’s not a single mirror in our cell.

377
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,216
[James] I refuse to wear
those horrible prison uniforms.

378
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,718
[Meowth]
And I would give this food to a Muk.

379
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,721
We shouldn’t have tried to steal
from that friend of yours, Jessie.

380
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,891
I’ll show her who’s the queen of mean.

381
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,563
I guess you guys are heading
to Cinnabar Island, right?

382
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,773
That’s right.

383
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,858
Well, I think I’m going to head up
to the mountains

384
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,277
so I can take some new shots
of wild Pokémon.

385
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,446
-That’s great.
-We’ll all miss you.

386
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,700
-Bye! I hope we meet again real soon.
-Mm-hmm.

387
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,036

Watch?
I can’t see a foot in front of my face.
