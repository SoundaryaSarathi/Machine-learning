1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,560
Okay, on to
the next scene.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,930
Yuki, use your magic
to take out Mikuru.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,840
The answer is "no!",
of course.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,930
I can't give my permission for you to use
your magic, let alone hurt Miss Asahina.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,270
Look, Miss Asahina's turning blue
and shaking from fear.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,120
Oh well. We'll use CG effects
in this scene.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,890
Kyon, put in a beam coming
from Yuki's wand, okay?

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,890
How am I supposed to put in
a visual effect like that?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay, Mikuru, now scream!
And fall over, like you're in pain.

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,190
DAY BY DAY unzari dayone dakara
Day by day, everything's just so dull

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,000
Doudou to kotowacchau
kimi ni narina yo
That's why you need to become
someone that can just reject it all

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,770
OH MY BOY kippari shinakya uso ni
Oh my boy, you need to be decisive

13
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,180
Tsukiatterarenai yo semai sekai de
I won't deal with any lies
in this small world

14
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,950
Jibun de mitsuketa MYSELF
suki ni natte touzen
I found myself on my own,
it's natural you'd fall for me

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,190
Kudaranai yarikata kette
Kick away the boring ways
of doing things,

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,920
subete wa atashi ga kimeru
I'm going to decide everything

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,490
I SAY I SAY MY HEAVEN
I say, I say my heaven

18
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,000
SUPER DRIVER tosshin makasete
nantettate zenshin
Super driver, leave everything
to the rush

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,770
SUPER DRIVER tosshin makasete
nantettate zenshin
And just keep going forward,
no matter what

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,600
Fukanou (DON'T YOU STOP ME)
Tobikoete TAKE IT EASY, GO!
Surpass (Don't you stop me)
The idea of "impossible"

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,140
Fukanou (DON'T YOU STOP ME)
Tobikoete TAKE IT EASY, GO!
Take it easy, go!

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,840
Daishouri tte doukan
I agree, it's going to be
a huge victory

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,340
Mochiron dounatta tte kaikan
Of course, it'll feel pleasant,
no matter what happens

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,750
Hanseikai? (GET BACK TO WILD)
Sore yori saa isoide yo
A review meeting? (Get back to wild)
Forget that, now hurry up

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,490
Aremo koremo mitaiken
itsudatte muriyari
We haven't tried this or that,
we always do things how we want

26
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,290
Marude marude mikeiken
korekara shimashou
Everything's a new experience,
let's try them out

27
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,090
Aremo koremo mitaiken
itsudatte totsuzen
We haven't tried this or that,
we always do things suddenly

28
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,090
Marude marude mikeiken
sore ga doushita no?
Everything's a new experience,
what about it?

29
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,740
We need a scene
with pigeons.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,870
There's a shrine nearby.
We're heading there next.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,650
We're going to shoot a scene
of Mikuru walking along

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,250
as some pigeons go flying
into the air.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,760
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,060
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III
I'd love it if these pigeons
were all completely white.

35
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,290
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III
Please don't feed the pigeons
I'd love it if these pigeons
were all completely white.

36
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,560
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,690
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III
In this case,
I'll let the color slide.

38
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,780
In this case,
I'll let the color slide.

39
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,660
Can't you read Japanese?

40
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,930
What in the world am I
supposed to be filming?

41
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,840
This is it, Kyon!
Be sure to shoot it!

42
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,440
Why are you sitting down,
Mikuru!?

43
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,980
Hey, you!

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
What!?

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,650
Retreat!

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,790
You don't eat much,
do you, Mikuru?

47
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,330
You'll never grow bigger
if you don't eat more.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,640
If you only focus on growing your breasts,
you'll only appeal to a hardcore fan base.

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,470
Be sure to get taller, too.

50
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,080
I already know.

51
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,340
I don't know how many years from now it
will be, but Miss Asahina will eventually

52
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,750
have a face and a body good enough for
her to enter the Miss Universe pageant.

53
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,190
Though I don't think
she knows that.

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,060
Haruhi, what are you going to do if
that priest complains to the school?

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,460
Koizumi's school uniform
is a dead giveaway.

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,000
It'll probably be okay. We were pretty far
away, and blazers are fairly common.

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,500
Even if he says something,
we can just play stupid.

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,300
Once we show the movie, I'm pretty sure
our cover will be blown in an instant.

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,480
I can't imagine there's more than
one waitress who would come out

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,280
to this shrine and walk
amongst the pigeons.

61
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,250
So where are we
going next?

62
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,610
Let's go back to
the park again.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,020
Now that I think about it, what we got
wasn't enough for a fight scene.

64
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,860
Mikuru, being chased through the forest
by Yuki, running for her life.

65
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,060
How about we have Mikuru
fall off a cliff,

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,370
and then she's saved by Koizumi,
who just happened to be walking by?

67
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,240
What a slapdash way to
come up with the story.

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,810
This is Haruhi we're talking about, so she
might actually throw her off a cliff.

69
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,440
You should fall instead. Put on that
costume and be her stunt double.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Well, your breasts aren't
quite as big, but...

71
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,710
What are you imagining?

72
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,690
You're not imagining me
as a waitress, are you?

73
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,230
You mind reader...

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,760
Are we three the only ones
appearing in the film?

75
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,890
Don't ask needless questions,
you jerk.

76
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,890
Well... I wonder, is three people
not enough?

77
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,830
Koizumi, you helped me realize
something important.

78
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,810
As a reward, I'll give you
more screen time.

79
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,550
Well... thank you.

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,550
Serves you right.

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,910
I didn't say anything because I knew
I'd be stirring up a hornet's nest.

82
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,280
You've got to take out the minions before
you can defeat the boss, right?

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,080
Minions... minions...

84
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,130
- They'll do, right?
- That works!

85
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,320
Taniguchi and Kunikida.
They're perfect supporting characters,

86
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,930
and what's more, they're
the ultimate minions.

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,060
In any case, we're going to have horrible
things happen to you, Mikuru.

88
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,000
After all, the theme of this
movie is a pitiful girl

89
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,440
that has horrible things happen
to her getting a happy ending!

90
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,580
The bigger Mikuru's misfortune is,
the bigger the cathartic release will be!

91
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,530
Why are you acting like
I'm unreliable?

92
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,290
And so we returned
to the wooded park.

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,230
Let's get rid of
the guns.

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,470
I thought more amazing bullets
would come out of them,

95
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,700
but they don't give off any
flashy sounds or flames.

96
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,040
They just don't
feel realistic.

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
Mikuru, you stand here.

98
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,220
Yuki, you stand here.

99
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't move from
those spots, okay?

100
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,950
I want to shoot a scene where you
two are staring each other down.

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,260
Koizumi, get the
reflector ready.

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,960
Action!

103
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,460
What the!?

104
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,670
Action? Haruhi, all you've told
them to do is stand there.

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,410
What kind of action are
they supposed to take?

106
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,510
Come on, you guys! That won't make
for a battle scene at all.

107
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,320
Well, they're just standing
there, after all.

108
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,930
Listen, Mikuru.

109
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,430
You can't rest on your laurels
just because you're cute!

110
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,560
There are tons of other cute
girls out there, after all.

111
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,530
If you just leave things be, you'll be
overtaken by all the young up-and-comers!

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,140
What is she trying
to say?

113
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,080
That's why you have to at least have
a beam come from your eye, Mikuru!

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
I can't!

115
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,280
That's why your left eye
is a different color.

116
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,550
I didn't make it blue
for no reason.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,320
The idea is that there's incredible
power hidden within it.

118
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,390
That's what the beam is.
It's the Mikuru Beam.

119
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,550
- That's what you need to fire off.
- I can't!

120
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,130
Show some spirit
and fire it!

121
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,230
It hurts!

122
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,830
You idiot!

123
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,940
Cut it out!

124
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,930
What are you doing?

125
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,130
- You need to calm down!
- Let go!

126
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,880
How the hell is a normal human supposed
to shoot a beam from their eye?

127
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,810
Are you stupid
or something?

128
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,250
I know that.

129
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,150
I just wanted her to show some spirit,
as if a beam might come out.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,430
She lacks the drive you need to
be a lead in a movie, after all.

131
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,000
You don't get jokes,
do you?

132
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,970
That's because your jokes
turn out to not be jokes.

133
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,840
What'll happen if Miss Asahina really gets
the ability to shoot a beam from her eye?

134
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,800
You can't, right?

135
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,680
After we shoot the scene, we can figure
something out using CG, right?

136
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,510
Thank you.

137
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,090
And who's going
to do that?

138
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,620
That's what I meant
from the start.

139
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,620
This take was no good.
Let's take it from the top again.

140
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,000
Shout, "Mikuru Beam!"
While you pose like this.

141
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,200
L-Like this?

142
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,860
No, like this!
And close your right eye.

143
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,430
Okay, Mikuru.
Try saying it.

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,770
M... M-M-Mikuru Beam!

145
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,970
Louder this time!

146
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,950
Mikuru Beam!

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,070
Be less embarrassed about it,
and louder!

148
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,110
M-M-Mikuru Beam!

149
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,220
Project from
your diaphragm!

150
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,480
The stares coming from the families
watching us are starting to hurt...

151
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,760
Okay! Now let's try this
for real!

152
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,130
Now, use the beam!

153
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,110
M-M-Mikuru Beam!

154
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,910
Huh? Yuki, when did you
go over there?

155
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,600
Cut, cut!

156
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,380
Miss Nagato!

157
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,710
Hold on, Yuki,
what are you doing?

158
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,840
- What are you doing? Hey, Nagato!
- This isn't in the script.

159
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,960
Are you all right?

160
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,090
Huh?

161
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,290
Oh, what are you
two doing?

162
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,870
Please don't do anything
that's not in the script.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Huh? Mikuru, what happened
to the contact lens?

164
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,700
Huh?

165
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,470
At a time like this, you ask the one person
who looks like they know what's going on.

166
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,710
Nagato, do you know what happened
to Miss Asahina's color contact?

167
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,240
- I don't.
- That's a lie.

168
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,940
I wonder if it fell out
during your struggle.

169
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,920
Why can't we find it?

170
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,190
Act like
you're looking, too.

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,390
It might have been blown away
by the wind. It is light, after all.

172
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,660
What happened?
Did it break?

173
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,190
I guess it was cheap.

174
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,300
Well, it's the Photography Club's,
so I guess that's to be expected.

175
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,070
Koizumi, please tape up
the back or something.

176
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,270
Right.

177
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,310
Without the color contact,
the video won't match up.

178
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,440
What do we do?

179
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,190
Got it! We'll have the eye color change
happen after she transforms!

180
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,650
T-Transform?

181
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,790
Of course! It wouldn't be realistic
if you wore that costume all the time!

182
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,820
There's something unrealistic about
people who want reality in their fiction.

183
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,460
T-That's good. I really would like
to wear a more normal outfit!

184
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,140
So your normal clothes are going
to be the bunny girl outfit!

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,670
W-W-W-Why!?

186
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,350
Because that's
all I brought.

187
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,410
And besides, there'd be nothing showy
on the screen if she wore normal clothes.

188
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,820
- Well...
- Wait!

189
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,220
I just thought
of something!

190
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,990
Mikuru is normally a bunny girl who brings
in customers for the shopping strip stores.

191
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,760
But when she senses danger,
she transforms!

192
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,270
That's when she becomes
a battling waitress!

193
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
What do you think?
Perfect, right?

194
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,540
What happened to the reality
you mentioned before?

195
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,660
All right,
let's get going.

196
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,710
Ow ow ow ow...

197
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,200
Thank you for all
the hard work...

198
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,240
So what was all that
ad libbing about?

199
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,690
Here.

200
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,620
So it was you
that took it.

201
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,750
Laser.

202
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,490
Hey, Nagato.

203
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,090
I've always noticed that you keep your
explanations to the bare minimum.

204
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,640
How about you speak for
at least ten seconds?

205
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,370
A coherent, narrow beam of light
invisible to the human eye.

206
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,880
I see. A coherent,
narrow beam... invisible...

207
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,280
Sorry, I'm even more
confused now.

208
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,620
- A laser?
- Yes.

209
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,550
That's surprising.
May I?

210
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,120
It looks like a normal
contact to me.

211
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,960
What do you mean?

212
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,290
Would you show me
your right palm?

213
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,300
Oh, not you.
I mean Miss Nagato.

214
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,840
It broke through
my shield.

215
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,470
Don't be so blasé when you say that.
Just looking at it hurts.

216
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,890
Incredibly strong.
I had to act fast.

217
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,920
Did the beam come from
Miss Asahina's left eye?

218
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,180
Correct.

219
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,060
Just "correct"!?

220
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,990
It will be repaired soon.

221
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,970
Oh, good grief.

222
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,800
Did Miss Asahina actually
shoot a beam from her eye?

223
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,880
It's not a particle acceleration cannon.
It's cohesive light.

224
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,200
Whatever.

225
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,210
Laser, maser, marker-light FAHP,
they're all the same to normal people.

226
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,810
The problem remains the fact that
Miss Asahina fired off a heat ray.

227
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,790
Not a heat ray.
A photon laser.

228
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,150
I told you, we don't need
the scientific details.

229
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,190
Is this an ability that Miss Asahina
has always possessed?

230
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,130
No. Currently, Mikuru Asahina
is a normal human being.

231
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,300
She is not any different
than anyone else.

232
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,370
Could there be some sort of
mechanism in that contact?

233
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,010
No. It's a simple
cosmetic accessory.

234
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,670
Which means...

235
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,720
If Nagato hadn't protected me, the laser
beam that shot out of Miss Asahina's eye

236
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,620
would have probably pierced the video
camera's lens, gone through my eye,

237
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,660
roasted various other bits, and then
come out the back of my head.

238
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,330
This was
Miss Suzumiya's doing.

239
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,020
Because she wanted there
to be a Mikuru Beam,

240
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,430
reality changed so
that there was one.

241
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,500
Wait a second.

242
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,540
That contact lens hasn't had
any magic cast on it, right?

243
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,340
Even if Haruhi wished for it, why did
a killer laser beam come out of it?

244
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,270
Miss Suzumiya doesn't need magic
or strange scientific technology.

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,480
All she needs to do is think
something exists, and it will.

246
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,950
But there's no way she actually thinks that
a beam would come shooting out of it.

247
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,490
That's true.

248
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,160
We all know that Miss Suzumiya
possesses common sense.

249
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,560
However, it's also true that
she doesn't subscribe

250
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
to the world's
sensibilities, either.

251
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,830
There's probably some sort of
special situation going on.

252
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,670
That's...
Oh, and she's back.

253
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,180
We'll continue this
discussion later...

254
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,040
How long are you going to complain?
Act more like an actress!

255
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,780
A willingness to strip will put you on
the fast track to the blue ribbon!

256
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,550
Okay, sorry to
keep you waiting!

257
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,300
Zoom in!

258
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,190
Confirmation completed. It's definitely
the Miss Asahina I know.

259
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,760
What are you doing?

260
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,340
You mustn't film anything
unless I tell you to.

261
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,100
I know that. Here's your proof - I didn't
hit the record button.

262
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,940
I was just looking
at her.

263
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,110
Okay, everyone! Eyes here!
And get ready.

264
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,660
After that, what I filmed was video
of what was supposed to be

265
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,730
Miss Asahina's
day-to-day activities.

266
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,930
What kind of day-to-day life
is she supposed to have?

267
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,070
And after pulling Miss Asahina
this way and that...

268
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,810
Having a mountain in the background
just doesn't work.

269
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,470
Let's go to town.

270
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh geez.

271
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,360
Miss Asahina wore her bunny girl
outfit until the sun set.

272
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,070
The only thing she really did was
walk around in that outfit.

273
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,630
The idea of "permission to shoot"
doesn't exist in Haruhi's mind,

274
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,240
so Haruhi was "free" to just shoot
whatever and wherever she wanted to.

275
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,480
This is a dignified freedom, in the same
vein as the papal freedom of action

276
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,810
practiced in the time of
Pope Innocence III.

277
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,890
Or so I'm told.

278
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,530
The definition of "free"
is being misunderstood.

279
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,790
I guess this works
for today.

280
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,530
What a long day. Tomorrow's Sunday,
and I'd like to spend it relaxing.

281
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,310
Okay, see you tomorrow.

282
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,170
We'll be meeting up at the
same time and place.

283
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,680
What a carefree girl.

284
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,040
I hope she's going to give us
some time to change, at least.

285
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,740
What's that? You've got
to get the filming done!

286
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,050
We don't have the time
to take things slow!

287
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,390
You can relax as much as you want
once the school festival is over.

288
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,920
Until then, consider your calendar
to be free of days off!

289
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,290
Okay, see you tomorrow!

290
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,860
We're going to complete this movie,
no matter what.

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,700
No. As long as I'm the director,
its completion is guaranteed!

292
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,060
Everything else hinges
on your hard work.

293
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,540
Be on time.

294
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,410
Anyone that's late will be lynched
and get the death penalty!

295
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,780
I'll tell Miss Asahina.

296
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,610
Tell her what?

297
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,190
About the laser. If she doesn't
change the color of her eye,

298
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,050
then a weird laser beam
won't come out of it.

299
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,690
Perhaps we should take
a precaution, just in case.

300
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,190
I'm sure that
she'll cooperate.

301
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,200
After all, a beam would
be dangerous.

302
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,870
Man, but Nagato just
keeps saving my life.

303
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,760
Hey, Kyon. This isn't
what we talked about.

304
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,920
Where's the lovely
Miss Asahina?

305
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,960
I came here because you said
that she'd come and meet me.

306
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,630
Well, she's not here.
I came for the eye candy.

307
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,300
What are you talking about?
You're the hero!
Well, she's not here.
I came for the eye candy.

308
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,400
What are you talking about?
You're the hero!

309
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,340
What are you talking about?
You're the hero!
So what about it?

310
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,740
So what about it?

311
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,100
30% of this movie
is riding on you!
So what about it?

312
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,370
30% of this movie
is riding on you!

313
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,810
All I can see is Suzumiya's
angry face.

314
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,800
70% is on me and my genius,
of course... That doesn't matter!
All I can see is Suzumiya's
angry face.

315
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,140
This is a scam!

316
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,150
It's a scam, so just die. Just gaze
at Nagato or something.

317
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,650
But you know, that actually looks
pretty good on Miss Nagato.

318
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,950
Kyon! What's up
with Mikuru?

319
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,620
Ohh, if you keep dawdling like that,
we'll never get anywhere!

320
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,060
Ohh, if you keep dawdling like that,
we'll never get anywhere!
It looks like Miss Tsuruya's been
pulled into being an extra, too.

321
00:19:59,330 --> 00:19:59,560
What!? Get your butt
over here already!

322
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,360
What!? Get your butt
over here already!
So, what are we doing?

323
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,460
What!? Get your butt
over here already!

324
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,060
What!? Get your butt
over here already!
I came because they told me to
if I wasn't doing anything.

325
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,620
I came because they told me to
if I wasn't doing anything.

326
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,700
How do you read that, the words written
on Miss Suzumiya's armband?

327
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,760
What are you doing
with that handy-cam?

328
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,970
What's with Yuki's outfit?

329
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,940
Wow, Koizumi!
You're looking hot today, as usual.

330
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,610
What a restless person.

331
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,370
What was that?
Your stomach hurts?

332
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,850
Dummy! That only works
through elementary school!

333
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,250
Come here, now!
You have thirty seconds!

334
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,790
And so it seems that Miss Asahina has
a sudden case of shut-in syndrome.

335
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,050
I'm going to go get her.
Let me see the bag.

336
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,540
I can understand how
Miss Asahina feels.

337
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,580
After all, it feels like she might end up
as a real transforming hero at this rate.

338
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,040
A laser beam is a bit
too much, though.

339
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,490
But I think we'll be able to avoid
any strange beams coming out.

340
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,260
How?

341
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,030
Miss Nagato's cooperated
with us.

342
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,530
What did you do
to Miss Asahina?

343
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,770
She just removed her ability
to shoot lasers.

344
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm not really sure, either.

345
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,040
Unlike the other TFEIs terminals,
Miss Nagato doesn't speak very much.

346
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,340
What's a TFEI?

347
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,880
It's an acronym that my organization
just assigned to them.

348
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,910
You don't need to know
what it stands for.

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:40,560
But I get the feeling that Miss Nagato
is unusual, even amongst "them".

350
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,160
Oh, about that thing earlier.

351
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
On the way back from the convenience
store one night, a taxi passed me.

352
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,570
Available Car

353
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,080
Available Car
And I glanced at its
"available car" light,

354
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,370
And I glanced at its
"available car" light,

355
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,380
but it looked like
"beloved car" to me.

356
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,640
That's surprising.

357
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,980
But before I could take another
look at it, it drove off.

358
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:12,090
And that's when I realized that maybe
what I'm missing in my life is love.

359
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,990
Maybe it really did have "beloved car"
written on the light.

360
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,290
I'm sure it was
a private taxi.

361
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,720
I never thought we'd be relying
on these two idiots.

362
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,230
You're not going to get away
with pretending to be sick.

363
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,310
We're going to start
filming right away!

364
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,780
Heya, Mikuru!
Wow, that's really sexy!

365
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,980
I'm sorry I'm late.

366
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,150
Oh, I don't mind.

367
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,250
Heya, Miss Suzumiya!

368
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,050
I'm sorry about yesterday.

369
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,990
It looks like I ended up firing off
a laser weapon without realizing it.

370
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,360
Oh no, I wasn't hurt,
after all.

371
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
I was bitten.

372
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,970
- By what?
- By Miss Nagato.

373
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,040
She said she injected some
nanomachines or something into me...

374
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,010
But it looks like nothing will be
coming out of my eye anymore.

375
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,240
Thank goodness.

376
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,320
What did she inject
into you?

377
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,080
Last night, she and Koizumi
came to my house together.

378
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,520
What are you two
whispering about?

379
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
You're so cute, Mikuru.
I'd love to keep you as a pet!

380
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,230
Don't look. You'll take away
some of her cuteness.

381
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,260
Okay, I've decided where
we're shooting next!

382
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,360
There's a big lake near
where Koizumi lives.

383
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,940
Let's head there
to shoot for now.

384
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,000
Filming Crew

385
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,620
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

386
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,320
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

387
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,850
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

388
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,130
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

389
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,770
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

390
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,970
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

391
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,510
Tomare!
Stop!

392
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,280
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

393
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,050
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

394
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,180
Nazenara
That's because

395
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,420
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

396
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,190
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

397
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,630
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

398
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,460
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

399
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,370
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

400
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,070
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

401
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,160
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
