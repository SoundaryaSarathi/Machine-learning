1
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,148
I found it first!

2
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,083
No, I found it first, brat!

3
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:15,915
Sakura, it’s coming your way!

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,551
Hold it right there!

5
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,885
Return to thy true form…

6
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:25,461
…Clow Ca…

7
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:34,502
Sakura, seal it!

8
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,239
Hurry, before
it has a chance to run away!

9
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:37,506
Eh?

10
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,277
While we’ve got a hold of it, hurry!

11
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:46,917
Return to thy true form… Clow Card!

12
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:07,501
You OK?

13
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,811
Oh, man.

14
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:16,912
What the heck?

15
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:18,453
Hey, calm down.

16
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,418
What happened? Don’t tell me that…

17
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:25,050
Kero, that speaking style…

18
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,820
Sakura, listen carefully.

19
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,661
And Li-kun has an Osaka accent…

20
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,368
Don’t be too surprised. I’m Cerberus.

21
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,906
W… what’re you saying?
Li-kun, don’t kid around…

22
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,676
It’s not a joke.
I’m Li Shao Lan.

23
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:44,904
Eh!

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,820
[Sakura and Kero and Shao Lan and…]

25
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,819
“Sa-ku-ra.”

26
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,355
Alright, Kero, Let’s go home.

27
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,130
I’m not him!

28
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,967
So he’s Kero and you’re Li?

29
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,234
That’s right.

30
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,965
What did this Card do?

31
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,634
What could happen to you two?

32
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,606
What do you mean?

33
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:18,171
Ah, this time that ain’t gonna happen.

34
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:18,970
Eh?

35
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,342
It’s just a switching of body and soul.

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,456
So, it’s not like someone got angry
and used this on you?

37
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,385
Not this time?

38
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,089
Nope.

39
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,526
So how did this Card do it?

40
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:34,422
Clow Reed, the guy who made the Cards,

41
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,025
did a lot of things.

42
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,462
Pretty careless, aren’t you?

43
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,333
What did you say?

44
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,569
You might be okay…

45
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,169
…but what about me
in this stuffed animal’s body?

46
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,033
Who’s a stuffed animal?

47
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,872
I’m stuck in this lame body,
that sucks.

48
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:49,668
What?

49
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:52,643
What’s so funny?

50
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:53,843
Sorry!

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,415
But still, nothing happened to me.

52
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,310
Why was it just you two?

53
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:01,448
We were holding onto that card together.

54
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,390
That’s when Change’s
power started working.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,891
You didn’t know it was going to happen?

56
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:10,322
I’m the Beast of the Seal, right?
Of course I knew.

57
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:11,959
Then, how…?

58
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,928
I just forgot.

59
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:16,435
What?

60
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,137
Life is full of challenges!

61
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,032
Don’t mess around! You have to
figure out a way to change us back!

62
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,838
Don’t worry!
Just be patient until tomorrow.

63
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:25,646
Really?

64
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,649
After one day,
Change’s magic power will return.

65
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,781
Then Sakura can use the Change card.

66
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,386
However,

67
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,121
me and the brat
will have to do something then.

68
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:37,386
Do something…?

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,155
But still, can you do it?

70
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,521
I’ll do it. Tell me!

71
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:42,961
Tell me, Kero!

72
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,994
Tomorrow evening, you and me…

73
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:47,934
Yeah?

74
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:50,098
…tightly and in unison…

75
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,302
…hug each other.

76
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,575
Is that all?!

77
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:01,411
That’s not all!
Can you do that, brat?

78
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,678
Don’t look, I also feel nasty

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,244
‘Cause if you don’t…

80
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:07,622
…we’ll be stuck
like this for life.

81
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,655
No choice, then.

82
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:14,557
Anyway, we know how to switch you back…

83
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:16,129
But what do we do now?

84
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:17,260
About what?

85
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,863
You’ll be like this
until tomorrow evening, right?

86
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:26,437
Who is it?

87
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:33,743
Shao Lan, welcome home.

88
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,041
Yes.

89
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,846
What’s wrong?
You’re acting kind of shy.

90
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:39,945
Why don’t you come in?

91
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,348
I was waiting for you!
Come here, come here!

92
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,589
Will he give it away?

93
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,188
If you’re worried,

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,033
why don’t you tell Mei Lin the truth?

95
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:54,865
If she knew,
she’d never let me hear the end of it.

96
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:56,726
Then it can’t be helped.

97
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,264
It’ll stay like
this until tomorrow evening.

98
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:01,871
But still…

99
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,435
It’ll be okay.
If you stay patient…

100
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,578
Will he be able to remain patient?

101
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:09,581
Probably…

102
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,884
I’m making leftovers,
so why don’t you make soup?

103
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:16,883
Soup?

104
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,590
Wei is out today,

105
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,655
so we have to make it on our own.

106
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,855
“We?”

107
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,925
Well, I have to go buy some stuff,
so you get started, okay?

108
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:31,397
Hey! What the heck is going on?

109
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,102
A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do…

110
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,139
That’s dangerous, Li.

111
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:44,214
You never said anything
about leaving this room.

112
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,311
But if you leave this room

113
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:47,881
Someone will see you.

114
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,628
I can’t do it! I need some air.

115
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,225
You’ll catch a cold.

116
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:15,913
Li!

117
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,977
I’m home.

118
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:21,251
B… Brother…

119
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,951
Sakura, good afternoon.
Did you drop your stuffed animal?

120
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,389
Yukito!

121
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,293
It’s okay, it doesn’t look damaged.
Here.

122
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,231
Thank you very much.

123
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,530
Dad’ll be late today.

124
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,804
The three of us will eat together.

125
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,305
Really?

126
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,505
Have you prepared the food?

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,370
I forgot! I’ll do it now!

128
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:47,739
Sakura.

129
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,619
That stuffed animal’s face
is kind of red, isn’t it?

130
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:56,583
Maybe something got stuck on it!

131
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,083
I’ll take it back to my room!

132
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:01,324
Man, that hurt.

133
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:06,124
Sorry about that.
Well, gotta hurry up and cook.

134
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:07,861
Remember, Li?

135
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,268
You mustn’t leave this room.

136
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:17,838
Oh, Sakura.
Let me help with something.

137
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,474
No, you just sit right there.

138
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,008
That’s all right.
Why don’t I bring this to you?

139
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,258
Looks good! Well, let’s eat!

140
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,591
What’s up?

141
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,626
Something wrong?

142
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:36,995
N… nothing at all!

143
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:40,424
Of course not!
It’s soup made by you, after all!

144
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,605
I think so, I am confident in that.

145
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,902
You know, Shao Lan,
you sound kinda weird today.

146
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:50,806
Eh?

147
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,943
It isn’t like your usual…

148
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,111
I’ve been hanging around

149
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,780
Cerberus all evening.

150
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,745
He uses that Osaka dialect,
so it must’ve rubbed off.

151
00:07:58,253 --> 00:07:59,652
Yeah, that must be it.

152
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,088
Cerberus, you mean that stuffed animal?

153
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:03,219
No!

154
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,387
I mean, that really
cool Beast of the Seal.

155
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:11,294
Shao Lan, you always
call it “that stuffed animal.”

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,363
Well, he has his good points, too.

157
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,464
This is terrible!

158
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,142
Oh, this is good, tasty…

159
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:45,897
…while drinking it…
I’ll get some tea.

160
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:49,900
Thanks. I’ll have half a cup,
and Touya, too.

161
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,166
I see.

162
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,312
Hey, over here. Over here!
Geeze.

163
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes?

164
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,378
What’s wrong?

165
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,250
Oh, I thought I heard
something from the window.

166
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,696
Someone… hel…

167
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,501
Go away!

168
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:24,665
Isn’t that a cat?

169
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:36,977
Li…

170
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:40,614
Thanks. That was delicious, Sakura.

171
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,320
Really?

172
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,738
Ouch…

173
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,438
You awake?

174
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,346
That’s Kero’s bed.

175
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,183
It’s kinda small, but is it okay?

176
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:13,684
There’s nothing I can do.

177
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,186
What’ll you do tomorrow?

178
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,680
About what?

179
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:17,884
About school.

180
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:20,691
You wait here, and then…

181
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,758
I’m going, too.
I’m worried about what that guy will do.

182
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,226
I’m worried about you.

183
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,133
I’ll stay still. I promise.

184
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:30,703
Really?

185
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,449
I made it.

186
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:49,380
There’s no reason for you to be barely
getting to school on time all the time.

187
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,019
You’d better stay quiet.

188
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,458
I know.

189
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,624
Kinomoto, don’t be late.
Class is about to start.

190
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,360
Good morning!

191
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,198
That’s a pretty big bag.

192
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,128
This is… for gym.

193
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,800
What’s your bag for?

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,268
This? I just received a present.

195
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:11,206
Eh?

196
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:12,713
Today’s her birthday,

197
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,138
so I guess that happens…

198
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,610
Hey, instead of talking like this,
we should go to class.

199
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:18,708
Right.

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,458
You alright?

201
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:29,391
I’ll stay still. That’s my promise.

202
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:30,821
OK!

203
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,368
It’d be nice if
he would just stay quiet, too.

204
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:36,329
Good morning!

205
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:44,805
That kind of move?

206
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,180
I didn’t know.

207
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,480
Li, you know a lot about games.

208
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:53,681
That move was the
Cerberus Super-Special Attack.

209
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:58,617
So how do you use
that to defeat the enemy?

210
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:01,857
You hit the B button in rhythm and…

211
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,928
Truly terrible…

212
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,658
Yes.

213
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,432
Shao Lan,

214
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,774
since when did you
have time for games?

215
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,071
Oh, here and there.

216
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,610
Kero, you’re standing out too much!

217
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,017
Yeah, well,

218
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,546
they started talking about games, and…

219
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,084
How uncool.

220
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,525
Yeah, brat, I should just act dumb
if I want to be like you.

221
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:33,620
What was that?!

222
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,462
If you yell, someone will find us!

223
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,463
What is there to find?

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,592
Tomoyo!

225
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,560
Isn’t Li acting
a little strange today?

226
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,171
Actually…

227
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:45,996
Don’t say it!

228
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,433
Oh, Kero’s here too?

229
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,937
Um, you see, this is…

230
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,208
We’ve been discussing Card matters,
right?

231
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes, yes!

232
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,481
Li’s use of language…
sounds like Kero.

233
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,286
That’s not right, Tomoyo.

234
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:03,616
It’s… you see… Right, Li?

235
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,819
I… I’m not nearly as cool as
that Cerberus is.

236
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:10,489
Here, pose please!

237
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,733
I thought so!

238
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:20,331
It’s no laughing matter!

239
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:21,398
That’s right!

240
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:24,309
I’m sorry. It’s just so unusual
to see Li look so relaxed

241
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,404
and Kero look so serious.

242
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,480
Weird, isn’t it?

243
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,578
I won’t get mad if
it’s just laughing.

244
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:33,484
We’ve got to hang in
there until this evening.

245
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:36,580
How nice, this friendly feeling.

246
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,587
Kind of like a wonderful
family get-together.

247
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,122
Anyway, I’m sorry about before.

248
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,132
I’ll keep quiet until this evening,

249
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,092
so you don’t stand out too much.

250
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,262
Got it.

251
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:53,066
Now that Tomoyo knows,
that’s more than enough.

252
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,538
I’ll take that!

253
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:08,647
It’s worse…

254
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:13,752
Sakura!

255
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,240
Sorry about that!

256
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,617
That moron!

257
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:37,713
Is there someone in here?

258
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:50,562
The homeroom teacher
should have confiscated this.

259
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,302
Oh, sir. Could you help me take some
of these things to the gym?

260
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,571
Man, that was some kind
of throw you made there.

261
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:02,902
Ok!

262
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,711
We have passed today safely.

263
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,986
What were you thinking,
doing that during P.E.?

264
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:22,421
Li is keeping quiet, so you should keep
your promise too, right?

265
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:23,822
Shao Lan!

266
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:32,001
Shao Lan,
you’re kinda weird today.

267
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,566
W… what?

268
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,777
Are you keeping something from me?

269
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,840
That’s just your imagination…

270
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:41,610
Why’re YOU answering?

271
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:48,855
Mei Lin. There’s no reason
I’d be keeping anything from you, right?

272
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,287
Really?

273
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:56,262
Of course!
Are you saying you don’t believe me?

274
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,461
If you say so, Shao Lan…

275
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:01,467
Where did Kero get that from?

276
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,429
Maybe he saw some weird drama on TV…

277
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,601
Wait for me in the classroom,
I’ll be there shortly.

278
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:08,500
OK!

279
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,104
Shao Lan…!

280
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:18,612
Thanks.

281
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:21,749
Mister Terada, phone call for you.

282
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:22,981
Oh, thanks.

283
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:27,754
Gotta get out of here…

284
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,996
All right, see you later.

285
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:34,801
Damn!

286
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,345
Oh no, this is bad!

287
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,173
What’s wrong?

288
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,049
This…

289
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,453
What’re you doing there, Li?

290
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,580
That’s Shao Lan? In such a body…

291
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,652
Didn’t he say
he was going to keep it quiet?

292
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:02,755
Li? Are you awake?

293
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,397
Sakura, maybe somewhere
a little more private…

294
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,327
Li, Li!

295
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,337
He’s not answering.
Maybe something happened.

296
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:17,172
The Change Card shouldn’t
have that kind of power.

297
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,546
Shao Lan!
Answer me, Shao Lan…

298
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,474
I won’t be able to go back like this.

299
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,814
Hey, brat! Snap out of it!

300
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:27,480
That’s not Li.

301
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,612
Eh?

302
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:31,817
Li doesn’t have a tag.

303
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:33,325
Eh?

304
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,323
He’s not in the classroom either.

305
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:44,129
Where have I seen that bag…?

306
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,670
Oh yeah, Mister Terada
had that this morning…

307
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,374
Are you looking for something?

308
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,435
Miss Mizuki!

309
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,407
Oh, what a cute stuffed animal.

310
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,779
Do you know where Mister Terada went?

311
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,451
I think he went to one of
the shops by the station.

312
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:58,982
Thank you very much!

313
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:00,046
If you’ll excuse us… See ya!

314
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:00,920
Hey!

315
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,146
Good luck!

316
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,592
Hey, you sure
I can’t run on all fours?

317
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,525
You can’t do that!

318
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:15,867
Oh, I want to fly!

319
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:16,660
Got it!

320
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:17,403
Hey, Teacher!

321
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,203
W… what’s going on?

322
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,210
What happened with this?

323
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,302
I returned it at the toy store.

324
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,975
I was just heading home.

325
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:35,517
Shao Lan, where are you?
Where are you, Shao Lan?!

326
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,449
Not on the shelf? Maybe out front.

327
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:41,122
Sakura!

328
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:51,000
Get me outta here!

329
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,567
All right, now it’s my turn!

330
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:55,800
If it’s a game, leave it to me!

331
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,645
Have you ever played the crane game?

332
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,071
I should only need one try.

333
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:08,310
Right, just like that!

334
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:10,855
You found it, huh?

335
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,055
Oh,

336
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,724
that’s it. You’ve got the hang of it.

337
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,432
Too bad. You need to try again.

338
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,304
Try again?!

339
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,263
Looks like it…

340
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:31,976
I won’t be defeated! I’m burning up!

341
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:40,778
Man, would you treat
my body a little better?

342
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,686
It’s your fault that you suck!

343
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,259
You moron, it’s this clumsy body’s fault!

344
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,351
What was that?

345
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,193
Want to get it on right now?

346
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:50,327
Calm down, both of you!

347
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,865
Li, if you don’t do it,
you can’t go back.

348
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,981
Take these bodies and
exchange the souls within!

349
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,149
Change!

350
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:35,200
Good morning.

351
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,573
Mornin’. Yesterday was some kinda
ordeal for us, wasn’t it?

352
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,843
You… That speaking style…

353
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,147
Sakura is here.

354
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,553
This time, we got switched…

355
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:47,750
Eh?

356
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,952
Li, aren’t you Mei Lin?

357
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:54,184
No!

358
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,866
It’s not a dream!

359
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,802
Shao Lan, if you don’t hurry,
you’ll be late for school.

360
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:13,772
I am leaving then

361
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:18,475
It’s really the real Shao Lan, right?
Ah.

362
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:19,944
Yes.

363
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:23,253
Obviously Shao Lan is
the best Shao Lan there is!

364
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,649
Hey, let go!

365
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:25,683
But…!

366
