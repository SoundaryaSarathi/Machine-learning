1
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,019
Nothing holds his attention
like an intense game.

2
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,029
Hey, Kohsaka.

3
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,059
Hmm?

4
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,559
Would you rather have been with
a girl who plays games with you?

5
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,469
That's not really important.

6
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,939
You don't choose a girl based on that...

7
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,069
...and you're the way
you are so I don't mind.

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,139
Well, maybe that's just
what dating him is like...

9
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,039
But to be honest I feel
miserable right now...

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,589
...and it makes me
worry about the future...

11
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,919
He doesn't look at me at all, either...

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,139
Oh, sorry, TV time.

13
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,209
Uh, you mean anime?

14
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,079
Yeah, it's about to start.

15
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,679
I've been looking forward to it all day.

16
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:30,999
I'm sorry I'm gutless,
but this is my limit.

17
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:32,659
Tokino!

18
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,159
Outside, outside, outside, outside.

19
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,999
Just hold out a little longer!

20
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,539
The heat must be getting
to our opponents too.

21
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,159
Let's talk about something...

22
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,519
<i>Genshiken</i>

23
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:05,329
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

24
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:11,369
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

25
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:16,129
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

26
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:21,009
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

27
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,709
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

28
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,379
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

29
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:34,389
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

30
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:40,549
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

31
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:46,029
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

32
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,229
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

33
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:56,509
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

34
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,279
<i>At this tempo!</i>

35
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,099
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

36
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,119
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

37
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,169
<i>Genshiken</i>

38
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,599
That again!

39
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,699
That's pretty good, chaining a low
light kick into a standing super.

40
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:29,079
I can only pull it off about
one in five tries though.

41
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:33,119
These two sure are a trip to watch.

42
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,119
<i>Episode 6: Subculture and its Circular
Relationship to Others Surrounding It</i>

43
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,789
Ohno.

44
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,689
Isn't your hair too long?

45
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,359
Huh?

46
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,429
I mean, it makes you look kinda scary.

47
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,629
Huh?

48
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,479
If you cut it, or even just added
some color, it'd lighten up.

49
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,479
Is it like this for cosplay?

50
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,809
Hmm, that's part of it...

51
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,379
...but when I was in America I
couldn't bring myself to dye it.

52
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,049
People told me they envied
how black and straight it was.

53
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:15,649
I guess they had a
point, but this is Japan.

54
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,789
That's true...

55
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,449
So it's for cosplay?

56
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,059
I guess so.

57
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:26,199
The salon I go to gives
discounts for referrals.

58
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,659
I'm not used to places
like that, though...

59
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,509
Yeah, bring it on!

60
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:37,609
Ohno.

61
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,239
Aren't your tits too big?

62
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,289
Huh?

63
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,349
What's your cup size again?

64
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,849
Don't you already know?

65
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,619
Yeah but I forgot.

66
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,129
What?

67
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:02,639
Oh my god, it takes cups that big
to support those manga-sized tits?

68
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,169
Saki!

69
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,439
F?

70
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,699
G?

71
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,179
It's just like that soccer...

72
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,709
J. League?

73
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,369
W-World Cup?

74
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,719
I'm going to claim sexual harassment.

75
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,179
That's the scary you.

76
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,789
Hey, are you ignoring me?

77
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,449
W-What?

78
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,819
Don't "what" me.

79
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:27,329
I'm trying to get you to
discuss something with me.

80
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,859
Discuss?

81
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,199
Well you see, this is about
one of my high school friends.

82
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,339
She says she's been
dating an otaku lately.

83
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:39,599
Oh yeah?

84
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:44,309
Well, at a glance he seems
different from Kohsaka.

85
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:48,449
So anyway, when they have sex
at night they leave the TV on.

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,549
The guy says it's to mask the
noise since the walls are thin.

87
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,519
But then last night...

88
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,249
Some anime came on during it...

89
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,929
And just before that, they
had switched to doggy style.

90
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:08,169
I wonder if he was back where she
couldn't see him watching it...

91
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,169
What do you think, Ohno?

92
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,609
Um, well...

93
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,249
Lasting more than 30 minutes is
amazing!

94
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,809
Laughing about it only
digs your own grave.

95
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,889
What about you guys?

96
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,819
Yesterday, you said? What time?

97
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,359
12:30, she said.

98
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:34,829
Oh, that!

99
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,769
You saw it, didn't you?

100
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:38,829
Yes, that.

101
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,969
<i>Kujibiki Unbalance</i>

102
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,939
It's quite a highly
rated anime right now.

103
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:46,569
I watched it too.

104
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,469
So did I.

105
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,679
You don't say...

106
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:05,259
Then maybe it'd be best
if she cosplayed after all!

107
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,729
I mean, she got a reaction
from cat ears a while back.

108
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,309
A-All right, why don't
I lend her a costume?

109
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,309
I'm sure the size difference
would just make her feel bad.

110
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,679
Besides, I don't think you
want it being used for that.

111
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,689
I see your point.

112
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,849
Um...

113
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,389
You were talking about a friend?

114
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,359
Of course I was.

115
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,519
But what about you two?

116
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,529
If you had a girlfriend, would
you want to have sex in costume?

117
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,429
Uh, well...

118
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,539
I don't even think about that kind
of thing, not having a girlfriend.

119
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,869
Ah, but I have seen cosplay
scenes in adult videos...

120
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,309
They're not very interesting, though.

121
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,609
The women are just porn
actresses, after all.

122
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,009
There are also cosplay
dojinshi, erotic ones.

123
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,909
Yeah, I saw some in a
catalog at Comic Fest.

124
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,889
I wonder if they're on CD-ROM.

125
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,549
Look at me when you're talking.

126
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,889
So anyway, you're going to have to
ask Tanaka about stuff like that.

127
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,999
Hmm...

128
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,759
Then I suppose...

129
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,529
if she liked to cosplay...

130
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,539
...and she understood the character,
it might be kind of fun, maybe.

131
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,069
Like Ohno?

132
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,369
Saki...

133
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,009
Well, you know...

134
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,909
But you wouldn't be able to do that...

135
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,939
...would you?

136
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:35,109
Not me, it's a friend of mine.

137
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,509
Hey, either way.

138
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,829
The more fundamental question is...

139
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,049
...can your friend become an otaku too?

140
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,369
That's impossible.

141
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:53,399
But that's what we're thinking
about almost all the time.

142
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,399
Anime, games, not much else.

143
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,099
Even Kohsaka shouldn't be
any exception to the rule.

144
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,899
You think so?

145
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:04,049
Otherwise he wouldn't
be such a good gamer.

146
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,019
Not to mention, he knows a
lot of system-related info.

147
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:13,119
Hmm, video games...

148
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,989
I guess games really are his thing.

149
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,489
I couldn't possibly become an otaku...

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,459
...but I guess I've got to
play at least one game...

151
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,459
Heh, you will?

152
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,429
It's better than trying to get
his attention with shabby cosplay.

153
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,739
She might find she's an
otaku before she knows it.

154
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,999
Shut up.

155
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:38,139
After careful consideration, the
game of choice is Puyo Pop Fever.

156
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:43,109
You connect and pop falling "puyos" in
this latest of the hit puzzle game series.

157
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,149
That's why you rotate it here like this.

158
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,049
Rotate?

159
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,859
You insert it here, these
pop, and these shift down.

160
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,979
Why?

161
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:54,659
She did it.

162
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:55,789
Finally.

163
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:57,729
What?

164
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:58,989
What? What?

165
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,469
Oh yeah!

166
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,669
<i>Thuddy thud.
Oh yeah!</i>

167
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:02,859
No way!

168
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,669
What the hell's with that?

169
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,639
It's no use asking us.

170
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,479
Okay, I'll give it a shot tonight.

171
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:17,079
Now that was weird.

172
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,489
Kasukabe played a video game.

173
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,679
Stop the world so I can get off.

174
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,159
But, thank goodness she
got to where she can do it.

175
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,999
Playing against Kohsaka, though...

176
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,199
You're right.

177
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,539
He'll have a 5-chain
put together in no time.

178
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,939
Hopefully he'll hold back
against her a little...

179
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:44,009
Know what, though, she was
talking about herself before...

180
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,819
...I'm sure of it...

181
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,939
So tonight...

182
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,719
I don't like this vibe...

183
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:54,889
Let's play Puyo Pop!

184
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:55,879
Huh?

185
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,889
Play me in Puyo Pop.

186
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,699
What's with you?

187
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,859
I played it today at
Genshiken, it was kind of fun.

188
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,829
Wow...

189
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,099
Here we go!

190
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,069
Whadda ya think?

191
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:27,649
Huh?

192
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,929
Oh?

193
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,589
Yeah!

194
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,499
Hah!

195
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,289
Here I go!

196
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,259
Ice Storm!

197
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,529
Take that!

198
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,029
You're done for!

199
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,569
You're done for!

200
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,639
Ha ha, you suck!

201
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,739
What?

202
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,069
What?

203
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:51,219
Oh yeah!

204
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:53,009
<i>Thuddy thud.
Oh yeah!</i>

205
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:54,719
All right!

206
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,929
Puyo Pop cosplay.

207
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,129
Does it turn you on?

208
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,699
Well, I mean, you're a puyo.

209
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:21,139
That night was the last time Saki
Kasukabe ever played a video game...

210
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,119
Hello.

211
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,029
Where's Kohsaka?

212
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,819
In Akihabara...

213
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,129
What, aren't you playing
league matches today?

214
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,169
Looks like it's best not to
pour any more fuel on the fire.

215
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:58,279
Dammit, if Kohsaka were here,
she could just leave with him.

216
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:00,679
Oh yeah, that's right.

217
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:03,349
It's almost been a year
since you joined, Sasahara.

218
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:04,979
Y-Yeah.

219
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,849
So? Have you grown at all?

220
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:09,779
Grown?

221
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,829
What do you mean by
"growth" in this case?

222
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,359
Well, I spend a lot more money now.

223
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,859
But I get the feeling that's
just me being out of control...

224
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,739
I can't call myself an otaku
when I don't have my own computer.

225
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,779
Whoa, you say you're not otaku?

226
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,669
No, it's not that.

227
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,369
Maybe I just have a ways to go...

228
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,879
Why don't you buy a computer?

229
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,919
Have you got some
mental block against it?

230
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,079
Not at all.

231
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:39,279
Like I said before,
I spent all my money.

232
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,049
No, you can buy one!

233
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,989
If you put your mind to
it, you'll find a way.

234
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,819
It's like that proverb...

235
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,389
Think after you buy!

236
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,419
Th-This would be the part
where s-someone smacks you down.

237
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:57,129
But, that's exactly why I
don't have any money right now.

238
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,009
True.

239
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,849
Oh, that's me.

240
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,199
I don't know this number...

241
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,219
Then don't answer it.

242
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,409
I couldn't do that.

243
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:11,389
Hello...

244
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,149
Oh hell, it's you!

245
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:19,249
What's with this big time
un-Sasahara-like attitude?

246
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,269
You switched cell phones again?

247
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,059
Yeah, yeah...

248
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,199
Wait a minute!

249
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,299
No, I'm on my way!

250
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:29,839
Don't move.

251
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,959
No, not that...

252
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,299
Yeah...

253
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,839
May I ask who?

254
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,249
My little sister's at
the train station...

255
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,759
Wow, you've got a sister!

256
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:46,909
Trippy.

257
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,919
First a childhood friend, now a sister!

258
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,149
I feel s-so moved.

259
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,959
No, you've got the wrong idea!

260
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,129
She's a fashion slave, a
trashy high school chick.

261
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,139
She wouldn't understand us, in fact
it's best if you don't meet her.

262
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,309
On that note, you don't go for
the "little sister" look at all.

263
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,069
In fighting games you always
use the sexy older female characters.

264
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:08,999
You're right.

265
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,309
I can say for a fact that fad's
just an illusion for those...

266
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,109
...who don't actually have a sister!

267
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,439
You're such a fool, Sasahara.

268
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,719
Why would I ever need a
little sister I'm related to?

269
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,219
Hah, he's not pulling any punches.

270
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,219
B-But, in a way it's normal.

271
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,849
You'll think she's from
another planet if you see her.

272
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,229
Well, that's how it goes.

273
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,869
Please don't follow me!

274
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,369
We won't.

275
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,339
The station, you said?

276
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,519
So that's her...

277
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,789
Yup, she's got nothing
in common with us...

278
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:57,559
You can't even see her
face through the make-up.

279
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:00,189
T-They all look the same.

280
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,359
What do you think she calls him?

281
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,999
Big Brother is right out.

282
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,539
With her, probably "bro."

283
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,539
Or else "h-hey you..."

284
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,379
What's with you guys?

285
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,009
Took you long enough, monkey!

286
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,979
Monkey...

287
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,209
Pity...

288
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,039
You're still saying that?

289
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,219
Whatever, lend me some money.

290
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,979
You mean you came all this way for
that?

291
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,559
My boyfriend and I went
to the park zoo in his car...

292
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,829
...but we had a fight and I got ditched.

293
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,429
My purse's in his car.

294
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,859
Weren't you the one who said...

295
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,269
..."Nothing good comes of
choosing a guy by his looks?"

296
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,189
I know, but it's no use.

297
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,269
I can't stand homely guys.

298
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,369
My friends are all the same way too.

299
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,239
Besides, this is normal.

300
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,879
Now I go home on my own
and we make up big time.

301
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:55,379
It's the big "in" thing right
now, this whole "test" thing.

302
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,819
I don't get it.

303
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,389
So give me some money.

304
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,889
That wouldn't make it "on your own..."

305
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,259
I'll bet she's the type who's
easily influenced by friends.

306
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,419
Is she?

307
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,219
And it only takes an instant.

308
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,929
I can't see her growing up in
the same household as Sasahara.

309
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,899
What was Sasahara's first name again?

310
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
I think it's Kanji...

311
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,369
Y-You can't be...

312
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,839
Hey Kanji!

313
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:24,439
What're you up to?

314
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,569
I thought you were
gonna hang out with me.

315
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:27,609
What?

316
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,549
Oh, who's she?

317
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,219
Huh? Eh?

318
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,449
Kasukabe, look...

319
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,419
I asked you not to follow me
because you do things like this.

320
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,619
Way to kill the mood!

321
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,969
You really are a boring guy.

322
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,629
My friend's girlfriend...

323
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,869
You see how she is...

324
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,069
An otaku?

325
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,139
Don't hit her for that just
because she's my sister...

326
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,179
You two look identical in the face.

327
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,049
What the? Is she,
like, always this rude?

328
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,919
Something tells me this
is going to end ugly...

329
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,889
Come on, that's enough, Kasukabe.

330
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,499
You too, Keiko.

331
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,699
What are you guys up to?

332
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,179
They said he went to Akihabara...

333
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:37,479
That means he went and bought
more pain in the ass otaku crap.

334
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,449
Hello!

335
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,219
My sister.

336
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,519
Hello.

337
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,689
Let's get going, Kohsaka.

338
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:48,259
This is her real boyfriend.

339
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,159
Huh?

340
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:50,659
Oh, right!

341
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,199
These are the ones we had on order.

342
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,429
Here's yours.

343
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,169
Thanks...

344
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,339
What a coincidence, they
delivered it right before my eyes.

345
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,969
What's that? Looks big, must be cool.

346
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,709
Well, y'know...

347
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,969
It's about as tall as I am.

348
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,989
Want to see it? They're both the same.

349
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,349
I do, I do, I so want to!

350
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,429
No, don't sweat it. Not here, Kohsaka!

351
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:17,419
That'd do it...

352
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,149
Y-You called it...

353
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,519
Here it comes...

354
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,229
Kohsaka, let's go.

355
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:25,299
Sasahara's sister needs to talk to him.

356
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,369
Oh, okay.

357
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,569
Unrolling this huge thing
would get in the way, anyway.

358
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,509
There's no one around, though.

359
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,339
She needs to hurry home, too.

360
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,369
There's a test that
needs passing, right?

361
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,209
Huh?

362
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,249
That's right.

363
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,319
Here's some money, now scram.

364
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,749
I'm in no real hurry.

365
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,749
Right now I want to see this.

366
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,789
Okay, just for a bit.

367
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,289
Ah, not here...

368
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,599
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

369
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,159
W-What a cute picture.

370
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,059
So looks win out, huh Keiko?

371
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,689
That's really nice.

372
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,729
Isn't it?

373
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,759
She's from a game I really like.

374
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,829
K-Kill me now...

375
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,789
There's no escape now...

376
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,499
She's so not ready for us.

377
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,629
9000 for the tapestry, then
5000 loaned to my sister...

378
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,039
...and I've got a wallet full of air.

379
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,439
See ya.

380
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,449
Sure.

381
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,579
Is there any chance Kohsaka
would quit being an otaku?

382
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,629
Not at all, he's way
more otaku than I am.

383
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,419
He sure doesn't look it!

384
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,629
Kasukabe over there is also
trying to make him quit...

385
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,359
...but from here it looks like she's
walking down a rough and thorny path.

386
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,269
Give it a rest and
stop dwelling on looks.

387
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,799
Just leave it to Kohsaka
to spice up the situation.

388
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,739
That poor little sister.

389
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:21,849
What do you mean?

390
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,319
That was 9000 yen, though?

391
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,349
If that's how you spend money,
you'll never afford a computer.

392
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:31,389
Yeah, although...

393
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:36,729
To not buy what one
likes is to deny oneself.

394
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:38,589
Sasahara...

395
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,369
While that's true, we're all aware
that you don't own that adult game!

396
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,139
You probably play it at Kohsaka's!

397
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,409
Just buy a computer already!

398
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:51,839
Don't eat for three months!

399
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,509
That's ridiculous...

400
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,709
W-Why not try cutting back
on games and DVDs for now?

401
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,879
PCs are cheap these days.

402
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,269
Hey, Kohsaka.

403
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:17,529
Hmm?

404
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,129
Will you watch anime again today?

405
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:19,869
Uh-uh.

406
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,579
Not today.

407
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:48,169
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

408
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:57,469
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

409
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:06,779
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

410
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:16,499
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

411
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:26,909
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

412
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:38,379
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

413
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:47,829
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

414
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:57,839
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

415
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:06,679
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

416
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,049
<i>Suioh University</i>

417
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,939
Hey, do you know much about S&M?

418
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,259
Huh?

419
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,569
What?

420
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,039
Heartache's been
feeling good to me recently...

421
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,539
I wonder if that's a kind of S&M...

422
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,279
Hey Ohno, is cosplay fun?

423
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:43,879
Will you do it?

424
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:44,919
No, I won't!

425
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,889
I can understand if foreigners do it.

426
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:48,509
So much is based on western
culture and clothing...

427
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,559
...they don't look that out of place
as fantasy characters and whatnot.

428
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:52,359
But it just doesn't work for Japanese.

429
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:52,899
Um...

430
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,019
And then these cosplay
names, why are they in kanji!?

431
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,569
And it's names like Reika and
Sakuya with high stroke counts!

432
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:01,899
Then their surnames sound like some
court noble. I mean, "Ayanokouji?"

433
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,869
I mean, it's like get
a grip and know thyself.

434
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:08,399
Saki, you just made enemies of
a million cosplayers nationwide.

435
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,739
Huh? Why?
