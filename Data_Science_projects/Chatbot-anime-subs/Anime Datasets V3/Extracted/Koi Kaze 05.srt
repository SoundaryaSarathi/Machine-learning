00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,700
Distant Thunder

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,800
Hey Daddy, will there be a panda? A panda?

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
What? panda?

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, I'm leaving now.

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,100
Unbelievable.

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,100
You're still here?

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,900
Brother, if you have nothing to do, could you at least clean the bathtub?

23
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,000
Did she notice?

24
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
It was only for an instant.

25
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
There's no way.

26
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,300
There's no way...

27
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Brother.

28
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
<i>soumen = cold white noodles, eaten at summer</i>
What should we have for lunch? Is soumen okay?

29
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,400
Dad hasn't come back since he left to get his hair cut.

30
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Let's just go ahead and eat-

31
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
You went into my room, didn't you?

32
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah.

33
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Tomorrow's the day to take out the trash, so earlier...

34
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,700
I've told you before, haven't I? Not to go in without my permission.

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,700
But... all I did was empty your waste basket. I didn't touch anything else...

36
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,400
That's not the problem!

37
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm saying that I'll take care of my own trash!

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,300
You wouldn't like it if I went into your room right?

39
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
You're right.

41
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,300
Idiot. You're just too inconsiderate.

42
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
You don't have to put it like that...

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,900
I was just trying to be nice.

44
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
It's unnecessary.

45
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't ever make me repeat myself again.

46
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,700
What was that?

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,900
Insinuation?

48
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,000
No. No way...

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was just for an instant.

50
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
There's no way she could have noticed.

51
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,100
But...

52
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,900
That's suspicious.

53
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,300
Really?

54
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,800
Definitely suspicious. Why would he get so angry for just going into his room?

55
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Maybe there was something he really didn't want you to see.

56
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,600
Ah, I know!

57
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,400
What? What?

58
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
A present.

59
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
He makes himself seem like a major jerk,

60
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,000
and tomorrow he'll suddenly transform into the nice big brother.

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Ah! That kind of a plan!

62
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Nanoka, it's your birthday tomorrow right?

63
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,500
No way! No way! That's definitely not it!

64
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,700
Maybe Nanoka's big brother is pretty simple minded.

65
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,400
That's not a bamboo tree anymore...

66
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,100
<i>Tanabata = festival of the Weaver, celebrated on July 7th</i>
It is the Tanabata Rendezvous Party.

67
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,400
The mood is very important to young women!

68
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Young women?

69
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
candidate member : female member
age 15 ~  marriable age

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Wha... What are you...!

71
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,100
The guy over there, decorating the bamboos with tanzaku without complaining...

72
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
it looks really ominous.

73
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I want a sister - Odagiri

74
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,200
Wha... What are you doing?

75
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,900
Even if you have a younger sister, it's not a good thing.

76
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,000
A guy who fights over the TV channels with his cute younger sister wouldn't understand my feelings!

77
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,400
Man its steaming out here.

78
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Going outside is the worst.

79
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,400
Do you want to go for a drink?

80
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Sure! I was just about to ask you.

81
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Is it all right not to call home?

82
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,100
After Nanoka-chan came, you've been calling home every time you're going to be late, right?

83
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,000
No I haven't.

84
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
There's no use hiding it.

85
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,900
Why don't you wipe your mouth?!

86
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I don't care about her.

87
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,700
She's the one who just suddenly came into my life.

88
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't give a damn about her.

89
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,700
I really don't give a damn about a girl like her...

90
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Brother?

91
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Don't come near me!

92
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,100
It's dangerous with the broken pieces.

93
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,900
That's my bowl.

94
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,700
It was my favorite bowl! What are you going to do?

95
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,400
I won't be able to eat my rice tomorrow.

96
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Umm... brother...

97
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,300
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

98
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,700
I have to go out early tomorrow too, so I won't need a lunch.

99
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
Just say it.

100
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,100
That I'm sorry I sniffed it.

101
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm sorry for feeling a sexual desire.

102
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
No.

103
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
What good would saying that do?

104
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,800
She might still have the same piece of underwear on from that time, without knowing anything.

105
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,000
From that time...

106
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,200
What? Koshiro left rather early today again.

107
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,900
Does he know that it's your birthday today?

108
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,200
It's fine...

109
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,800
that brother isn't here.

110
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,420
Brother is suddenly gone

111
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,170
father understood it

112
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,300
As long as father is here
I am happy

113
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Our shelter is a small and creative one... This place is...

114
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Ah I know!

115
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
What? What?

116
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
A present.

117
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
He makes himself seem like a major jerk

118
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,900
and tomorrow hell suddenly transform into the nice big brother.

119
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,500
Ah! That kind of a plan!

120
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
Nanoka its your birthday tomorrow right?

121
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
Your father called.

122
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,700
Nanoka chan left without taking an umbrella, so he asked you to wait for her at the station.

123
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Why me?

124
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
He can't leave because he's preparing her birthday party.

125
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,400
Birthday party?

126
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
This is why you...

127
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,400
Umm...

128
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,200
Brother...

129
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

130
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,000
Why don't you go for her? I don't mind if you leave early--

131
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I just don't get it.

132
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
This is my chance...

133
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,200
to use her birthday to fix everything.

134
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,500
I can say "Congratulations!" or "I'm sorry I forgot about it!" and

135
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,700
bring up all these plans and make her happy!

136
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,700
She's a birthday idiot, so if I give her some flowers or something she'll probably cry and thank me.

137
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,800
This way I can get rid of my guilt!

138
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
I can probably...

139
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
I can...

140
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm sorry...

141
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
No... No! Damn!

142
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,700
There's nothing I can do! I'm the worst!

143
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,400
God I'm the worst!

144
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,400
No, no, no, that's not it!

145
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,500
I'm sorry I forgot about your birthday... And I wanted to say sorry!

146
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
There's no deeper meaning in this...

147
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,900
It's okay.

148
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,800
It's okay.

149
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,800
Did you come to get me?

150
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,900
No this isn't for that...

151
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,600
Is that for me?

152
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,300
No, this isn't... It's for the Buddha idiot!

153
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm glad.

154
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I thought you were really mad at me because I saw you naked in the bathroom.

155
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Why would I get mad?

156
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,100
It's normal to be just in my underwear the whole day with this weather.

157
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,400
Eh? It is?

158
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Yeah.

159
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Oh, it is...

160
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,800
Yeah! You were really scary last night!

162
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
For your birthday present,

163
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I'll buy you whatever you want.

164
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,500
Really?

165
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,200
Then...

166
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I was supposed to be able to do it...

167
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
To get rid... of my guilt...

168
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,700
Why?

169
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,550
yasashii yume ga
a gentle dream

warming up this moment...

179
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,920
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

180
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,290
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

181
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,790
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

182
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,910
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

183
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,700
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

184
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,370
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

185
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,950
I'll say it however many times as necessary.

186
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,410
I innocently really want a teenage younger sister.

187
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,820
Is that a crime? Is it wrong?

188
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,410
Then as we're fighting over the TV channels, our love will sprout...

189
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,400
Whipping punishment!
