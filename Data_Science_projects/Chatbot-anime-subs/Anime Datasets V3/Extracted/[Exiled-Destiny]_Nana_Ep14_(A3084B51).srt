1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:07,821
Although it's already May, the wind
at night still feels very cold.

2
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:11,501
This is no different from my home town
in the mountains.

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:17,361
I had thought that Tokyo
was a warmer place.

4
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,841
When I was darkness at that time

5
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:46,671
With trembling lips

6
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,771
In a corner of a room I cry

7
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:54,851
The more I struggle

8
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,681
The more this wound deepens

9
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,851
The broken promise hurt me

10
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,581
Nobody can save me

11
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,761
God, I have only one request

12
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:12,391
Stop tearing apart my love

13
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,731
I need your love

14
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,961
I'm a broken rose

15
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,911
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

16
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,081
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

17
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,841
I need your love

18
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,151
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,081
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

20
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:37,041
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

21
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,021
I wanna need your love

22
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:43,251
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:45,591
I wanna need your love

24
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,661
Well, this may still be Tokyo,
but we're way out in the suburbs.

25
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,901
Or rather, don't you think
the weather's gone nuts?

26
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,501
One day it's hot like summer
and then another day it gets cold enough

27
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,971
to convince you we've
gone back to winter.

28
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:34,041
Is the weather gonna get even crazier?
I'm getting worried.

29
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,751
I'm a lot more worried about you,

30
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,321
Shin, the way you're headed on
a direct path to destruction!

31
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,281
Why?

32
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,421
Oh, the phone.

33
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:53,031
Hello. Oh, Mayumi? Mhm, no problem.
Where are you now?

34
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,501
Roppongi? I'm out in
the suburbs right now.

35
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,701
Then do you mind if I got on a taxi?
Really?!

36
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,031
All right!

37
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,941
Yeah. I'll be on my way now.

38
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,981
I'm sorry but something came up
so I'll be going now.

39
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,281
Okay. Be careful.

40
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,271
- Although...
- Shin.

41
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:17,591
You're free to choose whatever life
you wish to live,

42
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,351
but don't you do anything that will
give the band a bad name!

43
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,531
Nana!

44
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,201
Shin's only fifteen,
so you could be kinder to him

45
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,101
than push him away
from you like that.

46
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,561
What would you do if he goes astray
and joins some biker gang?

47
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:39,711
Hey, Shin. I don't know
why you left home,

48
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,481
but I'm sure you were going through
some very difficult times

49
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,451
to make that decision, right?

50
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,941
Did your stepmother tease you?

51
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:48,881
- Stepmother?
- It's all right!

52
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,381
You don't hafta talk if it's painful.

53
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,261
But, Shin, please understand one thing.

54
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,091
If you underestimate women,
you'll get hurt in the end.

55
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,661
Okay. I'll be careful.

56
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,171
Oh boy.

57
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,171
Not!

58
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:11,941
You haven't fixed anything.

59
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:13,771
Besides, how is giving some advice
gonna help him?

60
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:16,651
Advice? You're wrong.
I was giving him a warning.

61
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:19,741
I'm going home. I have to start work
in the morning tomorrow.

62
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,051
Nana!

63
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,551
Don't be so unfriendly and stay with me.

64
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:25,681
How do you expect me to
spend the time alone here?

65
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,961
Are you serious about waiting here
until Shoji gets off work?

66
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,261
It's easily another hour, at least.

67
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,101
But...

68
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:35,221
There's no need to wait.
He did say he'd drop by our place later.

69
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,271
But still!

70
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,761
Jun-chan told me I should show him
that I care for him.

71
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,611
Whatever. Then let's go
wait for him inside.

72
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,571
No!

73
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,341
Since he said not to wait for him,

74
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,831
openly waiting for him in full view
would only have the opposite effect.

75
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,911
Then like I said, let's go home.

76
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,781
If he thinks I went home only to find that
I had been waiting for him,

77
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:54,251
don't you think that would
touch his heart?

78
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,851
That's just silly.

79
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:58,921
You have no clue how
a young girl in love feels, Nana!

80
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,251
I don't understand!

81
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,521
I hate cunning women like that.

82
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,531
If you just say you're waiting for Shoji
because you love him, then sure,

83
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:10,901
I have no problem staying here with you.

84
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:17,071
Well of course, that's the first
and foremost reason...

85
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:22,341
Then all that other stuff is unnecessary.
Just wag your tail and wait.

86
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:34,021
I hate cunning women like that.

87
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:47,241
Nana!

88
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,271
It's okay! You'll catch a cold.

89
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,671
I'm not that weak.
Besides, I don't feel cold.

90
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,901
No way. It's really cold today.

91
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,981
Compared to the cold weather
I experienced in my hometown,

92
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:00,311
Tokyo is like a tropical island.

93
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:04,121
The place I lived is covered in snow
half of the year.

94
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:08,261
So that's what your hometown's like.

95
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,361
I'd like to go there sometime.
The place where you grew up.

96
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:20,131
Thanks. It's warm.

97
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,771
Yeah.

98
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,871
You know how Shoji said he had
something he needed to talk to me about?

99
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,351
He had such a serious look.
It got me thinking.

100
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,691
So I'd probably be unsettled
and restless if we went home.

101
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,581
Sorry for having you stick around.

102
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,041
I couldn't say anything else.

103
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:07,351
I just continued listening to
the tune Nana was quietly humming.

104
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:12,291
Nana's eyes were so clear.

105
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,891
She seemed to fit in better
with snowy mountains,

106
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,451
than in this city where
you can barely see the stars.

107
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,601
The truth is I am a very cunning woman.

108
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,911
I was no longer the pure woman
who would continue waiting for Shoji,

109
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,341
while expecting nothing in return.

110
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,871
But I pretended to be.

111
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,651
Because I didn't want
Nana to dislike me.

112
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,511
Good night! I'm going on ahead!

113
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,141
Sachiko... You know, I...

114
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,511
I'm gonna break up with her.

115
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:14,691
Hey!

116
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,251
They're finally finished.
Someone's coming out.

117
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,831
Really?

118
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,391
Sachiko!

119
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,071
What?

120
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:50,421
This girl...

121
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,121
I'm sorry!

122
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:58,491
Sachiko? Of all the names...

123
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:05,501
What are you doing?
What's with this woman?

124
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,351
She's my girlfriend.

125
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,661
Huh?!

126
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,621
You telling me that
you have two girlfriends?

127
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,061
You sure have it good!

128
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,191
This can't be. This can't be happening.

129
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:36,631
I need to talk to you about something.

130
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,471
There's gotta be some sorta mistake.

131
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,571
I'm sorry!

132
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,201
There's no way Shoji would
do something like this.

133
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,131
Don't!

134
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:18,811
Sachiko! It's okay, stay back!

135
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,211
Don't be violent with Shoji!

136
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,451
Shut up! I won't be satisfied
until I beat him up!

137
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,111
Stop it!

138
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,121
Stay out of this!
This has nothing to do with you!

139
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,741
You're the one who
has nothing to do with this!

140
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,251
She's right.

141
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,251
If you want to hit someone,
then hit me!

142
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,021
H-Hey!

143
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,681
I was the one who had a crush on him!

144
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:36,161
I knew he had a girlfriend,
and still I could not stop myself!

145
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:39,861
I won't hide or run away
so hit me to your heart's content!

146
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:53,781
You sure have guts.

147
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,251
Cut it out.

148
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,251
Hachiko!

149
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,751
Why are you just standing there?!
This is your fight!

150
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,111
You do something!

151
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,521
If you don't fight,
you've accepted defeat!

152
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,451
He's your man, isn't he?
Fight to get him back!

153
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,201
I don't want him.

154
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,211
I don't even wanna see his face.

155
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,901
I wasn't mature enough
to forgive his betrayal.

156
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:58,541
And I had too much pride to cling onto
someone who just hurt me.

157
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:01,541
I lose.

158
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:06,741
The next day, like a sick person, I spent
all day not being able to get outta bed.

159
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,451
I tried not to think about anything.

160
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,851
I wanted to put my mind
on something else to distract me,

161
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,451
but I didn't feel like doing anything.

162
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,021
I repeatedly dreamt about Shoji.

163
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:04,901
Coming.

164
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,271
Who is it?

165
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:20,751
Ren?!

166
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:28,091
What a surprise. It was a dream.
What is it with me,

167
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,491
dreaming of celebrities at times like this
when I'm supposed to be heartbroken?

168
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,591
But why Ren?

169
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:39,661
Could this have had something
to do with it?

170
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,731
But I'd rather dream of Takumi...

171
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:49,071
It really is the doorbell! Is it Takumi?
Or could it be Naoki? Maybe Reira?

172
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,281
Yes, coming!

173
00:14:57,191 --> 00:15:00,091
Thank goodness! You're alive!

174
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,791
Oh. It's only you Jun-chan.

175
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,061
Come on! How many times
must I ring the doorbell?

176
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,401
You had me worried that you
slit your wrists or something.

177
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,461
Give me a break.

178
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:12,901
My wrists?

179
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:20,011
I see. So you heard about last night.
Slitting my wrists...

180
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,551
That may be better than
jumping off a bridge.

181
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,581
Oh, Nana must've called you.

182
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:28,591
Huh?

183
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:32,211
She's working today so she's worried
about leaving me here alone all day.

184
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,381
No. Your roommate isn't the type
to think of doing such a thing.

185
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,531
Huh?

186
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,321
Shoji called me a short while ago.

187
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:47,231
He's worried about you.

188
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:51,471
The hell with him.

189
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:56,441
If he cannot come himself
I don't want him worrying about me!

190
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,121
You're right. Sorry, it was
stupid of me to tell you.

191
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,191
But you know, Nana, this is
hard on Shoji too.

192
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:18,231
You know very well the type of guy he is.

193
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,441
Are you taking his side, Jun-chan?!

194
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:22,461
No, this isn't about taking sides.

195
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:24,401
He was cheating on me all along!

196
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,981
It wasn't the whole time!
And don't say that he cheated on you.

197
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,881
There you go again!
You are taking his side!

198
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:48,691
Maybe I am.

199
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:54,341
To me, Shoji is a good friend
just as important as you, Nana.

200
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,931
I can't always be taking your side
about everything.

201
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:00,141
Honestly, I have a problem with

202
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,171
your tendency to be
quick to play the victim.

203
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,051
It's true. Shoji is at fault

204
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:08,021
for going after another woman
before clearing things with you first.

205
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,861
But before we focus on that,

206
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:14,151
you've gotta acknowledge
you're also to blame for this, Nana.

207
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,631
I know that.

208
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,931
But I did the best I could, Jun-chan.

209
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,561
I even found a job, so that I could
make it on my own.

210
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:34,241
But that's something you did
for your own sake.

211
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:39,011
From long ago, you would always
think about just yourself.

212
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,721
You showed very little care for Shoji.

213
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:46,581
Love is all about a relationship
two people build for each other.

214
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,651
If you cannot care for your partner,
the relationship isn't gonna work out.

215
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:13,811
I'm back.

216
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:24,121
You could at least turn on the light.
I know you're depressed, but come on.

217
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:27,791
Nana! Welcome back. No way.
I didn't realize how late it is.

218
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,371
You must be hungry. I'm sorry.
I didn't prepare dinner tonight.

219
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,301
I expected as much, so I bought us
some dinner on the way home.

220
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:36,971
Let's eat.

221
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,611
Are these tears of joy?

222
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,981
I've always thought this.
You always put yourself first,

223
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,481
but at the same time
you're so caring to others.

224
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:46,471
Caring?

225
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:47,951
And what's this about me
putting myself first?

226
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,991
On the other hand, look at me!
I did nothing but think about myself!

227
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,921
It never occurred to me that you'd be
coming home with an empty stomach!

228
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,231
You don't need to worry about that.

229
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:58,561
But friendship is about a relationship
two people build for each other.

230
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,231
Why are you suddenly
bringing up the obvious?

231
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,421
Let me at least make you some tea.

232
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,061
By the way, there's a letter for you
from Natsuko.

233
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,061
Mom sent me a letter?

234
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,001
Bottom line, Natsuko has
a knack for sensing these things.

235
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:13,171
The way she contacts you without fail
when you're in a bind.

236
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,011
Because she is your mother.

237
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:15,051
Natsuko Komatsu
Because she is your mother.

238
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,141
Natsuko Komatsu

239
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:30,261
If she asks me to come home now,
I would be tempted to accept.

240
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,661
This registered letter came for you.
Would you at least give them
notice of your change of address?

241
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,671
Is that all?
Where are my words of consolation?

242
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:43,411
What's the matter, Hachiko?!
Are you all right?!

243
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:44,411
This won't do!

244
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,381
Scissors.

245
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,601
Where did I put them? Never mind.
A paper-knife will do.

246
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,041
A paper-knife!

247
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:51,441
Don't do it! Shoji's not
the only man in the world!

248
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:54,451
I know that! But more importantly,
the tickets arrived!

249
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,951
- Huh?
- Tickets to the Trapnest concert.

250
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,921
I bought two tickets. Wanna go?

251
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,331
Nana.

252
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,901
No matter how unbearable life may seem,

253
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,431
good things will happen
as long as we're alive.

254
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,181
They're front row seats.

255
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:23,311
Gates Open 5:30 pm
Performance 6:30 pm
Reserved seating 5,250 yen (tax included)
Floor 1, Central Aisle, Row 1, Seat 27
They're front row seats.

256
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,111
Gates Open 5:30 pm
Performance 6:30 pm
Reserved seating 5,250 yen (tax included)
Floor 1, Central Aisle, Row 1, Seat 27

257
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,961
Now that I think back,
during those days

258
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:45,161
it was as if luck had eluded me
on a daily basis.

259
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,401
I never had much luck
with the lottery either.

260
00:20:56,111 --> 00:21:00,951
Those tickets were something
God had set aside for Nana.

261
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:12,691
I reached into the sky

262
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:19,201
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

263
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:24,571
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

264
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:30,571
Like colorful balloons

265
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,681
I'm alone

266
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:36,411
My hand had no place to go

267
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:43,051
And gently you took it

268
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,231
Starless night

269
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:48,431
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

270
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:54,231
I want to feel your warmth

271
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:56,111
Tears are falling down

272
00:21:56,111 --> 00:22:00,201
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

273
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:06,711
Of your hand holding mine
