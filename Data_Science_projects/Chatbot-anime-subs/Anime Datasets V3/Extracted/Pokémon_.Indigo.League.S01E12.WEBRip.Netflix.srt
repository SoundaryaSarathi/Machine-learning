00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,960
[all gasping]

171
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,046
[groans]

172
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,506
Pikachu!

173
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,091
[yells]

174
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,221
Ugh, they got us!

175
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,723
Squirtle.

176
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,147
-Squirtle.
-[Meowth laughs]

177
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,108
You’re not going to Squirtle out
of this one!

178
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,735
-It’s Meowth!
-Meowth?

179
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:22,205
I’m the Pokémon in charge here.
Just wait till my human pets get back!

180
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,415
Na-na-na-na-na!

181
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,458
[grunts]

182
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,168
[screams]

183
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,505
Don’t believe him, Squirtles.
Meowth’s a big liar.

184
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,257
Those humans aren’t Meowth’s pets.

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,635
Team Rocket’s trying to trick you all
into doing their dirty work.

186
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,845
Squirtle.

187
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,596
Quiet, human!

188
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,936
Who are you going to believe,
this human or a fellow Pokémon?

189
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,896
[all] Squirtle. Squirtle...

190
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,734
-Ash, Pikachu’s in bad shape!
-Huh?

191
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,528
[Misty]
We’ve got to do something!

192
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,698
[Brock] We’ve got to heal Pikachu
with super potion before it’s too late.

193
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,535
But we don’t have any super potion.
What can we do?

194
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,913
-A shop in town sells it.
-In town?

195
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,916
Squirtle Squad, please,
you’ve got to let me go into town.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,878
If I don’t get the medicine,
Pikachu’s in a lot of trouble!

197
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,338
Squirtle. Squirtle.
Squirtle. Squirtle...

198
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,341
They know you humans
are just trying to get away!

199
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,302
Trust me. I won’t run away!

200
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,513
As soon as I buy the medicine,
I’ll come back. I promise!

201
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,931
Squirtle.

202
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,058
Squirtle says promises are cheap!

203
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,021
I’m begging you. Please trust me.

204
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,189
[sobs]

205
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,404
[whimpers and wheezes]

206
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,867
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...

207
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,120
The Squirtle says
if you’re not back here by noon tomorrow,

208
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,539
the red-headed girl
gets her hair dyed purple!

209
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,000
-Purple! Why you mangy little flea trap!
-Huh?

210
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,501
When I get out of this,
I’m going to wrap your tail--

211
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,962
Misty, don’t worry. I’ll be back, okay?

212
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,548
[grunts]

213
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,386
So long! Be back in a flash!

214
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,847
Good luck.

215
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,060
Even if that kid does make it back,
we’ll all be long gone.

216
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,311
[chuckles]

217
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,776
[in mind] <i>Just hold on a little longer,</i>
<i>Pikachu. I’ll get you that super potion!</i>

218
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,279
[screams and grunts]

219
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:28,206
I got to keep going.
Pikachu needs me to get that medicine.

220
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,421
Just don’t look down.

221
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,802
[grunting and yelling]

222
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,515
[sighs]

223
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
[gasps]

224
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,194
Man, that was close!

225
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,990
[gasps and screams]

226
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,246
[screams and grunts]

227
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,593
That’s it. That’s the place!

228
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,888
[yelps]

229
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,726
I beg your pardon.

230
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,060
[groans]

231
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,944
[wheezing]

232
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,904
Pikachu, don’t give up.

233
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,907
Ash will be back here
with the medicine soon. Just hold on!

234
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,120
[in mind]
<i>Where are Jessie and James already?</i>

235
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,376
-[Jessie] All right, freeze!
-[all] Huh?

236
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,337
These are ice packs we’re gunning,
I mean ice guns we’re packing!

237
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,547
It’s Team Rocket!

238
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,218
Cool! We’re just like those supervillains
in the comic books, except better looking.

239
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,512
And even meaner!

240
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,349
[Jessie] Listen up!
We want all the flash powder you’ve got!

241
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,728
-[James] And a large roll of dental floss.
-[Man] What do you need them for?

242
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,189
[Jessie] You want to get rid
of the Squirtle Squad, don’t you?

243
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,816
The flash powder will scare them
out of town!

244
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,778
-The floss is for our teeth.
-The Squirtle Squad!

245
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,906
<i>-Ciao</i> for now.
-Farewell!

246
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,324
[all gasping and grunting]

247
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
Look! It’s snowing!

248
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,334
It’s Team Rocket! I’ve got to get back
before they get Pikachu!

249
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
[grunts]

250
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:44,133
Super potion, please!
Oh, no, I don’t need a new gun!

251
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,720
-Don’t shoot me, please. I’m not--
-[Jenny] Stop!

252
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,098
Drop those! He’s not with Team Rocket!

253
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,727
Step on it, Jenny.
I got to get there by noon!

254
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,646
Just hang on, Ash! Huh?

255
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,731
[tires screech]

256
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,820
A dead end.

257
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,744
These flash blasts will scare
the shells off the Squirtle Squad.

258
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,331
[Jessie] And in the confusion,
we’ll snatch Pikachu!

259
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,917
[Jenny]
Here’s a secret entrance to the cave.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,710
[Ash]
Gee, there’s not much room.

261
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,004
[Jenny]
The passageway’s too narrow for an adult

262
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,508
-but maybe you can squeeze through.
-I can do it!

263
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,846
Be careful, Ash!

264
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:38,312
It’s too dark to see in here.
Hey, I know!

265
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:44,026
-Charmander, I choose you!
-Char! Char!

266
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,489
-Charmander, lead the way!
-Charmander!

267
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,915
[Ash grunts]

268
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,170
They’re gone! Pikachu!

269
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,713
[screams]

270
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,340
Misty! [gasps and grunts]

271
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,595
What’ve you done?
I told you I’d be back by noon and I am!

272
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,555
What did you do with my friends!

273
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,017
-We’re right here.
-Huh?

274
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,061
-Squirtle...
-Where’s the super potion for Pikachu?

275
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,522
Oh, uh, here!

276
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,941
Hurry! Let’s spray it on Pikachu!

277
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,740
-So, Misty, your hair isn’t purple.
-Nope! I’m still a redhead!

278
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,742
[Brock]
The Squirtle Squad was bluffing!

279
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,120
They play tricks but they’d never change
a girl’s natural hair color!

280
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,414
-Hm?
-Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...

281
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,002
That blast! It’s Team Rocket!

282
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,922
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

283
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,466
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

284
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,010
[both]
To denounce the evils of truth and love,

285
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,513
to extend our reach to the stars above...

286
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,139
-Jessie.
-James.

287
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,434
Squirtle Squad, it’s payback time
for insulting Team Rocket.

288
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,894
[both] Bombs away!

289
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,983
[Jessie]
Meowth, carry Pikachu up the ladder!

290
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,445
And the rest of you are in
for a real blast. Get it?

291
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,073
Meowth!

292
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,659
Pikachu!

293
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,786
[all yelling]

294
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,121
Quick, run for cover!
Head for the cave!

295
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,583
[Misty] Hurry!

296
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,377
Squirtle.

297
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,504
-Squirtle!
-Squirtle.

298
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,216
Here I come!

299
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,634
[Ash grunts]

300
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,386
Oh, Ash!

301
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,809
[Ash groans]
Hey, Squirtle, are you okay?

302
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,770
[feeble] Squirtle...

303
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,731
Here come two more!

304
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,192
Save yourself, Squirtle.
Run for it!

305
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,155
- Whoa, Squirtle!
- Squirtle!

306
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,117
[both grunting]

307
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,829
Look out!

308
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,039
[all yelling]

309
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,966
No more Squirtle Squad!

310
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,343
The town’s going to give us medals
and we’ll be heroes!

311
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,720
[Ash] Not so fast!

312
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,973
-Who said that?
-Huh?

313
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,766
-[Jessie] Weren’t they...
-[James] Didn’t they...

314
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,894
[Meowth] How did they...
- Squirtle! Water Gun attack now!

315
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,148
Squirtle!

316
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,525
[all yelling]

317
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,403
-[James] Come back here!
-Pikachu!

318
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,364
[grunting]

319
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:42,705
[Team Rocket] Looks like
Team Rocket’s blasting off again!

320
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,631
A fire! The blasts must have set it off!

321
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,342
If it keeps burning,
the whole town could go up in smoke!

322
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,345
-Don’t worry, Jenny. I’ve got an idea.
-Oh.

323
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,097
Listen, if you Squirtles work together,

324
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,809
you can combine your water guns
to put out the fire!

325
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,619
And so we gratefully award
this certificate to the Squirtle Squad.

326
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,621
Thank you for saving our town
from the fire.

327
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,791
Because of your skill and bravery,

328
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:31,712
we proudly appoint you
the town firefighters!

329
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,798
Squirtle!

330
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,720
Pi, Pi, Pika, Pikachu.

331
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,307
Hey, Ash, that Squirtle is following us!

332
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,936
Squirtle. Squirtle.

333
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,398
Would you like to come along with us,
Squirtle?

334
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,359
Squirtle!

335
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,656
[Ash laughs]

336
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,326
-Welcome to the team, Squirtle!
-Squirtle!

337
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,371
-Guess I’ve caught a new Pokémon!
-Pikachu!

338
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,041
-Caught? What do you mean caught?
