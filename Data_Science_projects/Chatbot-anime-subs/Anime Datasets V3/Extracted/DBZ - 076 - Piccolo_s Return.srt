00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,840
"Kami-sama Also Returns to Life! Piccolo
is Resurrected By Super Shen Long."

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,570
He- He's huge! His form is different than the one on Earth as well.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,810
Thi- This is Shen...ron?

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,340
Thou who hast gathered the Dragonballs,
now speak forth thy wish.

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,690
I shall grant thee any three wishes,
as long as they are within my ability.

6
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,720
Awesome! He really does grant three wishes!

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,920
We should have expected as much from the
native Shenron! It sure is generous of him!

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,160
What should we do? We have three wishes.

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,300
Your wishes, quickly! Don't forget about Freeza and Vegeta!

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,300
Oh yeah. First...

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,510
Ask him to please bring back to life
everyone that the Saiyajins killed on Earth.

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,300
All right, I got it!

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,390
That wish cannot be granted.

14
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,460
Restoring the dead to life can only be
accomplished one individual at a time.

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,500
Oh no!

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,080
Apparently, he can only bring back
one person at a time.

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,280
Only one at a time!?

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,960
If they only have three wishes... and
there's me, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo...

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,890
All right! I'll have myself restored to life first.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,830
What was that?

21
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, Kaio-sama, I'll go first-

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,270
Wait! Don't be so selfish, I'm going first!

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,240
What are you saying!? I was the first one of us to die!
Therefore, I will be the first brought back!

24
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,700
That's ridiculous!

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,240
Everyone! Let's draw straws!

26
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,180
No way! You'll use your telekinesis to cheat on us!

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,780
How awful! I wouldn't do that!

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,910
Let me...

29
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,790
Let me talk with Gohan!

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,460
- What?
- Please!

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What keeps thee? Speak forth thy
wish. I shall grant thee any three wishes,
as long as they are within my ability.

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,040
Within his ability, he says.

33
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,780
Quickly! If we're found out by Freeza or Vegeta, we're finished!

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,040
What do we do? Only one person can be brought back per wish!

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,150
This is quite a fix. Who do we choose?

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
Damn it! For the native Shenron,
he's not that generous after all!

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,130
You say you want to speak with Goku's son? What are you planning to do, Piccolo?

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,930
Why you! What are you thinking of doing!?

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,640
You're not thinking of having just yourself
brought back, are you!?

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
What!? Is that right?

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,310
Piccolo, that's not fair!

42
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,540
You're not the only one who's been
training here! We've also powered up
several levels, you know. What's more-

43
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,410
Hurry and let me speak, please!

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,790
All right, then. Place your hand on my
shoulder, and then you can speak.

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,060
Gohan! Can you hear me!? It's me! It's Piccolo!

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,260
Gohan!

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,460
Gohan!

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,070
Answer me, Gohan! It's me! Piccolo!

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
Piccolo? It can't be!

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,780
Where are you, Piccolo-san?

51
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,660
I'm using Kaio to speak directly
into your hearts.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,450
I won't have you dishonor my name. Kaio-sama
is how I am addressed, Kaio-sama.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,230
Into... our hearts?

54
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,670
We know that you only have three wishes,
and that only one person can be brought
back to life per wish.

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,930
Now listen closely!

56
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,770
With the first wish, bring me back to life!

57
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,620
- Wait!
- We won't let you get away with this, Piccolo!

58
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,170
You shut up!

59
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,790
Don't forget, if I am returned to life,
Kami will be also.

60
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,760
When that happens, the Dragonballs
on Earth will also be restored, and the
rest of us here can then be brought back.

61
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,790
Hey, yeah! We can do it that way!

62
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,190
Understood, Piccolo-san.

63
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,010
I get it now. So that's what you were after.

64
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,730
- Nice thinking!
- Piccolo is great!

65
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,570
Now, I'll tell you the second wish...

66
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,980
Once I... Once I'm brought back to life, bring me
to Planet Namek, where you guys are!

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,190
I... I want to fight.

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,250
I want to fight that rotten Freeza, who has killed my people, in the land where I was born.

69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,860
What are you saying, Piccolo!?

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,100
I've gained great power since I've been here.
I'll defeat him for you for sure!

71
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,010
Send me there to that planet you're on. Got it?

72
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,970
Understood, Piccolo-san!

73
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,670
I'm counting on you. Do whatever
you want with the third wish.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,220
Right! I'll be so happy once you get here!

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,580
Hey, Piccolo!

76
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,950
Have you forgotten the promise
you made to me?

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,950
That you would never fight against Freeza?

78
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,730
I must have. I don't remember making
such a promise.

79
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,630
What's that?

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,660
Unfortunately, my memory isn't that great.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,440
- Why you!
- Hold it now...

82
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,740
- Kaio-sama!
- Just take it easy!

83
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,240
Let go of me! How dare you do this to me!

84
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,100
I don't know what kind of punk you are, but I,
Piccolo-sama, will be sure to defeat you!

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,450
You guys! You have no idea how terrible Freeza is!
Let go of me! I can't talk to you like this!

86
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,650
Okay!

87
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,630
Before we do anything else, let's get
those two wishes granted!

88
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,860
- Right!
- Dende!

89
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,430
- Yes?
- Ask that Piccolo, the Nameksei-jin who
was on Earth, be brought back to life!

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,700
Piccolo-san, you say? Got it.

91
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,680
Any second now, Piccolo-san...

92
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,020
What's this? Something's headed this way!

93
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,900
It's an incredible battle power!

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,700
F- Freeza!

95
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,050
It will still take several more minutes for
Kakarotto to fully recover.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,190
It's still a bad time for Freeza to appear.

97
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,320
Ah, crap. I got a bad feeling about this.

98
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,920
What?

99
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,770
What's going on here? It's night!

100
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,500
Why?

101
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,400
There isn't supposed to be any night time on
this planet. So then why is the sky so dark?

102
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,500
This has to mean...

103
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,500
No, it couldn't be...

104
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,040
It couldn't be... It couldn't be!

105
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,210
It couldn't be!!

106
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,210
Understood. I shall grant thy first wish.

107
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,510
NO!!

108
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,350
The Dragonballs are gone!

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,080
Damn it! Kakarotto's son is also missing.

110
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,590
Why you dirty rotten little brat!

111
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,350
What's that monster over there?

112
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,670
Is that the dragon they said would appear
out of the Dragonballs?

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,330
Damn it, those rotten kids have gotten
the jump on me!

114
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,280
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!!

115
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,510
This is bad! Freeza is almost on top of us!

116
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,790
I'm reading four life signs. At last, I've
found you!

117
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,260
Just you wait for what you've got coming,
you inferior life forms!

118
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,830
It vanished!

119
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,130
All right.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm alive again! Now, for the next wish!

121
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,970
I'm counting on you, Gohan!

122
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,090
I won't be responsible for this! It's out
of my hands now!

123
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,790
Wait!... Wait! Wait!

124
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,530
Kami-sama!

125
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,870
Piccolo, you rascal.
That was some smart thinking.

126
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,900
Popo, you've taken good care of the
place in my absence.

127
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,840
Great! Kami-sama is back alive! So happy!

128
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,550
I have granted your first wish.

129
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,180
Now, speak forth thy second wish!

130
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,360
The second wish is to have Piccolo, who was just restored
to life, transported here to Planet Namek.

131
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,690
Right!

132
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,140
Dende, make it fast! Vegeta's found us out!

133
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,800
Okay!

134
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,230
That is a simple matter. I shall grant your second wish.

135
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,530
Such a fool!

136
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,580
I have granted thy second wish.
You may now speak thy final wish.

137
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,180
He said it's granted? But Piccolo isn't here yet.

138
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,380
Where are you, Piccolo-san?

139
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,020
You just said to have him brought to this
planet... so he could be anywhere.

140
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,720
Did you mean you wanted him brought here?

141
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,160
Oh, no!

142
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,400
What should we do? We could use the third
wish to bring him-

143
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,750
Vegeta!

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,960
I knew it! I knew it was something like this!

145
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,900
How dare you... How dare you try to
trick me, Vegeta-sama, you punks!!?

146
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,170
You'll pay for this!

147
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,400
You idiots! You've taken the only chance
we had to defeat Freeza and wasted it!

148
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:45,310
The only way we can win is if I am made
immortal. You dirty, stinking brats!

149
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,390
Wait! We've only had two wishes granted so far, there's
still one wish that remains to be granted.

150
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,820
Idiot! Keep your mouth shut!

151
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,330
I'm quite relieved to hear this.

152
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,770
What is that column of light there?

153
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,200
Thats where the life sign readings are...

154
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,240
No! They couldn't be using the Dragonballs to get their wish!

155
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,180
What is thy third wish?

156
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Now then, make me immortal! Hurry up and do it now!

157
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,270
Lousy brat!

158
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,870
Don't you know what "Do it now" means!?

159
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,630
Dende!

160
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,270
You have to do it right now! Freeza is nearly upon us!

161
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,380
If that wish gets granted...

162
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,250
But we don't have any other choice! Father's
injuries won't heal for some time still...

163
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,640
So this is my homeland?

164
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,840
Planet Namek.

165
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,450
Then it's no wonder I feel such an odd
nostalgia for this place.

166
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,360
The Nameksei-jin blood that flows within
me must be responsible.

167
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,760
Hold on, this is no time to be so sentimental.
I'd better locate Gohan and the others.

168
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,540
Damn, where are they? They aren't
around here anywhere close.

169
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,640
Wh- What's that!?

170
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,540
I can feel a tremendous Ki off in the distance.

171
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,080
Can that be the monster, Freeza?

172
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,530
There are three other Kis near there.
Gohan and the others...

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,430
All right. Hold on, Gohan!

174
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,610
I still await thy final wish. Thou may
speak it now.

175
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,910
What are you waiting for!? Tell him now!
Make me immortal!

176
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,410
Do you want to be killed by Freeza?

177
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,690
Krillin-san, Freeza is almost here!

178
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,740
Our situation is desperate.

179
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,400
Dende! Let him have his wish!

180
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,040
Vegeta may be incredibly bad, but at least he's
better than Freeza. I hate to have to do this,

181
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,680
but right now, there's no other way to
get us out of this pinch.

182
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,220
Very well.

183
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,290
All right, that's better.

184
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
So, do it now.

185
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,790
Okay.

186
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,960
Stop messing around!

187
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,940
This is good! This will fix it so that Freeza won't be able to kill me.

188
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,080
I just have to keep after him, and even if I can't
do it now, eventually I will defeat him!

189
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,900
Very soon now, the time will come when
I, Vegeta-sama, will rule the universe!

190
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,970
What?

191
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,130
What's happened? Why did the dragon
disappear, and the sky become light again?

192
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,070
Why have the Dragonballs turned into
those stones?

193
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,840
The Senior Elder-sama has...

194
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,300
Dende...

195
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,310
The Senior Elder-sama has...

196
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,510
passed away.

197
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,470
Are you sure?

198
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,170
The life of the Senior Elder-sama, who created
these Dragonballs, has come to an end.

199
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,810
What do you mean, you little snot!?

200
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,280
What about my... what am I supposed
to do about my immortality!?

201
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,640
What do you want me to say?

202
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,950
You rotten punks!

203
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,880
If you hadn't double-crossed me, none
of this would have happened!

204
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,860
You're going to pay! You dirty, rotten fools!

205
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,640
Freeza!

206
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,080
You've really done it now, haven't you, gentlemen?

207
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,890
You have done an outstanding job of
shattering my dreams of eternal youth.

208
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:46,440
I certainly trust that you fools are now
prepared to pay the price.

209
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,250
It's the worst possible situation... Freeza
has at last arrived!

210
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,040
Freeza is burning with anger. In this great
crisis, what will happen with Piccolo?
What will happen with Goku?

211
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:13,040
