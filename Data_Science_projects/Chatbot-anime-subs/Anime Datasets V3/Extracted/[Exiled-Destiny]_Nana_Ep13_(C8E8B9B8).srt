1
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:05,271
The biggest reason I chose that job
was because,

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,501
unlike working in sales,
I get weekends off.

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:12,381
I felt that I would then be able to
spend more time with Shoji,

4
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:16,151
who's busy with school
and work during the week.

5
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,881
When I was darkness at that time

6
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:45,711
With trembling lips

7
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,811
In a corner of a room I cry

8
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,891
The more I struggle

9
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,721
The more this wound deepens

10
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,891
The broken promise hurt me

11
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,621
Nobody can save me

12
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,801
God, I have only one request

13
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,431
Stop tearing apart my love

14
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:14,781
I need your love

15
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:18,011
I'm a broken rose

16
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:20,951
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

17
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:23,121
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

18
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,891
I need your love

19
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,191
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,131
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

21
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:36,091
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

22
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,061
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:42,301
I'm a broken rose

24
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,631
I wanna need your love

25
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,851
Kyosuke, have you ever been
unfaithful to your partner?

26
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,291
You did it? With Sachiko?

27
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,291
The defendant shall
just answer the question!

28
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,101
The defendant would be you.

29
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,201
I've never been unfaithful to my partner.

30
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:16,301
You liar!

31
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,141
During our senior year,

32
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,671
you're the dumbass who fooled around
with several girls at the same time!

33
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,971
Was I?

34
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:24,271
Don't play stupid with me!

35
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,581
I know it all! There's that college girl
you met at the club,

36
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,981
the nurse from the hospital you were
taken to after that bike accident...

37
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,721
And Tamura's sister from class six.

38
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,591
You have a pretty good memory.
I didn't know you were that jealous.

39
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:37,561
Anyway!

40
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,061
There's no way a cruel man

41
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,721
with such a past record
would not cheat on his partner!

42
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,461
Are you that desperate
for a partner in crime?

43
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,271
But that really brings back memories.

44
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,531
Those days were the peak of
my popularity in my life.

45
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,231
My popularity with the girls
has plummeted as of late.

46
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,441
Then if you were still popular,
you'd fool around, right?

47
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,711
I wouldn't.

48
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,041
Why not?
Because you're afraid of Junko?

49
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,651
Well sure, it's natural to be
afraid of Junko,

50
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:02,781
being a former delinquent in school
and all.

51
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,981
Because I'm afraid of losing Junko.

52
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,091
Check please.

53
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:13,531
Right away.

54
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:25,071
There's a woman there
who totally pisses me off!

55
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,441
What do you call them?
You know, like, a spinster?

56
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,341
"Miss Komatsu, you can't even
make a decent cup of tea.

57
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,411
You'll never make a good wife."

58
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:36,111
She's the one who can't find a husband,
that thirty-eight year old bitch, Sakagami!

59
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,391
What's wrong, Shoji? You seem to be
under the weather today.

60
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,421
Well, you know, I wish you
wouldn't say stuff like "bitch".

61
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,531
Did you pick that up from
your foul-mouthed roommate?

62
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,331
But she really pisses me off!

63
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,361
It's only a small publishing company,
but they have a ton of little side jobs!

64
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,241
They speak down at me,
I've gotta work overtime

65
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,571
and I even had to come in
both days this weekend

66
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,101
because of the approaching deadline!

67
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:04,351
So much for weekends off.
I hate it. I wanna quit!

68
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,281
Then quit.

69
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,081
Don't say it so casually!

70
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:11,521
You just said you wanted to quit.

71
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:16,861
But it's not that easy. I haven't even
worked there for a week yet,

72
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:20,321
and if I quit, there's no guarantee that
I'd find another job right away.

73
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,991
And I can't make a living unless I work.

74
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,601
Then you've got no choice.

75
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,441
Well, it's easy for you, Shoji.

76
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,181
Bottom line,
you're a carefree college student,

77
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,811
and your parents pay
for your basic needs.

78
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,251
If you hadn't bought that computer,
and you watch your expenses closer,

79
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,311
you'd have no problem getting by
on what you get, right?

80
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:00,631
That was awful. Why am I like that?

81
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,131
Why can't I be a nice, cute girl
in front of Shoji?

82
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:22,721
Unless he asks me to go home with him,
we won't be able to make up.

83
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:31,391
Wanna come up?
Nana's probably still at work.

84
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,731
No, it's okay. You have to get up
early tomorrow to get to work.

85
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:37,101
Good night.

86
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:43,371
You're mad at me, so don't try to
force a smile.

87
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,941
Unless you're direct with me,
how am I supposed to apologize?

88
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,191
Miss Komatsu!

89
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,291
How long is it taking you to
sort those postcards?

90
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:58,251
You really are slow!

91
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,831
Yes, excuse me Ms. Sakagami.

92
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,761
- In a way,
- Oh, why did

93
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,031
- this woman is a breath of fresh air
- the editor in chief hire

94
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,001
- the way she's direct about everything...
- such a useless girl?

95
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:06,971
although she still pisses me off.

96
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,911
The publishing company where
I started working is located on

97
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:14,241
a floor of a multi-tenant building,
in the heart of the big city.

98
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,611
A small company that issues
information magazines targeted at

99
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,101
young men and women in
their late teens and early twenties.

100
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,821
Since I'm the same age group
as those targeted,

101
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,911
I came into this job thinking this
would be the perfect workplace for me.

102
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,661
But my job here consists of...

103
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:36,761
cleaning, serving tea, taking copies,
delivering manuscripts, and etc...

104
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,591
None of this has anything
to do with the magazine itself.

105
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:48,241
Just simple jobs that anyone can do.
But so much of it with no end in sight.

106
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:54,071
Ow, my feet hurt...
From tomorrow, I'm wearing lower heels.

107
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:00,791
Editor in chief.

108
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,411
Yes?

109
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,711
Here are the illustration manuscripts
from Mr. Noguchi.

110
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,731
Oh, thank you for your efforts.
Nana, how about a drink tonight?

111
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,701
Not a good idea!

112
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,861
The editor in chief is on the verge
of sexual harassment.

113
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,001
- The company employees are
- Could you speak a little slower, please?

114
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,401
- mostly older men past their prime.
- A little slower, please?

115
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,501
Nana-chin.

116
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,471
Make me some coffee.

117
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,341
The few young ones are all like that guy.

118
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,571
At the least comb your hair,
25-year-old Honda!

119
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:23,871
Miss Komatsu!

120
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,071
Can't you even make copies properly?!

121
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,971
They're all crooked!

122
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,811
I'm so sorry.

123
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,321
And the trains are so crowded.

124
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,321
What in the world is there
to look forward to

125
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,121
as I make my way to
the workplace daily?

126
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,551
I'm so exhausted!

127
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,901
Why is there no elevator
in this seven story building?

128
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,371
Why? Why is it?

129
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,481
This must be why the rent is so cheap.

130
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,681
I'm home.

131
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,651
Hachiko!

132
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,421
Wh-What is it? Your smile is too bright.

133
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,221
A live show! A live show!

134
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:11,761
They had an opening in an
upcoming event at Shimokita,

135
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,321
and they're letting us
fill that spot and play.

136
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,231
Huh?

137
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:16,661
It's for thirty minutes on May 5th!

138
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,471
Yay!

139
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,941
Don't cry, Hachiko!
We're gonna party today!

140
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,591
Hey, did you hear?
On May 5th, Children's Day,

141
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,731
Sachiko Kawamura
Hey, did you hear?
On May 5th, Children's Day,

142
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:44,891
Hey, did you hear?
On May 5th, Children's Day,

143
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,991
they're gonna decorate the kids' meals
with little carp kites.

144
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,461
Look at this. Cute, don't you think?

145
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,931
Wow, this is really well made!
This is great.

146
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:55,841
You want it?

147
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,201
Yeah, sorta.

148
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,911
But you can't have it. I got it as
a birthday present from our boss.

149
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:04,401
Huh? It was your birthday?

150
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,411
Why didn't you say anything about it?

151
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,181
No, not yet. My birthday is
on Children's Day.

152
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,451
I told him it's a shame I won't
see them being served

153
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,321
because I won't be working that day,

154
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,381
then Boss gave it to me,
saying it's a birthday present.

155
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:22,361
Oh, so that's it.
I'm off in the evening that day,

156
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,851
so why don't we spend the evening
together to celebrate?

157
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,271
Really?!

158
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,341
What do you want for your present?
A chimaki, maybe?

159
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:31,501
I love chimakis.

160
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,731
Shoji, your cell phone.

161
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,941
Oh, sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

162
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,581
You should answer it.

163
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,181
Incoming call
Nana
You should answer it.

164
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:39,551
Incoming call
Nana

165
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:39,581
Incoming call
Nana
- Ah, but...
- It's from your girlfriend, right?

166
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:40,881
- Ah, but...
- It's from your girlfriend, right?

167
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:43,581
If you keep ignoring her calls,
she's gonna become suspicious.

168
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,611
I'll step outside.

169
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,451
Ah, then I'll go out...

170
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,851
Damn, what am I doing?
Pathetic.

171
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:56,991
Hello?

172
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,671
Oh, Shoji! You're awake!

173
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,831
Guess what?! The date for Nana's band's
first live has been decided!

174
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,001
Ah, r-really? That's great.

175
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,731
It's at 8 p.m. on May 5th.
Can you make it?

176
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:09,881
The 5th?

177
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,551
Sorry. I can't make it on the 5th.

178
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,221
What? You can't?! You have work?

179
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:18,551
Yeah.

180
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,111
No way.
Can't you do something about it?

181
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,521
No. You know, it gets extra busy
on national holidays, so I've gotta work.

182
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,791
I'm really sorry.
We'll do it some other time.

183
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,101
Sure.

184
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,141
On Children's Day,
let's scatter some beans.

185
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,681
You're thinking of
the Setsubun festivities, Shoji.

186
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,221
Stop looking. It's so distracting.

187
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:03,861
Well, I was thinking, "Wow,
what a good looking woman,"

188
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:04,831
then I noticed it was you.

189
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:05,901
Huh?

190
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,031
You won't get anything
from seducing me.

191
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,031
I don't really need anything.
As long as I have you by my side.

192
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,001
What's gotten into you?
You have food poisoning?

193
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,071
I forgot to tell you
the eggs in the fridge are old.

194
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:21,681
You know, I've been wondering why
people have a change of heart.

195
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:25,051
But the more I think about that,
the tougher it is to take.

196
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,441
Oh?

197
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:31,851
I had forgotten all about Tamura
from class six until Shoji brought her up.

198
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,391
Tamura from class six?

199
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:36,591
Unlike the other girls I went out with,
I really fell in love with her.

200
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,301
And it really hurt when I found out
she was only playing with me.

201
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,001
Whatever.
Typical teen years.

202
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:48,931
You know, there's nothing
we can do about Shoji.

203
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:50,881
What do you mean?

204
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,771
Don't tell me, he did it with Sachiko?

205
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:55,921
You know, I didn't think
he was the kinda guy

206
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:59,221
who was capable of cheating,
from a number of perspectives.

207
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,551
As far as I know, neither did I!

208
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:06,561
He's not just fooling around, either.
He's serious about the other girl.

209
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,751
He's seriously fallen in love with Sachiko.

210
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:12,491
He's no longer able to
think rationally or morally.

211
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,331
There's nothing we can do.

212
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,321
What's he gonna do about Nana?

213
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:38,351
I wonder. It's not as if anything's
happened for him to dislike Nana.

214
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:40,021
I'm sure he continues to
have feelings for her.

215
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,901
But he's gotta make things clear,

216
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,131
or else he'll end up hurting
both Nana and Sachiko.

217
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:48,291
You're right, but that's
based on your values.

218
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:52,071
I don't know much about Sachiko,
but what would be best for Nana?

219
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,681
As long as she doesn't find out about it,

220
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:56,541
Shoji may be necessary for her
even if he is seeing someone else.

221
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,711
Over time, Shoji's feelings
for the other girl may cool.

222
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,181
You can't expect me
to agree with that logic.

223
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,621
But just imagine for a minute.

224
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:09,351
Imagine Nana after she gets
ditched by Shoji.

225
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,221
Frightening, don't you think?
She might even slit her wrists.

226
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,361
I just hope Shoji is
doing everything possible

227
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,891
to make sure Nana doesn't find out!

228
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,941
Can't be sure. It's really frightening.

229
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,711
Hello, Nana here. Oh, Jun-chan?

230
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,451
It's been a while. What's up?

231
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,111
Ah, Nana?

232
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,251
You're in the middle of work now,
aren't you? Is it okay to talk?

233
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,891
Mhm. No problem. We met our deadline,
so things are pretty peaceful here.

234
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,161
Hey, about that email you sent me
regarding your roommate's live show.

235
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,901
Yeah, right! It's next Saturday!
Can you come?

236
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,401
Mhm. I'll go with Kyosuke.
So tell me how to get there.

237
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,601
The three of us can go together then.

238
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,371
Huh? The three of us? What about Shoji?

239
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,381
Shoji said he had to work
and couldn't come.

240
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,981
Huh?

241
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,171
Hey, Jun-chan. Don't you think Shoji has
been acting a little weird lately?

242
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:10,351
What do you mean?!

243
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:11,891
I just have this feeling.

244
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,791
You think so?
He hasn't really changed at all.

245
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:17,081
But I get the feeling
he's been avoiding me.

246
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,421
That's not true! You're imagining it!

247
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:22,461
But it seems that Shoji's
seriously growing tired of me.

248
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:25,561
Well, you know, you mustn't
make excuses about how busy you are.

249
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,201
As hard as it may be,
try making the time to see him.

250
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,441
Show him that you really care
and I'm sure he'll reconsider

251
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:33,131
his feelings for, .,
I mean his attitude towards you!

252
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,811
Oh, I see. You're right. I'll show him
that I care. Yeah, I'll do my best.

253
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,311
Thanks, I'll call you later.

254
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,641
Come on, Ms. Sakagami.
What are you doing here wasting time?

255
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,141
Please get back to work.

256
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,661
Why do I hafta take the fall for Shoji?
This is all wrong.

257
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,501
But what else can I do?

258
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,831
Thank you very much!

259
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,201
Shoji!

260
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:05,811
I came.

261
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,631
Sorry for coming here without any notice.

262
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,401
Nice to meet you. I'm the bassist, Shin.

263
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,881
Hachi wouldn't shut up about
wanting to see you.

264
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,311
We came all the way here,
so you're paying.

265
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,451
Umm... Then allow me to
show you to your table.

266
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,791
Please do.

267
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,661
This way, please.

268
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:27,761
No way. I'd rather sit
at that window seat over there.

269
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,721
Why should it matter where we sit?

270
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,671
Welcome.

271
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,131
Huh? Where'd Shoji go?

272
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,441
I'm sure he went to
get us water or something.

273
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,371
Would you sit down, already?

274
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,671
Your boyfriend is so cool, Nana.
And that uniform really suits him.

275
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,111
Doesn't it? Though he's kinda lame
when he speaks.

276
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,421
Now how many times have I heard that?

277
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,561
What are you doing, Miss Kawamura?!

278
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,421
Excuse me! I'm very sorry!

279
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,931
You could hurt yourself if you
pick it up with your bare hands.

280
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,021
I'll go get a broom.

281
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,301
You're bleeding! Are you okay?!

282
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,041
Your handkerchief. I'm sorry.

283
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,471
Don't worry about it. You can have it,
so never mind.

284
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:17,711
But...

285
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,311
What's important now is
for you to treat that cut.

286
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,621
I'm sorry!

287
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,751
Huh?

288
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:30,691
Miss Kawamura. Why are you crying?
Get a hold of yourself!

289
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,721
I'll take care of things here.
You go to the back.

290
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:37,391
I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble, miss.

291
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,671
No, please do not worry about me.

292
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:45,111
You're so kind, Hachiko.
My impression of you has just improved.

293
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:49,911
Actually, I used to work at
a family restaurant like this in the past,

294
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,141
so when I see something like that
it's like seeing myself.

295
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:55,471
Oh. I can just see you making
far worse blunders.

296
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:56,281
Huh?

297
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,841
What's that supposed to mean?! Come on!

298
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,921
I've run away again.

299
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:06,761
What am I doing hiding like this?

300
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,421
I should've predicted this much.

301
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:13,561
Well, Nana might not realize,
but Sachiko could very well realize.

302
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:15,661
Nana can be pretty loud, too.

303
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,971
Please, let Nana be nice and quiet.

304
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,941
I really am pathetic. I could just puke
thinking about how detestable a guy I am.

305
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,871
Sachiko.

306
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:03,241
Let's put an end to this, Shoji. She's cute,
kind, and such a wonderful girlfriend.

307
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,021
What just happened
between you and her?

308
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,751
It's all right. I doubt
she's caught onto anything.

309
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,751
Let's put an end to this,
before she ends up getting hurt.

310
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,531
I'm sorry, Shoji.

311
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:26,041
If I hadn't gone after you like I did,
none of this would've happened.

312
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,201
That's not true.

313
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,641
But at this rate, I'll just be
more of a bother to you.

314
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,071
That's not true!

315
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,781
This'll continue hurting me, too.

316
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:48,391
No one can end up happy in this situation.

317
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,901
Make sure you take good care of her.

318
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,911
I guess it's kinda hard to eat
with a pierced lip.

319
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:12,991
Serves you right.

320
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,961
Shin. You seem to be getting
more piercings by the day.

321
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:18,581
Now you even have one there.

322
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:20,961
What have you done
to your beautiful face?

323
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,021
I'm sure kissing is harder with that.

324
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,051
No, I had no problem with that.

325
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,731
Shin! Who'd you kiss? Was it Nobu?!

326
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,711
Huh? Is Nobu into that sorta stuff?

327
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:33,671
Is he?!

328
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,501
Ah, no. But I thought this guy might be.

329
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,431
I'm straight.

330
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:43,421
Hey, Shin. Do you plan to continue living
at Nobu's place like you are now?

331
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:49,051
Actually, I haven't been to Nobu's place
much lately. I don't wanna be a burden.

332
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,461
So you've returned home.

333
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,461
Nope.

334
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,951
Then where are you staying?

335
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,491
At some women's places.

336
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,091
I move from place to place.

337
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:05,441
I'm still fifteen, I look like this,
and I still can't find a steady job,

338
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:09,031
but I realized that if I live this way,
I won't have any money problems.

339
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,811
Surprisingly, life can be pretty easy.

340
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,481
Shin... You're a natural born bastard.

341
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:20,081
Bastard?

342
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:21,791
One day, you're gonna

343
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,761
- get killed by a woman.
- Shin.

344
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,851
I'm so sad.

345
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:26,251
Nana.

346
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,371
Come on, Shoji.
Where had you run off to?

347
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,671
Do you have any plans after this?

348
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,671
No. I have four straight days off
from work starting tomorrow.

349
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,511
I can wait for you to get off work.

350
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,771
You don't hafta wait.

351
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,111
Huh?

352
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:50,351
Can I go to your place later?
I need to talk to you about something.

353
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:57,791
If Nana hadn't been with me that evening,

354
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,561
I probably would've thrown myself
into Tama River and sunk to the bottom.

355
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,761
I seriously think so.

356
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:12,831
I reached into the sky

357
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:19,341
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

358
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:24,721
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

359
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:30,711
Like colorful balloons

360
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,831
I'm alone

361
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:36,561
My hand had no place to go

362
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:43,191
And gently you took it

363
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,371
Starless night

364
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:48,571
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

365
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:54,371
I want to feel your warmth

366
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,251
Tears are falling down

367
00:21:56,251 --> 00:22:00,351
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

368
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:06,851
Of your hand holding mine
