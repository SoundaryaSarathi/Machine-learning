-James.

Meowth. I don't get why you two
are always talking

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,167
and I'm stuck doing all the work!

19
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,544
We haven't got much time.

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,213
If they're headed for Pewter City,
they'll have to pass this way!

21
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,757
And they'll fall right into our trap.

22
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,677
[Meowth] Come on! Dig it deep,
then we'll cover it up so well

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,013
they'll never guess it's a trap!

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,389
Ha! Perfect!

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,726
Ah!
I can't even tell where the trap is!

26
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,519
-Wasn't it here?
-Is this it?

27
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,271
-Where did it go!
-It's over there.

28
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,523
[all] Hm.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,774
[all] Hm? Huh?

30
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,486
[all groaning]

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,538
[narrator] <i>Continuing his quest to become</i>

00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,301
-Yay, Pewter City!
-Phew.

37
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,012
For a while there,
I thought I was going to be in this forest

38
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,306
-for the rest of my life.
-Chu.

39
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,392
Pewter City is gray, the color of stone.

40
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,771
This town has always been famous
for stone.

41
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,191
Huh? What the...?
Who's this old guy?

42
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,400
Never met him.

43
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,152
The name's Flint.

44
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,656
And you're sitting
on some of my merchandise, young man.

45
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,282
Oh, sorry!

46
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,827
Uh, you mean you sell rocks?

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,374
They're Pewter City souvenirs.
Want to buy some?

48
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,003
No, thanks. I'm traveling,
trying to become a Pokémon trainer.

49
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,213
Uh-huh.

50
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,382
[sighs]

51
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,926
Well, your Pokémon sure looks worn out.

52
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,554
Why don't you follow me?
I'll show you to the Pokémon Center.

53
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,016
See, looks can be deceiving.
He's a nice guy.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,975
Are you sure?

55
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,521
By the way, that'll be a $2 charge
for resting on my rocks.

56
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,605
Ah!

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,735
[Ash]
Please revitalize my Pokémon.

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,531
-Sure, right away, Ash!
-Huh? Nurse Joy?

59
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
Yes, I'm Nurse Joy.

60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,661
But this isn't Viridian City.
This is Pewter City.

61
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,372
The Joy in Viridian City
is my little sister.

62
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,124
I'm the older Joy.

63
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,668
I've heard nice things about you,
very nice.

64
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,421
-Uh, thank you.
-Have you seen that poster?

65
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,220
The Pokémon League
Regional Championships!

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,221
All right!

67
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,223
-[Misty] Ha!
-Huh? What's the matter?

68
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,392
To compete
in the regional championships,

69
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,311
you need to beat Gym trainers
from different towns

70
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,188
and get their badges as proof.

71
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,859
-Can you do that?
-Of course I can!

72
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,318
[Flint chuckles]

73
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,113
Don't tell me you plan
on challenging Brock,

74
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,865
the Pewter City Gym Leader.

75
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,158
Of course I do.

76
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,953
As soon as Pikachu and my other Pokémon
are better, I'll have no problem.

77
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,873
Take me to this Brock's Gym.
I'll beat him!

78
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,332
[chuckles]

79
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,877
You'll beat him, heh.

80
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,923
[Ash] Ooh, that Flint,
trying to make a fool out of me.

81
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,341
Do you really think you can win?

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,928
Gym leaders are different
from your everyday Pokémon trainer.

83
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,680
They're much, much tougher.

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,603
I'll tell you what, Ash, if you ask me
really nicely, I'll help you out.

85
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,563
I don't need any help.

86
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,649
Huh? Is that so?
Fine with me.

87
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,278
There's no way you'll beat Brock
in the Pewter City Gym. Huh!

88
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,286
Hey, you can't leave me with the bill!
Come back here!

89
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,831
Well, Ash, no more waiting.

90
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,501
Pikachu and your other Pokémon
are all back to normal.

91
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,628
-Oh, that's great!
-Chu!

92
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,587
All right!

93
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,259
[Ash] So this is Pewter Gym?
All right, then.

94
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,762
Hello!

95
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,020
-[Brock] Who goes there?
-Huh? Oh!

96
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,191
So, you must be Brock.
I'm Ash from Pallet Town.

97
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,609
I challenge you!

98
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,654
-Is this your first Gym match?
-Um...

99
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,532
A Gym match is different
from other battles.

100
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,701
This match
is for Pokémon League authorization.

101
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,620
There are special rules.

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,373
Um, what do you mean by special rules?

103
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,543
We will use two Pokémon each,
understood?

104
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,669
[Ash] Oh.

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,964
How long have you been
with that Pokémon?

106
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,049
Uh, about two weeks, I guess.

107
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,010
Yes, your Pikachu
is in its cutest stage!

108
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,013
-Ka-chu.
-[Brock] It can't win.

109
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,475
I'll worry about my Pokémon
and you worry about yours, all right?

110
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,893
Suit yourself.

111
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,646
As Gym Leader,
I have to accept every challenge,

112
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,690
so let's just get this over with.

113
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,782
Whoa! Oh!

114
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,869
[panting]

115
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,829
[grunts]

116
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,258
[grunts] Ah. Let the match begin.

117
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,721
All right.
Okay, Pikachu, I choose you, buddy.

118
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,681
Pikachu!

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,559
Onix, go!

120
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,732
[roaring]

121
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,358
Pika...

122
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,360
[roars]

123
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,364
Chu. Pikachu.

124
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,827
Hey, this is your battle, Pikachu,
not Pidgeotto's! Go.

125
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,290
Pika, pika? Chu!

126
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,502
-Onix, tackle attack!
-Chu!

127
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,006
[roars]

128
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,467
Chu, chu!

129
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,302
Onix, bind it now!

130
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,263
[growls]

131
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,973
[grunting]

132
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,935
Unh! Pikachu, Thundershock!

133
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,480
Pika!

134
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,068
[grunts]

135
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,903
You haven't raised it very well.

136
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,781
Such a weak electric attack
can't hurt Onix!

137
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,660
-Chu.
-Pikachu, return!

138
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,123
It's being blocked.
I can't bring it back.

139
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,584
Chu!

140
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,920
[grunting]

141
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,382
[grunts then cries]

142
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,843
Argh! Cut it out!

143
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,762
Do you surrender?

144
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,642
[Ash]
I... I do.

145
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,311
[bell dings]

146
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,864
Huh?

147
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,368
Come with me.

148
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,754
Everyone loses sometimes.
You can't let that get you down.

149
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,800
I know, but I didn't just lose.
I stunk!

150
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,552
Brock's way better than me.

151
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,304
I could never enter a league match
if I can't beat him.

152
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,307
Brock is very good.

153
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,226
His own talents could take him
much further

154
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,478
than simply being
the local Gym Leader.

155
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,774
Yeah, but why has he never been
in a regional championship himself?

156
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,236
-He has his reasons.
-Huh?

157
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,995
[indistinct chatter]

158
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,289
I tore my skirt!

159
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,375
All right, all right,
I'll sew it up for you.

160
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,543
Huh?

161
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,380
Is it done yet?

162
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,090
Just a minute.

163
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,553
Wow, I sure never
thought of Brock like that.

164
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,681
Brock has ten little brothers and sisters
to take care of

165
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,018
so he could never leave town
for regional championships.

166
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,479
Doesn't he have a mom or a dad?

167
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,191
His good-for-nothing father left
the family to become a Pokémon trainer

168
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,443
and they never heard from him again.

169
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,446
Brock's heartbroken mother tried her best
to hold things together

170
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,531
but sadly, she passed away.

171
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,785
Brock's the only one
his little brothers and sisters have left.

172
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,412
I better not listen to any more sad stuff.

173
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,791
Next time I have a match with Brock,
I might not have the heart to beat him!

174
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,376
But... But you said that...

175
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,171
You said you could never win
a match with Brock!

176
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,381
Yeah, well, I changed my mind about that!

177
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,842
If I can power up Pikachu, I'll beat him!

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,305
Hmm, I may just know a way
you can supercharge Pikachu.

179
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,265
Hey, you do?

180
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,394
-[Ash] What is this place?
-[Flint] A hydroelectric plant.

181
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,814
The river turns the wheel
and makes electricity

182
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,482
and if you can hook Pikachu up to it,

183
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,609
you might be able to give it
a power boost.

184
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,362
Thanks, Mr. Flint.
That's a great idea!

185
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,782
Gee, how do you know
so much about Pokémon, huh?

186
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,700
Me? Uh, you see, I, uh...

187
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,079
Well, I just got lucky, I guess.
That's it, lucky.

188
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,082
Well, Pikachu, get ready to power up!

189
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,667
Pikachu!

190
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,336
Of course
right now the river is dry.

191
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,713
[Ash] Ah!

192
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,633
Then what did we come here for?

193
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,844
I have another idea.

194
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,185
-Pikachu is all hooked up.
-Okay.

195
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,273
[Ash grunts]

196
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,440
[Ash] Ah!

197
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,569
All right!

198
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,872
Pi...

199
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,958
Take it easy, Pikachu.

200
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,961
All this power may be shocking at first,
but sooner or later,

201
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,838
your body will get used
to the high voltage!

202
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,801
[screeches]

203
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,476
Hey, Ash. Wouldn't it be a lot better
to just ask me for help

204
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,188
instead of going
with this crazy power plan of yours?

205
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,733
Forget it!
I'll win without your help.

206
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,151
Huh?

207
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,446
Huh! What do I care?

208
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,451
I'm going to get a badge all by myself
using the Pokémon I'm training!

209
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:46,539
Stubborn. It'd be a lot easier
if he used some of mine too.

210
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,713
If I can take this, you can take it,
Pikachu!

211
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,971
[screeches]

212
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,183
Hang in there, Pikachu.

213
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
[screeches]

214
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,188
Huh?

215
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,652
Pi!

216
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,705
I'm back!

217
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,126
[Brock] Haven't you learned
your lesson yet?

218
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,963
Ah! We're ready for you this time, Brock!

219
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,049
Heh, we'll see.

220
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,511
-[Pikachu] Pi!
-[Brock] Two Poké Balls.

221
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,513
[Ash] Got it!

222
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,226
I'll start with... Geodude, go!

223
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,186
Geodude.

224
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,901
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

225
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,905
[squawks]

226
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,199
Go, pidgeotto! Gust Attack!

227
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,293
-Huh?
-Bad strategy.

228
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:18,047
Don't you know flying Pokémon
are weak against Rock Types?

229
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,258
Oh, guess I forgot.

230
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,385
Come on, Ash.
Use your head.

231
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,764
Pidgeotto, return!

232
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,186
-Are you giving up again, Ash?
-No way.

233
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,064
-Pikachu, I choose you!
-Chu!

234
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,359
The Pikachu again.

235
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,822
I feel sorry for it, being raised
by such a weak Pokémon trainer.

236
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,534
Pikachu, now's our chance
to show him how weak we are!

237
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,121
Pikachu!

238
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,543
[sighs]

239
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,004
Pikachu, nice going.

240
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,466
Return, Geodude.

241
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:08,181
It looks like you've trained it better.
But still, it's no match for Onix!

242
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,974
Go!

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,147
[growls]

244
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,858
Pika!

245
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,945
[Pikachu grunting and Onix roaring]

246
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,200
Hey, Pikachu,
watch where you're aiming, huh?

247
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:33,414
-Chu!
-Oh, Pikachu, give it a Thunderbolt!

248
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,628
[roaring]

249
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,922
Hang in there, Pikachu!
It's working!

250
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,633
Onix, bind it!

251
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,801
[all gasp]

252
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,762
[Onix groaning]

253
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,516
-Chu!
-Pikachu.

254
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,601
[growls]

255
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,062
[groaning]

256
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,944
-[Brock] Onix, stop!
-Huh?

257
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,786
No, Brock,
I want to play this match to the end.

258
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,871
There's no point in going on.

259
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,249
I really don't want to hurt
your Pokémon.

260
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,210
[groans and sighs]

261
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,591
[growling]

262
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,095
-[Misty] Ash!
-Ah. Huh?

263
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,848
Rock Pokémon
are weakened by water!

264
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,102
-Pikachu!
-Chu!

265
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:43,526
[roaring]

266
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,988
Onix!

267
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,241
[groans]

268
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,829
Pikachu, finish it off!

269
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,795
My conscience is holding me back.
I can't bring myself to beat Brock.

270
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,256
I'm imagining his little
brothers and sisters

271
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,342
stopping me from beating
the one person they love.

272
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,554
Ash, I think you'd better
open your eyes.

273
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,890
-Huh?
-You leave Onix alone!

274
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,350
Our brother worked hard to raise him,
you big bully.

275
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,228
Believe me, kid, I'm no bully.

276
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,564
Stop it.
Get off, all of you!

277
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,984
This is an official match and we're
going to finish it no matter what!

278
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,238
But, Brock, we know that you love
your Pokémon so much.

279
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,700
That's why we can't watch Onix
suffer from another attack!

280
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,076
[Brock] Onix, stop!

281
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,838
-Pikachu, return!
-Chu?

282
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,842
What do you think you're doing?
This match isn't over yet, Ash.

283
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,095
Those sprinklers going off
was just an accident.

284
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,848
Winning the match because of that
wouldn't have proved anything.

285
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,644
Next time we meet, I'll beat you
my way, fair and square.

286
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,897
Maybe.

287
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,066
[sighs]

288
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,485
Just when he finally
gets a lucky break,

289
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,446
he decides to be
a nice guy too.

290
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,784
I'm sorry if I was too tough on you,
Pikachu.

291
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,786
But you really did a great job.

292
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,704
Pikachu.

293
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,165
Sounds like you feel
just the way I do.

294
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,168
Hey, hey, wait up! Ash!

295
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,837
Huh? Brock?

296
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,381
[panting]

297
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,676
Ash, you forgot this.

298
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,638
A badge
for defeating a Gym Trainer.

299
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,393
I can't accept that.
I didn't beat you.

300
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,562
-I gave up.
-Nah.

301
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,105
I lost to you.

302
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,275
You beat me in battle
and in being kind to all Pokémon.

303
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,484
But...

304
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,196
To tell you the truth,
I get more pleasure from raising Pokémon

305
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,823
than from making them battle.

306
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,742
I don't care about being
a great Pokémon trainer.

307
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,203
I want to become
the world's best breeder

308
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,499
but I can't leave here because I have
to look after my brothers and sisters.

309
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,670
Ash, I want you to take this
and fulfill my dream.

310
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,339
-Will you do that for me?
-I will.

311
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,467
And I'll do my best to deserve this too!

312
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,972
Brock, you go follow your own dreams.

313
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,223
[Ash] Flint!

314
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,062
-My father.
-Huh?

315
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,899
You mean you're the good-for-nothing
father who left home and never came back?

316
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,193
That's right. It was me.

317
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,238
I couldn't become the great
Pokémon trainer I wanted to

318
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,032
and because I was such a failure,

319
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,119
I was too embarrassed
and ashamed to go back to my family.

320
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,913
But why did you help me
instead of Brock?

321
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,957
You reminded me of myself.

322
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,585
-You didn't seem to have a chance.
-Oh!

323
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,421
Its time I started
taking care of my family.

324
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,049
You go fulfill your dreams and mine.

325
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,510
First, there are some things
I have to tell you.

326
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,555
After all these years,
I understand how you must feel about me

327
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,224
so I want you to get everything
off your chest. Here.

328
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,768
Uh...

329
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,854
Suzy always rips her dresses
so you better learn how to sew.

330
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,648
And Timmy only eats
cold spaghetti for breakfast.

331
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,857
Tommy likes corn flakes for dinner--

332
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,360
Slow down, slow down.
I can't write that fast!

333
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,570
Cindy sleepwalks
so you have to tie a bell on her wrist.

334
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,156
The twins never want to take a bath
so you have to...

335
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,619
Hey, Ash, are you sure it's okay
if I go with you on your Pokémon journey?

336
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,329
[Ash] Sure I'm sure.

337
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,083
The more the merrier and it's good to have
somebody to talk with.

338
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,545
Well, what about that girl
who keeps following you?

339
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,256
Don't forget about my bike,
Ash Ketchum!

340
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,509
I'm going to follow you
till you pay me back!

341
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,969
I know, I know!

342
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,888
-Pikachu, let's try to lose her.
-Chu!

343
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,474
-Wait up, Ash!
-You won't get away!

344
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,186
[narrator] <i>And so with a new friend</i>
<i>and ally and Misty close behind</i>

345
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,815
