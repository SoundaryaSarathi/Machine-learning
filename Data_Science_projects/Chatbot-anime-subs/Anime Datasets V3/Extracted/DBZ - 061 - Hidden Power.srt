00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:22,814
Hang in there, Gohan!
Grand Elder-<i>san</i>'s place is just ahead!

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,906
Right!

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>l might have said that once we have the</i>
<i>Grand Elder draw out Gohan's dormant power,</i>

4
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:34,751
<i>he would rival Vegeta, but to be honest,</i>
<i>l doubt we can expect that much.</i>

5
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:46,194
<i>That bastard really does have a gift.</i>
<i>There's no end to how strong he's becoming.</i>

6
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>After having Gohan made stronger,</i>
<i>all we can do is wait for Goku to get here,</i>

7
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,270
<i>and then have all</i>
<i>three of us fight together.</i>

8
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,292
9999...

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,234
10,000...

10
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:36,488
Amazing! I'm hardly tired at all!
I've surprised myself!

11
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:40,425
Now then, all right,
that's all for my training.

12
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,828
With the time that's left, I'll rest up.

13
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,763
I have to get used to
regular gravity again, too.

14
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,490
I did it! What agility!

15
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,450
I'm so surprised! I'm so light,
it feels like I ain't even here!

16
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,499
Whoo! Light! Light!

17
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,366
So light, so light, so light, I say!

18
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,260
And strong, and strong!

19
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:10,874
After building myself up this much, I'm sure
I'll be able to withstand a 10X <i>Kaio-ken</i>!

20
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,383
" Shampoo"

21
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:28,066
I'm almost to Planet Namek, huh?
All right, let's do this! Let's do this!

22
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,262
Whew, that was refreshing.

23
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,475
Now, all that's left is to sleep tight.

24
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:39,841
But let's take a moment
before doing that.

25
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,410
Let's see... here it is.

26
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:48,486
Huh? My mistake.
This stuff is bitter, after all.

27
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:51,756
Let's see... here it is,
here it is, this, this!

28
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:55,590
Bulma's daddy's specially-made sports drink!

29
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:07,772
<i>Goku had not realized</i>
<i>that at some point along the way,</i>

30
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:14,405
<i>he had obtained a level of power</i>
<i>that went beyond Saiyan limits.</i>

31
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,386
<i>Almost there. Almost there,</i>
<i>you dirty punks!</i>

32
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:43,141
Gohan, it's coming into view!

33
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,633
You see that tall mountain
there? That's where he is.

34
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,312
All right, we're in the home stretch!

35
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,082
G- Gohan, there's a <i>Ki</i>!
There's a <i>Ki</i> coming from behind us!

36
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,103
I- it can't be!

37
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,503
I- it couldn't be... Vegeta!

38
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,815
Gohan, I'll use all of my
strength to stop him here.

39
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:25,783
You go on to Grand Elder-<i>san</i>'s place!

40
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,451
But...

41
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,284
Hurry up! Go get yourself made stronger!

42
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,776
Okay?

43
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,779
Right!

44
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,797
All right...

45
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,424
In any case, I have to try.

46
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,488
<i>What speed!</i>

47
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:12,430
Yo.

48
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,100
I- I'm impressed that you discovered us.

49
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,104
Of course I did. I'm in a completely
different league than you are.

50
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:26,444
Now, why don't you return to me the Dragon
Ball with the four stars that I had hidden?

51
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,446
You've made a mockery of me!

52
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:31,040
W- what in the world
are you talking about?

53
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:35,549
Don't play dumb. I'll make
you talk soon enough.

54
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:49,057
This is incredible!

55
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:57,668
What's that?

56
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,750
That mountain where
Kakarrot's son fled to...

57
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,377
There's something else there.

58
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:11,422
That's where you've
hidden the ball, is it?

59
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,582
It is not!

60
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,283
Wait!

61
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,434
You have a tremendous amount
of dormant power, don't you?

62
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,770
Are you not an Earthling?

63
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,762
Excuse me, but could
I ask you to hurry?

64
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,432
They are here.

65
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:40,910
What is this place?

66
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,789
Wait, Vegeta!

67
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:45,778
Please wait!

68
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,496
Leave here.

69
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,529
Looks like you want to die.

70
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:31,102
<i>H</i>- <i>he did it!</i>
<i>Gohan's Ki has risen!</i>

71
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:35,440
So that's it.
Kakarrot is here, is he?

72
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,776
All right, today's the day
when we settle things!

73
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:41,404
Come on out, Kakarrot!

74
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:50,716
What!?

75
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:13,945
I- it's you!?
What did you do in there!?

76
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:17,278
Why has your base power
risen so sharply!?

77
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:46,144
It's true,

78
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:50,181
your battle power seems to have risen to
a level incomparable to what it was before.

79
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:51,409
Even so...

80
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:57,181
...are you telling me you want to
exchange blows with me at your level?

81
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:03,920
Very well.

82
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,939
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>!

83
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:19,811
D- Dende...

84
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,039
Y- yes?

85
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:30,822
Go tell everyone at once... There is a large,
mysterious power approaching Namek.

86
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,156
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>!

87
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,825
Quickly!

88
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,087
R- right!

89
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:50,842
L- listen, Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> says that
there is something approaching this world!

90
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:52,176
--Huh?
--What!?

91
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,512
Grand Elder? Who's that?

92
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:57,181
I- it's true! There really is
something up there!

93
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:59,784
I- it's an incredible power!

94
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,788
I- it's Goku!
Goku has finally gotten here!

95
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,948
What?

96
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,797
I'm not so sure. It doesn't
feel like there's just one...

97
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,662
I- it couldn't be!

98
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:30,815
1... 2... 3... 4... 5...
No doubt about it!

99
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,152
Freeza has called in
the Ginyu Special Corps!

100
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,881
Damn it all!

101
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,159
You guys, hand over your
Dragon Ball to me, now!

102
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,496
N- no way! We won't do that!

103
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,100
I promise you, once I gain
the power of immortality,

104
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,835
in no way will I
do anything to you!

105
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,505
Hurry, or there will be
no undoing what will happen!

106
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,769
Y- you think you can fool us!?

107
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,471
If we do that, we'll be
playing right into your hands!

108
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:06,784
Listen to me closely,
you dirty bastards!

109
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:10,121
This Ginyu Special Corps that
Freeza has called in has five men,

110
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:15,787
each of which is as strong as me-
no, probably even stronger!

111
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,096
They're going to use the
latest Scouters to find me,

112
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,465
as well as you guys,
and then come kill us at once!

113
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:23,467
T- that can't be true!

114
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:27,805
Can't you sense their power!?
There's only one path we can take!

115
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:32,476
The only route we have is to make
me immortal, and have me defeat them!

116
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:35,813
What he's saying might be true.

117
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:39,909
There are indeed five great
evil powers out there.

118
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:53,831
Well, let's make Gohan immortal!

119
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:58,200
He might have the power, but he's
utterly lacking in tactical experience!

120
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:05,443
B- but then... if that's the case...
why the hell did we even come here!?

121
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:08,901
The Dragon Balls can
grant you three wishes.

122
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,121
You guys will be sure
to have your wish granted.

123
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:20,249
Three? Not just one?

124
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,054
T- three?

125
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,492
Y- you guys!

126
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,470
Why do you keep repeating it!?
Snap to it!

127
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,805
Who knows if there's
going to be enough time!?

128
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:40,607
L- listen, we really... we really
can have three wishes granted, right?

129
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:46,882
Come with me!

130
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,619
But we're going to make sure
you keep your promise, you got that!?

131
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,927
Wait for me!

132
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:02,433
Damn it!

133
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,628
Fly as fast as you can!

134
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,114
It looks like they've left, huh?

135
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:23,120
Yes. But even if it works out, their
chances of winning are extremely low.

136
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,455
Nail-<i>san</i>...

137
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:25,979
Nail...

138
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:32,463
You go on as well. You want
to help out some, don't you?

139
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,464
But...

140
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:36,133
If it's about me,
I'll be all right.

141
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,591
My life should still
hold out for a little while.

142
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,608
Understood.

143
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:37,659
So, you have arrived at last, Ginyu
Special Corps. I have been waiting for you.

144
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,700
Aren't we there yet!?
They've already landed!

145
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:47,661
<i>Just a little farther.</i>

146
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,580
Why does this have to happen to me?

147
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,428
W- what in the world was that!?

148
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,429
Huh?

149
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,865
Bulma-<i>san</i>, I'm taking
the Dragon Ball with me.

150
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,129
All right, hurry! This way now!

151
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,928
H- hey, what exactly is going on!?

152
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,442
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

153
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,446
Hold on! Explain what's
happening before you go!

154
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,450
Do you know the kind of trouble
I've had to go through!?

155
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,042
For crying out loud!

156
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,388
Really, when it comes to
those guys, I've just about-

157
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,720
Huh? Wasn't that Vegeta
with them just now?

158
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,776
ReaCoom!

159
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,158
Butta!

160
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:12,306
Jheese!

161
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,093
Ghurd!

162
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,542
Ginyu!

163
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,777
To-geth-er we are...

164
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,682
The Ginyu Special Corps!

165
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:07,293
I- I have been expecting you.

166
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:16,146
<i>The tense situation was</i>
<i>starting to change rapidly.</i>

167
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:20,981
<i>Who exactly are the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>
<i>whom even Vegeta is afraid of?</i>

168
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,258
<i>To whom will go the Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>along with their wishes?</i>
