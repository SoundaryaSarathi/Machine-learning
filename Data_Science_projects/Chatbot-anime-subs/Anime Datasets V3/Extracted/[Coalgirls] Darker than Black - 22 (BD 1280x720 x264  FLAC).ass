Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.14,0:07:47.33,DTB-Default,Schroeder,0,0,0,,although it failed in South America.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.08,0:07:54.48,DTB-Default,Schroeder,0,0,0,,Well, we weren't the ones who made it disappear.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.48,0:07:56.84,DTB-Default,Schroeder,0,0,0,,Technically speaking, it didn't really disappear, either.
