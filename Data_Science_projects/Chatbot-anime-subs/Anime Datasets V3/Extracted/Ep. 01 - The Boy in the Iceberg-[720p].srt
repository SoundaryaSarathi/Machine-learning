<i>Water.</i>

<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,692
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,652
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,942
<i>My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.</i>

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,568
<i>A time of peace.</i>

7
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:21,417
<i>When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom,...</i>

8
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:24,165
<i>...Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.</i>

9
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:28,281
<i>But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,464
<i>Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.</i>

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,753
<i>Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.</i>

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,563
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

13
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:49,367
<i>A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.</i>

14
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,841
<i>Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe...</i>

15
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:55,206
<i>...journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.</i>

16
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:59,149
<i>Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.</i>

17
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,270
<i>Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.</i>

18
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:07,349
<i>And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.</i>

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:13,179
<i>I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter One: The Boy in The Iceberg

21
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,451
It's not getting away from me this time.

22
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:03,871
Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.

23
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,762
Sokka, look!

24
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:18,347
Shhh~ Katara, you're gonna scare it away.

25
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,979
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!

26
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,149
But Sokka! I caught one!

27
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:26,498
Hey!

28
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,548
Ugh!

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,609
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?

30
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,265
Ah~ It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's...

31
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:41,560
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...

32
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:45,439
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.

33
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:47,215
You're calling me weird?

34
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,523
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself...

35
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:53,612
...everytime I see my reflection in the water.

36
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,149
Watch out!

37
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,016
Go left! Go left!

38
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,954
You call that left?

39
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,050
You don't like my steering.

40
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:30,662
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.

41
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:31,847
So it's my fault?

42
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,742
I knew I should have left you home.

43
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,422
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.

44
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:42,497
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...

45
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:46,487
...ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!

46
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:50,464
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp...

47
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,243
...while you've been off playing soldier!

48
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,235
Uh... Katara?

49
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,835
I even wash all the clothes!

50
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:01,918
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!!

51
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,897
Katara! Settle down!

52
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,985
No, that's it. I'm done helping you.

53
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:11,493
From now on, you're on your own!

54
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,810
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.

55
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,800
You mean I did that?

56
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,996
Yup. Congratulations.

57
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,454
He's alive! We have to help.

58
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:10,480
Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!

59
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,883
Finally. Uncle, do you realize what this means?

60
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,176
I won't get to finish my game?

61
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:53,766
It means my search. It's about to come to an end.

62
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:59,023
That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!

63
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:05,704
Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.

64
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:10,001
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.

65
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:16,555
Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?

66
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:20,631
I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar.

67
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:24,731
Helmsman, head a course for the light!

68
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,228
Stop!

69
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,740
Stop it!

70
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,441
I need to ask you something.

71
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,685
What?

72
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,821
Please... come closer.

73
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,263
What is it?

74
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,865
Will you go penguin sledding with me?

75
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:27,228
Uh... sure. I guess.

76
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,048
What's going on here?

77
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,242
You tell us!

78
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:33,476
How'd you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?

79
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:36,815
I'm not sure.

80
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:47,823
Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.

81
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,988
Haha! You're okay!

82
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:06,262
What is that thing?

83
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:07,956
This is Appa, my flying bison.

84
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,137
Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.

85
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:26,223
Don't worry. It'll wash out.

86
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,256
So, do you guys live around here?

87
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,548
Don't answer that!

88
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,230
Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.

89
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:36,950
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.

90
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,139
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.

91
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:45,874
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.

92
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,256
I'm A...

93
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,873
I'm Aang.

94
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,797
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.

95
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,583
Really? It felt higher that that.

96
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:10,769
Ah, you're an airbender!

97
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,760
Sure am.

98
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:14,529
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...

99
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,907
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.

100
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,801
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.

101
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,896
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.

102
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,640
We'd love a ride! Thanks!

103
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:35,139
Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.

104
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:39,491
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?

105
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:43,850
You know... before you freeze to death?

106
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,154
Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight!

107
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,546
Appa, yip yip!

108
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,617
Come on, Appa. Yip yip.

109
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:06,624
Wow. That was truly amazing.

110
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:12,565
Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.

111
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,826
Why are you smiling at me like that?

112
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,790
Oh... I was smiling?

113
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,911
I'm going to bed now.

114
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:44,257
Yep. A man needs his rest.

115
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:48,039
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

116
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:53,992
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.

117
00:10:53,968 --> 00:11:00,872
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

118
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:05,605
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does.

119
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:09,727
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.

120
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,109
Hey.

121
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,268
Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?

122
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,246
I guess I was wondering...

123
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:30,781
...your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.

124
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:37,691
Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.

125
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,469
Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.

126
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,052
Sleep tight.

127
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:29,768
Aang! Aang, wake up!

128
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:36,352
It's okay. We're in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you.

129
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:56,566
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

130
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,361
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?

131
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:03,625
Did Appa sneeze on me?

132
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,070
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.

133
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:12,071
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.

134
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,077
Extinct'?

135
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,176
Aang, this is my grandmother.

136
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,957
Call me Gran Gran.

137
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:21,621
What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.

138
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:26,186
It's not for stabbing. It's for airbending.

139
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,667
Magic trick! Do it again!

140
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:34,347
Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.

141
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:38,088
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.

142
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:41,069
Check again!

143
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:45,232
Whoa... it's flying...

144
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,072
...it's amazing!

145
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:05,153
Oh, my watchtower!

146
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:10,231
That was amazing.

147
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,927
Great. You're an airbender,...

148
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:20,138
...Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.

149
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:21,695
You're a waterbender!

150
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,979
Well... sort of. Not yet.

151
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,814
All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.

152
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:33,672
I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.

153
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:37,218
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.

154
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:40,134
But he's special. I can tell.

155
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:43,206
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.

156
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:48,038
Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.

157
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:56,378
Again.

158
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:07,233
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles.

159
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:10,721
The breath becomes energy in the body.

160
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:16,453
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.

161
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,606
Get it right this time.

162
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:20,656
Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day.

163
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,254
Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.

164
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:28,184
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.

165
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,887
Drill it again!

166
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,368
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.

167
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,081
He must be over a hundred years old by now.

168
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,459
He's had a century to master the four elements.

169
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:45,808
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.

170
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:50,347
You will teach me the advanced set!

171
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:56,729
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.

172
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:03,763
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.

173
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:07,086
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.

174
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:12,022
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?

175
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,911
I gotta pee!

176
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,500
Listen! Until your fathers return from the war,...

177
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,937
...they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.

178
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,481
And that means no potty breaks.

179
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,081
But I really gotta go.

180
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:29,113
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?

181
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:36,876
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.

182
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,153
Wow! Everything freezes in there!

183
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:46,324
Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

184
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:53,643
Stop! Stop it right now!

185
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:58,099
What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.

186
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,866
What war? What are you talking about?

187
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,968
You're kidding, right?

188
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,357
Penguin!

189
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:14,452
He's kidding, right?

190
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,302
Aang?

191
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,550
Hey, come on little guy.

192
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,335
Wanna go sledding?

193
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:31,634
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.

194
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:39,620
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.

195
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:45,623
You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.

196
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,376
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?

197
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:52,901
No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.

198
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:57,535
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.

199
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:01,497
What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right?

200
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:03,845
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.

201
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:08,600
Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.

202
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:13,133
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.

203
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,750
But you forget, I have a flying bison.

204
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,216
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.

205
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,366
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!

206
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,921
That's... I mean, I don't know.

207
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,568
I've never left home before.

208
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,400
Well, you think about it.

209
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:32,410
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?

210
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,618
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.

211
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:42,084
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.

212
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,446
I haven't done this since I was a kid!

213
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:13,317
You still are a kid!

214
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,641
Whoa... what is that?

215
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:43,534
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.

216
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:50,111
Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.

217
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:55,228
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.

218
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:43,396
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.

219
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,792
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.

220
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,481
Okay, back up.

221
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:53,240
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.

222
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:56,515
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?

223
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,942
I don't know... a few days, maybe?

224
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,427
I think it was more like a hundred years!

225
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:06,929
What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?

226
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:12,031
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because...

227
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:19,029
...somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.

228
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,898
A hundred years! I can't believe it.

229
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:28,041
I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.

230
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,139
I did get to meet you.

231
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:34,803
Come on. Let's get out of here.

232
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:44,139
Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.

233
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:50,358
What's that you said about booby traps?

234
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:05,696
Hold on tight!

235
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:21,222
The last airbender. Quite agile for his old age.

236
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,692
Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar...

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,467
...as well as his hiding place.
