1
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,771
Something seems off.

2
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:08,671
It just somehow
felt that way.

3
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:10,141
What an incredible spirit,

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:10,681
What an incredible spirit,
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural game playing on the TV,

5
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,011
he's able to keep going
despite giving up seven runs.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural game playing on the TV,

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,221
The second pitch is...
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural game playing on the TV,

7
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,321
but I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

8
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,821
And it's up... it's a left fly ball.
One out.
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

9
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,991
And it's up... it's a left fly ball.
One out.
Once I did, I kind of
got the feeling

10
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:20,521
Once I did, I kind of
got the feeling

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:20,791
The gap between
the scores is big,
Once I did, I kind of
got the feeling

12
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,461
The gap between
the scores is big,
that Haruhi was going
to start something.

13
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,461
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
That Haruhi was going
to start something.

14
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:24,861
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

15
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:26,521
but Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

16
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:27,991
The passionate voices cheering

17
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:28,531
The passionate voices cheering
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

18
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,531
From the third base bleachers
haven't died down.
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

19
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,931
From the third base bleachers
haven't died down.
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

20
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,461
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

21
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,501
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

22
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,441
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
You're not doing
anything today, right?

23
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,041
That's true.
You're not doing
anything today, right?

24
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,041
That's true.
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

25
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,301
After all, you never know how
a match is going to turn out.
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

26
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,841
After all, you never know how
a match is going to turn out.
Be sure to show up.

27
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,271
After all, you never know how
a match is going to turn out.

28
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:40,711
They still have hope.

29
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,211
They still have hope.
I didn't even say anything...

30
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,041
I didn't even say anything...

31
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,611
Next, stepping up
to the batter's box

32
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,751
Next, stepping up
to the batter's box
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

33
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:45,811
We have number four,
Kashima, a senior.
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

34
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:47,011
We have number four,
Kashima, a senior.
I know.

35
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,811
We have number four,
Kashima, a senior.

36
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,581
We have number four,
Kashima, a senior.
What?

37
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,481
After last year's
summer tournament,
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit, and plenty of money.

38
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,351
He was chosen to be part of the team
that went to Cuba.
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit, and plenty of money.

39
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,051
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

40
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:56,361
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

41
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,161
What?

42
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:57,821
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
What?

43
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:59,881
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

44
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,431
That was a good pitch.

45
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,731
That was a good pitch.
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

46
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:03,631
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

47
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,931
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

48
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,471
Perhaps he feels like he's got
nothing left to lose.
No, not quite.

49
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:06,931
Perhaps he feels like he's got
nothing left to lose.

50
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,831
Perhaps he feels like he's got
nothing left to lose.
To be precise,

51
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,741
Perhaps he feels like he's got
nothing left to lose.
It felt like this exact same conversation
had happened before.

52
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,471
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
it felt like this exact same conversation
had happened before.

53
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:10,941
It felt like this exact same conversation
had happened before.

54
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,001
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

55
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,231
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

56
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,881
And it's good!

57
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,471
It's a solo home run!

58
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,871
And with this, Jyonan's
gotten their eighth run!

59
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,931
You're late, Kyon!

60
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,631
Show some more motivation!

61
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,971
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,441
Sorry I made you wait.

63
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,541
I just got here, too.

64
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,571
Okay, we're all here,
so let's go.

65
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,441
Where are we going?

66
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,741
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

67
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,811
Well, I guess that makes sense.

68
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:58,351
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

69
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,721
We can never get back the time
that we've lost!

70
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,221
And so we're going to do
them now, during this,

71
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,711
our one and only summer
as tenth graders!

72
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,361
By the way, we're going
to the pool by bike.

73
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,501
Did you ride
your bikes too?

74
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,331
No, the only two bikes we have
are yours and mine.

75
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,671
Okay, are you ready?

76
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:20,811
Of course not!

77
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,441
I am!

78
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,141
Kyon, you'd better not lose
to Koizumi.

79
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,811
This train is leaving
the station!

80
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,651
Dammit!

Kyon, we're about to go have fun.
This is no time to be exhausted.

102
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:10,681
You're such a slacker.

103
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,671
Whose fault do you
think this is?

104
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:19,751
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

105
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,131
Come on, time to go swimming!
Let's race!

106
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:29,471
No diving
It's dangerous

107
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,171
No diving
It's dangerous
Can't you read this sign?

108
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:31,601
Can't you read this sign?

109
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:35,701
Hurry up and get in!
The water's warm so it feels fine!

110
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,411
That looks like fun.

111
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,071
This makes me smile, though.

112
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,321
Miss Suzumiya has some
rather normal ways

113
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,981
of enjoying her time,
don't you think?

114
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,881
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

115
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,261
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

116
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,721
I hope that's the case...

117
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,071
What's wrong?

118
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:04,231
Koizumi!

119
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,311
It's nothing...

120
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,141
It's probably
just my imagination.

121
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,431
Because so much has happened
since the beginning of spring,

122
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,471
I've become
a little paranoid.

123
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:16,171
Come on, let's go swim.

124
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,181
Hey!

125
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,821
Hey now!

126
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,011
Take that!

127
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,751
Get back here!

128
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:39,401
I think it'd be better to call this a
communal pool than a public pool.

129
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:46,741
This feeling...

130
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:52,041
It feels like I've seen
this scene once before.

131
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:57,091
Where Nagato kind of looks like
she's bored... and then...

132
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,291
Kyon!

133
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,991
Right, and then Haruhi shows up
and says this...

134
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,031
These two are my
brigade members.

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,761
They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!

136
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,371
Okay, let's have some fun!
We're going to play water soccer.

137
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,441
Come on!

138
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,011
Well, deja vu isn't
all that uncommon.

139
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,781
Here I go, Mikuru!

140
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,041
Okay!

141
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,071
I'm sorry!

142
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:24,481
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival,
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...

143
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,851
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival,
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...
What is this?

144
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,191
What is this?

145
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:29,461
I thought about what we'll
be doing from here on.

146
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,061
It's a schedule of
how we'll spend

147
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,361
the rest of our short
summer vacation.

148
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:37,061
We only have two weeks of
summer vacation left.

149
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,271
And yet it feels like there are
a lot of things we've yet to do.

150
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,741
But we've only got this
much time left.

151
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,471
That's why we're going
to pick up the pace!

152
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,441
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

153
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,351
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

154
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:56,581
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

155
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,511
Pardon me
for a moment.

156
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,191
Thank you.

157
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,791
Is there a place nearby
having a Bon festival?

158
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,061
A fireworks show
would work, too.

159
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,791
I'll check around.

160
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,231
Don't forget about the
goldfish scooping!

161
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,671
It's Mikuru's sole request,
after all.

162
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,141
Roger that.

163
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,341
Okay, Kyon.
We're starting tomorrow!

164
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,641
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

165
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,741
The next morning, it was Haruhi
that awoke me from my slumber.

166
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,421
They found a place that was
holding a Bon festival.

167
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,221
It seems to be happening
tonight at a public park.

168
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:44,061
Both Mikuru and Yuki said that
they don't own a yukata.

169
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,271
So we're going to go buy
some to wear tonight.

170
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,501
I don't own one either,

171
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,241
and there's a place selling them
in sets for cheap!

172
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,801
You're coming too!

173
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,941
Haruhi entered a women's
clothing outlet store.

174
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,651
She just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

175
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,551
and then headed straight
for the changing rooms.

176
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,521
After making us wait about
an hour or so...

177
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,851
(That'd make anyone yawn.)

178
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:08,441
The three of them finally
came out at once.

179
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,051
Excellent!

180
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:14,031
You all look wonderful.

181
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,931
Of course! I chose
these yukata, after all.

182
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,591
Especially Mikuru!

183
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:23,101
It's so cute on you! Just what you
would expect from my choice!

184
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,601
Yes...

185
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:26,941
Miss Asahina... it's so good,
Miss Asahina!

186
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:35,741
I guess it makes sense for there
to be this many people.

187
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,291
Hmm? There it is again...

188
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,481
This feeling...

189
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,291
It's been a while since I've
come to a Bon festival,

190
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,381
but it feels like I went
to one recently.

191
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,461
That tower,

192
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,931
those vendors...

193
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:50,831
This is...

194
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,131
Mikuru!

195
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:56,201
They have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

196
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,571
This way!

197
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,841
Okay!

198
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,931
Shall we play, too?

199
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:04,171
I'll pass.

200
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,051
You're interested
in that stuff?

201
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:22,931
Which one?
I'll buy it...

202
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:23,761
It's all right.

203
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,121
- This one.
- Right-o.

204
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,941
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

205
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,461
so I thought buying it for her
would be appropriate, but...

206
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,581
Wow, what a haul!

207
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:40,981
Thirteen!

208
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,511
But I don't need so many, so I
just kept one for each of us.

209
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:47,951
Huh?

210
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,861
What's with
the mask, Yuki?

211
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:51,851
I bought it.

212
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:53,851
I see.

213
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,261
I need to use your back
for a second.

214
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,001
What?

215
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,491
Just turn around!

216
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:01,991
Hey.

217
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,671
Now then, next up is fireworks!

218
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,831
Let's launch some fireworks
to end the day!

219
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,501
Don't you understand the meaning
of the word "moderation"?

220
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:17,341
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

221
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,951
That's why I wanted
to forget about it,

222
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,511
but there was one thing
lingering in my mind.

223
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,331
Okay, everyone, tomorrow
we'll be catching bugs!

224
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,131
This will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

225
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,671
Whoever catches
the most bugs

226
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,901
will get to be the brigade leader
for one day!

227
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,111
Haruhi, it's fine to
want to play around,

228
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,871
but are you finished with
your summer homework?

229
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,881
What are you talking about?

230
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:49,751
You can finish homework like that
in just three days.

231
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,281
Take care of all of that
bothersome stuff

232
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:56,221
so you can have fun without
having to worry about it.

233
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:59,091
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation!

234
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,061
Why is she so smart?

235
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:08,291
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

236
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,371
It was on this day

237
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:13,111
that we had the SOS Brigade
Cicada Capturing Competition.

238
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,841
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

239
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,001
but of course, or something
to that effect,

240
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,401
the winner ended up
being Haruhi.

241
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,451
The next day,
we met up,

242
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,751
even though we had no idea
what was going on.

243
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,351
And we continued to have no idea
what was going on,

244
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,391
even as we were made to
wear frog costumes,

245
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:34,521
and pass out balloons in front of a
supermarket as our part-time job.

246
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,531
Are you all right?

247
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,801
I thought I was going to die.
Actually, I am going to die.

248
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,041
Thanks for the hard work,
especially in this heat.

249
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,711
The manager is thankful.

250
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,611
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

251
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,011
This is it.

252
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,611
I've wanted this
for a while.

253
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:57,011
The owner said that he'd give it to us
for Mikuru's sake.

254
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,881
We worked for that?

255
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:05,421
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

256
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:06,621
Ribbit.

257
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:19,971
That night, a single phone call
stole me away from my slumber.

258
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,741
Dammit.

259
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,541
Yes?

260
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,671
Whoa!

261
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,251
Kyon...

262
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,221
Is that you,
Miss Asahina?

263
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,421
Yes, it's me...

264
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,691
Something... very not good has...

265
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,261
At this rate, I...

266
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:46,601
Umm...

267
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,201
Umm...
Hello, this is Koizumi.

268
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,031
Hello, this is Koizumi.

269
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:51,241
Why are you
with Miss Asahina?!

270
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,311
Certain circumstances
came up.

271
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,441
Would it be possible for you
to come join us right now?

272
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,471
Of course!
I'll be right there!

273
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:19,761
What in the world happened,
Miss Asahina?

274
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:25,101
Kyon... I can't return
to the future!

275
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,341
Can't return?

276
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,681
Err... What do you mean,
can't return?

277
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,271
In other words,
this is what's going on.

278
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:39,141
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

279
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,191
What?

280
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:44,591
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

281
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,861
We are going through
an eternal loop...

282
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,331
Koizumi, do you realize
what you're saying?

283
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,301
I do. Much more than
I wish I did.

284
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,801
I had just been speaking
with Miss Asahina.

285
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,771
Call me too.

286
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,671
And as a result, what we realized
was that recently,

287
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,941
the flow of time
was a bit strange.

288
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,111
You might want to credit this
to Miss Asahina.

289
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,851
Thanks to her, I was
able to confirm it.

290
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:10,951
Confirm what?

291
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:17,991
That we have experienced the same
span of time numerous times.

292
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,631
You said that earlier.

293
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,291
To be precise, we've been
repeating the time

294
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,231
from August 17th
to the 31 st.

295
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:28,831
We're in the middle of an
endless summer vacation.

296
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,601
Well, we're certainly
in the middle.

297
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,811
It's a never-ending
endless summer.

298
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:40,481
This world has lost all time
after September 1 st.

299
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:44,011
That is why Miss Asahina
cannot return to the future.

300
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:46,521
I suppose you could say
that it's natural

301
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,421
that she can't return to a
future that doesn't exist.

302
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,831
Cut it out. What's natural about
something as stupid as that?

303
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:54,821
Who'd believe it?

304
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:59,231
We'd like for you
to believe it.

305
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:04,871
Umm... I'll explain, too.

306
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:10,011
Well... because of
"classified information",

307
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:15,281
I'm always contacting the future
and "classified information"-ing,

308
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,951
but I hadn't received
any "classified information"

309
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,721
for about a week or so,
and I thought, "that's strange."

310
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,861
And so I
"classified information"...

311
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,531
I was so surprised, I tried to "classified",

312
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,031
I was so surprised, I tried to "classified",
Miss Asahina, are your "classified"s

313
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,471
but it was completely "classified"...
Miss Asahina, are your "classified"s

314
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,331
but it was completely "classified"...
things that can't be said on TV?

315
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,861
Things that can't be said on TV?

316
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:45,011
Are we trapped inside one of
those closed spaces?

317
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,811
That's not it.

318
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,711
A single portion of time
has been torn away.

319
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:54,221
At exactly the point when it becomes
midnight on August 31 st,

320
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:58,961
everything resets, and we go back to
August 17th. That's the process.

321
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:02,191
So what about our...
No, humanity's memories?

322
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:07,101
Those are reset as well. Everything
starts over from the beginning.

323
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:10,131
So you mean that time does that
thing that you mentioned.

324
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:14,571
Well, I guess it
can't be helped.

325
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,601
Oh no, Miss Asahina
isn't involved in this.

326
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,981
Okay, then, what is?

327
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:21,611
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

328
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:28,351
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but somewhere inside of her

329
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,491
is a desire to not let
summer vacation end.

330
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,561
Do you mean she feels
regret over something?

331
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,261
That's what I believe.

332
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,531
Perhaps she feels that
there's something left

333
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,501
that she wants to do during
our summer vacation?

334
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:46,671
Man, the hopeless situations she causes
unfold on a galactic scale.

335
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,981
I've been wondering this
since I got here,

336
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,181
but you seem awfully
cheerful about this.

337
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,081
It's because we've finally
been able to solve

338
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,321
the recent mysterious and frequent
feelings of deja vu that I've had.

339
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,791
Now that I think about it, those inexplicable
feelings may have been

340
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,551
remnants from when our memories
have been reset.

341
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,761
You've been feeling
them too, right?

342
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,561
Is it possible that other people
across the world feel this, too?

343
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,341
You and I
are a special case.

344
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,811
It appears that the people who
are closest to Miss Suzumiya

345
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:23,611
are able to sense
this strangeness.

346
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,881
What about Haruhi? Does she
sense any of this at all?

347
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:32,751
Not at all, it seems. It would probably
be bad for us if she did.

348
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:39,931
However, I believe that there is one
person who remembers everything,

349
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:43,261
more than the deja vu
that we do.

350
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,771
And who would
that be?

351
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:48,201
I think you know.

352
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,641
Is that right, Nagato?

353
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,771
It is.

354
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:56,611
You remember
all of it?

355
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,841
Yes.

356
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:03,321
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

357
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:07,271
This is the fifteen thousandth,
four hundred and ninety-ninth time.

358
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,921
15,499?

359
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:17,091
What do you mean by 15,499?
Nagato, what are you saying?

360
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:21,431
Are you serious?

361
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,371
I am.

362
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:27,341
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

363
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,341
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

364
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:34,181
Out of 15,499 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

365
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,281
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

366
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,591
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

367
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:43,861
but did not go to a goldfish
scooping stand, occurred 437 times.

368
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,791
We've had a part-time job 9,026 times,
and when we did,

369
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,091
there are six different kinds
of jobs that we did.

370
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:50,761
In addition to handing
out balloons,

371
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,531
we also worked as movers, cashiers,
we handed out fliers,

372
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,301
worked as call center...

373
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:54,771
worked as call center...
I got it, that's enough.

374
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,101
I got it, that's enough.

375
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:09,481
15,499 times,
that's what Nagato said.

376
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:14,711
Times two weeks, hmm,
that's around 594 years.

377
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:19,421
She alone has memories
of all that time,

378
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,961
repeating it all
over and over...

379
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,731
Nagato, how must it feel

380
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:27,601
to experience that same period
of time over and over again?

381
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,001
I've heard yet another
crazy story.

382
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:37,841
The next day we
went stargazing.

383
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:40,011
The location was
Nagato's apartment,

384
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,881
and the telescope was one that
Koizumi had gotten for us.

385
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:49,551
I'm bored of this.
UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.

386
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:54,391
Hey! Stop it, Haruhi,
you'll break it!

387
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,561
Exactly what does
she want to do?

388
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,231
Now what could
that be?

389
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,501
If we could figure that out,
this would all be solved...

390
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:12,181
How about trying
this out?

391
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,981
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden
embrace from behind,

392
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,081
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

393
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,851
And who would
be doing that?

394
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,321
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

395
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,021
Consider me out.

396
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,351
All right, how about
if I do it?

397
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:36,101
I'm kidding. I'm lacking a certain
something for the role.

398
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,441
And all that would
do is cause

399
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,271
unnecessary confusion
in Miss Suzumiya.

400
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:45,801
We continued to run through a torrent
of summer vacation events.

401
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,051
We went to a batting center,

402
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,481
to a real fireworks show,

403
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,721
and we even took part in a
goby fishing tournament.

404
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,721
We also had a test
of courage,

405
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,991
watched some movies,

406
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:59,261
went to the beach,
went bowling,

407
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:03,251
and even to karaoke.
We were always doing something.

408
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:08,101
Of course, I knew that this wasn't
going to satisfy Haruhi.

409
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,041
Even still, there wasn't anything
I could do about it,

410
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:15,101
and the last days of our summer
vacation ticked away.

411
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:19,911
And so we ended up
at August 30th...

412
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:25,311
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

413
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,091
Hmm. I wonder if this
was good enough.

414
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,721
But, hmm, well...
I guess this works.

415
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:40,101
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

416
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,371
That's fine, then.

417
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,841
We were able to do
a lot this summer,

418
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,341
so that's enough, right?

419
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:54,541
No, Haruhi...
You're still not satisfied.

420
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,821
Okay, we're done
for today.

421
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:59,681
I had tomorrow set aside
just in case,

422
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,991
but you can just
take the day off.

423
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,251
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

424
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,061
Wait, Haruhi.

425
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,291
There it is again!
That deja vu!

426
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:15,461
And it's a strong one,
stronger than ever before.

427
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:19,641
I can't let Haruhi leave.
If she goes,

428
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,711
we'll end up repeating
these past two weeks

429
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:24,441
for the some-thousandth
time again.

430
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:27,351
But what should I do?

431
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:29,281
What should I say?

432
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,781
There must have been a hint
somewhere in what Haruhi said.

433
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:34,051
But what was it?

434
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:37,451
What has she said
up to this point?

435
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:40,351
I don't know...

436
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,531
I can't remember...

437
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,751
August 31 st. I haven't
touched my homework.

438
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,781
Whatever, it doesn't
matter anymore.

439
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,261
If we're just going to
do it all over again,

440
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,461
then there's no point
to doing it.

441
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,811
Whether tomorrow
comes or not,

442
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:31,771
I'll leave it to the me at
that time to deal with it.

443
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,161
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

444
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:48,861
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

445
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:53,421
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

446
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,701
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

447
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,371
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

448
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:03,581
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

449
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,081
Tomare!
Stop!

450
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:08,881
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

451
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,451
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

452
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,821
Nazenara
That's because

453
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:20,031
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

454
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,831
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

455
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:25,231
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

456
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:30,141
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

457
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:34,041
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

458
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,741
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

459
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,801
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
