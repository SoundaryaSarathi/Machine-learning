1
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:22,648
May BLAST have
their professional debut

2
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,748
May BLAST have
their professional debut
Back then, the one thing I had plenty of
was my countless number of wishes.

3
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,688
Back then, the one thing I had plenty of
was my countless number of wishes.

4
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:45,868
Blinking eyes call the wind

5
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:51,378
A smile clears all the noise away

6
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:57,748
The angel in your eyes whispers

7
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:02,988
"Everything begins now"

8
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:05,458
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,788
It's like being caught in a wave

10
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:11,328
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

11
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:14,798
Breath held, arms reaching out

12
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:22,208
Baby this world is different
from yesterday's

13
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,718
You're the only one I can see

14
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:30,748
Baby my wish on a wing

15
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:33,588
This sky is torn

16
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:39,248
By a single overflowing word

17
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:05,908
It's the 7th of July?

18
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:08,718
A bad omen.

19
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,028
What is?

20
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,548
Actually, Nana hasn't talked like that
lately, has she?

21
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,488
Before, she would blame everything
on the Demon Lord.

22
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,288
Perhaps she's becoming
more of an adult.

23
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:21,988
That would be nice.

24
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:27,968
Kyosuke, do you want your eggs
sunny-side up or scrambled?

25
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,078
Sunny-side up.

26
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:32,948
Come to think of it...

27
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,908
Nana doesn't come by our place
as often as she used to.

28
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,878
I don't think I've seen her
in quite some time. How's she doing?

29
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,388
Oh, right. You couldn't make it to
her roommate's live concert either

30
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,828
because of work.

31
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:50,588
Well, she's doing okay, but there was
something odd about her.

32
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:54,618
Yeah. You mean that scent of
a new guy in her life?

33
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:57,128
Although she denies it.

34
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,208
Has she found a job?

35
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,168
Ouch!

36
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,568
Judging by the fact she's said
nothing about it, I doubt it.

37
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:07,478
She said something about wanting to
work in sales at a fashionable shop.

38
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:09,448
But it's been at least a month

39
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:10,978
since she was fired from
her previous job, right?

40
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:12,508
How's she getting by?

41
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:13,818
She seems to be managing.

42
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,318
She said she's been taking on
temporary jobs to get by.

43
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:20,788
But it's not like there are
that many temporary jobs.

44
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:24,098
Hmm... She's registered at
a personnel agency

45
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,228
specializing in demonstrators.

46
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,698
What exactly does
this demonstrator do?

47
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:33,798
This is the new product, Raffine Beer.
Please give it a try.

48
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,438
This demonstrator takes part in

49
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,568
campaigns to promote food items
newly on the market.

50
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,348
You'll find them in the food section
of department store basements,

51
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,548
preparing anything
from sausages to sliced fruits.

52
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,378
In other words, I'm a food saleswoman
offering food samples.

53
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,618
I get called for a sales blitz
that lasts for two, three days.

54
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:52,458
I get paid over
ten thousand yen a day,

55
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,758
so I took the job to help me out with
living expenses for the time being.

56
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,458
But it's actually a lot more fun
than I expected.

57
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:02,598
Anything involving food would
seem fun to you, Hachiko.

58
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,368
N-No way! That's not why.

59
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,838
How should I put it...
the interaction with the customers...

60
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,448
- Hey, Nobu, about this part...
- Listen to me!

61
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,408
What is it?

62
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:17,978
I'm convinced that working in sales
really suits me.

63
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,078
For instance, I'm really good at that
"smiles are free" deal.

64
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:25,178
Then you should find a job
at a fast food joint.

65
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,758
If the uniform's cute, then I'd love that.

66
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,298
This latest gig from the beer company

67
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:30,698
requires me to wear
a campaign girl-type mini-skirt outfit.

68
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:32,098
I think I look great in it.

69
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:34,998
I would've loved to see that.

70
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,968
That old pervert's saying something.

71
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:45,378
The Milky Way's not visible.

72
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,708
I was so looking forward to seeing it.

73
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,208
Hey, Nobu!

74
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,188
About meeting tomorrow!
Yasu's asking if we could meet there!

75
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:01,858
Sure! Since I'll get off work just in time
for the opening anyway!

76
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,598
Tomorrow...

77
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,398
July 8th?

78
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:09,058
He says it's okay!

79
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,938
That's right. Tomorrow is
Trapnest's last performance.

80
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:14,738
The three of you are going, right?

81
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,078
Mhm.

82
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:19,068
Those VIP seats.
Are they in a special section?

83
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,848
Not really. They're center seats
on the second floor balcony.

84
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,718
I hear you get a great view,

85
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:25,948
but since you're surrounded by those
associated with the band,

86
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:27,678
and journalists,
the section is pretty much dead.

87
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:29,918
What's that? Sounds so boring.

88
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,298
But we're not exactly fans,

89
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:36,228
so I'm rather thankful that I won't be
sitting between screaming voices.

90
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:39,658
You should've had Ren
get you a seat too, Hachi.

91
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,958
It might not be too late. Why don't I
ask him to make arrangements?

92
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:47,098
No, I already saw them back home,
so never mind.

93
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,808
Besides, I'm a bit
busy tomorrow anyway.

94
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,238
You've got it wrong!

95
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,368
You hafta write a wish
and hang it from a bamboo branch.

96
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:55,738
A wish?

97
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:57,108
Do you seriously not know?

98
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,608
- What?
- What's the matter?

99
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:02,478
Well, Shin says he's never seen
Tanabata decorations.

100
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:04,848
Can you believe it? He just asked me,
"What is a tanzaku?"

101
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,078
Like I asked before, what kind of life
have you been living?

102
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,018
Didn't you do stuff
back in kindergarten?

103
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,428
I wanna write a wish on a tanzaku too.

104
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,828
Then should we go to our place
to write some?

105
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,458
We have some tanzaku left.

106
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:15,938
All right!

107
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,308
She did some Tanabata decorations?

108
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,178
I told her not to, since it's
embarrassing at her age, but...

109
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,588
All right.

110
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:35,358
Defeat Trapnest!

111
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,388
Defeat Trapnest!
Defeat Trapnest?

112
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:37,718
Defeat Trapnest!

113
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:41,388
Nobu, that's not a wish!
That's a resolution!

114
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:42,628
Yeah, I guess.

115
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:49,798
I'll write a wish for Nobu.
"I want to become taller. Nobuo."

116
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,998
None of your business!

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,968
Besides, you're smaller than me!

118
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:56,568
But I'm still growing. Sorry to say this,
but I'll surpass your height in no time.

119
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,178
I think I'll wish for that.

120
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:01,848
I wish that we can
get an air conditioner.

121
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,548
I wish that I get back the car I sold.

122
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,878
I'd like a veranda where I can
decorate some bamboo branches.

123
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,318
I want money.

124
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:12,228
You guys, can't you write down
some real dreams?

125
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,458
But this room is so damn hot!

126
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,398
Indeed.

127
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:17,328
My dreams will wither in this heat.

128
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:19,728
Nana!

129
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:21,218
The tanzakus are being blown away.

130
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:45,058
That day the clear skies of Tokyo
filled up with clouds in the evening

131
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:47,928
and we never
got to see the Milky Way.

132
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,058
However we ended up staying up
all night chatting.

133
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:03,948
I already knew that wishing alone
won't make dreams come true,

134
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,848
but I did feel that each time
a dream came true,

135
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,908
I would become that much happier.

136
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:11,278
May Hachiko find a boyfriend.
(long haired)
Nana

137
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:15,158
Today, we will once again bring you
a wide range of special melodies,

138
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:16,988
from the latest hit songs
to nostalgic songs from the past.

139
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,458
We will kick off with a video clip of
a group who will be performing

140
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,858
the finale to their first nationwide tour
tonight. Trapnest.

141
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:34,768
Once the tour is over, .,

142
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,508
I'll come directly to see you.

143
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,808
When I do, would you mind
cooking for me again?

144
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,848
He will come.
He won't come.

145
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,658
He will come.
He won't come.

146
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,428
He will come.

147
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:56,698
He won't come.

148
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:01,688
Oh, no! Nobody in today's age uses
flowers to make predictions anymore!

149
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,498
I may be insane!

150
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:06,298
I shouldn't hafta use flowers!
I know the answer!

151
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,528
There's no way he's coming.

152
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:11,438
He didn't even reply to my email.
He's probably forgotten all about me.

153
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,608
But just in case...

154
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,978
Even if Takumi doesn't come,
I'm positive Ren will come.

155
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:22,318
There's no big difference in cooking
for three people or four people.

156
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:27,958
I don't know what time they'll show up,

157
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,898
so it's gotta be food that's tasty
even after it's cooled down.

158
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,598
These tomatoes are really delicious.

159
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:36,998
Where did you get them from?

160
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:45,878
Is this really okay?
Thank you, Jun-chan.

161
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,908
The two of us can't eat all this.

162
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,108
They just arrived,
so they're really fresh.

163
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:51,148
Lucky!

164
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:54,408
Well then, thank you so much,
Jun-chan.

165
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:55,878
Come by again.

166
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:58,448
- Kyosuke said he'd love to see you.
- Mhm.

167
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:02,398
But look at all the stuff you bought.
Are you expecting someone?

168
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,418
N-Not really. N-No one's coming.

169
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:11,868
It's probably for the best
for him not to come.

170
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,868
Then I can easily give up on him.

171
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,408
Besides, if Takumi comes over,

172
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,708
I would hafta explain
everything to Nana.

173
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:23,978
There's no way I could
hide things any longer.

174
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:29,318
But if that happens, there'd
no longer be a reason to hide things.

175
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:36,658
If Takumi is the kind of guy who would
come to see me as he promised,

176
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,628
I would feel less guilty
about the situation.

177
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,748
Hey, Hachiko!
Who's gonna eat all this?

178
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,338
There's easily enough here
for at least five people!

179
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:01,248
I guess I got a bit carried away.

180
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:05,178
But I figured he'd be hungry
after the live performance.

181
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,828
I wonder what time Ren will be here.

182
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:10,448
Huh? He's coming? Did he say he is?

183
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:16,258
What? I don't know, but I assumed
he'd be coming. Isn't he?

184
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:20,228
I doubt he is.
He never made any such promise.

185
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,568
Why not?!

186
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:24,578
What do you mean, why not?

187
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:26,248
His tour ends today,

188
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:28,838
so wouldn't he come to see you
first thing after the concert's over?!

189
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,778
He hasn't seen you in a month!

190
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:31,978
He will definitely come!

191
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,918
But tonight they're partying until late
to celebrate the end of the tour.

192
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,648
It's not likely he'll be
able to come here.

193
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,528
Partying until late...

194
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,658
I see.

195
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,428
But he may come after that.

196
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:47,968
No. If Ren comes over
and stays the night,

197
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,728
you'd feel obligated to be hospitable.

198
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:52,038
So we decided that from now on,
whenever we wanna meet,

199
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,338
I'll go to Ren's place.

200
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:57,278
He's not gonna suddenly show up
late at night without my knowledge.

201
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,638
No way. I was faintly hoping that...

202
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:03,618
Hoping that Ren would
come to see Nana,

203
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:05,048
and Takumi would tag along

204
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,208
with his casual,
"maybe I'll come along too" attitude.

205
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:09,518
H-Hey...

206
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:12,288
I don't care even if it were
a casual spur of the moment decision.

207
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,288
I just hoped he would come.

208
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,158
Don't let it get you down.

209
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:20,258
If you wanna see Ren I'll ask him
to drop by again sometime.

210
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,998
He did say he has free time
starting tomorrow.

211
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,068
Oh, if you'd like I'll have him
invite Takumi again, and...

212
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:29,008
No, it's all right! Don't worry about me!

213
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,178
B-But...

214
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:35,908
Well, anyway, I don't think
he'll be able to come today.

215
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:39,178
I'm sorry, considering
all the food you prepared.

216
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,878
It's okay. It really is.
Really, don't worry about it.

217
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,888
I'll just put everything in the fridge.
It'll last a few days.

218
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:47,788
What am I doing? I got carried away
all by myself again.

219
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:51,018
Hey, wait! I'm hungry.

220
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:52,758
Do you mind if I eat what I can now?

221
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,968
Sure. Of course you can.

222
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:57,438
I'll get some plates.

223
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,728
This looks really delicious.

224
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:03,138
Ren doesn't know what he's missing,
losing out on this great feast.

225
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,468
Delicious!

226
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:11,148
However, seeing the way
you're acting, you actually wanted to

227
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,948
go to the final concert
with everyone tonight, didn't you?

228
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,188
I should've asked Ren about it.

229
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:21,328
I'm really bad at noticing
that sorta stuff. Sorry.

230
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:22,558
That's not true.

231
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,588
Never mind me, I bet you
wanted to go, didn't you?

232
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,658
You can be really stubborn.

233
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:29,998
It's not really about being stubborn.

234
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,668
If I saw the performance,

235
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,158
I'd end up comparing myself
to her again and get depressed.

236
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,428
As shameful as that is...

237
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:39,878
This is great too. Looks like we'll be
enjoying great food for a while.

238
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,448
I'm the one who's lousy at
noticing things about others.

239
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:49,148
I'm sorry, for forcing
those words outta you.

240
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,288
Thank you very much!

241
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:11,038
Today's performance is now over.

242
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,478
People are asked to follow
the guidance of the staff

243
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,278
and promptly leave the premises.

244
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,188
I'm going home.

245
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,858
Huh? You're not going?
But our pass allows us to go backstage.

246
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,688
I have work to do.

247
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,228
Never mind that. Come for just a bit.

248
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:38,938
Sorry. Give Ren my regards.

249
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:40,368
What about Reira?

250
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:45,598
"Good job."

251
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:46,978
That's it?!

252
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,148
Huh? Where's Yasu?

253
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:51,588
Isn't he with you?

254
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:55,048
He left, saying he had work to do.
He sends his regards to Ren.

255
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,488
Huh? What about me?

256
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,458
No way!

257
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,058
I was really looking forward
to seeing him.

258
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,828
I guess it wasn't mutual, Naoki.

259
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:07,798
I was also looking forward to
seeing him. So it wasn't mutual?

260
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:09,198
This is so painful.

261
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:13,068
Reira, you realize it's hard to come up
with a comeback phrase in your case.

262
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,938
It wasn't mutual? This is so painful.

263
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:17,238
Not to mention there are writers
around us taking notes.

264
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,078
Take, it's not a laughing matter.

265
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,918
Yasu asked me to tell you
that you did a good job.

266
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:27,618
Wow, what a pretty boy!

267
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,318
Come play with me.

268
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,288
Hey!

269
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,758
Sure, but I'm expensive.

270
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,628
One hundred thousand yen per night
for the "works".

271
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,598
Shin!

272
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,718
You're cute too. How much?

273
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,588
Ren, save me.
What's up with this person?

274
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,558
I think I'm going home.

275
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:46,138
Come on. We're partying.
Come join us.

276
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,828
We've got a second and third party
lined up, so we'll be at it until morning.

277
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,648
Yay! I'm coming, I'm coming.

278
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,948
Yay, come, come.

279
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,348
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

280
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,328
Gin and tonic.

281
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,628
Are you sure, Nobu?
We're only at the second party.

282
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:09,628
Shouldn't you slow down
with the drinking?

283
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,028
I can't blend in with this atmosphere
unless I'm drunk.

284
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,028
Such a pure hearted guy!

285
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:19,068
I wonder why Yasu went out
with such a weird woman.

286
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,398
Weird woman?

287
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,308
The mysteries of Yasu keep building.

288
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,138
I can't let you talk like that, Nobu.

289
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,798
How dare you talk of
our Princess like that.

290
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,048
Takumi... Sorry to bother you but
could you please autograph these?

291
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,778
What. What's this? You making me work,
even in this place?

292
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,758
Sorry.

293
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:38,348
I got autographs from the others
during breaks at rehearsals,

294
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:41,788
but you seemed busy so I was
gonna ask you later, then forgot.

295
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,958
It's a request from
a very important sponsor.

296
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:46,998
Okay, okay. If it's so important,
then you shouldn't forget.

297
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:47,938
Sorry.

298
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:49,798
Pull yourself together, manager.

299
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,908
So you're signing them? Good for you.

300
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:52,868
I'm a mature man, after all.

301
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:56,108
You're the one who does
the musical arrangements

302
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,908
for all the Trapnest songs,
right Takumi?

303
00:16:57,908 --> 00:16:58,878
That's right.

304
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:02,548
And you also produced
your latest album, right?

305
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:03,678
Well, yeah.

306
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,448
So that's why it's so much
better than the first one.

307
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:09,388
Oh? You're cute. How about for
two hundred thousand yen?

308
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:11,888
But you're seriously great.

309
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,888
How do you manage to make

310
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,448
such fancy music
outta Ren's dark, twisted songs?

311
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,358
Excuse me for writing
dark, twisted songs.

312
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:20,798
Shochu!

313
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,458
But it's all possible
because of Ren's songs.

314
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,638
How do you manage to
get on everyone's good side?!

315
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:28,868
By the way, Takumi. Could you
sign an autograph for me, too?

316
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,538
Sure. But do you
have autograph paper?

317
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:34,048
No I don't. Just give me one of those.

318
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,318
But these are for
an important sponsor.

319
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:36,478
Give me a break
But these are for
an important sponsor.

320
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:37,548
Give me a break
What do I care?

321
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:37,818
Give me a break
He's just like Nana.

322
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:38,938
He's just like Nana.

323
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:40,778
To who?

324
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:42,078
- Hachiko.
- Huh?

325
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,758
Ren, if it's for Hachi,

326
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,688
why not do the favor of having him
write out her full name?

327
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,388
What is her full name?

328
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:49,398
Hachi...

329
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,418
Where have I heard that before?

330
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,628
You met her a while ago, Takumi.

331
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,188
At the mahjongg tournament.
Nana Komatsu.

332
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,228
Oh, yes, Nana.

333
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,868
She may no longer
want an autograph from me.

334
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,148
Huh? But she said she wanted one.

335
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,208
- When?
- The day of the mahjongg game.

336
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:13,678
Then there's no need.
We did it the next day.

337
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,078
Where did Take go?

338
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,488
Wait. What do you mean, "You did it."?

339
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,518
What? You want me to
explain it to you?

340
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,168
She's my girl's best friend.

341
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,058
It's one thing to fool around
with women but you've gone too far.

342
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:29,688
Know your limits.

343
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,098
Don't get all worked up.

344
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:35,078
It's not as if I forced myself onto her.
She agreed to it.

345
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,608
She was wagging her tail
looking all pleased.

346
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:46,988
Hey, you!

347
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,948
Take, it's nothing.
They're just fooling around.

348
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:54,488
If you wanna fight, let's take it outside.

349
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,958
It's a party for all the tour staff.
Don't spoil it.

350
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,868
- Nobu...
- I'm going home.

351
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:07,938
You're going home?

352
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:11,208
Takumi...

353
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,778
Good job.

354
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,748
The autographs!

355
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:23,578
Are you all right, Takumi?

356
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:26,988
Shin is so awesome!

357
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,158
Don't laugh, Reira.

358
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,188
Don't get all upset, Takumi.
You're the one at fault.

359
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,498
I was just telling the truth!
What's wrong with that?!

360
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,288
You think you did
absolutely nothing wrong?

361
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:38,838
I'm going home too.

362
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,708
You can't leave Takumi.
We've still got the third party to go to.

363
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,728
Continue without me.

364
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,378
Takumi, the autographs...

365
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:46,138
I'll redo them tomorrow
and send them to you.

366
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,178
Thanks to this, I just remembered
something important that I must do.

367
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,708
What? A woman thing again?

368
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,308
When you see Nobu tell him.

369
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:54,818
He cannot reach my level
even in a hundred years.

370
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,578
He doesn't have the guts to
make a woman his, so stop fussing.

371
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,958
I agree with the second half.

372
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:02,798
I'll give him the message.

373
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,378
What is it at this time of night?

374
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:27,708
Hey, Hachi...

375
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:52,048
Hey, Nana...

376
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,348
Why are having a dream come true
and achieving happiness

377
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,148
two different things?

378
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:01,488
I still don't get it, even now.

379
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:05,228
May Hachiko find a boyfriend.
(long haired)
Nana
I still don't get it, even now.

380
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:05,918
May Hachiko find a boyfriend.
(long haired)
Nana

381
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:13,718
I reached into the sky

382
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:20,238
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

383
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:25,608
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

384
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:31,608
Like colorful balloons

385
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,718
I'm alone

386
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:37,448
My hand had no place to go

387
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:44,088
And gently you took it

388
00:21:44,198 --> 00:21:45,268
Starless night

389
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:49,458
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

390
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:55,268
I want to feel your warmth

391
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,138
Tears are falling down

392
00:21:57,138 --> 00:22:01,238
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

393
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:07,738
Of your hand holding mine
