1
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,816
G’morning!

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,449
G’morning!

3
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:16,292
G’morning.

4
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:17,553
G’morning!

5
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,427
Good morning, Sakura.

6
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:28,034
Tomoyo, g’morning!

7
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:30,907
Did something nice happen?

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,969
Eh!

9
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:35,804
Because from the moment you came in,
you looked joyful.

10
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:40,314
Tonight,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,613
Yukito is staying over at our house.

12
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,386
He has to plan the
athletics meet with Touya.

13
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:48,283
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:49,591
Who did you say is staying over?

15
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,526
I said it in such a soft voice already.

16
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,002
After all, one can hear the name

17
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:05,604
of the person one likes
under any circumstances.

18
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:09,136
Is he coming over tonight?

19
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:12,174
Hey, hey, who is ‘he’?

20
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,441
He is…

21
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,986
What? What?
What are you guys talking about?

22
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,668
Sorry for interrupting…

23
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,268
Wh… What is it?!

24
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:36,033
Daidouji…

25
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,197
Yes?

26
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,141
Our music teacher, Miss Tsujitani
wanted me to let you know…

27
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,342
…that she needs you to stay behind
in the music room after school.

28
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:45,577
To practise for the competition?

29
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:46,675
Yes.

30
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:50,083
Everyone in the choir has to stay behind.
This is not easy at all.

31
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:52,623
Hey, can I come watch your practice?

32
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,824
The song you sang to me yesterday
was a really nice song.

33
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,219
I want to hear it again.

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,092
Please come!

35
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,328
Oh! We want to go too!

36
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,097
I want to hear Tomoyo sing.

37
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,602
Yeah!

38
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,434
Oh! I can sing very well too.

39
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,443
Then, would you like to join the choir?

40
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:14,202
I don’t mind joining,

41
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:16,438
but I don’t know any Japanese songs.

42
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,110
Oh, speaking of the choir…

43
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,476
Did you know? They said it came out…

44
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,617
Wh… What came out?

45
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:27,489
A ghost.

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,987
[Sakura and Tomoyo and
the Wonderful Song]

47
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:40,168
Last night, there was this girl
from the choir who stayed late.

48
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,267
They said she left something
in the music room,

49
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:44,436
and so she went back for it.

50
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:50,612
In that really dark room,
where nobody should be there,

51
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:52,811
someone inside was singing!

52
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,491
Tomoyo, did you know about it?

53
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:16,101
I thought you would be scared,
so I did not mention it.

54
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,570
Thank you.

55
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:25,713
The song is pretty even
it was only played on the piano, right?

56
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,549
Yes! It was a wonderful song!

57
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:28,545
Oh!

58
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:29,812
What is the matter?

59
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:34,187
Everyone, why don’t we listen
to this wonderful song one more time?

60
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:36,324
I feel something weird in this room.

61
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,324
You noticed it too?

62
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:42,299
There’s something in this room.

63
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,525
Could it be a Clow Card?

64
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,737
What is it?
Is there a Clow Card in here?

65
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,032
I can’t quite tell yet.

66
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,743
It… It could be a ghost…

67
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,137
Let’s check it out.

68
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:57,070
When?

69
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,141
After everyone is gone.

70
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,146
At night?

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,511
At night?!!

72
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,391
Is there something wrong,
Kinomoto?

73
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:15,430
N… No… m…
I just thought… it’s scary at night…

74
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,395
I’m sorry.

75
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,597
So, a singin’ voice
from the music room.

76
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:29,909
That isn’t a ghost, is it?

77
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,143
Stop it!!

78
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,382
Talk about a song coming
out from the music room,

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,086
isn’t that like the
seven mysteries of the school?

80
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,120
But, I’m sure
I could sense a trace of a card

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,187
in the music room,

82
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,823
and even Li-kun said so too.

83
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,499
Okay! Then in order to
jump ahead of the brat,

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,325
we’ll sneak into the school tonight!

85
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:51,558
No!

86
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,105
You’re the one who lose if
it turns out to be a Clow Card!

87
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,043
But even if the music room incident

88
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:02,574
is due to a card,

89
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,506
there are still many other
scary stories about the school!

90
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,943
Didn’t we go there
for Shadow?

91
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,253
That’s why I said no more!

92
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:11,753
Hey! Hey!

93
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,755
Besides, Yukito is coming over tonight.

94
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,727
I want to stay here all night.

95
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:22,993
Oh, your tea is getting cold, isn’t it?
I’ll go pour you a new one…

96
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:24,698
You want another cup, don’t you?

97
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,403
He… Hey, Sakura!

98
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,098
Geez…

99
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,145
They should be back anytime now.

100
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,522
Yukito…

101
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,286
They are late, aren’t they?

102
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:54,621
Ye… Yeah.

103
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,323
Oh, I was going to pour some tea.

104
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:58,632
Should I pour it out for you?

105
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,035
I’m fine. It’s not something
I can’t do myself.

106
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:05,501
I’m home.

107
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:07,209
There you are.

108
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,270
Welcome home.

109
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:10,874
Sorry for bothering you.

110
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:12,414
You’re very welcome here,
Tsukishiro.

111
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,186
He… Hello.

112
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:22,925
Hello. I’m staying over tonight.

113
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:24,726
O… Okay!

114
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:29,433
Yukito will be with us today…

115
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,804
U… m… Would you like some tea?

116
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:36,064
Can I?

117
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:38,635
Thanks.

118
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:40,703
Oh, I want one too.

119
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,079
After.

120
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,178
Totally different attitude.

121
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,211
By the way, Sakura…

122
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,713
Did you know the story about
the music room in your school?

123
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,388
Oh, that story.

124
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,549
Hmm? What happened?

125
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,558
It seems somehow,

126
00:06:57,162 --> 00:07:00,131
people heard songs from within
their music room at night.

127
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,089
Songs?

128
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,025
Also, they always
last for about an hour.

129
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:07,935
We have students staying
late at school

130
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:09,606
to prepare for the athletics meet.

131
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,040
I see.

132
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,509
Those who heard it were the officers

133
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:16,676
from the student council
who stayed the latest.

134
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,814
They thought it was the wind at first,

135
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,376
but they listen more closely
and it was definitely a song.

136
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,447
And they wondered where
it was coming from,

137
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,348
so the members went to check it out.

138
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,694
And it was from Tomoeda’s music room.

139
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,157
What time did it happen?

140
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,360
They said it was around
10 o’clock at night.

141
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,895
Um… No one’s there at that hour, right?

142
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:39,827
Yes.

143
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,430
That’s why there were
rumors around the school.

144
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:44,731
That maybe it’s a ghost.

145
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,315
But I heard… 
It was a very beautiful voice.

146
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,487
I kinda want to hear it.

147
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:06,696
I’m going to the school tonight!

148
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,697
What? Did somethin’ happen while
you went to pour the tea?

149
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:16,429
Yukito said he wanted
to hear the ghost’s song.

150
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,670
Is that why?!

151
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:21,602
That is why.

152
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,704
You don’t have the right motive,

153
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,676
but I’m fine with it as long as you are.

154
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,948
It’s the Card Captor’s call!

155
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,285
I found it!

156
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:32,987
Yukito…

157
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,384
Hey, are you listenin’?

158
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,105
Tomoyo, you’re not scared?

159
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,577
Not particularly.

160
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:02,776
I am more worried about

161
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,686
not being able to capture
your best shots.

162
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,992
By the way, did you hear the singing.

163
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,488
in the music room when…
you stayed for practice?

164
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,898
No, I stayed behind after school,

165
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,961
but it was only till 7 o’clock.

166
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,761
Then only that girl who forgot her stuff

167
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,731
and those high school students heard it.

168
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,732
Some students in Seijou High School.
Stayed until 10 o’clock.

169
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,710
It is exactly 10 o’clock right now.

170
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:40,719
So… Somehow…

171
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,698
It is scary after all.

172
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:52,360
Hey!

173
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,932
Umm…

174
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:04,242
Li-kun. Mei-Ling.

175
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:06,316
You scared me.

176
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:07,981
You scared us too!

177
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:12,222
In your costume with a sword,

178
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,024
you’ve come to look for the Clow Card,

179
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:15,120
right, brat?

180
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,525
Who’s a brat?

181
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:20,454
You are a brat for the fact that
you only lived for 10 years.

182
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,160
And you came along too.

183
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,732
I followed him here.
He said I couldn’t come.

184
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:27,696
You shouldn’t have done that.

185
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,372
If something happens,

186
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:31,740
someone with no magical powers like you

187
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,974
can’t win.

188
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,937
Then, what about her?

189
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:38,175
I need to record it.

190
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,876
I should have brought my video camera!

191
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,480
That’s why we’re not coming to play.

192
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,183
Next time, for sure…!

193
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:51,987
Did you hear something?

194
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,263
Is that… a song?

195
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:06,600
Guess the rumor was for real.

196
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:08,606
Where is it comin’ from?

197
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,345
The school building over there.

198
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:18,951
Let’s go!

199
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,118
Wait!

200
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,189
Those brats are cuttin’ ahead of us!

201
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:25,359
Let’s hurry, Sakura!

202
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,500
It isn’t a ghost, is it?

203
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,062
Just go, even if it is.

204
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,515
After all, it is here.

205
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,411
I could hear it clearly from back then.

206
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,320
But I still can’t tell the exact place.

207
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,188
Hey, it isn’t a ghost, right?

208
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,589
Hey, hey,

209
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:58,929
it’s not, right?

210
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:01,623
This song…

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,064
What’s wrong?

212
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,334
I seem to have heard it before.

213
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:07,233
You know it?

214
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:10,639
Yes, but I cannot tell what song it is…

215
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,674
It’s not the one from
the seven mysteries, right?

216
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,581
I do not think so.

217
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:26,580
But you could have been wrong too.

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,055
Just as I thought, I…

219
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:32,055
Hey,

220
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:35,193
aren’t you all ready to
record the voice on tape?

221
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,297
That’s right.

222
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,402
What are you recording it for?

223
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,533
Someone wanted to hear it…

224
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:45,934
The snow ra…

225
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,472
I heard that the voice is beautiful.

226
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,017
Let’s get going.

227
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:09,160
Sorry.

228
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,764
I thought I was gonna die.

229
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:24,406
Just as I thought, I know this song.

230
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,375
It’s from the music room.

231
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,252
Card Captor, pull yourself together.

232
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,481
If you can’t capture the card,

233
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,222
that means you can’t
record the song either.

234
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:38,855
O… Okay. I’ll do my best.

235
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:45,633
It’s from here after all.

236
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:47,962
Oh?

237
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,033
I have heard this song before too.

238
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:54,741
This song!

239
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,942
No more guesses. I’ll just open the door,
and let’s find out.

240
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:00,416
Hey, hold on!

241
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:12,290
It’s gone!

242
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,225
I cannot hear the voice either.

243
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,464
All because you suddenly opened the door!

244
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,058
But!

245
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,695
But thanks to you opening the door,

246
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,405
I could hear the song clearly.

247
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,967
Did you recognize the song?

248
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,578
Yeah. That’s the song you sang for me,
wasn’t it?

249
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,318
That was the song I have been practicing
for the national competition.

250
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:38,121
Why is it the song from Tomoyo’s practice…

251
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:41,650
There it is again.

252
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:45,026
It’s coming from above.

253
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:45,885
Let’s go!

254
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:55,768
It moved again.

255
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,138
This voice…!

256
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:07,582
This sounds just like Tomoyo’s voice.

257
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:11,985
I see now. This is…

258
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:14,090
Song!

259
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,355
I was just about to say that!!

260
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,996
What can Song do?

261
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:26,603
First of all, the card, Song,
is a card that sings.

262
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:28,570
What else?

263
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:29,964
It listens.

264
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:30,965
Anything else?

265
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,239
That’s it.

266
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:36,812
Then, why is it Tomoyo’s voice?

267
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,584
The card, Song,
can copy the voice

268
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:44,013
of the one who sings better than anyone.

269
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:47,085
Tomoyo is good at singing.

270
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:49,549
I’m good at singing too.

271
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,326
If the card copies her voice,

272
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:53,991
it’s gonna get so ill.

273
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:55,960
What did you say?!

274
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,130
Because you yelled!

275
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:02,470
But!

276
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:11,578
It’s here.

277
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:14,273
But I don’t see anything.

278
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,085
Because Song can’t be seen.

279
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:20,649
Then how am I supposed to seal it?

280
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:21,854
Hang on!

281
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:25,287
Tomoyo, are you still
practising this song?

282
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,826
Yes, because the higher
notes were still unstable.

283
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,391
That’s right.

284
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:32,160
Song!

285
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,264
Because our perfect Tomoyo
will win no matter what,

286
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,674
Song is working hard in its practice.

287
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:41,909
While Tomoyo practises her song
in the music room, at the same time…

288
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,712
The card has its own practice too.

289
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:48,149
But we just can’t leave it as it is.

290
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:49,617
If we don’t something,

291
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:51,648
the rumor will just get worse.

292
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,955
They might recognize
it’s Tomoyo’s voice…

293
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:57,824
What should we do?

294
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:00,929
Hey, how about this?

295
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,625
Let me do that,
I’ll sing in front of the card.

296
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,696
Having heard my perfect singing,
even the card…

297
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,498
Well, as we put that thought aside…

298
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:12,008
Tomoyo, bein’ the one whose
voice was copied,

299
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,139
if she would sing the song
in the most perfect manner,

300
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:18,472
that even the card is satisfied,
it will show itself…

301
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,076
I sing?

302
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:21,917
You will do fine.

303
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:25,353
Even when you sang it yesterday,
it was really nice.

304
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,186
I’m sure you can do it.

305
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:34,257
I understand. I will do my best
and be confident.

306
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:50,370
Twinkling in the night sky

307
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:57,376
is a distant golden star,

308
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:00,920
Look at that!

309
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:10,759
the same color as the
little bird I saw

310
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:17,868
in last night’s dream.

311
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:32,482
In this sleepless night,
I sing a song alone.

312
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:42,825
Let us sing tomorrow

313
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:50,535
as we ride on the wings of dreams.

314
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,381
Now, Sakura!

315
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,582
Return to thy form which
thou should be!

316
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:13,253
Clow Card!

317
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:34,646
Good job!

318
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,349
Well done, Tomoyo, Sakura.

319
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,716
Tomoyo, it was really wonderful.

320
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:42,152
Don’t you think so? Li-kun?

321
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:43,717
Yeah.

322
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,158
I guess she’s as good as I am.

323
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:49,965
And puttin’ that thought aside…

324
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,836
after all, only the original
copy of Song would work.

325
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:55,532
Thank you very much.

326
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,436
Oh no, brat, you couldn’t
do anything this time.

327
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,848
You still have plenty
of things to learn.

328
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:06,713
You stuffed doll.

329
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,410
I dare you say it again!

330
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:11,286
What is the matter?

331
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,983
I brought my tape recorder along,

332
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,960
but I forgot to record Song’s singing.

333
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:21,123
But then its voice
is the same as Tomoyo’s voice,

334
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,057
isn’t it okay to just have her sing?

335
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,465
But the duet was really wonderful.

336
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,968
Then why don’t you write
your name on the card,

337
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,634
and have them

338
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:31,997
sing together?

339
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,773
And I was just gonna say that!

340
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,947
S-A-K-U-R-A

341
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,114
All right! I wrote it down.

342
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:42,716
The tape recorder is ready.

343
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:43,553
Okay.

344
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,723
Hey, how about
I sing with them too…

345
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,123
Puttin’ that aside…

346
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,589
Tomoyo, thanks.

347
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:55,458
I will sing the best
I can with the card.

348
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,057
Okay.

349
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,804
Deliver a supreme
singing voice to us!

350
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,111
Song!
