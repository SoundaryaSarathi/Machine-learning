<i>Here, their next adventure begins.</i>

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,379
This is a really weird city.
Lots of factories but no people.

19
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,882
-This place is called Gringey City.
-Gringey?

20
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,426
Never heard of it.

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,846
It used to be a lively, busy place
with all these factories here.

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,724
[Brock] Yeah, they kind of went overboard
with factories.

23
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,809
Pollution ruined the air
and the water here.

24
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,979
I guess we won't find any Pokémon here.

25
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,274
Pika.

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,318
Pikachu, what's wrong?

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,778
Pika.

28
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,780

Hold on, Pikachu.

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,470
We'll get you to the Pokémon Center
as soon as we can.

34
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,680
Pika.

35
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,742
That's them, and they're on their way
to the Pokémon Center.

36
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,078
To protect the world from devastation...

37
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,789
To unite all peoples within our nation...

00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,293
I can't take it anymore!

-This is disgusting!
-This place stinks!

41
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,173
Just chill out
and put on the suits I brought you.

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,388
This thing pumps in a mixture of oxygen
and air freshener.

[contented sighing]

44
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,849
[both] That smells good.

45
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,811
Why didn't you tell us
about these suits before, Meowth?

46
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,812
We could have choked.

47
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:11,066
Quit complaining.
I did come up with this ingenious scheme.

48
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,527
Now get in the pipe
and swim to the Pokémon Center.

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,570
We're wasting time here.

50
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,573
Your plan's stupid.
I'm not going in that sewer.

51
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,159
I'm 100 percent with Jessie on this one.

52
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,453
I want to get Pikachu
just as much as you do,

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,746
but this is humiliating.

54
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,916
-It's degrading.
-We won't go through with this, Meowth,

55
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,752
so you'll have to go on this mission
alone. I'm sorry if this shocks you.

56
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,711
So am I.

57
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,630
[screaming]

58
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,550
I knew you'd see things my way.

59
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,844
You'll pay for this, Meowth.

60
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,680
[James]
Why do we always get the dirty work?

61
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,476
[dings]

00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,104
Hey, nurse!

63
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,063
Hey, nurse!

00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,023
[yawning]

65
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,444
Do you kids have any idea
just what time it is?

66
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Don't you know
that you should be sleeping now?

67
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,283
I'm sorry, but there's something
really wrong with my Pikachu.

68
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,369
[yawning] A cold.

69
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,872
[groans] This is no cold.

70
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,333
Your sisters and cousins
were a lot more helpful!

71
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,878
[yawning]

72
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,546
There's no need to get excited.

73
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,549
Look, sparks are coming
from its cheeks, right?

74
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,052
That's an early symptom of a cold
in electric rodent Pokémon.

75
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,140
If you leave it here overnight,
I'm sure it'll be fine in the morning.

76
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,975
-Miss.
-Hmm?

77
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,604
Excuse me, but are you, by any chance,
the oddball in your family?

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,107
Oh, no.
It's all my other relatives that are odd.

79
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,650
Huh?

80
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,209
[all] Grimer, Grimer, Grimer...

81
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,511
[man] Huh? What's that?

82
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,474
Our generator's completely shut down.

83
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,393
-The water intake valve is totally jammed.
-It can't be!

84
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,604
[whirring powers down]

85
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,067
Hey, what's going on?
The power supply just went dead.

86
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,529
If the pump stops working, there's no air.

87
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,616
They won't like that. [chuckles]

88
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,494
[gasps] What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

89
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,206
[grunts]

90
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,124
My air supply.

-Oh.
-[Ash groans]

93
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,304
-What happened to these Pokémon?
-[Joy] They're in intensive care.

94
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,265
If we don't get the power back soon,

95
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,184
well, I just don't want to think
about what would happen.

96
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,645
Don't just stand there.
We have to save them.

97
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,315
-Joy, please do something.
-I don't know what to do.

98
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,903
Hey, stop giving Joy a hard time.
There's nothing that she can do.

99
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,155
-Let's go.
-[Joy gasps]

100
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,157
Pikachu!

101
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,244
Pikachu, we'll be back
when the power's back on.

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,205
Good luck, everybody.

103
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,916
Chu.

104
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm trying to find out,
but there's no answer at the power plant.

105
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,093
-We don't have much time.
-What does the power plant look like?

106
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,678
You can't miss it.

107
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,055
It's the big building
with the smokestacks there.

108
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,640
[Ash] All right, let's go.

109
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,975
-[rustling]
-Huh?

110
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,436
Pi... Pikachu.

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,479
Pikachu. [groans]

112
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,985
Ah, Pikachu, you should be back
at the Pokémon Center.

113
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,945
Chu.

114
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,032
-I don't get it.
-Just think about it, Ash.

115
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,909
Pikachu's afraid we'll leave,
and we won't come back.

116
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,119
Pika.

117
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,872
-See?
-Hmm...

118
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,291
Okay, you can come along.

119
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,585
But remember, you've got to take it easy.

120
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,545
Pikachu!

121
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,507
[yelling]

122
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:12,432
[both gasping]

123
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,685
We could have suffocated.

124
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,606
The city has been plunged into darkness
by a power failure.

125
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,067
A power failure is it?

126
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,402
I can identify with failure.

127
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,530
[Meowth]
Huh? There they go. Now we're in luck.

128
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,408
We got another chance.

129
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,785
For what?

130
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,455
For finally once and for
all capturing that pesky Pikachu.

131
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,414
Come on now!

132
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,125
Jessie, James, let's move it!

133
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,002
Give us time to rest, Meowth.

134
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,589
We nearly drowned in the stinking sewer
thanks to your ridiculous plan.

135
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,509
Meowth, you nearly killed us, you dimwit.

136
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,552
Guys, don't worry.

137
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,473
This time we've got a secret weapon
that's Meowth-proof. [chuckles]

138
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,525
-There's the power plant.
-Let's check inside.

139
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,364
Hello? Is anybody in here?

140
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,119
If no one's here,
we might as well look around, huh?

141
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,913
Pikachu.

142
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,292
Something's really weird.
Why isn't anybody working here?

143
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,920
It looks like the central control room's
down that way.

144
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,015
[shivering]

145
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,100
[Misty] Something's following us.

146
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,685
-[whimpering]
-Huh?

147
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,979
The place is deserted. Nobody's here.

148
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,941
Oh, I know I heard something back there.

149
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,237
Listen, Misty,
it's okay if you're a total chicken.

150
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,906
Brock and I are brave enough
to handle things here.

151
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,451
I'm not a chicken, you little twerp!

152
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,120
There was something back there
whether you believe me or not.

153
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,372
Okay, okay, let's just...

154
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,707
[both] Huh?

155
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
[stammering]

156
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,878
Chill out?

157
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,047
[both whimpering]

158
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,757
There's something...

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,675
Right behind you.

160
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,054
[whimpering]

161
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,849
All right, if anybody's there,
you can come on out.

162
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,518
And if you're a ghost or a monster,

163
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,271
you can stay where you are,
and we won't bother you.

164
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,190
And you called me chicken!

165
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,192
You're a total coward!

166
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,818
Maybe not a total coward.

167
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,488
-[Misty] You're just a--
-[Brock] Come on, guys, quit it.

168
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,323
Pika!

169
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,367
Be quiet, Pikachu.

170
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,869
Be quiet.

171
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,454
Pika, pi-pika!

172
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,706
-Pikachu, I told you.
-Pika! Pika!

173
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,125

-Pika! Pika.

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,210
[all screaming]

175
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,586
What is that thing?

176
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,630
[all whimpering]

177
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,049
What is that thing? What is it?

178
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,635
Magnemite.

179
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,388
Magnemite? Is that a Pokémon?

180
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,475
[Pokédex]
<i>Magnemite, a magnet Pokémon.</i>

181
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,937
<i>Its means of floating through the air</i>
<i>are not understood.</i>

182
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,649
<i>This very mysterious Pokémon</i>
<i>is of the electric type.</i>

183
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,568
What's a Pokémon like that doing here?

184
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,072
It caused the blackout.
Magnemite shut down the power plant.

185
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,283
This one, by itself? No way.

186
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,953
Well, Dexter said it's mysterious.

187
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,081
Great.
I'll capture it, then we can check it out.

188
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,543
Wait a minute. That Magnemite
doesn't look like it wants to battle.

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,505
Cha.

190
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,551
What's with this thing?
Why is it circling Pikachu?

191
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,970
It seems to like Pikachu.

192
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,305
-Pika.
-Magnemite.

193
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,184
This Magnemite is blushing,
like it's in love or something.

194
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,227
Love?

195
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,105
If it were an animal Pokémon,
I could understand,

196
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,941
but how can an inorganic Pokémon,
like Magnemite,

197
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,651
fall in love with an electric rodent?

198
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,445
Magnemite's following Pikachu
all over the place,

199
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,656
almost like it's a streaker or something.

200
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,616
Ash, you mean a stalker.

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,911
Like I said,
this Magnemite really likes Pikachu.

202
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,206
Yeah, but Pikachu doesn't like it.

203
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,959
Hey you, Magnemite, cut it out.

204
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,378
Pika.

205
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,758
-[whimpers]
-[chuckles] Guess Magnemite gave up.

206
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,553
[sniffs] Mm, do you smell that?

207
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,430
-I do.
-So do I.

208
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,268
-Grimer!
-Grimer!

209
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,813
-It's those things.
-They stinks.

210
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,231

<i>specialize in sludge attacks.</i>

213
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,742
Magnemite must have disappeared
because of these things.

214
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,162
Is this what sludge smells like?
It really stinks.

215
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,081
-Grimer!
-[Ash grunts]

216
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:51,878
Ash, don't say anything that might insult
their Pokémon pride or make them mad.

217
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,006
I'm sorry.
You have such a unique scent.

218
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,759
I should have known
it was the aroma of sludge.

219
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,637
You can call it whatever you want,
but it sinks.

[all screaming]

229
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,544
Why'd you have to open your mouth
and make the Grimer mad, Misty?

230
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,922
I had to open my mouth.
I couldn't use my nose.

I'm Brock, this is Misty,
and we're here to help fix--

at the Pokémon Center

if the power doesn't come back soon.

245
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,713
Hang in there.

246
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,675
Those kids are going to get the power
back on real soon, I'm sure.

247

they're clogging the sea water intake.

so it will turn the turbines

So do something.

I'm afraid that's easy to say.
We've been trying to do--

255
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,907
-[Brock] Ash!
-[both] Huh?

256
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,369

I hate to say it,
but if we don't act fast,

259
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,630
we'll be on the Muk menu.

260
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,466

to help us out.

266
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,192
That's right. If you can get rid
of the Grimer, the generator will work.

267
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,736
What do you expect us to do?
Pikachu is sick.

all of those Grimer at once.

you're the only one who can help.

00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,591
It's no good. There are too many of them.

00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,551

[gasping]

279
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,226
What are they?

280
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,978
Magnemite and their evolved form,
Magneton.

281
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,980
They're friends of our stalker.

00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,698

00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,217
-Yeah!
-Yay!

285
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,301
The lights are on.

00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,470
The turbine's moving again.

00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,515
The Grimer have all cleared away
from the sea water intake valve.

288
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,559
Yes!

289
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
Hold on. There's still one left.

290
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,478
Muk!

291
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,356
[Ash] An adult Muk and its child.

293
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,987
Pikachu!

294
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,866
Oh, man, that's some pretty strong sludge.

295
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,785
Magnemite.

296
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,706
Muk!

297
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,874
Chu!

298
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,129
Muk!

00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,014
All right! Poké Ball, go!

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,115

-Hmm? What's wrong?

303
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,747
[both groaning]

304
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
The smell comes through the Poké Ball!

[all laughing]

306
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,012
That's the bad news.

307
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,932
But the good news
is Pikachu's 100% better.

308
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,560
That's right. Pikachu was sick
until just a little while ago.

309
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,480
Ah, if an electric mouse
builds up too much electricity,

310
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:07,443
its body becomes magnetized
nd it seems like it has a cold.

311
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,611
Pikachu.

312
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,366
Well, we all sure owe a big thank you
to Magnemite here, don't we?

313
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,076
[whirring]

314
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,912
Pi! Pikachu!

315
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,373
Pi? Pika?

316
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:25,002
Hey, until just a minute ago,
that Magnemite was obsessed with Pikachu.

317
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,339
What's going on?
Now it's completely ignoring Pikachu.

318
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,009
Maybe Magnemite fall in and out of love
just like humans do.

319
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,055
Hmm. Could Magnemite have fallen in love
at first sight

320
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,808
because Pikachu's body was magnetized?

321
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,393
That must be the reason.

322
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,812
Animals are attracted to other animals
by scent,

323
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,857
so Magnemite are attracted
to other Pokémon by their magnetic force.

324
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,694
Because Pikachu had built up
so much magnetic force,

325
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,946
it must have been very attractive
to that Magnemite.

326
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,197
-Oh.
-I get it.

327
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,034
After Pikachu ran out of electricity,
it was no longer magnetized,

328
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,329
that's why Magnemite isn't interested
in Pikachu anymore.

329
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,292
It's a good thing, huh, Pikachu?
It won't follow you around anymore.

330
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,751
Chu!

331
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,796
-[all laughing]
-Yeah.

332
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,716
[Meowth] We got them now.

333
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,723
Now the fun begins
with our new secret weapon.

334
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,516
Tell them, James.

335
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,727
Now that Pikachu is magnetized,

336
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,564
our plan is to take
this high-powered electromagnet and...

337
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,066
[both] Finally capture Pikachu!

338
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,901
Hey, who are you talking to?

339
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,153
Let's just catch Pikachu.

340
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,780
Why don't you keep your snide remarks
to yourself?

341
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,740
That's right.

342
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,868
[whirring]

343
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,119
[metallic slamming]

344
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,497
-That sounds strange.
-Certainly does.

345
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,582
Yeah.

346
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,044
[all whimpering]

347
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:57,386
[all] Team Rocket's splashing off again!

348
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,433
All those Grimer here just prove
that the ocean's totally polluted.

349
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,769
You guys got to clean up the sea
around here.

350
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,356
-I know you can do it.
-You're right, Misty.

351
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,485
We'll do everything we can to make sure
that the ocean is really clean again.

352
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,154
If you clean up the air and the water,

353
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,740
you may just bring this place
back to life.

354
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,533
Thanks, Ash.

355
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,663
You worked so hard to make sure
all these Pokémon survived,

356
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,999
you've inspired me
to become a better nurse.

357
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,919
We salute your fine work.

358
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,172
Oh, please, ladies.
That's very nice of you.

359
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,383
Anyway, try to make your city clean.

360
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,094
We will and please come back and visit us.

361
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,512
Bye.

[laughs] It's been quite a while
since Ash sent me a new Pokémon.

366
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,158
I wonder what he's captured this time?

367
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,580
Ugh! What is this smell?

368
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,293
-M-m-m-muk!
