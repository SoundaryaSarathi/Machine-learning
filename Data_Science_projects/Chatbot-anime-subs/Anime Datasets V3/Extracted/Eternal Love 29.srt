<i>[Episode 29]</i>

3
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,159
Father!

4
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,680
Where were you?
Why didn't you bring Jia Yun with you?

5
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,000
You always talk about how Mother
often would get lost in the woods.

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,759
I thought it sounded like a mystery.

7
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,919
I went today in secret and, of course,
I lost my way as well.

8
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Father, I also ran into a snake monster
and was nearly harmed.

9
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,960
Luckily, this sister saved me.

10
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Don't run off by yourself again.

11
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,319
Thank you, Miss, for saving him.

12
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,199
It is nothing. Sir, you are...

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,960
My lord is the Celestial Tribe's
Crown Prince, Ye Hua.

14
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Crown Prince?
Miao Qing greets Your Highness.

15
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,120
No need to stand on ceremony.

16
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,039
My older brother is
the Water King of Eastern Sea.

17
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
So you are Princess Miao Qing.

18
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
You saved A-Li's life today.
I must return this kindness.

19
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,240
Do you have a wish, Princess?

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,080
I have always admired
your fighting prowess.

21
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,520
It is my great fortune
to have met you today.

22
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,520
If I had a wish

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,680
I'd only wish to stay by
Your Highness's side.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,520
Stay by my side?

25
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,120
You want to marry my father?

26
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
No, no.
Don't misunderstand, young prince.

27
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
I know I am merely
a princess of Eastern Sea.

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
I cannot enter Xiwu Palace.

29
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,039
I only want to stay at this hut

30
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,439
and when Your Highness brings
the young prince to visit

31
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,599
I could wash your clothes
and cook for you.

32
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,800
Princess Miao Qing.

33
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,280
With your status, it is inappropriate
for you to do such things.

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
Moreover, I am the one who is
supposed to fulfill a wish of yours.

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
It is unreasonable to make you serve us.

36
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,759
This is a wish of mine. I hope
Your Highness can grant me this wish.

37
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
Father.

38
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,839
Do you truly have such a wish?

39
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,639
Then we'll make it a period of ten days.

40
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,639
Once the ten days are over,
you will leave.

41
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
Your Highness.

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
What is it?

43
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,439
I will obey your command.

44
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,600
Father, I don't like that sister.
Don't let her stay.

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,439
She's clearly... clearly trying to
take Mother's position.

46
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,879
Enough.

47
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,879
Princess Miao Qing saved your life.

48
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,079
I promised I would fulfill her wish.
I will not break my word.

49
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,519
Father, you said Mother
would be back soon!

50
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,319
If you do this, Mother will be mad
when she gets back!

51
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Enough.

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
A-Li.

53
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,639
Your mother will not be coming back.

54
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,839
Why?

55
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,560
Didn't you say as long as
the Soul-gathering Lamp is kept lit

56
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Mother will return?

57
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,098
The Soul-gathering Lamp
has been extinguished.

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
She will not be coming back.

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Why would it be extinguished?
Did Tian Shu not look after it?

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,639
That's enough! Step out.

61
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,319
Father!

62
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,680
Step out!

63
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,360
My lord, please calm down. His Highness
is just eager to meet Her Highness.

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,319
You two catch up to him quickly.
Just let him cry alone for a bit.

65
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,399
- Yes.
- Yes.

66
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,639
Your Highness?

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

68
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
- Slow down!
- What's wrong with His Highness?

69
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,720
He had an argument with the Crown Prince.
It is best if you don't go inside.

70
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,319
My lord is furious right now,
and won't wish to be disturbed.

71
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,519
Your Highness!

72
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Dragonfly, Father must be
lying to me, isn't he?

73
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,959
I have waited for Mother for 300 years.
Mother will surely come back, right?

74
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,160
What is going on?

75
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,521
Why did His Highness say
the Soul-gathering Lamp has been put out?

76
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,439
It is because that Bai Feng Jiu
of Qing Qiu was too mischievous.

77
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,079
She transformed into Consort Su Jin

78
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,000
and stole the lamp,
putting out the light.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Think about it.
She is a princess of Qing Qiu.

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,120
She is Bai Qian's niece,
and is friends with Dong Hua Dijun.

81
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,240
Thus, His Highness couldn't
do anything about her

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
and could only let the matter rest.

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,641
His Highness and the young prince
have been waiting for 300 years.

84
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,079
So what of it?

85
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,759
Honestly, the lamp would only
create a person who looks similar.

86
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,720
It wouldn't really be her.

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,399
It being extinguished
is it's own blessing.

88
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,759
- Aunt.
- It's been returned?

89
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,920
I've returned it.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did the Celestial Tribe condemn you?

91
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,680
Third Prince plead for leniency
on my behalf.

92
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,759
That's good. Your time spent
in Heaven wasn't for nothing.

93
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,399
I'll be going to the Eastern Sea
in a few days.

94
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,279
On my way back, I'll be stopping by
Fourth Brother's manor.

95
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,920
Stay here in Qing Qiu.
Don't cause anymore trouble.

96
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
What are you going to
the Eastern Sea for?

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
The Water King of the Eastern Sea
has born a son.

98
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,680
I just received an invitation
to the banquet.

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
But you have never liked these sorts
of social occasions and banquets.

100
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,519
Why is Water King of
the Eastern Sea so lucky

101
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,639
to be graced by your attendance?

102
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,600
Normally, I don't like
these sorts of social occasions.

103
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,759
However, back in the day,
Mother had difficulty giving birth to me.

104
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,559
Luckily, the midwife of
the Water King's family helped

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,600
saving Mother a lot of suffering.

106
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,399
They're inviting me this time
for a happy occasion.

107
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,240
It doesn't feel right to forget
the kindness they showed.

108
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
Mi Gu.

109
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,080
You're back, Little Princess!

110
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,440
I thought you'd be imprisoned
in heaven for 30 to 50 years.

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,080
It was all your rotten idea.

112
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
What orders do you have, Aunt?

113
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,679
Go fetch the biggest luminous pearl
from the pond.

114
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,759
You're giving a gift again?

115
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,440
How did you know?

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,080
Who in Qing Qiu doesn't know
you like giving luminous pearls?

117
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,360
The rank of the immortal
and Aunt's mood on that day

118
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,120
will determine the size of
the luminous pearl being gifted.

119
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,480
Back when Fox King was
living in the Fox Den

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,720
there were plenty of
luminous pearls in the pond.

121
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,159
Now you can almost see to the bottom.

122
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,240
Enough talking. Go get it quickly.

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,759
All right, my prodigal Aunt.

124
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,658
The Water King of Eastern Sea is merely

125
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,568
preparing a banquet for
his one-month-old baby.

126
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:36,884
He's taken several days absence

127
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,601
from court meetings
in the Emperial Hall.

128
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:42,759
That's right. It's just a banquet.
Does he need to go to so much trouble?

129
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,559
Do you all not know?

130
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,879
The Aunt from Qing Qiu will be attending
the Eastern Sea's dinner banquet.

131
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,080
This Aunt is afflicted with
an eye ailment

132
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,960
and cannot stand bright lights.

133
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,759
However, the glazed coral tiles
of the Eastern Sea Palace

134
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,080
are excessively bright and dazzling.

135
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
That's why Water King of the Eastern Sea

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,960
has been busy searching everywhere
for water lily leaves

137
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,360
to weave together to cover up
anything overly bright.

138
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,039
Is the Aunt you are referring to

139
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,879
the Fox King Bai Zhi's daughter,
High Goddess Bai Qian?

140
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,679
That's correct.

141
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,840
In this world

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,240
this is the only high goddess who is
worthy of us to address as Aunt.

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,320
Yes.

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,679
To be able to catch a glimpse
of Aunt is truly not easy.

145
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,759
That is why I already have
a gift prepared.

146
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,039
Fresh peach blossom facial cream.

147
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,399
It would surely be the utmost honor
to gain Aunt's favor.

148
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes.

149
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,799
Isn't she the one who has an engagement
with the Crown Prince?

150
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,679
Heavenly Lord personally agreed to
this engagement 300 years ago.

151
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,679
I thought I would be able to attend
the Crown Prince's wedding banquet.

152
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,480
However, in these 300 years

153
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,240
there has not been any word
of the two tying the knot.

154
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,759
That's right.

155
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,519
His Highness has a son

156
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,159
but the position of his main wife
has remained vacant.

157
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,279
Bai Qian has remained in the valley
of Qing Qiu ever since she was born.

158
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,360
Nobody's invitation has been able to
successfully invite her out.

159
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,559
Those two have never even met.

160
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,960
Yes.

161
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,080
The two have yet to be married,
but they are in no hurry.

162
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,279
It is quite a wonder.

163
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,120
That's...

164
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
It is indeed strange.

165
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,759
However, the Water King of Eastern Sea
is quite fortunate.

166
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,879
Aunt hasn't left Qing Qiu
in tens of millennia.

167
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,360
Yet, he has managed to invite her.

168
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,679
It is such an honor.

169
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,600
It is quite an honor.

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
However, Water King of Eastern Sea
has been very troubled lately.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,639
He never expected Aunt
would be attending the banquet.

172
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,399
He had even invited
Water King of North Sea.

173
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,039
Yesterday, the Crown Prince brought
his son to visit the Far East

174
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,000
and will be attending
the banquet along the way.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,720
When the time comes, the three of them
will run into each other at the banquet.

176
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,039
Water King of Eastern Sea
is in a panic now.

177
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,720
Who knows what mayhem
may ensue at the banquet.

178
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,480
Who is this Aunt from Qing Qiu?

179
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,120
Does she have an existing feud with
Lord Ye Hua and Water King of North Sea?

180
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,840
You are young.
You might not know of this.

181
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,240
Before the great war between
Celestial Tribe and Ghost Tribe

182
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Aunt once had a marriage arrangement
with Heavenly Lord's second prince.

183
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,000
It was originally
a well-matched engagement.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,519
But somehow, Sang Ji fell in love
with Aunt's maid

185
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,960
and he was determined to
call off the engagement.

186
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,519
Water King of North Sea
wanted to marry Aunt's maid

187
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,960
even if it meant offending
Fox King Bai Zhi?

188
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,480
How good-looking is that maid?

189
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
I have seen that lady.

190
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,360
The second prince was
holding her by the arm

191
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,480
and knelt in front of the Heavenly Lord

192
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,759
and asked to marry her.

193
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,320
She is indeed a rare beauty.

194
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,840
However, compared to the lady
in Fox King Bai Zhi's family

195
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,399
her beauty is not even close.

196
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,559
I have never seen the lady

197
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
but I've heard Aunt has
a likeness to her mother.

198
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,279
No, even more beautiful than her mother.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
I have actually had the good fortune
to catch a glimpse of Aunt.

200
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,759
At the time, I was just a young boy
following under Heavenly Lord.

201
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,840
I accompanied Heavenly Empress to
Zhe Yan's land to view peach blossoms.

202
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,480
I happened to see Aunt

203
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,440
dancing lightly and gracefully
atop the peach tree branches.

204
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,639
Because I was far away

205
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,679
I only saw the swath of a red dress
among the vivid peach blossoms.

206
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,639
That view was exceptionally alluring.
Exceptionally beautiful!

207
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,039
Even such a beautiful woman
can be rejected.

208
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,240
Heaven's will sure is
difficult to predict.

209
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,799
Perhaps it is precisely because of this

211
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,104
that Aunt is unwilling to
step out of Qing Qiu.

212
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,000
Heaven's will is hard to fathom.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
- Yes.
- That is so.

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,200
You scared me.

215
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,000
You just love to stir up trouble.
You are everywhere.

216
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,600
It's a good thing I didn't marry you.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,440
Even if you wanted to marry me,
I wouldn't wed you!

218
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,799
A-Li.

219
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,360
I received an invitation
from Water King of Eastern Sea.

220
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,320
Do you want to visit the Eastern Sea?

221
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,799
No.

222
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,200
Then I'll go by myself.

223
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Are you going to leave me here alone?

224
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,120
This is your choice.

225
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,960
Then I'll just go.

226
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,480
Your Highness, today is the tenth day.

227
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,139
You can leave now.

228
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
Isn't Your Highness heading to
my brother's Eastern Sea today?

229
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,159
- I can lead the way--
- No need.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,159
I shall take my leave.

231
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,399
Sit properly.

232
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,159
Who are you?

233
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
How dare you trespass into Qing Qiu?

234
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,480
Young man, I am Star Lord Si Ming.

235
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,519
I came to visit the young princess
of Qing Qiu, Bai Feng Jiu.

236
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,399
- Si Ming?
- Yes.

237
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,279
Si Ming!

238
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,047
I haven't been able to sleep,
waiting for you. You're finally here!

239
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,707
- Your Highness.
- Come, let's go inside.

240
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:13,879
Your Highness! Your Highness!

241
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,171
The valley contains many of
Aunt's precious possessions.

242
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:18,919
Outsiders must not be allowed inside.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,039
Especially those of Celestial Tribe.

244
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,720
I am very sorry, Star Lord Si Ming.

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,452
The Fox Den does indeed have a rule
that outsiders are not allowed.

246
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,480
It's no matter.

247
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,679
Since I came to pick you up
so you can repay your debt

248
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,120
it doesn't matter if I go in or not.

249
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,120
But will Your Highness need to prepare?
This may take two months of your time.

250
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,639
- Two months?
- Yes.

251
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
Mi Gu.

252
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,680
Is there any way I can avoid
going to the banquet at the Eastern Sea?

253
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,319
You can't.
A debt must be repaid.

254
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,880
A favor must of course be
returned with a favor.

255
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,079
No matter how capable you are,
the debt still needs to be repaid.

256
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,440
You're acting weird today.
Who has provoked you?

257
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,839
It's nothing.

258
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,839
I'm afraid Aunt won't let me leave
if she learns of this.

259
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,920
So can you tell Aunt only after
I have been gone for a few days?

260
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
Oh, yes.

261
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,759
Where is my luminous pearl?

262
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,039
Right! The luminous pearl.

263
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,480
Aunt, this is the largest pearl
in the pond.

264
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,240
By the way, Mi Gu,
I'd like something of yours.

265
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,599
What is it?

266
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,279
I want a branch from your tree.

267
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,079
It's a long journey to the Eastern Sea.

268
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,319
If I were to lose my way,
I could rely on it to to find my way.

269
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,559
Yes, my tree branch can give directions.

270
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,839
It is perfect for a high goddess
like Aunt who likes to get lost.

271
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,359
You're acting very odd today.

272
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,240
No, I'm odd every day.

273
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,319
Aunt, are you setting out
for the Eastern Sea now?

274
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
By the way, on my way back

275
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,263
I'll be stopping by to see
Fourth Brother in the north.

276
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,319
Keep watch of the Fox Den
with Feng Jiu while I'm away.

277
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,079
Don't get into arguments.

278
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,920
Fourth Uncle has indeed been
in the north lately.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,145
He said the bird, Bi Fang,
was angry and returned there

280
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:03,079
so he has gone looking for Bi Fang.

281
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,559
You believe that?

282
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,599
Every time Fourth Brother is angry
at Zhe Yan, he uses that excuse.

283
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,240
In these 300 years since I've woken up

284
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,628
Bi Fang must have ran off
over a dozen times already.

285
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,960
Aunt is so wise.

286
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,839
When will the Little Princess
finish repaying her debt?

287
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,519
Long live Your Majesty.

288
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,680
Rise.

289
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,759
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,559
Is that... Dijun?

291
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
It is Dijun.

292
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,880
Did Dijun do something wrong
and offend Heavenly Lord

293
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
to be sent down to the mortal realm?

294
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,440
How could that be possible?

295
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
He himself wanted to come
to experience trials.

296
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Experience trials?

297
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,599
Dijun will be experiencing trials
in the mortal realm for 60 years.

298
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,480
I thought if Your Highness
wants to repay a debt

299
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,079
this would be the best time to do so.

300
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
How will I do it?

301
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,480
I've figured it out for you already.

302
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,920
Why did you bring me inside the palace?

303
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,240
Who is that?

304
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,559
Dijun is an emperor in the mortal realm.

305
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,240
I will arrange for you
to be in the palace.

306
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,880
That is who you will be
to repay your debt.

307
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,039
This Honored Lady will
fall into this pond soon

308
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,680
catch a cold, and suffer a long illness.

309
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,279
No medicine will be of any use,
and this beauty shall pass away.

310
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,839
You shall take advantage of this
to continue writing her story.

311
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,563
Henceforth, you shall be
Honored Lady Chen in the mortal realm.

312
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,759
How pitiful.

313
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,480
It's not pitiful.

314
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,920
Ever since she entered the palace
and saw the emperor twice

315
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,039
she hasn't had the chance
to sleep with him again.

316
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,200
To be living such a life in the palace

317
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,519
the earlier she leaves,
the earlier she is set free.

318
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,839
If I become Honored Lady Chen,
how should I repay my debt?

319
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,839
Use your discretion.

320
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,200
Quick! Now is the moment! Hurry!

321
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,039
Help! Help!

322
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,319
Quick, help her out!

323
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,079
Pull her up!

324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
They're all charlatans.

325
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,799
They take a quick look, prescribe
some medicine, and then brush us off.

326
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,680
Are they taking advantage of us
because our lady is not favored?

327
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,559
Let it go. Do not mind them.

328
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,680
Step out. I'm tired now.

329
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,799
Yes.

330
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,640
Your Highness.

331
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,519
You're here.

332
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,039
I came to see if you've adapted
to the palace's rules.

333
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,880
I've spent time in Taichen Palace.
It is about the same here.

334
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
Besides, I constantly
cough up blood every day

335
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,680
according to the Book of Destiny

336
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,720
so I don't have to interact
with anyone either.

337
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,640
Come spring, this illness will
eventually get better.

338
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,759
However, this plumed cockscomb on
your forehead is a bit troublesome.

339
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,480
Is it?

340
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,079
My aunt said this was bestowed by heaven
and is very beautiful.

341
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,240
Yes, it is beautiful.

342
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,519
However, Honored Lady Chen did not
have a birthmark on her forehead.

343
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,880
Having such a flower appear
out of thin air may attract suspicion.

344
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,920
Will it?

345
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,680
When will His Majesty see me?

346
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,079
The physician says Your Ladyship's health
has nearly fully recovered.

347
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,599
I have also reported this.

348
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,799
Don't worry, Your Ladyship.

349
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,920
When His Majesty sees
Your Ladyship's nameplate

350
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,503
he will remember you.

351
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
Who is that?

352
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,400
That seems to be Honored Lady Chen.

353
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,079
Honored Lady Chen?

354
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,440
That's right, it is Honored Lady Chen.

355
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,053
I heard she fell into the water
in the twelfth month of the year

356
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:18,599
and has been sick since.

357
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,759
She has just now become
well enough to get out of bed.

358
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,759
Is it the Honored Lady Chen who

359
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,599
has been visited by His Majesty
only twice after entering the palace?

360
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,960
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,680
Greetings, Empress and Your Highnesses.

362
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,440
- Greetings, Empress.
- Rise.

363
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,759
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

364
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,279
What is that makeup on your forehead?
It is so dreadful.

365
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,599
Wash it off quickly.

366
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,680
I was born with it.

367
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,480
Why don't I remember you having
such a thing on your forehead?

368
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Your Highness.

369
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,519
After my lady recovered from her illness

370
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,039
this plumed cockscomb flower
appeared on her forehead.

371
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,200
The physician does not know
how it came to be either.

372
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
He said... he said it is a good thing.

373
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,359
What is good about a birthmark
that is so unpleasant to the eyes?

374
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,799
It makes me uncomfortable
just looking at it.

375
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,279
Your Highness, in my opinion,
it is a demonic flower.

376
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,039
How could it possibly be
a demonic flower?

377
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,400
This is clearly my--

378
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,160
Clearly what?

379
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,319
It is clearly a mark that

380
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,624
likens my recovery from
a serious illness to a rebirth.

381
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,279
Your Highness, listen to what she says.
It is absolutely hilarious.

382
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,400
Who hasn't fallen ill before
in the palace?

383
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,880
But only hers is like a rebirth,
and she gains a mark.

384
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,000
Enough.

385
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,839
The appearance of this thing on
your forehead is much too strange.

386
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,319
Your nameplate will be removed from
selection for His Majesty's night visit

387
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,599
in case this is something evil
that will cause harm to His Majesty.

388
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,359
Yes.

389
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,759
That was clearly just an excuse so that

390
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,200
Your Ladyship won't get a chance
to sleep with His Majesty.

391
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,720
<i>I can't even see Dijun.
How will I repay him?</i>

392
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,599
<i>Since he won't be coming
to sleep in my chambers</i>

393
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>then a chance encounter should work.</i>

394
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
<i>In Fourth Brother's storybooks</i>

395
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,319
<i>doesn't the emperor always find
his beloved by a chance encounter?</i>

396
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,160
<i>The lower in status,
the more he likes her.</i>

397
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,480
Your Ladyship, what are you
staring at me for?

398
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,240
Yu Dang, prepare for me a set of
the same maid outfit you are wearing.

399
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,500
Yes.

400
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,519
<i>Dijun!</i>

401
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,720
<i>I wonder what Dijun's temperament
is like in the mortal realm.</i>

402
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,599
<i>Would he be easy to get along with?</i>

403
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,359
<i>What should be the first thing
I say to him for him to remember me?</i>

404
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,559
<i>I must not be like
how I was in the Celestial Palace.</i>

405
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,079
<i>Yes, I must be dignified.</i>

406
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,000
<i>I must have the air and demeanor
of a princess of Qing Qiu.</i>

407
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,440
Your Majesty.

408
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,359
- Your Majesty.
- Empress.

409
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,960
Your Majesty is heading to...

410
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,440
To visit Noble Consort.

411
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,079
Then I shall not delay Your Majesty.

412
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,759
<i>He's leaving just like that?</i>

413
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,880
Your Highness.

414
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,400
Honored Lady Chen.

415
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,279
What are you doing dressed as a maid?

416
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,960
Has Your Ladyship seen His Majesty?

417
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,196
It doesn't matter if you didn't see him.

418
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,880
I have found out His Majesty's itinerary
over the next few days.

419
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,920
We can follow after His Majesty.
You will eventually see him.

420
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,160
Empress said I am not to step foot
out of Handan Quarters.

421
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,119
I won't be able to see His Majesty.

422
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,599
You're asking me for peaches?

423
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,928
Do you think the peaches of
my Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods

424
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,000
can be had by anyone in the world?

425
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,640
You are right, High God.

426
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,759
Because of my wife's pregnancy cravings,
she is pestering me all day for peaches.

427
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,200
In this season, peach blossoms
are blooming everywhere

428
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,799
but as for peaches

429
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,640
I'm afraid that in heaven or on earth,
they can only be found here.

430
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,359
So may I dare ask that you grant me
a few peaches of immortality?

431
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,799
Not much. Just a few will do.

432
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,799
Since you have dared to ask

433
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,119
I mustn't be too difficult on you,
former second prince of Celestial Tribe.

434
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,000
After all, I am your elder.

435
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
Follow me.

436
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,920
Thank you, High God.

437
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,119
Do not thank me.

438
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,119
If you must, then thank
your own identity.

439
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,160
I am giving you a few peaches
out of respect to your father.

440
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,680
In the span of one day,
both Aunt and Little Princess have left.

441
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,440
The Fox Den that has been
lively for 300 years

442
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,920
has become cold and cheerless again.

443
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,640
It is so cold and cheerless.

444
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,240
She still won't give up.

445
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,680
My lady of the North Sea
seeks an audience with Aunt.

446
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,680
You come a dozen times a year.
Aren't you tired?

447
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,599
What? You won't even come out
of your palanquin this time?

448
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,519
Why bother putting on a show?

449
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,880
My lady is with child.
It is not easy for her to move around.

450
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,200
Wait!

451
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,359
Leave, leave! She won't see you.
I'm going to get back to my nuts.

452
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,200
Your Highness, although
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu is

453
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
a high goddess revered around the world

454
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,920
our North Sea is not
any less respectable.

455
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,480
Why must you see her?

456
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,960
I committed a wrong 300 years ago.

457
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,599
It has troubled me all this time.

458
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,759
Only by settling this matter
can I live my days in peace.

459
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,240
I don't understand.

460
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
Your Highness, we have a banquet
to attend in the Eastern Sea.

461
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
Let's hurry back.

462
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,599
I'll come again after the banquet.

463
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,920
Bai Qian, come sit.

464
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,519
Bai Qian.

465
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,920
A few days ago, Water King
of North Sea and his wife

466
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,200
came to admire my peach blossoms.

467
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,680
Because of pregnancy cravings, his wife
was pestering him every day for peaches.

468
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,359
You know that in this season

469
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,200
nowhere else in the world
can peaches be found except here.

470
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
Since he so shamelessly asked me for some

471
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,079
I found it difficult to refuse.

472
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,640
This peach tree woods belongs to you.
The peaches are yours as well.

473
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,000
There's no need to explain to me.

474
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,359
Look at you. Your face is already green.

475
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,920
It's just a few contraceptive peaches.

476
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,759
You gave them contraceptive peaches?

477
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,440
What's the matter?

478
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,599
You feel ashamed that I gave
the sweet couple contraceptive peaches?

479
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,359
Don't worry.

480
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,920
The contraceptive peaches
will only make their family

481
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,920
temporarily unable to conceive
a fifth child for a few dozen millennia.

482
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,240
It won't cost them much happiness,
and won't cost me too much shame.

483
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,440
Actually, whether they have
a fifth baby has nothing to do with me.

484
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,720
Then what are you still
so bothered about them for?

485
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,759
What I'm bothered by is if Sang Ji
hadn't canceled the engagement

486
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:47,799
then the consequent troublesome
engagement wouldn't have happened.

487
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:52,920
While I was unaware, you and Father
agreed on this engagement for me.

488
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,839
Now it has been 300 years.
It's becoming increasingly awkward.

489
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,319
Yes, the Heavenly Lord's family
loves to say vain words.

490
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,920
They haven't even come to see me and
your father to discuss your wedding date.

491
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,199
Ye Hua has now married Consort Su Jin
who is greatly favored by Heavenly Lord

492
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,920
and also has an imperial great-grandson.

493
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,679
He has even less intention of
attending to this engagement with you.

494
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,719
Continuing to delay like this
isn't a good option.

495
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,119
With Heavenly Lord having put
this engagement to the side

496
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,360
even if someone in this world
would like to marry you

497
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,960
he wouldn't dare commit
an offense against the Celestial Tribe.

498
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,280
Fortunately, I am in no hurry
to be married.

499
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
You can't say that.

500
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,159
It has been delayed for so long.

501
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,079
Perhaps you might become
the laughingstock of the world again.

502
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,159
This won't do.

503
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,159
I'll have to discuss this with
your parents one day.

504
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,760
Once I think that according to seniority,
he should address me as Aunt

505
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,559
and according to age,
he should address me as his senior

506
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,840
I just can't bring myself to be
so cruel as to fulfill this engagement.

507
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,679
Forget it. Let's not talk about this
shameful mess with the Celestial Tribe.

508
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,000
The Eastern Sea's banquet
starts tomorrow.

509
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,559
Sleep here tonight before
leaving for the sea tomorrow.

510
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,719
That was what I was thinking.

511
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,559
Your Fourth Brother had me make
two special jars of wine for him.

512
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,400
They're buried under
the tree by Jade Lake.

513
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,199
Dig them out before you leave
and deliver them to your Fourth Brother.

514
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,840
Remember, do not spill them
and do not drink them on the sly.

515
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,119
What wine is it that I am
not allowed to drink? How stingy.

516
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,480
The little wine you have here isn't
enough to fill up my small jade flask.

517
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,119
You really can't drink that wine.

518
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,840
If you want to drink some, you can
go to my Chunyang Cave tomorrow

519
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,760
and take as much as you can.

520
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,880
All right, I'll do as
you command, High God.

521
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,920
<i>This small cottage has suffered
through all the elements</i>

522
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,519
<i>but it still remains standing strong</i>

523
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,320
<i>and is so clean and tidy.</i>

524
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
<i>Zhe Yan sure has devoted
his attention to it.</i>

525
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,639
<i>This would be perfect for digging up
those two peach blossom wines to drink.</i>

526
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,800
This peach blossom wine
is for drinking on the sly.

527
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,880
The wine in the wine cellar of
your Chunyang Cave is for the taking.

528
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,639
Can't miss out on either.

529
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,159
Medical expertise?
Brewing wine is Zhe Yan's true expertise.

530
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,639
Your Highness.

531
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,920
Zhe Yan's Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods
is close by the Eastern Sea.

532
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,599
It is just ashore.

533
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,360
Father.

534
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Is Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods
the residence of the mysterious high god

535
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,519
who has withdrawn from the three realms,
is uninvolved in worldly affairs

536
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,519
and has elegant tastes?

537
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,039
According to age, you should be
calling him your senior.

538
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,719
Are we going to visit an ancestor?

539
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,719
It's time for you to go to sleep.

540
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,592
Then return soon, Father.

541
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:12,199
If you gain the habit of not returning
to your chambers at night

542
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,440
Mother will be heartbroken.

543
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,440
A-Li, didn't I already tell you

544
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,519
- Mother won't be--
- I understand.

545
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,559
I will obey you on everything
except for this, Father.

546
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:31,800
I have a feeling Mother will return.

547
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,199
Take the young prince to his bed.

548
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

549
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,000
Go see if the water lily leaves
have all been arranged.

550
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,639
Aunt's eyes are weak. Do not allow
any glaring lights to shine through.

551
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,239
-Yes.
-Yes.

552
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,079
Sister.

553
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
What are you doing standing here?

554
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,119
I wanted to see Crown Prince.

555
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,559
Crown Prince? You know him?

556
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,599
A few days ago, I happened to save
the imperial great-grandson

557
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,840
and by chance, I met the Crown Prince.

558
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,400
Later on, I made a request
using this favor

559
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,159
and served His Highness
for ten days at his hut.

560
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,960
What an opportune incident.

561
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,840
Sister.

562
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,599
Could it be that
you like the Crown Prince?

563
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,440
Think about this carefully.

564
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,519
Xiwu Palace is not a place
normal people can stay in.

565
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,599
His main wife will be
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

566
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,039
His side consort, Su Jin

567
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,864
used to be a greatly favored
imperial consort of the Heavenly Lord.

568
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:17,440
With those two present, would there be
any place for you in Xiwu Palace?

569
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,519
The Crown Prince will be acceding
Heavenly Lord's position in the future.

570
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,360
How could he possibly have
only two women in his palace?

571
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,760
Besides, I just want to be able to
stay by the Crown Prince's side.

572
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,920
I'd be content just to be a maid.

573
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,559
Have you really made your mind?

574
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:38,079
I heard that a couple hundred years ago
during the Mermaid Clan's rebellion

575
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,800
Princess Lu Xiu of Chang Sea fell in love
at first sight with the Crown Prince.

576
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,360
However, she did not even get
a chance to get close to him.

577
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Your looks are superior to Lu Xiu's.

578
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,079
Now you have even saved
the imperial great-grandson's life.

579
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,079
You will have an easier time
than she did.

580
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,039
Let me think about this.

581
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,159
I have an idea.

582
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,400
What is it?

583
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,760
After you perform a dance
during the banquet tomorrow

584
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,840
I will beseech the Crown Prince
to meet with you.

585
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,320
Tell him that I, your brother

586
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,719
am forcing you to marry
the second prince of the West Sea.

587
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:21,000
Make the second prince of
the West Sea sound like a hedonistic son

588
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,800
and tearfully lament to the Crown Prince.

589
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,880
You've saved the
imperial great-grandson's life.

590
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,360
I reckon the Crown Prince wouldn't stand
to see you coerced into marriage.

591
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,599
Be a maid first, and then later think
of a way to make him fall for you.

592
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,559
This is a gift.
Fresh peach blossom facial cream.

593
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,519
If you can capture
everybody's attention tomorrow

594
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,239
perhaps you will be able to succeed
and stay by the Crown Prince's side.

595
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,960
Thank you, Brother.

596
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,840
