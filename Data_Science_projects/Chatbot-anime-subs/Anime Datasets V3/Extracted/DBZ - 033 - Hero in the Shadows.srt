00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,081
Don't you die, Goku.

2
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,343
Father...

3
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:43,862
That guy's intense.
It's no use. This is all over.

4
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:50,709
It's not like I'm
desertin' ya, though.

5
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:53,712
There's just nothin' I can do.

6
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,146
Don't go holdin' it
against me, 'kay?

7
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:01,546
Suffer good and long,
and then die!

8
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,825
It's close!
We're almost there!

9
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,742
Even though it's the evening, because of
that strange light, it's as bright as this.

10
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:26,006
W- what the hell is that thing?

11
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,510
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>, o- over there!

12
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:44,362
Get down, Gohan!
Get down, and hide!

13
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:47,032
W- what is that?

14
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,367
Hurry up, you stupid twit!

15
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,801
Ah, it's those guys.

16
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:56,966
<i>lt can't be... He's turned</i>
<i>into a Great Ape!</i>

17
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:04,478
Feels like most of your bones
just broke, huh? Does it hurt?

18
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:08,053
Goku is getting
done in! This is bad!

19
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,054
This way!

20
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,146
Right!

21
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,727
Hey!

22
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,062
Yajirobe!

23
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:21,733
Hey, who d'ya think that monster is?
It's the Saiyan, I tell ya, the Saiyan!

24
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,068
I know.

25
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,738
There's no way you can stand up
to that monster, you know! Give it up!

26
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:31,076
I know that, too. But if we cut off
his tail, he'll return to normal.

27
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,744
His tail?

28
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,346
His tail?

29
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:35,347
Listen up.

30
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:39,351
Gohan and Yajirobe, you guys circle around
in front of him, and get his attention.

31
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,684
I'll find an opportunity
to cut off his tail from the back!

32
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:47,692
Hurry! Goku is going to die!

33
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,125
R- right.

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,466
Y- ya gotta be kiddin' me.

35
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,703
Get his attention, did'ja say?
You guys don't even know!

36
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:02,969
Even after he's back to normal,
he's still gonna have unbelievable strength!

37
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:08,141
<i>Father, don't die!</i>

38
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:18,153
<i>Goku's Ki is almost completely gone!</i>
<i>Dammit, he's moments from death!</i>

39
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,500
Eh, do whatever you wanna.

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,347
There's something out there.

41
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,008
Where is it?

42
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,790
Over here!

43
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,458
L- let my father go!

44
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:08,039
This is a surprise.
If it isn't Kakarrot's kid.

45
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,136
I get it. So you've come here just to
see your father meet his end, have you?

46
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,982
You've got good timing.
He was just about to die.

47
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:21,145
I was right about to finish him off.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,153
<i>Kienzan!!</i>

49
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,274
Damn it all...

50
00:04:57,021 --> 00:05:04,028
Watch very closely. I'm going to
crush him until there's nothing left.

51
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,792
<i>Kuririn-san, hurry!</i>

52
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,466
Unfortunately, it appears he has
already lost consciousness.

53
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,651
I- i- it can't be!

54
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:43,668
Did you think I wouldn't notice
that there was another one of you?

55
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:48,006
You guys seem to share some worthless
attachment for each other, after all.

56
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,775
There's no way this kid would just
come strolling back by himself,

57
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,679
so I was just waiting
to see what would happen.

58
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:59,776
Apparently, you know about
our tails. Too bad for you.

59
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,959
Just you wait. Once I've taken care
of Kakarrot, it will be your turn next.

60
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,029
<i>D</i>- <i>damn! What kind</i>
<i>of beast is this?</i>

61
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,931
<i>Even after turning into a monster,</i>

62
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,033
<i>he still has his presence of mind</i>
<i>and his guard is flawless.</i>

63
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:18,469
<i>l'm sorry, Goku. I don't</i>
<i>want to just let you die,</i>

64
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,803
<i>but this guy's Ki is so incredible,</i>
<i>l can't even get close to him.</i>

65
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:31,141
You guys were mistaken
to have challenged me to battle!

66
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,487
Dammit! If we don't do something...

67
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,997
Stop...

68
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:51,663
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

69
00:06:56,674 --> 00:07:00,667
So, you want to die
ahead of your father, do you?

70
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,683
T- this is bad!

71
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,193
What's the matter?
Too scared to move?

72
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:51,152
Dammit! I didn't know
there was yet another one!

73
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,992
My tail!

74
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,873
H- he did it!

75
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:46,818
I got nothin' to do with this...

76
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,652
I- I got nothin' to do
with this from here on...

77
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:17,507
I- it's gone!
His tail is gone!

78
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:36,200
You did it, Yajirobe!
He returned to his original form!

79
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,027
<i>lt's not my problem... Whatever</i>
<i>happens now, it's not my problem...</i>

80
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,477
W- why, you!

81
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,822
You want to die so badly
that you've made me angry!?

82
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,061
W- what's going on?
Why did that monster-?

83
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,733
In that case, as you wish,
I will kill you, you miserable scum!

84
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,667
<i>There, ya see?</i>

85
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,512
Gohan! Get out of there!

86
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,855
I'll start with you.

87
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:52,308
What's the matter? Wasn't a Super
Saiyan supposed to be strong?

88
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:59,808
Show me your true power.

89
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,730
Maybe the order
has been changed.

90
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,665
There, you see?
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

91
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:23,840
Come on, get up! Amuse me
a little while longer.

92
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,354
Hey, what's wrong?
Is that the best you can do?

93
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,356
I guess the son of scum...

94
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:40,688
...is scum, as well.

95
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:52,632
You may be scum, but it looks
like your blood is red, at least.

96
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,376
How awful!

97
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:01,311
How can he be
so cruel to a child!?

98
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,719
She's strangely tranquil, huh?

99
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,984
I'm sure she must have
run out of tears.

100
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:16,060
She hasn't fainted,
has she? Hey!

101
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,728
Hey!

102
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:19,397
Ee-yow!

103
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:22,161
--Yow! Yow! Yow!
--Fight...

104
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,668
Fight.

105
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,744
Fight! Fight, Gohan! Fight!

106
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:40,513
Avenge your daddy's death!
Get up, Gohan! Fight, Gohan! Fight!

107
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:53,797
How about I at least let you die
next to your father? I'll be kind.

108
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:10,977
G- Gohan...

109
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:18,723
Oh? Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

110
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:21,392
Gohan, can you hear me?

111
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:28,399
Gohan, your daddy's whole body
is a mess. I can't move anymore.

112
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,006
Fight in my place. His power
should have dropped considerably.

113
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:42,013
I- I can't, Father!
He's too strong! I can't beat him!

114
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:47,351
All right, I'll do it this way-
I'll follow my order, and kill Kakarrot first.

115
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,121
Next will be Kakarrot's kid.

116
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,691
After that, I'll finish off
that bald bastard from earlier.

117
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:57,361
Finally, I'll kill the bastard
who cut off my precious tail!

118
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,829
<i>He remembered me, huh?</i>

119
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:05,036
You don't have to beat him...
Just keep him bottled up...

120
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:10,041
Your power should be even more
incredible than his... even more...

121
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,637
While you're doing that,
I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

122
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:20,051
I can't! I can't even
move anymore!

123
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,989
You stupid jackass! Do you want
everyone else's deaths to be in vain?

124
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,480
What did Piccolo teach you?

125
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,498
I'm counting on you, Gohan...

126
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,024
For left-behind scum, you're sure
giving me a lot of trouble!

127
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,958
G- Gohan!

128
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,630
What's the matter!? Eh!?

129
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,302
S- stop... that...

130
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,707
Die!

131
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,971
Stop... that!

132
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,712
What's the matter?
Die! Die!

133
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,381
Stop that!!

134
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,473
What!?

135
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,054
I'm going...

136
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,646
...to defeat you!

137
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,817
<i>You</i> are going to defeat <i>me</i>?

138
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,266
What the!?

139
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,612
Kuririn!

140
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:58,605
Kuririn, please!
Come here!

141
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,786
D- dammit...

142
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:12,029
Don't you mess around
with Vegeta-<i>sama</i>!

143
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,967
G- Goku, it's hopeless.
He's just too terrible.

144
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:21,372
Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

145
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:25,376
I'm going to give this
to you now, Kuririn...

146
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:29,142
The <i>Genki Dama</i> that I gathered
from all over the earth...

147
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:36,320
Eh? What did you say?
What are you going to give me?

148
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,992
A- a <i>Genki Dama</i>... <i>Ki</i> that I've
collected from everything on earth...

149
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:47,665
About half of it got away, but I think
it will still defeat him, the way he is now...

150
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,000
W- what?

151
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,005
Kuririn... take my hand...

152
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,007
I don't understand this at all.

153
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,840
Hurry! Gohan is going to die!

154
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,013
I just have to take your hand?

155
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,348
Please...

156
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:06,684
Like this?

157
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:09,353
Your bones are broken, aren't they?

158
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,186
That's okay... Don't let go...

159
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:18,017
I'm giving it to you now,
so take it...

160
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:45,820
W- w- what is this?

161
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:50,995
I- it's awesome... This is
a tremendous amount of <i>Ki</i>!

162
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:57,491
Turn your palm upward, and focus it...
You can make it into a ball...

163
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,004
You dirty brat!!

164
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,192
Hang in there...

165
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:26,026
Gohan ain't able to control
this kind of <i>Ki</i>...

166
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,694
I- it came out!
Is this-?

167
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:38,869
A <i>Genki Dama</i>...
You did it!

168
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,040
