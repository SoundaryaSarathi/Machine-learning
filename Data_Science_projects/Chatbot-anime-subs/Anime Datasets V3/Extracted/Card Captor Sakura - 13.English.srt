1
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:48,109
[Sakura and elephant compare strength]

2
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:54,223
Morning.

3
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,383
Good morning.

4
00:00:57,462 --> 00:01:00,295
Today’s lunch is extra special.

5
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:03,962
Sakura is going on a trip?

6
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:05,735
To the zoo she says.

7
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:07,867
Shall I help you?

8
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:09,101
No, I’m just about done.

9
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,166
Wait a second for breakfast.

10
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,908
Yeah

11
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,472
This is the Penguin park

12
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:20,111
inside Tomoeda central park

13
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,051
What’s this?

14
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:23,978
Good morning!

15
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,618
Oh, for you to come down alone,
it will rain today probably.

16
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:29,052
You’re wrong.

17
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,554
The lady in the weather report
said it would be clear.

18
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,325
Good morning, Sakura.

19
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:36,598
Is that mine?

20
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,993
I put in lots of your favorite things.

21
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:41,468
Yay!

22
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:42,971
Are you gathering at school?

23
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,237
Yeah, we are gathering at school
and going by bus from there.

24
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:48,969
If you are going through
the park be careful.

25
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:50,672
Why?

26
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:55,409
Eh… Eh…

27
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:05,461
I’m going!

28
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:09,997
That was surprising.

29
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,994
How could such a large emperor penguin

30
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:14,803
be flipped over?

31
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,133
Could it be a Clow Card?

32
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,775
I’ll ask Kero-chan when I get home.

33
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,775
How nice.

34
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:33,214
Sakura-chan!

35
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:34,517
Eh!

36
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:37,857
Yukito-san.

37
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:40,924
Good morning, you certainly are early.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,627
Umm… Good morning!

39
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,838
Umm, aren’t you with my brother?

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,766
Today I’m the board monitor.

41
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:53,007
Today really is a good day.

42
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:56,711
What?

43
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:08,989
The penguin shaped slide
which was destroyed.

44
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,888
The mysterious thing about this incident

45
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,427
was that nobody was near the slide between

46
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:15,895
the break of dawn and early morning.

47
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,560
There is a lot of people.

48
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:20,935
It must be something very strong,

49
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,997
to flip that upside down.

50
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:24,271
You’re right.

51
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,047
I don’t feel the aura of a Clow Card.

52
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:35,211
Sakura-chan.

53
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,615
Yes?

54
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,046
Since you’re carrying a pack,

55
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:39,783
does that mean you’re going on
a trip somewhere today?

56
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:40,949
Yes.

57
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,554
It seems pretty big.
What’s in there?

58
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,656
A notebook for taking observations,
and lunch.

59
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,224
Did your dad make it?

60
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:50,327
Yes.

61
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:54,162
Your dad really is a good cook.

62
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:03,379
A gift.

63
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,145
The weather is nice,

64
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,080
we are going on a trip,

65
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,790
and I met Yukito-san.

66
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:17,853
Today really is a good day!

67
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,055
Huh…

68
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,290
Eh?

69
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,797
Strange?

70
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,919
Well then go off

71
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,789
and observe the animal
assigned to your group.

72
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,256
Do you all know your groups?

73
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:50,626
Yes!

74
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:53,460
Well then, group leaders come
and take the camera.

75
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:54,455
Yes!

76
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,829
Turn in the report on Monday.

77
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,464
Cooperate and do your best.

78
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:05,738
Yes!

79
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:09,305
Have lunch whenever
your group feels like it

80
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,806
Be back here at two o’clock.

81
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:13,013
Yes!

82
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:14,245
Well then, dismissed.

83
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:20,782
Tomoyo-chan.

84
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:22,793
You take care of the pictures.

85
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:26,158
Tomoyo-chan is an expert on cameras.

86
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,627
Sure.

87
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,500
By the way, did you all see it on TV?

88
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,528
About the emperor penguin?

89
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:35,271
Yeah.

90
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:36,971
Yeah, I saw it.

91
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:40,408
I wonder how they pulled
over something so big?

92
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,010
I wonder if it was a ghost.

93
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,083
If it were a ghost

94
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,781
it would be a really strong ghost right?

95
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:51,681
Perhaps the ghost of a sumo wrestler?

96
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,386
It would be nice if it were a scary one.

97
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:55,855
Eh? Why?

98
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,057
I like scary things.

99
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,697
There is the elephant, let’s go.

100
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:05,731
She’s fast.

101
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:08,832
Sakura-chan can’t handle
scary stories well.

102
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,534
But they are so fun.

103
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:19,679
Ah, there it is.

104
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:21,782
Where?

105
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:24,251
Right there.

106
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,115
So this is a sloth?

107
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,193
It seems pretty cute.

108
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,561
I wonder if it is related to a monkey.

109
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,454
Yeah, it must be.

110
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,231
We are in charge of the sloth.

111
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,471
Let’s do our best to observe it.

112
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:42,668
Yeah!

113
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,160
I wonder
if the sloth is like it’s name implies

114
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,731
and doesn’t move around a lot.

115
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:12,902
That’s not true at all, Li-kun.

116
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:17,434
A sloth is actually really swift.

117
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,043
It is always lazing about

118
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,843
like it doesn’t feel like moving…

119
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,944
but if it gets in the mood
a sloth is incredible.

120
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,676
Its speed

121
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,176
has been confirmed

122
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:30,350
at over a hundred kilometers per hour.

123
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,721
Incredible.

124
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,953
There it is Yamazaki’s sure
kill technique.

125
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,464
Yamazaki will lie for fun
at the slightest chance.

126
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,260
His lies are also ones that you would
normally know are lies right away.

127
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,571
Sometimes there are people
who are fooled though.

128
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:52,376
I wonder if we can see a sloth
that feels up to moving.

129
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:53,936
I would be nice if we did.

130
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:58,274
All right.

131
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:05,419
How big!

132
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:08,953
Hey,

133
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:13,593
they say these elephants
can do various tricks.

134
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,623
They say that they can understand
some human speech.

135
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:19,166
I have seen them on TV.

136
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:21,369
I saw them too.

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,698
They can do thinks like stand
on two legs when told to.

138
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:29,173
Yeah, it’s a really strong elephant

139
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,239
and even played tug-of-war.

140
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,148
Yeah, that’s right.

141
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,013
It was amazing.

142
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,288
Oh yeah, we have to make observations.
Let’s all do our best.

143
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,416
Yeah!

144
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:43,050
An earthquake?

145
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,724
It doesn’t seem like it.

146
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:57,035
It sounded like something very large
had fallen.

147
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:26,860
123, 123…

148
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,261
Oh yeah, what is Kero-chan doing?

149
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,467
He is staying at home today.

150
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:41,482
Kero-chan!

151
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,284
The elephant really is neat.

152
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,852
Really.

153
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,247
Did you write your report?

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,624
Just a little longer.

155
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:50,958
Good luck.

156
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,364
You finally noticed.

157
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,001
You said you were saying
at home didn’t you?

158
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,668
I had planned on that,

159
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,080
but your dad’s lunch smelled so good.

160
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,680
I just sorta floated in…

161
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:18,781
So that’s why the bag seemed heavy.

162
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:20,947
It wasn’t just my weight.

163
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:24,494
The lunch is big too.

164
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:27,462
If you had only asked
I would have brought you along.

165
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,863
I thought I would surprise you.

166
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:34,436
Sakura-chan was surprised
so it was a big success.

167
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:35,833
Yeah!

168
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:44,173
Sensei!

169
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,138
Umm…

170
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,358
What is it?

171
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,756
I made lunch,

172
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,815
will you have some?

173
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:04,154
It moved!

174
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:12,004
A little at 11:46.

175
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,071
It moved three times
in watching it for an hour.

176
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,240
Is that a lot, or a little?

177
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:20,980
Who knows.

178
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:22,182
Ah! It moved again.

179
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:26,455
it moved at 11:47.

180
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:29,583
For it two move twice in two minutes,

181
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,823
it might be up to it today.

182
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:39,403
There it is again.

183
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,034
Can you feel it?

184
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,031
Yeah.

185
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:43,499
It’s the aura of a Clow Card.

186
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,736
The animal’s cages were broken.

187
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:52,816
Penguins are fine,

188
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,377
but if some big animal
got out that would be bad.

189
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,285
Over there.

190
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,991
I am sure the keepers

191
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,595
and sensei are at the entrance.

192
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:13,133
What about you two?

193
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,738
We’ll be right back.

194
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:18,836
Li-kun.

195
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:24,611
Take care of this.

196
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:31,983
Nobody is here.

197
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,422
They all fled.

198
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,084
That is more convenient,

199
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,424
it would be a problem
if lots of people were around

200
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,295
when you use magic.

201
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,522
This way right?

202
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,929
I certainly feel a Clow Card’s
aura this way.

203
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,039
What card did this?

204
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,476
A card that would
want to break cages?

205
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,974
Something just crossed there.

206
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,553
What huge prints.

207
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,480
But I didn’t see anything.

208
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:08,888
Over there.

209
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:25,533
The elephants are afraid.

210
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,235
What should we do?

211
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,378
We can’t do much

212
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:31,772
when we don’t know what the card is.

213
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:51,261
Key which hides the power of darkness,

214
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,703
show your true form before me.

215
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,301
Under the contract,
I Sakura, command thee.

216
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,309
Release!

217
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:14,886
Windy!

218
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,932
The elephant was just about
to be really hurt.

219
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,502
But to throw an elephant like that.

220
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,274
What card is it?

221
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:39,747
I know!

222
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:43,978
Umm… Eh…

223
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,752
But.

224
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,614
If you don’t hurry and
save the elephant…

225
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,257
Wait a moment!

226
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:01,937
You are strength.
The card of Power.

227
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,509
Won’t you do a test of strength
against me?

228
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:07,969
Why a test of strength?

229
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:11,208
Power’s pride comes from
having a lot of strength.

230
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,577
There is the proof.

231
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,360
It’s coming this way.

232
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:24,489
See?

233
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:35,470
Aren’t you glad you used the Jump magic?

234
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,440
Don’t give me that.

235
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:40,610
If you don’t hurry and
test strength with it in a hurry…

236
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,139
What should I do?

237
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,673
Something you think you can win.

238
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:48,707
Here it comes again.

239
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:52,951
There is no way I can win against that.

240
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,125
If you don’t, it’ll continue like that.

241
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,089
Tug of war!

242
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:20,407
Power really is cute.

243
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:23,681
You’ll get hurt if you
underestimate her based on her form.

244
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,097
Kero-chan.

245
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,424
For the time being if it gets
dangerous you should let go.

246
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:46,639
Kero-chan!

247
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:48,100
Sakura, use a card.

248
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,506
Hurry and use one.
Close her in with Windy.

249
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,249
My hands are full, I can’t use it.

250
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:07,625
The elephant!

251
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:10,796
Go for it!

252
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:12,202
Good luck!

253
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,748
Time!

254
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,623
Could it be she won?

255
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:18,865
So it seems.

256
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:22,506
All right! All right! All right!

257
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,138
Thank you,
this is because you helped.

258
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,745
Sakura, hurry and seal her.

259
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:39,318
Return to your rightful form,

260
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,053
Clow Card.

261
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:04,244
This card really caused a panic.

262
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:05,649
You did good.

263
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,674
I thought I would lose for sure.

264
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,347
It was close.

265
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:14,447
I wonder if the sloth is feeling up to it.

266
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:20,188
Hey Kero-chan, this card is…

267
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,796
Of course, if you use it,
you become really strong.

268
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:28,270
Sakura-chan, I have a request.

269
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:29,600
Eh?

270
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:46,751
Tomoyo-chan!

271
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:50,691
What are you looking at?

272
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,592
Sakura-chan.

273
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,622
Ahh! That picture!

274
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,990
Thank you so much, it’s a souvenir

275
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,927
Don’t show it to anybody.

276
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,196
Yes.

277
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:04,665
Good morning.

278
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:06,306
Good morning!

279
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:07,878
Good morning.

280
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,211
It seemed the zoo was exciting.

281
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,706
Are you OK?

282
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:13,879
Yes!

283
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,086
Is that a picture from yesterday?

284
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:18,282
Yes.

285
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,940
This is…

286
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,275
What should I do?

287
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,808
He might find out about the magic.

288
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,726
You really are strong Sakura-chan.

289
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,631
That is a trick photo.

290
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,843
There is no way you could do
this without using magic.
