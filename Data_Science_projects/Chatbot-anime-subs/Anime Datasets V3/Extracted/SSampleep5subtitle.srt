00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,900
Oh, puzzle?</font></font>

51
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,490
"The answer is" trains crossing</font></font>

Robots carrying objects painted many of the CPU circuits manufactured</font></font>

62
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,900
A.-oh, well, can I question one</font></font>

How do I thought about this!?</font></font>

71
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,300
The correct answer is "Achargvh" for this it is not to croak</font></font>

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,190
It does not lose gasoline, is not it?</font></font>

79
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,230
Parts?</font></font>

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,490
This will be scary</font></font>

Rupture of the frame particles?</font></font>

87
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,390
This is likely rupture when going in a straight line, too, right?</font></font>

88
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,310
"The correct answer is" Speed</font></font>

89
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,060

. </font>Haku, you can see me again tomorrow</font></font>

97
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,670
Doll?</font></font>

00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,340
Haku</font></font>

99
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,100
What was all this?</font></font>

100
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,730
. </font>It seems that Kemeto-sama-sama and Haku together well progressing</font></font>

101
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,850
As a matter Atodhan, Arzogaoa?</font></font>

102
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,610
. </font>What do crime</font></font>

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,280
Ica-sama What idea on this matter</font></font>

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,070
! </font>It is clear that this is beyond the border</font></font>

105
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,110
! </font>This always bothered me, but it was recently wondrous</font></font>

106
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,580
.. when I speak with Kemeto even slightly</font></font>

107
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,330
! </font>It begins to cling to him and become distracted by</font></font>

108
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,290
. </font>It can cling to me</font></font>

109
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,420
... </font>When I play with him one against one in his game</font></font>

110
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,170
! </font>The Haku cling to Kimto, I thought he was ignored</font></font>

111
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,550
! </font>It began to take off her clothes to interfere with us again</font></font>

112
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,090
. </font>I do not think we have to wear clothes force</font></font>

113
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,260
what do you mean !? </font>They do this deliberate</font></font>

114
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,270
. </font>Clearly when you eat biscuits</font></font>

115
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,560
. </font>I have consumed them directly from the hand of Kemeto-sama</font></font>

116
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,230
! </font>This is, how can I express it</font></font>

117
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,070
! </font>This is unfair ! </font>Seen only Thabtunai</font></font>

118
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,610
-! </font>For - for sure</font></font>

119
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,820
! </font>I am very envious, I want to kill him</font></font>

120
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,240
. </font>S-kill him will not succeed</font></font>

121
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,740
. </font>It is still to blame</font></font>

122
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,330
. </font>When they are given candy always smiling</font></font>

123
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,080
. </font>It seems like you enjoy every bit of it</font></font>

124
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,750
It is like a servant, like hers Seibestan</font></font>

125
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,840
Do you have to take off my clothes too?</font></font>

126
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,460
Huh?</font></font>

127
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,010
! </font>For-nothing! </font>nothing at all</font></font>

128
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,390
! </font>We must banish Haku from his grasp</font></font>

129
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,350
... If we do not do something, it certainly will start</font></font>

130
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,020
! </font>By little of this and a little of that for Haku</font></font>

131
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,390
! </font>A-I will not accept this</font></font>

132
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,400
! </font>You are right, this crime and we have to stop this</font></font>

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,690
! </font>A-order, we prevent crime before you get</font></font>

134
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,280

. </font>Yup</font></font>

213
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,330
I want to tell him how horrible this, but what do I do!?</font></font>

214
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,670
. </font>Perhaps to choose my words carefully</font></font>

215
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,500
. </font>What do you think I came out of your imagination</font></font>

216
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,460
. </font>Let me say this, I do not play this because I want</font></font>

217
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,010
. </font>A friend of mine is a voice actress for this game</font></font>

218
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,180
Sound actress?</font></font>

219
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,220
When Talban game, the characters are talking and stuff, right?</font></font>

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,410

233
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,890
It also seems to go along with each other, right?</font></font>

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,220
! </font>We are certainly in order as well as</font></font>

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,400
! </font>B-certainly, even death separates us</font></font>

237
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,440
Could you tell this again?</font></font>

238
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,400

245
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,750
So when I came?</font></font>

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,720
. </font>There is a book I want to read this what it is all</font></font>

You are not not like to stay with me by, too?</font></font>

248
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,190
When she did not leave?</font></font>

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,100
Aika-sama</font></font>

250
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,520
M-What?</font></font>

251
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,320
When there are girls depicted on all the covers of the paintings?</font></font>

252
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,280
I do not know, because the chain has a girl as a key figure</font></font>

253
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,780
. </font>But all other chains as well</font></font>

254
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,970
. </font>These novels go to men, this is not it strange</font></font>

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,630
This atmosphere is full of girls, too</font></font>

272
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,340
Most books Kemeto-sama like this, is not it, what?</font></font>

273
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,930
Because, pervert, right?</font></font>

! </font>Oh, but you know something</font></font>

277
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:57,070

278
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,360
Oh, what do I do!?</font></font>

279
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,900
What do you mean by what do I do?</font></font>

280
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,360
"E-Are you interested in this," I have got these tickets from a friend to me. "" I do not think wrong. "</font></font>

281
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,870
"This is not what you think, it is not so, let's see," "I got this from a friend if you want, we can go together."</font></font>

282
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,580
"Ummm"</font></font>

283
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,830

287
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,630
I have delayed the day, you got anything that is not a big thing</font></font>

288
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,380
... but I like the way they work serious and diligent</font></font>

289
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,670
"Listen t .. t ... Toshi"</font></font>

290
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,340
. </font>So as not to reveal its goodwill</font></font>

291
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,380
"Toshicoche-soba." </font>"Have you eaten spaghetti Toshicoche soba?"</font></font>

292
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,220
