1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,880
Byousoku 5 Centimeters

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
Chapter 1

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,880
They say it's 5 centimeters per second.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,960
Hmm... What's that?

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,560
The speed at which cherry blossom
petals fall, 5 centimeters per second.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
Hmmm...

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,880
You seem to know a lot, Akari.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,360
Heh...

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,480
Hey... doesn't it somehow resemble snow?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,760
I wonder...

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,760
Hey!

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,080
Wait up!

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Akari!

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,000
Takaki-kun!

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,480
Next year, wouldn't it be good to watch
the cherry blossoms together again?

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:07,200
Oukashou

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,800
Dear Tohno Takaki-sama, I'm really sorry
for not having contacted you in a while.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,960
It's hot during summer over here... however,

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,080
it's much cooler compared to Tokyo.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
But come to think of it, I still prefer
the sweltering summer in Tokyo.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,480
The asphalt which looks as though it might melt,
the shimmering high-rise buildings in the distance,

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,000
and the overly-cold air-conditioning
in the department stores and subway.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,160
We last met at the primary
school graduation ceremony...

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,360
It has been half a year since

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,960
Hey... Takaki-kun,

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,560
do you still remember me?

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Greetings to Takaki-kun!

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
Thanks for the reply. I
was really happy about it!

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,000
It'll soon be autumn, right? The
autumn leaves here are beautiful.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,520
Yesterday, I dug out my
first sweater of the year.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Tohno-kun

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Senpai

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
What's that? A love letter?

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah, that's not it.

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm sorry for leaving you to do all these.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
It's OK. It'll be finished soon.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,920
Thanks. Hey, is it true that
you're going to switch schools?

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,160
Ah. Yes. During the third semester.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Where to?

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,520
Over to Kagoshima. It's
due to my parents' jobs.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
Is that so... It'll be lonely then.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Club activities have recently started earlier in the morning.
That's why I'm currently writing this letter on the train.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
I just had a haircut recently.

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,960
It's become short enough
to just see my ears.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
If we do meet up, you'll probably
won't be able to recognize me right?

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
I'm back.

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,840
Welcome back.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,560
You are also changing bit by bit, aren't you?

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Salutations. The cold weather
continues. How are you doing?

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,520
It had been snowing here countless times.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,000
I had to wear really thick clothes
to school because of that.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,280
It hasn't started snowing in Tokyo right?

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
I haven't gotten used to the move,

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,080
so I've been watching Tokyo's
weather forecast too.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
Looks like it's not gonna rain...

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
But it's pretty hard being
cooped indoors too.

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Hey, have you guys ever been to Tochigi?

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Huh? Where's that?

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,920
Tochigi.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Nope.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
How would I get there...

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,520
Dunno... take the bullet train?

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
It's far, isn't it...

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,400
Freshmen!

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,120
Yes!

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
Three weeks to go!

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,240
Fight oh! Fight oh!

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,080
I was pretty shocked when I heard
that you were transferring this time.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
Have we both become used to transferring
schools from having done so for so long?

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,160
Even still, to transfer to Kagoshima...

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,720
It's pretty far away this time, isn't it?

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
When the time comes,

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,360
it will no longer be a distance which would allow
us to just get on a train and meet each other.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
As I thought...

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,600
it's going to be a little lonely.

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,760
By all means, I wish you the best of health.

78
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
Good day to you, Takaki-kun!

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm really happy about the promise
to meet up on the 4th of March.

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,520
A year has passed since we last met.

81
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Somehow I'm feeling nervous about it.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,920
There's a huge cherry
blossom tree near my house.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,840
During spring, that's
probably the place where...

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,680
...the cherry petals fall at
5 centimeters per second.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
"Wouldn't it be nice if I could... "

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
"... stay with Takaki-kun until
spring comes". That's what I think.

87
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,640
- Want to drop by my place on the way home?
- Yeah, since it's raining anyway.

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,600
- The weather forecast says that the snow will be coming.
- Eh... I thought it was getting cold. It's March already after all.

89
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,280
It looks like many people
are going to catch the cold.

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,600
- Hey, let's grab a bite to eat afterwards.
They say that it's gonna rain in Shimokita.

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Ah, yes.

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,200
Tohno...

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
Let's go for our club activities.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,720
Oh...

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,520
Look here... I don't think I can make it today.

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Because of the moving preparations?

97
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Something like that. Sorry.

98
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a great help that you'll be
coming to my local station, but...

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,040
since it's a long journey, please be careful.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,240
As promised, I will be waiting for you at
the waiting room of the station at 7 pm.

101
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,320
On that promised day with Akari,
it started snowing after midday.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,200
Ah- Hey, Takaki-kun!

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,080
A cat... it's Chobi!

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
This one's always around here, isn't he?

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
But he looks like he's alone today.

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,400
What happened to Mimi? It's
lonely by yourself, right?

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,840
How was the book?

108
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,560
Very absorbing. I read through 4
billion years in one night yesterday!

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,280
Where did you read up to?

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
Until the part when the
Anomalocaris emerged.

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,520
The Cambrian period!

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,160
I like the Hallucigenia... they look like this.

113
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,080
Well, it looks similar, I guess.

114
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,680
What are you a fan of, Takaki-kun?

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
The Opabinia I guess.

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,360
Aah. It's got 5 eyes doesn't it?

117
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,480
I think Akari and I were somewhat
similar in our thoughts and feelings.

118
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
One year after I transferred to Tokyo,

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,840
Akari transferred to the same class.

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,320
We, who were still small
and sickly at that time,

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
preferred the library over the playground.

122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,840
That's why we came to
naturally become friends.

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,720
Because of that, we were
teased by our classmates.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,520
But...

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,520
strangely, when we were together, we
weren't too perturbed by those things.

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,360
We eventually started commuting
to the same secondary school.

127
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,960
"We would be together from then onwards"

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,880
For some reason, that's what I thought.

129
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,920
Shinjuku, Shinjuku. This is a terminal station.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
Disembarking passengers,

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,680
please transfer to the subway JR line and Keiou line.

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,320
It was my first time coming
to Shinjuku station by myself.

133
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,600
It would also be my first time taking
the railway lines from here onwards.

134
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,400
My heart was beating quickly.

135
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,200
I will be meeting Akari after this.

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
The guy from before, how was he?

137
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,280
Who?

138
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
You know, that guy from Nisshou!

139
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,200
Eehhh? Don't you think that's bad taste?

140
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,680
We will be arriving at Musashiurawa shortly. Repeat:
Musashiurawa. Eehhh? Don't you think that's bad taste?

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
We will be arriving at Musashiurawa
shortly. Repeat: Musashiurawa.

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,920
At the next station Musashiurawa, we
will be waiting for the express train...

143
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,400
In order to await the arrival of the express, this
train will be stopping here for four minutes.

144
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,240
Customers who are in a hurry to reach
Yonohonmachi and Oomiya are advised to...

145
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,240
Uhm... it's Shinohara here.

146
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
Uhm... is Takaki-kun there?

147
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
It's Akari-chan.

148
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Huh? Transferring?

149
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,360
What about Nishi Secondary? We
worked so hard to get accepted.

150
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,360
They say I have to go to Tochigi Public...

151
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm sorry...

152
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,240
No... it's not something you
need to apologize about...

153
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,800
I told them to let me commute from
Aunt Katsushika's place, but...

154
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,080
they told me I couldn't
do it until I was older...

155
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,160
I got it.

156
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
It's alright.

157
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
It's OK...

158
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm sorry...

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,240
I was pushing so hard on the
telephone receiver that my ears hurt.

160
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,000
I understood perfectly that
Akari had been hurt, but...

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,080
I couldn't do anything about it.

162
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,160
At the transfer station's terminal, it started to
become crowded with people returning home from work.

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,600
Everyone's shoes were wet from
soaking in the water from the snow.

164
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,960
The air was...

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,560
infused with the unique smell of a
snowy day in a city, and was cold.

166
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,240
Attention please, all passengers.

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,800
The train on the Utsunomiya line, headed
towards Koyama and Utsunomiya,

168
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,160
will be arriving around 8 minutes late due to the snow.

169
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,400
We offer our sincerest apologies
to passengers who are in a hurry.

170
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
Until that moment, the possibility
that the trains could be delayed

171
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,840
had not even crossed my mind.

172
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,400
My uneasiness suddenly increased.

173
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,920
Due to the snow, this train is
currently around 10 minutes late.

174
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
Our sincerest apologies to those who
were in a hurry to catch this train.

175
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
A little while after we
passed Oomiya station,

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
in the blink of an eye, the buildings
in the scenery became sparse.

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
The next stop is Kuki, Kuki.

178
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,320
Our sincerest apologies for
the late arrival to this station.

179
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,120
Passengers transferring to the Toubuisezaki
line, please approach the number 5 exit.

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,640
Due to the following train being delayed,

181
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,720
this train will be temporarily
stopping here for 10 minutes.

182
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
We offer our sincerest apologies for the trouble
we are causing to passengers in a hurry,

183
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,240
but please wait here for a while.

184
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,120
Due to the following train being delayed,

186
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,280
this train will be temporarily
stopping here for 10 minutes.

187
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
We offer our sincerest apologies for the trouble
we are causing to passengers in a hurry...

188
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
Nogi, Nogi...

189
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,800
We offer our sincerest apologies to our passengers,

190
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,280
Due to delays in the following train, this
train will be temporarily stopping here...

191
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,840
We appreciate the difficulty that this
is causing for passengers in a hurry...

192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,720
The time it took to go from station
to station was unbelievably long.

193
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
And the train stopped at each
station for an unbelievably long time.

194
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,640
The invisible winter wasteland
outside the window,

195
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,400
the flowing away of time, the painful hunger,

196
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,560
all these things gradually
wore down my heart.

197
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,680
The promised time came and went.

198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,840
By this time, Akari must
have started worrying.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,840
On that day... that day the phone call came,

200
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,480
The fact that I could not offer Akari
even a single word of kindness,

201
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,480
even though she was beset by a
far greater sadness than I was,

202
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,320
is something that I was very ashamed of.

203
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,600
So...

204
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,800
it's goodbye for us today.

205
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,040
Akari's first letter arrived
half a year after that.

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
During the summer of
my first secondary year.

207
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,640
I remember everything
she wrote in that letter.

208
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,600
2 weeks before today, the promised date,

209
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,040
I wrote the letter that I was
going to give her in person.

210
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,720
Things that I couldn't not tell Akari,
things that I wanted her to hear:

211
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,840
In truth, I had a lot of them.

212
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,720
We sincerely apologize for the trouble. In a moment,
this train will start moving towards Utsunomiya.

213
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,320
Koyama, Koyama...

214
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,280
Passengers using the Touho
bullet train, please transfer here.

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,920
Passengers getting on the Touho bullet train outgoing
from Morioka, please go to the first platform...

216
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,960
Passengers boarding the train headed
towards Tokyo, please go to platform 5.

217
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
Attention please, passengers,

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,880
due to the snow, the Ryoumo line is
currently suffering a major operational delay.

219
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
We are terribly sorry for the trouble.

220
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,400
Until such time when the train arrives, please wait.

221
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,440
In any case,

222
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,400
I have no choice but to forge forward
to the station where Akari is waiting.

223
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,440
The train arriving on track number 8 heading towards
Ashikaga-Maebashi, will be going to Takasaki.

224
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,440
Please stand behind the white line.

225
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,440
Attention please, passengers,

226
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,320
Due to the current snowstorm, this
train will be temporarily stopping.

227
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,720
We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

228
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,840
We are currently unable to provide
a time for the resumption of service.

229
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,440
Repeat:

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,960
Due to the current snowstorm, this
train will be temporarily stopping.

231
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,560
We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

232
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,600
We are currently unable to provide
a time for the resumption of service.

233
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Takaki-kun, are you well?

234
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,040
Club activities have recently started earlier in the morning.
That's why I'm currently writing this letter on the train.

235
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,680
For some reason, the Akari I imagine
from the letters was always alone.

236
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
Just like that, the train ended up

237
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,560
stopping there without a
sound for nearly two hours.

238
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,440
Every minute felt like an eternity.

239
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,280
Time, clearly as if it had a malicious intent,

240
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
slowly ebbed away above me.

241
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
I clenched my teeth,

242
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,080
and keeping myself from crying
was the only thing I could do.

243
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,840
Akari...

244
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
Please... just...

245
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
...return...

246
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,560
...return home already!

247
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,520
The train arriving on track number 3 heading towards
Ashikaga-Maebashi, will be going to Takasaki.

248
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,160
This train will be stopping here
momentarily due to the snow.

249
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,400
Akari...

250
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,440
Delicious...

251
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,960
Really? It's just normal Houji tea.

252
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Houji tea? It's my first time drinking this.

253
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
No way, you must have drunk it before.

254
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,560
Really?

255
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,320
Yes.

256
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,400
And after that, we have this... I made
it, so I can't guarantee the taste, but...

257
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,200
if it's alright with you, please eat some.

258
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Thank you!

259
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,840
I was really hungry.

260
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,520
How was it?

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,520
It's the most delicious out of all
the things I have eaten up to now.

262
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,560
You exaggerate!

263
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,200
It's true!

264
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,440
It must be because you are hungry.

265
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Really?

266
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,160
Yes.

267
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
I'm going to eat some too.

268
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,400
You're going to be moving soon, right?

269
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,040
Yes... next week.

270
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,560
Kagoshima, huh...

271
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,560
It's far away.

272
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,120
Yeah.

273
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,160
But Tochigi is pretty far away too.

274
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,600
Heh, so far away that you can't return home.

275
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,960
We'll be closing the station soon. There
are no more trains running anyway.

276
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,760
Ah. Yes.

277
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,480
Since it's snowing this much,
please take care of yourself.

278
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes sir.

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,040
Can you see it? That tree.

280
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,680
The tree from the letter?

281
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,800
Yes. The cherry blossom tree.

282
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,920
Hey...

283
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
Doesn't it... somehow resemble snow?

284
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,440
Yes, it does.

285
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
In that moment,

286
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,160
the dwelling place of
eternity, hearts and souls...

287
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,600
became clear to me.

288
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,680
It was as if I understood everything that had
happened in my life these last thirteen years,

289
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
and... the time which was to come.

290
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
I became unbearably... sad.

291
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,000
Akari's warmth, her spirit,

292
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
how should I treat them,
where can I bring them?

293
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
That was something I did not know.

294
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,120
That we could not be
together forever after this

295
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,960
was a fact I clearly grasped.

296
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,240
The vast lives we had ahead of us,

297
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,840
the boundless amount of time which laid
unavoidably stretched out in front of us.

298
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,840
But...

299
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,680
the anxieties which I had caught
sight of soon melted away.

300
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,760
And after that, only Akari's
tender lips remained.

301
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,960
That night,

302
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,400
we stayed at a small barn beside a field.

303
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Sharing an old blanket, we
talked long into the night.

304
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,680
And before we knew it, we had fallen asleep.

305
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
In the morning, I boarded the train
which had started running again.

306
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,120
Akari and I parted.

307
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,520
Uhm...

308
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
Takaki-kun...

309
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Hmmm?

310
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Takaki-kun, you'll...

311
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,400
be alright from now on. I'm sure of it!

312
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,600
Thank you.

313
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,760
Akari, you too, be well!

314
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,160
We'll write letters... and telephone too!

315
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,160
I did not tell Akari

316
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,280
that I had lost the letter
which I had written to her.

317
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
From before to after that kiss...

318
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,680
it seemed as though everything
in the world had changed.

319
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
I strongly wished for the
strength to protect her.

320
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,920
Just thinking that, as always,

321
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,000
I continued watching the
scenery outside the window.

322
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:47,200
Chapter 1: Oukashou: End

323
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,280
Chapter 2

324
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,800
Kanae, are you going after school too?

325
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,640
Yeah. Are you alright with that?

326
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,360
Yep, but make sure you study properly too.

327
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
Yep!

328
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,680
Alright!

329
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,360
Good morning.

330
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Good morning, Tohno-kun.
You're early today too.

331
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,080
You too, Sumida. You came
from the beach didn't you?

332
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,760
Yes.

333
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,360
You're hardworking.

334
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,040
Eh...

335
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,680
Not really... heh.

336
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
See you, Tohno-kun.

337
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

338
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,760
Got it? Lt'll soon be time for you to decide.

339
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,920
You have until Monday to submit.

340
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,120
Discuss this with your family
when you're filling it in.

341
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,160
It seems like Sasaki-san will be
going to a university at Tokyo.

342
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,720
Wow. I might be going to a
junior college in Kumamoto...

343
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,120
What about you, Kanae?

344
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,560
Uhm... uh...

345
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
Getting a job?

346
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,400
Uh...

347
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
You really haven't thought
about anything, have you...

348
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
Only about Tohno-kun eh.

349
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,000
That guy must have a girlfriend in Tokyo.

350
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
That can't be!

351
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,640
Ah...

352
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,120
You still can't do it properly?

353
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
Mmm... I wonder what's the problem...

354
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,440
Don't worry about it too much.
You can still get on the wave.

355
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,880
It's all very well for you to be so relaxed.

356
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

357
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,280
At this rate, I won't be able
to say it before graduation...

358
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,880
Thank you, sis.

359
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
I can come fetch you back.

360
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,960
No, I'll go back to Kabu's.

361
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
Ah. Sumida, are you going home now?

362
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,800
Yes. You too, Tohno-kun?

363
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,680
Yup.

364
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,280
Wanna go together?

365
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
If I had a tail like a dog,

366
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,320
it'd probably be making a buzzing sound
from shaking so quickly with hidden joy.

367
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,840
"Aahh, I'm so lucky that I'm not a
dog", I thought to myself with relief.

368
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,120
Thinking that, I was amazed at
myself for being such an idiot.

369
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,240
Even so...

370
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,560
The road home with
Tohno-kun was a happy one.

371
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,440
From the very beginning, Tohno-kun was
somehow different from the rest of the boys.

372
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm Tohno Takaki.

373
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,320
I am used to transferring schools because of my
parent's work, but I'm not familiar with this island yet.

374
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
I look forward to working with you.

375
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,760
I started liking him from that day in the second year of
secondary school, and wanted to go to the same high school as him.

376
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,280
After studying really hard, I
somehow managed to pass.

377
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,640
Even then, I fell even more in love
whenever I saw Tohno-kun's figure.

378
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,960
It was scary, and each day
was filled with anguish.

379
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,920
But feeling happy everytime I met him,

380
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,640
was something about myself that
I couldn't do anything about.

381
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,760
Tohno-kun, you're buying
the same thing again.

382
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,560
This is good.

383
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,560
Sumida, you're somehow
always so very earnest.

384
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,280
Yep!

385
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,880
I'll go first then.

386
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,480
Yeah...

387
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,280
Can I have this please.

388
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,760
That's 90 yen.

389
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,880
Yep.

390
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
As always, thank you.

391
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,160
Welcome back. What did you buy?

392
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,880
Yup, I couldn't decide though...

393
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,000
Yup, I couldn't decide though... Tohno-kun
would sometimes be typing mail to someone.

394
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
Tohno-kun would sometimes
be typing mail to someone.

395
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,920
During those times, I'd wish that I was the
one receiving the mail he was sending.

396
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,240
For some reason, I kept
thinking that every time.

397
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
Kabu! I'm back!

398
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,200
Kabu, Kabu, I've come back!

399
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,640
This is a notice from the town hall: The next duty
stand will be Sakai's Agricultural Cooperative Fuel...

400
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,440
Sumida Kanae from third year first group,

401
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,200
Itou-sensei requests your presence
at the student guidance room.

402
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,720
Itou-sensei requests your presence at the
student guidance room. Isn't that your girlfriend?

403
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,440
Isn't that your girlfriend?

404
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,320
She isn't my girlfriend.

405
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,520
Sumida, you're the only one in your
year who hasn't submitted your form.

406
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,920
I'm sorry...

407
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,120
Look, despite what we've been telling you, it's
not something you should be too worried about.

408
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,680
Did you talk to Sumida-sensei about this?

409
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
No...

410
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,200
If you really cannot decide, how
about going to a local junior college?

411
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,520
But...

412
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,640
It's got nothing to do with sis...

413
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Because...

414
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,960
my elder sister who coaxed
me into starting surfing.

415
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,200
And the important person who
occupies most of my thoughts...

416
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,920
I have still yet to...

417
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,760
As always, thank you.

418
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,760
That's OK. See you.

419
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,000
When I came to the place
where Tohno-kun was,

420
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,160
the inside of my chest
started hurting somewhat.

421
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,000
Tohno-kun!

422
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,040
Sumida! What's up? How did you find me?

423
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,160
Heh... I found your bike, so
I came along. Is that OK?

424
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,320
Mmm, I see. I'm glad.

425
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
I didn't see you at the scooter
parking place today...

426
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,560
Me too!

427
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,320
He is kind.

428
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,240
At times, it seems like he's going to cry.

429
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey... are you going to be taking the exams?

430
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Yes, the acceptance exams
for a university in Tokyo.

431
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,800
Tokyo... I see. I thought
that would be the case.

432
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,600
Why?

433
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,680
I somehow always thought
you'd go somewhere far away.

434
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,680
What about you?

435
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,840
Uhmmm...

436
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm not even sure about tomorrow.

437
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,440
I think... everyone is like that.

438
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,240
No way! Even you?

439
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Of course.

440
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,640
You don't seem like you're
undecided about the future at all.

441
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,000
No... I am full of hesitation.

442
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,120
I only somehow manage to do what I can.

443
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,760
I see.

444
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,120
So that's how it is.

445
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,600
A paper plane?

446
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,560
Yep.

447
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,360
...amazing.

448
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
They say it's 5 kilometers per hour.

449
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,160
Huh?

450
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,320
It's going to the Minamitane launch facility.

451
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,040
Oh.

452
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
This year, we'll see a launch at long last.

453
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Ah... they say it will continue travelling
through the solar system and beyond...

454
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,520
No matter how long it takes...

455
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,160
You should seriously discuss
Kanae's future with her.

456
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,240
She's such an absent-minded girl.

457
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,480
It'll be alright. She's no longer a kid.

458
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
I was once like her too...

459
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,680
Hey... Kabu, Tohno-kun is unsure too.

460
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,440
He's the same as me... Tohno-kun.

461
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
That would really be...

462
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,120
...a journey so dark and lonely
as to be beyond all imagination.

463
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,480
To exist so earnestly in pure darkness...

464
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,000
...without meeting even a single
hydrogen atom by chance...

465
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,440
To absolutely and wholeheartedly believe that somewhere in the
abyss, you are getting closer to the secrets of the universe.

466
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,880
In that manner, where
are we headed towards?

467
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,640
How far will we go?

468
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,440
When did I start typing
messages that are never sent?

469
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,320
Kanae, have you decided
on your future path?

470
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,640
No... I still don't know. But
it's OK. I've decided...

471
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,520
I'll do the best I can, bit
by bit. I'm going now!

472
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,120
From that day on, a few
typhoons happened to pass by,

473
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,520
and on those occasions, the
island became cooler bit by bit.

474
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,400
The wind which nudged the sugarcane
gradually became pregnant with chill.

475
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,800
The sky really became a little higher,

476
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,960
the contours of the clouds became gentler,

477
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,360
and the classmates whom Kabu jumped on ended
up looking like they'd put on thin jumpers.

478
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,480
When I managed to stand up on the
wave for the first time in half a year,

479
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,720
there was still a little bit of summer
left. It was the middle of October.

480
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,120
This evening's weather will be clear, with a
reported maximum windspeed of 8 meters.

481
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,800
This evening's weather will be clear, with a reported maximum
windspeed of 8 meters. It seems like Sasaki-san has confessed to Yamada.

482
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,040
It seems like Sasaki-san
has confessed to Yamada.

483
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,680
Wow, just as you would expect from her!

484
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,640
Huh? Kanae, you seem really happy today.

485
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,280
Did something happen with Tohno-kun?

486
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,120
Hehe...

487
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
No way!

488
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,920
Today, I too...

489
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
...will confess to Tohno-kun!

490
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,680
If I don't tell him on the day I
managed to get on the wave,

491
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
I will not be able to tell him from here on in.

492
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,320
Sumida

493
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,240
Toh-

494
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,880
Tohno-kun...

495
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,360
Are you going home now?

496
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,680
Yes.

497
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,240
I see.

498
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,280
In that case, let's go together.

499
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,560
Hmmm? Sumida, you've decided already?

500
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,280
Yes...

501
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,720
Hmm?

502
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,480
I...

503
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,640
What's wrong?

504
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:50,560
I...

505
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,360
...to me.

506
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:57,920
Huh?

507
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,200
No...

508
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,240
Sorry... it's nothing.

509
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,600
It's not working?

510
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,080
Yes... it's strange...

511
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,080
No good?

512
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,640
Yeah... it could be that the plug has given
up the ghost. Was this a hand-me-down?

513
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,120
Yeah. It was my sister's.

514
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,920
Did it have problems when
you were accelerating?

515
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,840
It might have.

516
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,720
Let's just leave this here today and have
someone from your family pick it up later.

517
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,120
We'll walk home today.

518
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,400
Eh... I'll walk home myself!
Tohno-kun, you can go first.

519
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,800
It's not that far from here,

520
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,320
and I kinda want to walk as well.

521
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,480
Tohno-kun...

522
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,400
Please...

523
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,760
What's wrong?

524
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm sorry... it's nothing...

525
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,360
I'm sorry...

526
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,720
Sumida...

527
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,240
I beg you... please...

528
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,480
...stop being...

529
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,040
...so kind to me!

530
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,640
To desperately and blindly stretch
out our hands towards the heavens,

531
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,480
to launch such a big mass into the sky,

532
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,200
and to fix our eyes on something in the
darkness of the far reaches of space.

533
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,680
Even if only a little, I've come to realize

534
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,120
why Tohno-kun seemed so
different from the other boys.

535
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,280
And at the same time,

536
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,000
I also came to the full
understanding that Tohno-kun...

537
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,240
...would never look at me.

538
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,320
That's why, I did not say anything
to Tohno-kun on that day.

539
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,360
Although Tohno-kun is kind...

540
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,560
...he's very kind... but...

541
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,840
but...

542
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,960
Tohno-kun has always

543
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,440
...been looking at something
far beyond, far higher than me.

544
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,280
I could never give Tohno-kun
that which he desires.

545
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,920
Even so...

546
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,120
Even so, I'm sure that even when tomorrow
comes, or the day after, or thereafter,

547
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,240
I will still be helplessly
in love with Tohno-kun.

548
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
Thinking only about Tohno-kun,

549
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,000
and crying, I slept.

550
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,800
Chapter 2: Cosmonaut: End

551
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,040
Chapter 3

552
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,440
Thinking back to that day,

553
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,560
surely, that person must also
strongly feel it when she thinks back.

554
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,800
The last train on the Chuou Soubu
line going to Tokyo has arrived.

555
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
If only you could go back
after the New Year...

556
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,640
Yes... but I've got various
things prepared, so...

557
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,480
That's right. Make sure you cook
him some delicious food too.

558
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,200
Yes.

559
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,920
If anything happens, give us a call, Akari.

560
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,080
It'll be alright. There'll be a meeting
ceremony next month, so you don't have to worry.

561
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,480
It's cold, so please return home.

562
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,040
I saw a dream from long ago.

563
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,600
Both of us were still kids.

564
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,720
It must have been because of
the letter I found yesterday.

565
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,440
Mizuno-san.

566
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,320
Ah... yes!

567
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,760
Shall we have the meeting now?

568
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,200
Yes.

569
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,080
By just living one's life, sadness
accumulates here and there,

570
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,120
be it in the sheets hung out in the sun to
dry, the toothbrushes in the bathroom,

571
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,920
and the history logs of the mobile phone.

572
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,840
"I still like you, even now. "

573
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,640
So wrote the lady I had dated
three years ago in her email.

574
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,360
"But, even if we were to
exchange a thousand emails... "

575
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,480
"... our hearts would probably not move
even one centimeter closer together. "

576
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,080
In the last several years, I have
forged ahead without any regard,

577
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,880
just to touch what I cannot reach. That
email was a definite indicator of that fact.

578
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,080
Without understanding
the sources from which

579
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,920
this menacing thought surged
forth from, I continued working.

580
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,920
When I at last noticed, my heart had already become
hard from the gradual loss of its youthful vitality.

581
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,320
And on a certain morning,

582
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,000
when I at last came to
an earnest realization...

583
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,520
that I had lost everything that was beautiful,

584
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,080
I knew I was at my limits,

585
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,000
and quit the company.

586
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,560
Yesterday, I had a dream.

587
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,440
A dream I have had since long ago.

588
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,840
In that dream, we had yet to turn 13.

589
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,240
We were in a vast countryside
completely covered with snow,

590
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,600
the lights of the houses extended far
into the distance, a dazzling sight.

591
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,920
We walked on the thick carpet of fresh
snow, but did not leave any footprints.

592
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,560
And like that,

593
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,560
"Someday, we will be able to watch
the cherry blossoms together again",

594
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,080
both of us, without any doubts at all,

595
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,560
that's what we thought.
