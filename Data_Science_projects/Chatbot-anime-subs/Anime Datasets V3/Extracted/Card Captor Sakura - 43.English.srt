1
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,084
It hurts!!

2
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,185
No! I messed up the cake again!

3
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:44,395
Mei Lin, haste makes waste.

4
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,393
If you stay calm, it should work.

5
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,264
Stay calm?

6
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:53,433
That’s the hardest thing for me

7
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:06,445
You know…

8
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:10,881
This is the result of Mei Lin-sama

9
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,289
trying to make a delicious cake for you,
Shao Lan-sama.

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
It is the thought that counts.

11
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:21,428
I’m sorry. I’ll clean up properly.

12
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:25,869
Oh! I’ll go get it!

13
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,507
Hello, this is Li.

14
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:35,642
Mother!

15
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,142
This is a cake…

16
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,645
Mei Lin-sama made it with all her heart.

17
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:42,513
But you know…

18
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,422
Shao Lan-sama,

19
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,456
I am sure you are a broad-minded person.

20
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,426
So are you going to bear
in mind such trivial matters?

21
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:53,665
But it’s not only this…

22
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,963
Say, she’d come hugging me
all of a sudden.

23
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:58,036
Shao Lan!

24
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,070
It hurts.

25
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,502
Hey! How many times have I told you

26
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,071
not to come hugging me all of a sudden!

27
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:07,812
What happened?

28
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,984
I don’t wanna go back!

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,590
[Sakura’s Farewell to Mei Lin]

30
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:22,352
Oh my! The pictures are very well taken.

31
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,592
Onii-chan said he took
it at the Literary Fest.

32
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,760
Your brother must be very good
at taking pictures.

33
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:32,962
It’s just the camera was good.

34
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,437
– Oh, Mei Lin-chan!
– Good morning!

35
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,012
Good morning!

36
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,457
Hey, I’ve got some pictures
from the play we did earlier…

37
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,658
Mei Lin-chan?

38
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:57,060
What’s wrong?

39
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:03,693
What? You’re going back?! When?

40
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:07,697
– Next week…
– So sudden?!

41
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:15,906
Li-kun!

42
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,781
Did you tell the teacher
that you’re going back to Hong Kong?

43
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,657
There might be other things
besides just taking attendance.

44
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:31,989
Let her know soon.

45
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,335
Shao Lan, you don’t care
if I go back or not.

46
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:41,599
There’s nothing I can do.
Auntie said you had to go back.

47
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,243
There’s nothing you can do…

48
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,939
Am I being a bother to you?!

49
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,754
Am I a bother being here?

50
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,554
– No, that’s not it.
– Shao Lan you jerk!!

51
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,096
– Mei Lin!
– Mei Lin-chan!

52
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,800
Mei Lin has to go back.

53
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,575
I have an announcement for everyone.

54
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,347
Mei Lin-san is transferring
back to Hong Kong next week.

55
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,617
This must be sad for her.

56
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,890
Bye-bye! Bye!

57
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:43,834
Mei Lin.

58
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:52,045
Mei Lin-chan!

59
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:54,045
Um… mm…

60
00:04:54,314 --> 00:05:00,378
Why don’t you stay over at my house?

61
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:05,416
Fo… For what?

62
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,789
For what?

63
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:08,687
Umm…

64
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:14,222
Father is going to make
a really tasty cake!

65
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,327
Father’s really good at cooking,

66
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,797
so it’s gotta taste very good.
Besides…

67
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,078
Besides… I want to chat with you
about many things!

68
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,078
– Okay.
– Really?!

69
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,384
I’ll come over tonight.

70
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,453
Tonight…?

71
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:47,227
I’m sorry for borrowing Mei Lin-chan
all of a sudden.

72
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,860
Why did you ask her all of a sudden…

73
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,670
It’s true that I have lots of things

74
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:56,973
I want to chat with Mei Lin.

75
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:02,203
Besides, she’ll be so sad

76
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,274
having to part with you.

77
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,851
I’ll let Wei know about it.

78
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,652
Yuki, stay for dinner.

79
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:13,654
You’re on your own, right?

80
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:16,820
Thanks.
Sorry for bothering you all the time.

81
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,390
There you are. I’m home.

82
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,396
Sorry for bothering you.
You’re very welcome here.

83
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:26,029
Sakura has a friend over?

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,535
Yes, she’s staying over, she said.

85
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:29,873
Is it Tomoyo-chan?

86
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,910
No, I’ve never met her before.

87
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,435
She came from Hong Kong.

88
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,550
Hong Kong?

89
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:42,348
Oh, I’m so full.

90
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,854
Your father is really a good cook.

91
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:48,226
I feel envy.

92
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:50,486
Here. Thanks.

93
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,300
Come to think of it,
where’s that bath sponge?

94
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,633
Oh, Kero’s at Tomoyo-chan’s house.

95
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:02,771
Geez… Kicking’ me out

96
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:04,168
coz that girl is staying’ over.

97
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:07,574
Well, this is probably
much more fun for me!

98
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:12,410
I got so much to eat, and the food
is so good here. Isn’t that great?

99
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,947
Occasionally like that is good.

100
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:17,953
My my, I look real cool!

101
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,021
I hope Sakura-chan is having
a nice chat with Mei Lin…

102
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,424
Oh, this is so good!

103
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,660
This too!

104
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,833
This one too!

105
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,165
I’m so envious!

106
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,541
I’ll have to push myself
to finish them all!

107
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:40,977
This is so good.

108
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:42,913
It’ll be such a waste if
I don’t finish all of it.

109
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,074
You know,

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,911
Li-kun is a very good cook too.

111
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:54,894
I guess.

112
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,500
I don’t think Li-kun thinks that

113
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,426
you’re a bother, you know?

114
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:10,069
Because he’s always worried about you.

115
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,677
Whether it’s at school,

116
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:12,979
or when we’re capturing the cards.

117
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,979
I know.

118
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:22,388
I know that.

119
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,157
I know…

120
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,425
Two mailboxes? Which one is true?

121
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,666
I know.

122
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:15,538
It it’s different than what I want.

123
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:25,340
Hey, since when did you
start liking that guy?

124
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:26,944
Hm… Eh…

125
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,713
He was Touya’s classmate,

126
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:33,456
and he came over… And…

127
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,083
And you have a crush on him?

128
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:39,989
Wh… What about you?

129
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:47,770
For me… it wasn’t exactly
like a crush…

130
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:53,679
In Hong Kong,
I lived very close to Shao Lan.

131
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,538
Because I don’t have magic powers,

132
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,644
I didn’t need to study magic.

133
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:02,347
But Shao Lan and I did have

134
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,487
martial art lessons together with Wei.

135
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:19,905
Shao Lan-sama.

136
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:26,236
But Shao Lan doesn’t smile at all.
Nor does he like to play.

137
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,106
Like how he is now?

138
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:32,243
Even worse. I’ve never seen him
did anything fun before.

139
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,748
That’s why I’d watch him sometimes.

140
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:47,631
But, you know…

141
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:56,302
Is there something wrong?

142
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:58,936
The bird…

143
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,313
It flew away…

144
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:04,877
Auntie gave it to me…

145
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,452
It was my favorite…

146
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,066
Don’t cry.

147
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,505
Shao Lan-sama! Where are you going?!

148
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:36,981
I’m going to look for it!

149
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,052
So he went looking for it.

150
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,594
And then, the rain started to come down,

151
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,734
but still Shao Lan hasn’t come back.

152
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,508
Shao Lan…

153
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:05,305
Don’t worry.

154
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,381
I am sure Shao Lan

155
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:10,911
will bring back the bird.

156
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,291
Shao Lan.

157
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,636
Shao Lan…

158
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,649
This is the bird, right?

159
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,495
Hey! What’s the matter?
Are you hurting somewhere?

160
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,082
So there was such a story.

161
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,244
I guess from then on…

162
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,009
I’m not too clear too.

163
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,750
I’ve grown to like him a lot,

164
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,185
That why I love him.

165
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,992
But it’s not the same for Shao Lan.

166
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,765
He made a promise with me, but…

167
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,299
A promise?

168
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:38,568
I don’t have any magic.

169
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,771
Even if I stay with him,
I can’t do anything for him.

170
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,844
There’s no need for me to be here
to help him look for the cards.

171
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:49,877
Mei Lin…

172
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,010
I sense a Clow Card!

173
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:00,017
Sakura! I’m heading towards

174
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,158
where the Clow Card is!

175
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:03,862
Are you done yet?

176
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,262
Yeah. Okay. Gotcha.

177
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,695
Mei Lin-chan, you’re not going?

178
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,899
Maybe I shouldn’t…

179
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,240
Everything in the art
museum is doubled.

180
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:24,947
Could this be…

181
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,950
That way?

182
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,191
Let’s go, Mei Lin-chan!

183
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,019
But even if I go…

184
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:38,894
Mei Lin-chan!

185
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,833
There are plenty of things
that no one else but you can do.

186
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,178
Crap.

187
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,216
No! It is Twin after all.

188
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,215
What? Didn’t your house
become double as well?

189
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,383
Shao Lan!

190
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:06,318
Are you all right?

191
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,856
Even that old man!

192
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:13,695
Kero-chan! Sakura!

193
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,867
What have you been doing?
You’re late!

194
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:17,330
I’m sorry!

195
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,531
Shao Lan! You okay?

196
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:24,773
Watch out!

197
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:28,544
Shao Lan! You okay?

198
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:34,349
Jump!

199
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,929
Wind! Become a chain of admonition!

200
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,930
Windy!

201
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,999
Return to thy form which thou should be!

202
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,308
Clow Card!

203
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:13,855
How come?!

204
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,522
It won’t work

205
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:16,955
if you only capture one of the twins.

206
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,462
They have to be caught exactly
at the same moment!

207
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:22,933
At the same moment!

208
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,372
Jump!

209
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,100
What to do…

210
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,575
– Has to be at the same moment…?
– Right.

211
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,045
King of Thunder, descend!

212
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:43,216
I see!

213
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:47,286
Thunder!

214
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,657
That won’t work!

215
00:16:58,504 --> 00:16:59,436
Just as I thought.

216
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,040
They noticed a gap in time…

217
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,269
If it’s not exactly
the same moment…

218
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,242
What? Exact same moment?

219
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,338
Even there is just a gap,
they will notice.

220
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:13,417
Wanna try one more time?

221
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,920
But is it gonna work?

222
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,352
We gotta try, if nothing else!

223
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:23,024
Mei Lin-chan!

224
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,392
Li-kun! You and Mei Lin-chan
might be able

225
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:28,629
to move just like the Twin.

226
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,568
can stop their action.

227
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,872
– Kinomoto-san!
– You can do it!

228
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:37,773
Because you’ve always
watched Li-kun!

229
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,077
But…

230
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:45,878
I… might be a bother…

231
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:51,817
Let’s do it! Mei Lin!

232
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:00,427
Got it!

233
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:13,641
Awesome!

234
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:39,500
Are you okay?

235
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,893
Now!

236
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,920
Return to thy form which
thou should be!

237
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,597
Clow Card!

238
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,490
I’ve never thought
of you as a bother.

239
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,742
I’ve never imagined that

240
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,947
The noisy bratty girl’s
gonna leave us.

241
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,314
She’ll be sad…

242
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:06,547
You didn’t forget
anything else, right?

243
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,522
Let me take care
of boarding procedures.

244
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,693
I’ll contact you
when we arrive.

245
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:24,372
Hey, do you remember
that promise?

246
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:27,010
Promise?

247
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:31,074
I love you!

248
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:35,146
I love you, Shao Lan!
I’ll be your bride!

249
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,486
Hey, wait a second! I…

250
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,049
Shao Lan! Is there someone else

251
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,258
you love more than me?

252
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,854
No, there isn’t, but…

253
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:46,863
So I’ll be your bride!

254
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,061
Because you’re
the one I love most!

255
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:51,529
Hey, listen…

256
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,031
I’ll give up

257
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:54,436
if you find someone you
love more than me.

258
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:55,906
But until that day,

259
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,505
I’m your bride!

260
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:00,772
– Okay?
– What do you mean “okay”…?

261
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,014
Okay?!

262
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,078
Do whatever you want.

263
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,058
Until you find someone you love most,

264
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,890
I’m your fiancee.

265
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:20,256
Mei Lin…

266
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:27,639
Mei Lin-chan… 
We’ll see each other again, right?

267
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:32,041
Of course! I’ll definitely
come back to be near Shao Lan.

268
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,605
Mei Lin-sama! It is time!

269
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:38,846
Okay!

270
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:41,584
Thanks for helping me

271
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,684
with magic at that time.

272
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:50,792
See you again!

273
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,859
See you again, Mei Lin-chan!
