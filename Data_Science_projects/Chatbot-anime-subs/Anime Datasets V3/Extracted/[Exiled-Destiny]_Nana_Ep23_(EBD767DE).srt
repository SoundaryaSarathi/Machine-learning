1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,870
Without even exchanging
a single word with Takumi,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,840
I kissed him
all the way to my bed.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,360
That was when

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,930
I sensed Nana leaving
the apartment.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,570
In the back of my head,

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,940
which at the time
had a severed circuit,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,710
I thought to myself that
she must've gone to see Ren.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,370
Blinking eyes call the wind

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:50,010
A smile clears all the noise away

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,580
The angel in your eyes whispers

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,760
"Everything begins now"

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,990
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,800
It's like being caught in a wave

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,440
Breath held, arms reaching out

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,670
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,310
You're the only one I can see

18
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,250
Baby my wish on a wing

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,220
This sky is torn

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,620
By a single overflowing word

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,020
Hey Nobu, let's go home already.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,190
I'll pay for the taxi.

23
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,550
If you wanna go,
then just go.

24
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,600
Let me stay at your place.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,130
Go to one of your women.

26
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,430
I'm not in the mood for that.

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,430
That Takumi is so annoying.

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,070
Hachi is our pet.
How dare he steal her away.

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,370
Don't talk about her
as if she's a dog.

30
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,510
But doesn't it piss you off?
Get her back, Nobu.

31
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,210
You like Hachi, don't you?

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,510
It's impossible.

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,590
You coward.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,050
There's nothing I can do about it!
Hachi likes him.

35
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,190
But that's just as a fan, right?

36
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,760
It might've started off like that,
but once she actually met him,

37
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,160
she's become
serious about him!

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,700
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have gone off with him.

39
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,770
But it was the day
after they met, right?

40
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,540
Would she become serious
so quickly?

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,000
I think it was no more than just being
in the heat of the moment.

42
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,110
Do you realize what you're saying?!

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,140
Hachi isn't that kinda woman!

44
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,550
I just know that Takumi
cleverly worked his charm on her,

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,050
and Hachi fell for it.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,750
He deceived her.

47
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,610
Are you sure?
I don't think Hachi's that stupid.

48
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,280
It's not about how stupid she is.

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,960
She's naïve!
And she's way too honest!

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
I know that, but you know,

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,060
I noticed how you were disappointed
about Reira after meeting her.

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,930
Aren't you idealizing the creature
known as woman a bit too much?

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,470
Do you think that women
don't have sexual desires?

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm talking about
only Hachi right now!

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,350
Don't you dare group her together with
the easy women looking after you!

56
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,410
I don't necessarily think

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,110
that the women wanting to sleep
with me are easy.

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,050
I do think they're shallow though.

59
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,680
They're all just lonely.

60
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,290
In Hachi's case,
don't you think that

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,190
maybe she was lonely too;
after her break-up with her boyfriend?

62
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,500
But you hesitated
to take action,

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,430
so Takumi ended up
walking off with her.

64
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,810
It may very well have happened
in the heat of the moment,

65
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,140
but knowing Hachi,

66
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,370
she may become more and
more serious about him.

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,450
But if Takumi continues treating
this relationship in that manner,

68
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,680
Hachi is obviously gonna get hurt.

69
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,950
Are you okay with that, Nobu?
I don't like it one bit.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,160
You know, it's a bit surprising.

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,130
No matter how I look at it,

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,790
your actions are just as bad
as Takumi's,

73
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,300
so you're not in any position
to talk that way about him.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,510
But for you to do so shows
how fond you are of Hachi.

75
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,500
Hachi's the one who's fond of me.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,080
Stop talking about her
as if she's some dog.

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,880
You know, all the women
I know want me,

78
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,010
whether it's my body
or my heart.

79
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,040
But with Hachi,
she's just kind to me

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,820
without expecting anything
from me in return.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,810
I really feel a sense of love.

82
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,520
But when you fall in love,

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,260
it's human nature to want everything
about that person for yourself.

84
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,640
Is that so?

85
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,530
If you want her, go for it.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,410
Well, I do believe that,
like you just said,

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,040
real love is expressed by
looking after the one you love...

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,710
without expecting...
anything in return...

89
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,650
But I can't take this.
I cannot forgive that guy!

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,860
I can feel true love
from you, Nobu.

91
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,140
Sir! Your change!

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,300
Welcome! Table for one?

93
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,720
What's the matter?

94
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,050
Sorry. It's not important.

95
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,950
Just tell me!
What time do you think it is?

96
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,990
It's four in the morning!

97
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,430
You can't hold back now after
calling me out at this hour.

98
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,100
Coffee.

99
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,270
Certainly.

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,640
What about you?
A café au lait?

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,260
I-I'm fine.

102
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,370
Order something.
I'll treat if you're short on cash.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,830
Are you hungry?

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,910
To be honest, I was worried
because I have no money.

105
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,010
How much do you need?
I don't have a lot on me, though.

106
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,510
No, it's not that!

107
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,850
I forgot my purse.

108
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,090
I realized I didn't have it with me
after I sat down in the restaurant.

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
So I called you to save me.

110
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,930
Don't laugh!

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,730
So that's all it was?

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,470
Then why didn't you say so
in the first place?

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,200
You said "help" with
such a stern voice.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
You had me wondering.

115
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,940
I said I'm sorry.

116
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
It's okay.
I'm relieved.

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm relieved that it wasn't
something more serious.

118
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,910
Anyway, order something.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,650
What are you hesitating for?
It's not like you.

120
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,760
They have cake.
Strawberry cake. Have it.

121
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,880
But what are you doing drinking tea
here alone at this time of night,

122
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,380
this close to your home?

123
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,520
Something did happen, right?
Did you have a fight with Nana?

124
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,790
Takumi is at our place.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,660
I didn't wanna get in their way.

126
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,200
When I look at these things,
it really doesn't seem like me.

127
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,170
Do I really look like this?

128
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,420
Sorry, were you sleeping?

129
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,250
You fall asleep right after
having sex, don't you?

130
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,550
You fell asleep quickly
the last time, too.

131
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
I wasn't really asleep
the last time.

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,500
I was faking it because I was sad
that you were so quick to leave.

133
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,600
But now, I know you'll stay
with me when you have the time.

134
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,830
What did you just say?

135
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,940
I said you were holding back
the last time,

136
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,640
but today you were amazing.

137
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,140
Who taught you?

138
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,580
No one!

139
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,950
I'm kinda jealous.

140
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,980
There's not one thing about me
that you should be jealous about!

141
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,210
Don't you have a boyfriend?

142
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,190
That's not a question you'd normally
ask in this situation.

143
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,190
No, I don't.

144
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,030
Really? I'm glad.

145
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,300
He's glad?!

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,460
But you're cute,
so I'll bet you're popular with the guys.

147
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,530
No way.
I'm not at all popular.

148
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,000
You're the popular one,
Mr. Takumi.

149
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,470
Please, drop the "Mr.".

150
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,310
T-Takumi, you're popular
with women,

151
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,680
so you must have many girlfriends.

152
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,080
No, no luck there.
Not at all.

153
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,840
No way.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,520
I may be stupid, but not stupid enough
to fall for that line.

155
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,250
Huh?

156
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,980
There's no way
you're not popular with girls.

157
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,090
No. I really am no good.
I lead such a lonely life.

158
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,490
There's just no way!

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,120
The fact is, I give my work priority,

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,220
and end up not paying enough
attention to any woman.

161
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm not one to answer
emails promptly,

162
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,130
and I'm often unable to
keep promises I make.

163
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,900
So I have never been in
a long-term relationship.

164
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,600
Every once in a while,
when I get some time off,

165
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,670
I'll contact a girl from the past
only to have her coldly tell me,

166
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,340
"I'm not interested in you."

167
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,170
What a waste!

168
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,650
But you can't help it with you
being so busy with your work.

169
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,690
You're the only one who's said
anything so understanding, Nana.

170
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,860
That's because, although
I'm a fan of yours,

171
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,790
I'm a fan of Trapnest
first and foremost.

172
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,290
I am counting on you
to continue to work hard

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,520
and produce new tunes.

174
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,200
You're really cute.

175
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,720
Nana...

176
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,430
I don't wanna give you up
to anyone.

177
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,330
Be mine forever.

178
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,970
So Takumi's there.

179
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,350
What for?

180
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,810
He came to do it with her.

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,350
No sooner than he arrives,
they're making out in the doorway.

182
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,270
Hachiko is in tears.

183
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,390
What the hell?
When did this happen?

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,250
I don't know.

185
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,260
There's no way you couldn't
have known.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,560
When I say I don't know,
I mean I don't know!

187
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,260
But what's wrong with that?

188
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,960
Hachiko is free to go out
with whoever she wants.

189
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,390
But I have a problem with
letting her date Takumi.

190
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,570
He has always been such a womanizer,
it's not funny.

191
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,030
But if she's in love with him
it can't be helped!

192
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,670
A woman's happiness is to be
in the arms of the man she loves,

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,970
regardless what kinda person he is!

194
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,270
She'll have no regrets,
no matter how badly she gets hurt!

195
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,850
That may be true for you, but...

196
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,750
Besides, given Hachiko's cuteness,

197
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,350
Takumi may end up falling
head over heels for Nana!

198
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,820
Just like how Ren fell for me.

199
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,730
There's always a small chance
that will happen, but...

200
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,660
Anyway, I'm on Hachi's side.

201
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,190
I really was thinking

202
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,030
how great it would be
if she found a boyfriend.

203
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,440
On top of that,
if this boyfriend is Takumi,

204
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,910
whom she's always adored,
all the better.

205
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,440
I wanna cheer her on
as a friend.

206
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,240
But...

207
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,580
Why did it have to be
Takumi of all people?

208
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,820
What you are saying
isn't making any sense.

209
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,550
Besides, aren't you the one

210
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,610
who set up the meeting between
Takumi and Nana?

211
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,790
I know that. But I never imagined
that it would end up like this!

212
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah. You never knew about
the terrible things

213
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,490
Takumi has been known to do.

214
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,090
Come on! I could care less
about the terrible things

215
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,570
Takumi has been known to do!

216
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,440
Then what do you not like
about this?

217
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,470
Why does Trapnest continue to take away
the things I hold most dear to me?

218
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:45,280
But it's not as if either Ren
or Hachiko belong to me.

219
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,890
I realize it's not right to think
in those terms.

220
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,730
No matter if
we're always together,

221
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,600
each one of us is living
a different life.

222
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,230
I know it's impossible to try
and make someone yours.

223
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,340
But there are times

224
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,070
when it makes me so lonely,
it's unbearable.

225
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,510
Maybe I was in fact thinking
of Hachiko as my pet dog.

226
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm the worst.

227
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,070
I'm gonna catch a cab and
go straight to the office now.

228
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,810
Come with me.

229
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,740
You can continue
this discussion with Ren.

230
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,650
INCOMING MAIL
REN
THE PARTY IS OVER.
I'LL BE AT HOME WAITING FOR YOU.

231
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,990
Sorry, Yasu.

232
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,950
I keep depending on
your kindness, don't I?

233
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,420
I realize it, but...

234
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,760
If you do, then I wish
you'd grow up already.

235
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,160
As long as you keep calling me out
at this hour,

236
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm never gonna find a girlfriend.

237
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,740
I'll try to grow up
before you get back with Reira.

238
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,140
Why should I hafta get
back together with Reira?

239
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,910
Because my fate is to
have everyone I hold dear

240
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,010
taken away by
the members of Trapnest.

241
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,240
Then the same goes for me, too.

242
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,290
The woman I was dating left me
to go to Tokyo with Trapnest.

243
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,960
My best friend was recruited
to join the band.

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,430
And on top of that, our vocalist
is Trapnest's guitarist's woman.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,000
You're right!

246
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,630
Why am I being all cheerful about
seeing the guitarist of our biggest enemy

247
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,070
this early in the morning?!

248
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,070
Cheerful? That's good to hear.

249
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,740
Maybe I should go home.

250
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,020
Go and see him.

251
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,810
Damn! Why is this happening?!

252
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,150
This must be what Hachi means

253
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,590
when she talks about the Demon Lord!

254
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,420
Or it's more like Trapnest is
an army of Demon Lords.

255
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,650
You and Ren are really alike.

256
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,960
I just remembered

257
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,590
how Ren told me something similar
to what you just said,

258
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,640
before he left for Tokyo.

259
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,340
That in the end, we are all alone.

260
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,740
No matter how hard you try to be close
to someone, you cannot become one,

261
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,340
and it's impossible to
make someone belong to you.

262
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,820
I know that it's impossible.

263
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:40,020
But sometimes I really strongly wish
that Nana belonged only to me.

264
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,900
Then I could put her in the pocket
of my leather jacket

265
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,440
and take her to Tokyo with me.

266
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,300
No, she wouldn't fit in there.

267
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,580
Why not just tell her that you
want her to come with you?

268
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,680
That's cool!
I'll give it a try.

269
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,860
Yeah, do it.

270
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,100
You can live your life
however you like.

271
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,210
There's a sea in Tokyo, too.
I had forgotten.

272
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,450
Nice view, isn't it?
Wanna live here with me?

273
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,590
I'll think about it.

274
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,370
That day, Takumi ate most of
the leftovers from the night before.

275
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,470
Then right after noon, he told me
he had work to do and left.

276
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,920
I was restless,

277
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,320
wanting to tell Nana everything
that happened as soon as possible,

278
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,160
before this feeling of happiness
had a chance to cool down.

279
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,940
Nana's late.
She said she had no plans today.

280
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,410
Is she still at Ren's place?
I wonder.

281
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,640
But if Takumi has work today,
then so does Ren.

282
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,910
Even on our days off,
we have things to do.

283
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,010
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

284
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,650
I wonder, does he
really have to work?

285
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,030
No, I'll believe him.

286
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,630
I'm not like those other women.
I'm gonna understand him.

287
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,660
To Nana. What time will you
be coming home?

288
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,870
There are many things
I wanna talk to you about.

289
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,270
WHAT TIME WILL YOU
BE COMING HOME?
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
There are many things
I wanna talk to you about.

290
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,830
WHAT TIME WILL YOU
BE COMING HOME?
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

291
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,070
You're home!

292
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm home...
Wow, that has a nice ring to it.

293
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,090
Sorry, sorry. It's you, Nobu.
I thought it was Nana.

294
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,560
Ah, Nana's not here?

295
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,560
No, I think
she's at Ren's place.

296
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,390
I see.

297
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,630
Sorry. Anyway, come in.

298
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,960
I was just writing Nana an email,

299
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,370
but why don't we give her
a call instead?

300
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,800
Ah, no. I didn't come here
to see Nana. It's you, Hachi.

301
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,370
Er, Nana. I need to talk to you.

302
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,680
To me?

303
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm fine! I'm not gonna rely
on the power of alcohol.

304
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,110
What's the matter?

305
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,820
Did something happen?

306
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,400
I can't.

307
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,410
Can't what?

308
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,800
I'll be back again!

309
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,500
What the?!

310
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,380
There's not a single thing
I'm superior in.

311
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,070
It's impossible.
I can't compete against him.

312
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,340
What are you talking about?
Let me help you!

313
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,020
But... I promise you,
one day, I'll be better than him.

314
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,710
Than who?

315
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,610
Takumi.

316
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,300
You have two messages.

317
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,980
Yasu! It's me, Naoki!
I also left a message on your cell!

318
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,150
I wanna meet with you while I'm off,
so could you make some time for me?

319
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,780
I'll invite Reira, too!
See ya later!

320
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,320
What is it with everyone?

321
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,990
This is Kawano of Gaia Records.

322
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,320
I had a chance to review the demo tape
and live video you sent us.

323
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,620
I would be interested in
talking with you.

324
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,080
Are you serious about this?

325
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,620
That comes out to 1,215 yen.

326
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,850
Oh, Nana, I'll take care of that.

327
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,850
It's okay. They're my things.

328
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,500
I reached into the sky

329
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,900
I reached into the sky
Then I'll get this, too.

330
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,590
I reached into the sky

331
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,930
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

332
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,940
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
Hey, Nana.

333
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,900
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

334
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,040
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
We were always together, yet,
I didn't understand you one bit.

335
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,340
We were always together, yet,
I didn't understand you one bit.

336
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,510
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky
We were always together, yet,
I didn't understand you one bit.

337
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,340
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

338
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:50,910
Like colorful balloons

339
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,580
Like colorful balloons
Forgive me for not realizing that
I had been hurting you.

340
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,280
Like colorful balloons

341
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,550
I'm alone

342
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,280
My hand had no place to go

343
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,920
And gently you took it

344
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,100
Starless night

345
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,300
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

346
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,100
I want to feel your warmth

347
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,980
Tears are falling down

348
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,070
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

349
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,340
Of your hand holding mine

350
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,580
Starless night

351
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,780
Even if your lips
spill weak words

352
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,660
I want to believe in your warmth

353
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,320
Endless love

354
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,560
I even love your contradictions

355
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,500
You are my shining star

356
00:21:52,570 --> 00:22:01,640
You are my shining star
