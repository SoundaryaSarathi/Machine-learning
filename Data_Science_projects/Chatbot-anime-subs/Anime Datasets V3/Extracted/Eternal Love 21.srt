<i>[Episode 21]</i>

3
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,221
The Lord of Numinous Treasures'
Heavenâ€™s Spring

4
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:33,562
can heal a common wound
in three to five days.

5
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,811
However, you've been here for days

6
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,474
and you don't seem any better.

7
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,383
It seems the Soul Slayer enshrined in
the Mermaid Clan's

8
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:43,290
Temple of Witchcraft is really powerful.

9
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:49,348
You've found the most
honest maid to serve her.

10
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:54,597
You haven't been to
the Hall of Beautiful Youth for days.

11
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:57,992
It's obvious that
you're one affectionate man.

12
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,037
Yet you have to pretend otherwise.

13
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:02,907
That's quite a torment as well.

14
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,703
Uncle Lian Song.

15
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:10,015
I heard that during our battle
with the Mermaid Clan

16
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:12,656
Li Yuan also escaped
from Arctic Lands.

17
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:18,109
Do you still remember anything about
the Crown Prince of the Ghost Tribe?

18
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,502
Li Yuan?

19
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,581
I met him 70,000 years ago.

20
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:28,360
He might be ruthless, but he's not
good enough to be the Ghost Lord.

21
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,173
But I've heard that
the current Ghost Lord

22
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,943
Li Jing, fools around all the time.

23
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,469
Both of them are just as incompetent.

24
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,461
Exactly.

25
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,038
Father.

26
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:48,033
Qing Cang's two sons are
indeed incompetent.

27
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,269
Ye Hua is here to nurse his injuries.

28
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,057
However, you're here to avoid
going to the assembly.

29
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:57,960
Father, you've wronged me.

30
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,864
I'm just worried about Ye Hua's injuries.

31
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:02,330
So, I'm here to check on him.

32
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,844
I'll head over to the assembly now.

33
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,274
It's the Realm of Supreme Purity
after we go through here.

34
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,769
Consort Su Jin.

35
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,387
Second Prince.

36
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,706
It's the Water King of the North Sea.

37
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,896
I've been demoted. How could I
still be addressed as a prince?

38
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:58,319
<i>In Su Jin's mind, Second Prince
will always remain a prince.</i>

39
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,750
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

40
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,735
Is the consort with child again?

41
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,911
Yes.

42
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,800
I've been having severe morning sickness.

43
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:19,800
Su Su, look.

44
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,762
You are both blessed.

45
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,223
This is...

46
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,754
She is...

47
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,838
She is Ye Hua's savior
in the Mortal Realm.

48
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,346
She's a mortal. Her name is Su Su.

49
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,874
As she's carrying Ye Hua's child

50
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,007
Ye Hua has kept her
in the Celestial Palace.

51
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,658
Ye Hua's savior in the Mortal Realm?

52
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,607
Exactly.

53
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:50,127
Ye Hua was injured in a fierce fight
with Scarlet Flame Golden Lion.

54
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,735
This young lady here saved him.

55
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:59,064
I didn't expect Ye Hua
to have such a brief romance.

56
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,922
Didn't Your Highness used to
have many beauties in your hall as well?

57
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:10,040
By the way, Second Prince

58
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,536
do you know where the Crown Prince went?

59
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:16,041
I heard from
the Lord of Numinous Treasures

60
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,139
that Ye Hua has been in
Heaven's Springs since this morning.

61
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,105
You're right.

62
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:23,343
Ye Hua was severely wounded.

63
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,985
It's better for him to recuperate there.

64
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,757
Su Su, let's go.

65
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:39,482
Second Prince, Consort Shao Xing,
we'll take our leave.

66
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,552
Shao Xing.

67
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:52,218
Why do you keep staring at that mortal?

68
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,848
Consort Su Jin.

69
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,718
Am I all you could see?

70
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,922
Have you not noticed this consort?

71
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:13,675
Consort Su Jin.

72
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:16,161
This lady isn't conferred any titles
in the Celestial Palace.

73
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,500
We really couldn't...

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,596
How dare you!

75
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,757
All of you serve
in the Heavenly Lord's hall.

76
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,526
Could you not know that
she belongs to the Crown Prince?

77
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,591
Consort, we do know that.

78
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,391
It's just that
the Crown Prince gave orders

79
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,199
to treat
the Hall of Beautiful Youth's lady

80
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,461
according to
the Celestial Palace's regulations.

81
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,569
Consort Su Jin, please forgive us!

82
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,762
Consort.

83
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,738
Please don't make it hard for them.

84
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:44,963
I really don't have any title.

85
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,384
All right, you may all get up.

86
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,543
Yes.

87
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:58,495
Are both the Heavenly Lord
and the Crown Prince inside?

88
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,742
The Crown Prince has
been here for two hours.

89
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,261
The Heavenly Lord just arrived.

90
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,684
Would you like us
to announce your arrival?

91
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,822
That's not necessary.

92
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:09,091
- But...
- Should they both blame you

93
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:11,286
I will take responsibility
for it. Fear not.

94
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,180
I'm from the Realm of Supreme Purity.

95
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,720
The lady of this hall has given orders
for you to take her fan

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,846
to the Realm of Supreme Purity.

97
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,596
Her fan?

98
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,504
It's a fan with a scenic drawing.

99
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:38,403
She handed it to you a while ago.

100
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:43,208
Find it quickly and bring it
to the Realm of Supreme Purity.

101
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,970
Yes.

102
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,706
Although Qing Qiu replied saying
that Bai Qian is still in meditation

103
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:08,004
the wedding mustn't be postponed.

104
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,264
I understand.

105
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,671
Bai Qian is the Fox King's only daughter.

106
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:13,889
She also inherited the position
of Queen of the East.

107
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,850
She can't possibly be
some mild-tempered woman.

108
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,466
Should she learn that
you are expecting a child

109
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:24,639
and behave unreasonably
you must learn to be tolerant.

110
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes.

111
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,956
Su Su.

112
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:47,941
Heavenly Lord.

113
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,611
- Heavenly Lord.
- Heavenly Lord.

114
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,475
What are you doing here?

115
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:55,596
I...

116
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,943
Consort Le Xu is concerned that
Su Su will be bored

117
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:03,086
staying in the Hall of Beautiful Youth

118
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:06,630
so she asked me to show her around.

119
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:10,366
How can a mortal be present at
the Lord of Numinous Treasures' assembly?

120
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,768
If there's nothing else to do
she'd better leave soon.

121
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,451
Yes.

122
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,616
Su Su, don't worry.

123
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,479
You have Ye Hua.

124
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,389
The Heavenly Lord won't harm you.

125
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,014
Why would you come here?

126
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,739
Ye Hua, I brought Su Su here.

127
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:48,999
Don't blame her.

128
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,937
It's best for the consort to steer clear
of the affairs in Xiwu Palace.

129
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,089
You're right.

130
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:05,293
You're the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe.

131
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:09,150
I am but one of the many consorts
in the Heavenly Lord's harem.

132
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,326
I've been too meddlesome.

133
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,488
Don't let her get close to you anymore.

134
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,818
According to the rites
of the Celestial Tribe

135
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,041
you shouldn't be here.

136
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,178
I'll get changed and escort you back.

137
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,446
Take me with you!

138
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,197
Please? Take me!

139
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,446
It won't be just the lords there, all
the important deities will also be there.

140
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,544
How can I take you there
when you were not invited?

141
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:57,009
I'm a maid. I can just follow you in.

142
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,822
Today, I'll be the Star Lord's maid.

143
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,673
- I wouldn't dare.
- You would.

144
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:04,924
- I wouldn't dare.
- You would.

145
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,385
Shao Xing is with child.

146
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:30,291
I've brought her here today to ask
Father to make a celestial decree

147
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,090
so that I can confer on her
a formal title.

148
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:38,153
You gave up a promising future
because of her.

149
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm already disappointed in you.

150
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,850
Yet you still dare to bring this woman to
the Lord of Numinous Treasures' assembly.

151
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,875
Are you trying to remind me
just how unfilial you are?

152
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,085
I hadn't thought it through.

153
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,999
Please don't be mad, Father.

154
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,900
Please don't be mad, Father.

155
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,943
Step down now.

156
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,563
Don't disturb the Lord of
Numinous Treasures' assembly.

157
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,644
This is bad! It's the Lord of
Numinous Treasures' magical beast!

158
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,903
Be careful, Father!

159
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,534
Little Princess!
Little Princess!

160
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,745
This phoenix is still untamed.

161
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:56,004
Disperse!

162
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,347
Don't say a word.

163
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,601
My Lord.

164
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,102
What trouble did she get into?

165
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,937
Why is she bleeding?

166
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,975
The Little Princess insisted on
going to the assembly with me.

167
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:10,990
Someone dropped Kunlun Mountain's
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun

168
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,548
and startled the Lord of
Numinous Treasures' phoenix.

169
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:18,301
The phoenix lost control
and charged at the Little Princess.

170
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,498
You are all to step out.

171
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:28,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

172
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:40,474
My Lord, allow me to take
a look at this young lady.

173
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,679
Step out.

174
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:45,885
Yes.

175
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,510
I gave the Jade Purity Fan
of Kunlun to Su Su.

176
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,678
She didn't know that it's a
magical artifact of Kunlun Mountain.

177
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:06,507
I thought that as a mortal

178
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,441
she wouldn't be able to
wield a magical artifact

179
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,015
but I didn't expect it to
stir up so much trouble.

180
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:13,788
I handled it poorly.

181
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,481
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

182
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,336
Do you know who was injured?

183
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,257
I do not know.

184
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,867
It was Bai Qian's niece, Bai Feng Jiu!

185
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,211
Bai Qian has yet to marry
into the Celestial Tribe

186
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,375
and yet this mortal has already
injured her niece!

187
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,430
Should Qing Qiu blame us for it

188
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,778
how would you have me respond to them?

189
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:37,945
I'm willing to ask for
their forgiveness in person.

190
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,864
Ask for forgiveness?

191
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,694
- Get up.
- Yes.

192
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,753
Your fault lies in negligence.

193
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,281
What about this mortal?

194
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,930
I've been wronged.

195
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,699
Heavenly Lord, please investigate this.

196
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,101
You were wronged?

197
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:01,630
I didn't know that the fan is
a true magical artifact.

198
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,484
In the celestial regulations

199
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:06,031
one is not spared for one's ignorance.

200
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:10,124
I didn't mean to barge in there.

201
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,327
Another celestial maid
passed on a message.

202
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:15,773
She said that my mistress asked me
to bring the fan to her.

203
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,290
Which maid?

204
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,387
Do you know her?

205
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:24,487
Heavenly Lord, please investigate this.

206
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,160
I didn't send any message to Nai Nai.

207
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,781
Someone must have framed me.

208
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,871
Atrocious!

209
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:34,643
You're saying that a deity
is out to frame a mortal?

210
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,009
I don't mean to say so
but you also heard her...

211
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,035
That's enough!

212
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,074
Su Su has offended you.
Please forgive her.

213
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,915
Father.

214
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,092
The celestial maid from
the Hall of Beautiful Youth

215
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:00,766
has only been recently promoted
to serve in the Celestial Palace.

216
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,286
She's unaware of regulations here.

217
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,487
This is also her first time
in such a grave situation

218
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,249
so she's too scared to admit her mistake.

219
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,183
Father, you don't have to be
so angry about a maid's words.

220
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:13,832
Nai Nai might be of a lowly status
but she's very honest.

221
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:17,934
Why would she deny her own mistake
and frame someone else?

222
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,211
Heavenly Lord...

223
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:20,239
Shut up!

224
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,076
Heavenly Lord.

225
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,984
Please allow me to speak.

226
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,700
What do you want to say?

227
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,229
I'm to be blamed for taking Su Su
to the Realm of Supreme Purity.

228
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:42,557
If you blame her

229
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,487
I'm willing to be punished in her stead.

230
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,653
You're asking to be punished?

231
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:52,884
Yes, I'm willing to be punished
in her stead.

232
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,018
Matters of Xiwu Palace need not
trouble any outsiders.

233
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:59,692
If Su Su is to be punished,
she will take her own punishment.

234
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,621
It has nothing to do with the consort.

235
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,201
Heavenly Lord!

236
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,038
Heavenly Lord, I just learned that
the beast got into trouble

237
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,902
and I made my way here
as fast as I could.

238
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,958
I thank everyone for taming the beast.

239
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:23,336
However, I don't know why it
suddenly lost control today.

240
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:38,550
A maid dropped this fan.

241
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,089
She startled the phoenix.

242
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:43,736
I am reprimanding them for it now.

243
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:47,421
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

244
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:58,154
Does the Heavenly Lord know who
this fan belonged to?

245
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,429
I do.

246
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,832
However, you couldn't have known
that that beast almost hurt

247
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:07,494
High Immortal Si Yin 70,000 years ago.

248
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,857
It hurt High Immortal Si Yin?

249
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,095
Exactly.

250
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:15,084
If I remember correctly,
the Ghost Lord was present as well.

251
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,903
He was injured by the phoenix.

252
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,916
I wonder if the Ghost Lord
still remembers that?

253
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:24,751
You're right.

254
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:28,480
A-Yin and I once had
a fight with that phoenix.

255
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,571
Then he subdued it with
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

256
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:40,678
I didn't know that the Ghost Lord
and Si Yin were such friends.

257
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:43,417
It was just a coincidence.

258
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,555
We weren't... friends.

259
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,403
Since the Heavenly Lord has
family matters to handle

260
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:51,696
I shouldn't be present.

261
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,090
I'll take my leave now.

262
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,744
Do feel free to leave, Ghost Lord.

263
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,111
Everyone.

264
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,988
I take my leave now.

265
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:16,257
It's perhaps because Si Yin once
took on the phoenix with this fan

266
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:20,503
that it agitated the beast
and caused it to attack.

267
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,553
Whatever the reason, it's Xiwu Palace
who wrecked the assembly.

268
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:33,811
Do forgive me, sir.

269
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,103
It was just a beast that died.

270
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,974
Why would the Heavenly Lord get so angry?

271
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:46,299
Not only is your phoenix dead

272
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,951
but it also injured
the Little Princess of Qing Qiu.

273
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,213
All in all, it's actually my fault.

274
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:56,637
That phoenix has yet to be totally tamed

275
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:58,866
but I brought it with me
to the Nine Heavens.

276
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,801
Hence, such a disaster happened.

277
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:04,478
If anyone is to be punished,
I should be the first one.

278
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,037
You've overstated, Your Lordship.

279
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,916
Since the Lord of Numinous Treasures
has taken the blame for you

280
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,257
you must bear his kindness in mind.

281
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,789
Su Jin, get up.

282
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,195
Yes.

283
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,558
The two of you are to step down.

284
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:24,715
Hold on.

285
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,353
Although His Lordship pleaded
on your behalf

286
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,897
I still can't let you off so easily.

287
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:35,758
From today onward, all personnel in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth are grounded.

288
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:40,018
None of you are to leave Xiwu Palace
without my permission.

289
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,548
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,863
Our mentor has arrived as well.

291
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,580
Why don't we go and greet him?

292
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,810
Ye Hua.

293
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,654
Since your mentor is here
you should greet him right away.

294
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:03,969
Yes.

295
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,169
Escort them back.

296
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:11,444
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,076
Thank you for your assistance.

298
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:48,096
Fortunately, Ghost Lord
Li Jing came looking for me.

299
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:51,028
Otherwise, judging by
the Heavenly Lord's temper

300
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,999
he might have taken
that young lady's life.

301
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,343
Ghost Lord Li Jing?

302
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:03,688
It was his mount that set Zhaohua Palace
on fire accidentally a few days ago.

303
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:06,449
It also almost injured Miss Su Su.

304
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:13,355
That's why he decided to help her
today and why he meddled in this matter.

305
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,345
Ye Hua.

306
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:22,673
Thinking back, your second uncle
was such a favorite then.

307
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:26,442
Yet now he's been demoted to North Sea
just because of a woman.

308
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,315
You witnessed all that.

309
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:33,025
A mortal is after all just a mortal.

310
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,951
This isn't the right place for her.

311
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:38,952
You can still keep her alive
if you send her away soon.

312
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:53,463
Step out now.

313
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:07,969
Kneel.

315
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:14,480
Why would you plead for that mortal?

316
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,631
I think that the accident wasn't severe
enough to sentence that mortal to death.

317
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,404
Since she won't be sentenced to death

318
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:26,732
I'd rather that she not be punished
if she's just going to suffer a bit.

319
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:28,199
Su Jin.

320
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:33,275
Don't try to show off and
act smart in my presence.

321
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:36,519
I wouldn't dare show off
in the Heavenly Lord's presence.

322
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,070
I'm also worried that that woman will
be a hindrance to the Crown Prince.

323
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:47,730
Therefore, I'm willing to
assist the Heavenly Lord

324
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,263
in getting rid of Su Su.

325
00:26:57,336 --> 00:26:58,604
Su Jin.

326
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,248
When you shared my concern
and asked to become my concubine

327
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:10,930
you won people over for me
and I agreed to grant you a wish.

328
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:16,252
Now, you're going to assist me
in getting rid of that woman.

329
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:19,174
What wish is it that you seek this time?

330
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,420
It's the same wish.

331
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:27,453
The same wish?

332
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:33,096
Tell me what it is
that you're so persistent about.

333
00:27:47,513 --> 00:27:49,500
There's only one wish that I seek.

334
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,768
If I can have that mortal killed

335
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:57,535
the Heavenly Lord has to make me
a side consort of the Crown Prince.

336
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:03,150
You wish to be married into Xiwu Palace?

337
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:07,048
This is the only wish
I have ever had in my life.

338
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,864
Tell me.

339
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:14,394
Did you ask to be my concubine
so as to pave the way for this?

340
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,476
Exactly.

341
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,685
Very good.

342
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:25,027
You're the type of person who
should be by Ye Hua's side.

343
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:27,358
You know what it is you want.

344
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:31,368
You also know what to do
to get what you want.

345
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,602
Fine.

346
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:35,166
I will agree to it.

347
00:28:38,212 --> 00:28:43,108
It doesn't matter if I bestow
a few of my concubines to my grandson.

348
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:46,117
Besides, I've never lain with you.

349
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:50,796
Why would I keep you with me
to waste your youth away?

350
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,101
Heavenly Lord, you agreed?

351
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,450
Exactly.

352
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:59,445
I agreed to your request.

353
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,963
Thank you, Heavenly Lord!

354
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:03,963
However...

355
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:07,702
Bear in mind...

356
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,586
Don't forget what you promised me.

357
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,252
Rest assured, Heavenly Lord.

358
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:18,201
I'll come up with a plan.

359
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,263
Even the Crown Prince won't
be able to save her.

360
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,871
<i>Could that beast have mistaken
Miss Su Su for A-Yin as well?</i>

361
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:50,553
My Lord.

362
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,599
Lady Su Su has been saved
by the Lord of Numinous Treasures.

363
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,040
She was escorted back to Xiwu Palace and
grounded in the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

364
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,558
Grounded?

365
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,826
Someone in the Celestial Palace
is certainly out to take her life.

366
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:08,066
A mortal can't be safe
in the Nine Heavens.

367
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,367
You worry too much, My Lord.

368
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,834
She is already carrying
the Crown Prince's child.

369
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,224
She won't be in any danger
here in the Celestial Palace.

370
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,296
That's hard to say.

371
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:25,083
Isn't Your Highness overly
concerned about that mortal?

372
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:30,673
Ever since you got pregnant
I've been very tolerant of you.

373
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:33,265
Why have you become
even more unreasonable?

374
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,388
My Lord...

375
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:38,441
This is all because of you.

376
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,400
Because of me?

377
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:47,597
Do you think that my feelings
for you aren't real?

378
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:51,548
I don't wish to discuss that with you.

379
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,200
My Lord!

380
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:56,732
Don't worry.

381
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,765
I won't go looking for that lady
in Xiwu Palace.

382
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:28,787
Your Lordship...

383
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,213
Don't say a word.

384
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:33,477
Your Lordship, are you going to save me?

385
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,049
If you save me again

386
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,657
how is my debt... ever going to be paid?

387
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,398
Stop talking.

388
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:47,730
My Lord...

389
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:20,529
Lady Su Su...

390
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:22,584
I shouldn't have trusted
anyone so easily.

391
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:23,900
I've implicated you.

392
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,728
Please punish me!

393
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:30,191
I'm totally helpless in here.

394
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:32,890
I don't even have the right to speak.

395
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,208
As a matter of fact, I'm the one
who had you implicated.

396
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,816
I was too foolish!

397
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,509
Nai Nai...

398
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,420
You...

399
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,752
Do you know how Ye Hua is
related to Consort Su Jin?

400
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:58,079
I've only heard that she was brought up
by the Crown Prince's mother.

401
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,709
She was raised
alongside the Crown Prince.

402
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,912
Su Su.

403
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:14,737
<i>I came here to repay his kindness
and yet I ended up implicating him.</i>

404
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:18,056
<i>He used his magical powers to heal me.</i>

405
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:23,456
<i>If I stay here
I might embarrass Qing Qiu.</i>

406
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:42,503
<i>This is really bad...</i>

407
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:45,103
<i>I can't walk any further...</i>

408
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:49,067
<i>Feng Jiu, don't pass out.</i>

409
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,782
<i>Don't pass out.</i>

410
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,885
Su Su.

411
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,199
Ye Hua...

412
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,597
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:45,565
Ever since I got pregnant
I've had mood swings.

414
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:48,929
This isn't your fault.

415
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:52,226
There are just too many
regulations in the Celestial Palace.

416
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,733
We can't be as carefree
as we were in Mount Junji.

417
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,717
Yesterday...

418
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:01,688
Yesterday! You're not to be blamed.

419
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:04,833
I've been thinking...

420
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:08,349
The Heavenly Lord
is prejudiced against me

421
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:11,864
because you married me in
the Mortal Realm without his permission.

422
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:18,978
Ye Hua...

423
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:23,193
I want to spend my days here with you.

424
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:26,344
Just like we did in Mount Junji.

425
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:27,893
All right?

426
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:37,108
Tonight... Will you still come to me?

427
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,375
No.

428
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:51,559
I understand.

429
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,800
You're the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe.

430
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,911
You have to see to official matters.

431
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:04,782
If I hold on to you, the others
will call me a femme fatale.

432
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:09,512
That's what they call
those women in the plays.

433
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:14,045
There aren't any of those mortal plays
in the Celestial Palace.

434
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:23,454
I have to go now.

435
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,025
Your Lordship.

436
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:20,563
Report to the Heavenly Lord that
the Little Princess of Qing Qiu is fine.

437
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,800
It's good that she's all right.

438
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,420
Has the Little Princess
returned to Qing Qiu?

439
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:37,619
I'll take my leave now.

440
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,355
My Lord.

441
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:51,496
Have you found Li Yuan?

442
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,260
I did but...

443
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,802
He's in the Far North.

444
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:57,000
The Far North?

445
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,092
Yes, Li Yuan has raised
a rebellion in the Far North.

446
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:10,871
Ghost Lord.

447
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:14,742
The Heavenly Lord invites you
to the Grand Hall for a discussion.

448
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,621
I heard you.

449
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,351
- Where are you going?
- The Grand Hall.

450
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:29,711
I'm meeting the Heavenly Lord.

451
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:30,713
I don't believe that!

452
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:32,411
Why would the Heavenly Lord see you?

453
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,900
You're not from the Celestial Palace.

454
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,510
What important matter could
he possibly have to discuss with you?

455
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,277
You're obviously going
to see that mortal!

456
00:39:38,277 --> 00:39:40,679
You're bullying me because
I can't leave this house.

457
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,012
I can't hold you back.

458
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,244
That's enough!

459
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:47,242
I'll tell you why the Heavenly Lord
asked to see me.

460
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:49,672
It's because you stole the military seal

461
00:39:49,672 --> 00:39:51,773
and Yan Zhi saved Li Yuan.
Li Yuan escaped.

462
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,443
They raised a rebellion in the Far North!

463
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:56,672
A rebellion?

464
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,726
Should the Heavenly Lord
blame anyone for it

465
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:04,063
I won't be able to save you
if he decides to punish you.

466
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,324
Stay in this room!

467
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:27,074
<i>It felt great to be cuddled
in Lord Dong Hua's arms...</i>

468
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:37,612
But isn't it wrong to deceive
my own savior?

469
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,668
His Lordship?

470
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:53,813
Come here.

471
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:09,215
The Heavenly Lord is furious?

472
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:10,418
Exactly.

473
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:13,791
Both the Ghost Lord and
the Crown Prince were summoned.

474
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:41,603
It says on the scroll that
the Scarlet Flame Golden Lion appeared

475
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:45,023
in the military camp of
Far North's rebel army.

476
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,871
The Scarlet Flame Golden Lion?

477
