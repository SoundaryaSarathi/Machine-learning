1
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:24,911
Nana!

2
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,221
I thought I might find you here.

3
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,721
He's so cool.
Matsushida the DJ!

4
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,481
Super cool! Super nice!

5
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,031
If you like him,
just tell him so.

6
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,731
If you're lucky,
he may make you his girlfriend.

7
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,101
No way. Matsushida is very popular
with the ladies

8
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,401
and I'll bet he fools around a lot.

9
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:47,491
Rumors are that he changes women
all the time.

10
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,201
He's so full of himself. I'm sure of it.
An enemy of women.

11
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,741
Then don't fall in love with him.

12
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,811
I like the way you said that.
Your comeback line.

13
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,681
You're starting to sound
a lot like Jun-chan.

14
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,211
Should I call you Sho-chan?

15
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,551
Everyone would become like this
after hanging out with you!

16
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,521
But Jun-chan doesn't talk
to me the same way now.

17
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,421
She's been so preoccupied with Kyosuke,
her personality is softening.

18
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,391
Like she's boneless.
She lacks something now.

19
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,301
But it's all right.
I have you now, Shoji.

20
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,901
So I'm merely Junko's replacement,
I guess.

21
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:18,501
By the way, Sho-chan, why'd you come
looking for me? Is it something urgent?

22
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,731
Don't call me Sho-chan!

23
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,741
I was at a bar drinking
with Kyosuke and Junko,

24
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,441
and thought I'd invite you.

25
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,671
You may get upset if you thought
we deliberately went drinking without you.

26
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,441
Yes! Let's go, let's go!
Let's drink!

27
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,181
You know, we seem to
always end up drinking.

28
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:36,591
For once, I'd like to try something
more refreshing, like go to the beach.

29
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:37,581
The beach?

30
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,561
Hey, summer vacation's coming up.

31
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,151
Why don't the four of us
go on a trip somewhere?

32
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:43,761
- The beach!
- The beach!

33
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:12,891
When I was darkness at that time

34
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,731
With trembling lips

35
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:18,821
In a corner of a room I cry

36
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,901
The more I struggle

37
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,741
The more this wound deepens

38
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,901
The broken promise hurt me

39
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,641
Nobody can save me

40
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:37,821
God, I have only one request

41
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:41,441
Stop tearing apart my love

42
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:44,791
I need your love

43
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,021
I'm a broken rose

44
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:50,961
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

45
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:53,131
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

46
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,901
I need your love

47
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:59,201
I'm a broken rose

48
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:02,141
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

49
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,101
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

50
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,071
I wanna need your love

51
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:12,311
I'm a broken rose

52
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,641
I wanna need your love

53
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,591
The beach is really nice.
This is what youth is all about.

54
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,501
I'm tired of the mountains.

55
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,671
Yeah, I've also grown tired
of watching the mountains.

56
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,101
I'm really sleepy.

57
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,971
Really, Jun-chan?
Then I guess we should get going.

58
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,451
What are you saying, Nana?
You're in this room with Junko.

59
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,741
I'll give my place to Kyosuke.
I'm gonna sleep with Shoji.

60
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,821
Huh?! Wh-What are you saying?

61
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,821
Come on. You've gotta be
more considerate, Shoji?

62
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:53,711
Hey!

63
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,861
Hurry up, let's go.

64
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,191
Well, I guess there was nothing
to worry about, after all.

65
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,431
You think it'll be that simple?

66
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,841
What are you thinking?

67
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,471
It's really okay.

68
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:12,841
There are two beds,
and I won't assault you, so don't worry.

69
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,011
I can even sing you a lullaby
like your grandmother.

70
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:19,681
Never mind! You may be fine with this,
but I'm not!

71
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:20,411
I might force myself on you!

72
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,321
Why?

73
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,321
Why, she says...

74
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,421
We're friends, right?

75
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:31,901
Nana, you really have
no clue about men.

76
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:36,491
A guy can do it with a girl even if
he has no feelings of love for her.

77
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,971
I know that.

78
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,371
But I believed that you weren't
like those types of guys.

79
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,811
Jun-chan even guaranteed it.

80
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,581
I'm afraid that I am like that!

81
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,351
I don't know what
Junko guaranteed you...

82
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,151
Hey, why are you crying?

83
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,861
Because I really like you, Shoji,

84
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,721
but you say things that
make me lose interest in you!

85
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:06,221
Ah, say, Nana.

86
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,491
When you say you like me,
you mean as a friend, right?

87
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:10,701
That's right.

88
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,301
You are the most precious
guy friend I have.

89
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,041
I like you not as the male species,
but as a human being!

90
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,441
But you're right.

91
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,981
Since you are a member
of the male species,

92
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,171
it may be dangerous to be sleeping
in the same room.

93
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,551
I was mistaken.

94
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,511
It's hard for a guy and a girl
to be friends, right, Sho-chan?

95
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,381
But we'll do our best.

96
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,291
Well then, I'd better be going back
to my own room.

97
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,951
Wait, Nana!
That's not a good idea!

98
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:38,821
Huh?

99
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,591
They're probably in the middle of...
you know...

100
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:42,991
Oh, right! What should I do?

101
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,301
When do you think
they'll be done?

102
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,241
Don't ask me.

103
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,171
We've got a problem.

104
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,541
All right, I've got it, Nana.
Sleep right there!

105
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,341
Huh?

106
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,811
I'll sleep in this bed.

107
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,911
No, Shoji! It's dangerous!

108
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,111
No need to worry!

109
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:03,951
Why's that?

110
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:07,411
You said a moment ago
that you lost interest in me, right?

111
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,991
I need to regain that trust that I lost!

112
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,861
For the sake of our friendship!
Good night!

113
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:16,431
Shoji...

114
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,441
I love you!

115
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:25,941
Go to sleep, little baby
Go to sleep, my child

116
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,311
You don't have to sing!

117
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:31,281
It's not a laughing matter.

118
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,251
Man. Thanks to that,
I didn't get any sleep at all.

119
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,411
Very well done, Sho-chan.

120
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,241
Don't call me, Sho-chan.

121
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:40,361
Take good care of Nana
from now on too, okay?

122
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,061
Yeah, yeah.
Although we're just friends.

123
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,361
Now I can go to Tokyo
without worry.

124
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,601
Jun-chan!

125
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,671
Come in! Let's swim together!

126
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,541
Okay, okay.

127
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,241
If you try to tan too much at once,
you'll regret it later.

128
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,651
Kyosuke, is Junko going
to Tokyo?

129
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,321
Yeah. So you heard.

130
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,221
Why? To do what?
It's not just a trip?

131
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,791
She's going to apply to
an art school in Tokyo next year.

132
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,031
Even if she doesn't get in,
she'll go to prep school.

133
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,161
Junko should be able to get in,
no problem.

134
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:24,901
But are you okay with this?
Why can you remain so cool?

135
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,801
Why?

136
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,061
Because I'm going too.

137
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,181
No! No! No! No!
Don't go, Jun-chan!

138
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,851
Aren't you gonna stop me?

139
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,621
You're right!

140
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,211
If Kyosuke decides not to go,
Jun-chan won't go either.

141
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,251
Don't go, Kyosuke!

142
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,261
Enough already, Nana!

143
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,551
Even if Kyosuke weren't going,
I'd still go!

144
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,401
I wanna devote myself
to studying art

145
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,761
at an art school in Tokyo!

146
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:58,761
It's my life!
You cannot tell me what to do!

147
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,531
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,511
You're right.
It's exactly as you say, Jun-chan.

149
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,341
But I'm gonna be so lonely.

150
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:18,981
I'll be even sadder than
I was on that snowy day.

151
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,071
You know, Nana...

152
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,011
I wanna go to Tokyo and try
and get into an art school as well.

153
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,101
Why don't you do the same?

154
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:45,541
Huh?

155
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,321
No way! Awesome!

156
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,591
I never knew there were
so many art schools in Tokyo!

157
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:55,281
I'm sure I will get accepted
into some place.

158
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,991
Yeah. Why not apply
to all of them?

159
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,861
Even if I don't get in a university

160
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,261
I can go to
a specialty college again.

161
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,801
What do you mean by that?

162
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,871
What meaning would it have
to do such a thing?

163
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,701
It's my life!

164
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,941
You cannot tell me what to do!

165
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:10,801
Ouch!

166
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:16,871
But... I wanna go to Tokyo
with everyone else!

167
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,181
Do as you wish.

168
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,711
Why should I care
how your life ends up?

169
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:21,871
Jun-chan!

170
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,281
I just abandoned you.
Why does that make you happy?

171
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,491
I must do my best!

172
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:27,891
No more staying out late!
No more clubbing!

173
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,891
Drop dead, Demon Lord!
No alcohol My goal: Tokyo
No more staying out late!
No more clubbing!

174
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:31,031
Drop dead, Demon Lord!
No alcohol My goal: Tokyo
Farewell, DJ Matsushida!

175
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:31,461
Farewell, DJ Matsushida!

176
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:34,131
I have no time to be thinking
about love.

177
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:34,971
When I get to Tokyo,

178
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,661
I'll see many handsome men
walking the streets...

179
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,001
This is the beginning of
our wonderful Tokyo life, Jun-chan!

180
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,301
I guess life doesn't always
work out as planned.

181
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:55,341
But why? I studied so hard
and yet I failed them all.

182
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,381
I knew it, it's my cursed fate!

183
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,281
Don't blame your fate for it.

184
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,321
It's fine for you two, Jun-chan.

185
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,581
You got into your university, so you can
play all you want this spring.

186
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,891
I'm not going to university
to have fun!

187
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,001
But Nana, it doesn't hafta be
a university for you, right?

188
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,401
A specialty college will do, right?

189
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,341
My parents tell me
they're only paying tuition

190
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,531
if I were going to university.

191
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:17,901
Then you'll hafta wait
a full year from spring.

192
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:22,441
But I don't wanna go to art university
desperately enough to wait a year.

193
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,081
What in heavens should I do?

194
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,481
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back
to the hotel?

195
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:32,121
I wanna get up early tomorrow
and visit a few real estate agents.

196
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:33,191
You're right.

197
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,241
Nana, since we've come
all the way here to Tokyo,

198
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,361
wanna try another shop?

199
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:47,701
Yes!

200
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,401
Which shop would be nice?

201
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,241
Sorry!

202
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:53,771
Go on ahead without us.

203
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,811
Okay. But don't drink too much.

204
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,511
You never stop worrying, do you?

205
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,811
Tokyo is quite the place.

206
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,691
It's this late at night,
but there are so many people.

207
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:10,031
I feel like such a country girl.

208
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,421
You are a country girl.

209
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,301
But more importantly, don't you think
the correct choice for you

210
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,391
would be to continue at
the local art school from April?

211
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:21,541
But I wanna come to Tokyo,
no matter what.

212
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:26,441
I kinda feel responsible for this.
I brought it up, after all.

213
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,911
But you know,
you're better off staying back home.

214
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,101
Absolutely not!

215
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:34,811
Do you want to be with Junko
that much?

216
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,051
But...

217
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,651
But you're going to Tokyo too,
aren't you, Shoji?

218
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,661
Actually, I think I'll remain here
and commute to prep school,

219
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,551
and then try to get in again next year.

220
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,561
Then I'm coming to Tokyo
to live here, too!

221
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,741
I don't need my parents to pay
for my living expenses.

222
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,341
I'll work freelance or whatever,

223
00:11:53,341 --> 00:11:54,671
and prove that I can survive
on my own!

224
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,401
You're being ridiculous!
Don't try and overdo things.

225
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,411
I'm not overdoing it. I'll be all right.
I'll show you that I can make it.

226
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:04,211
Do you have enough money to get by
without getting an allowance from home?

227
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,281
Like I said, I'll get a job!

228
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,651
What about rent money?

229
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,791
You're gonna need
a few hundred thousand yen upfront.

230
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,081
You're not a kid,
so you should know that much.

231
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,981
Think of things
a little more realistically, will ya?!

232
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,061
Then I'll go to prep school too.

233
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,721
That way my parents might
give me money.

234
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,091
What do you mean by that?

235
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,261
You can't go to prep school
for that reason.

236
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,331
What should I do then?

237
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,301
I'm telling you, stay back home.

238
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:33,331
You're not gonna be lonely
without me, Shoji?

239
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,781
I won't be lonely at all!
I'll be relieved!

240
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,381
What am I to you?!

241
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:44,761
The way you become all tearful,

242
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,351
say things to make me think
you like me...

243
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,491
Is it so much fun to mess
with my heart?!

244
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,601
All you're looking for is
a guy next to you,

245
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,391
who you can cuddle up
to on your terms!

246
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,561
What male-female friendship?
Give me a break!

247
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:23,691
I hafta get back to the hotel.
But I don't know my way back.

248
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:29,401
I've always relied on Shoji,

249
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:31,701
so I never paid attention
to where we were going.

250
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,101
I've purposely tried not
to watch the road.

251
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:38,311
It seems that I've fallen into the pits.

252
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,811
Where am I standing now?

253
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:43,811
Nana.

254
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,911
That's right. I'm in Tokyo.

255
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,121
But... it can't be.

256
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,091
I knew it.

257
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,131
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

258
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:14,501
It's over.

259
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:18,981
Because! She was being so unreasonable!
I got upset!

260
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,141
I can see why.
It's natural for you to get upset.

261
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,981
But to just leave her there?
I'm disappointed in you, Shoji!

262
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,421
Well, the streets are
well lit during night.

263
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,621
She should be able to
get back here alone.

264
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,851
That's not the point! You shut up.

265
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,701
It's come to this,
so I'll tell you.

266
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,691
Shoji, Nana is in love with you.

267
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,131
That's not possible.

268
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:41,211
Imagine how hurt she'd be,

269
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:43,041
being told those things
from the man she loves.

270
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,941
Think it through, and act on it!

271
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,911
To be honest, I did sorta suspect that.

272
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,651
But I figured that was
just wishful thinking.

273
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:56,141
What do you mean?

274
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,861
Hey, if Junko's telling you,
then you know it's true.

275
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,931
See what happens when
you act before you think?

276
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:19,001
I see. You applied to art schools here.

277
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:24,411
But I failed to enter all of them.
I'm not sure what to do now.

278
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:27,181
I had my heart set on coming Tokyo.

279
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:31,681
But it wasn't like I came
to search you down or anything.

280
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,451
I'm not a stalker,
so don't worry, okay?

281
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:38,391
You haven't changed, Nana.

282
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,991
What? No way! I did change.

283
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:42,631
My hairstyle, my clothes...

284
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:44,571
more like a kid than
when I was in high school.

285
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:47,871
I'm pretty embarrassed
having you see me like this.

286
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,831
That suits you better, Nana.

287
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,211
Y-You think so too?

288
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,411
But the way you speak
hasn't changed at all.

289
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:03,481
"I will not cause you trouble, Mr. Asano."
"I won't stalk you." " Don't worry."

290
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,851
You'd say it every time we met.

291
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,981
I felt uneasy every time
you said it.

292
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,151
Why?

293
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:19,761
You haven't changed at all either.

294
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,071
Every time I'd ask
what's wrong I would get no reply.

295
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,671
I felt uneasy every time that happened.

296
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,871
Is that so? Well, I'm sorry.

297
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,041
It's such a strange feeling.

298
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,981
I thought I really hated this man.

299
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,291
But now that we meet
I have trouble hating him.

300
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:49,331
I should stop thinking that this was a lie.

301
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,161
I loved him with all my heart.

302
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,831
And at one time,
he gracefully accepted my feelings.

303
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:01,171
That's good enough.
It's something to be thankful for, isn't it?

304
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:04,241
I shouldn't be sad about it.

305
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,511
Right. I know now.

306
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,751
I recognize this corner.

307
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:14,821
Just go straight
and you'll get to your hotel.

308
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,291
Huh? Mr. Asano!

309
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:23,231
What are you doing here so late?
And alone with a young girl?!

310
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,401
I'm gonna tell your pretty wife.

311
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,171
Then I'd better treat you to something
next time to keep you quiet.

312
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:31,571
Yes! I'm looking forward to it.

313
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,001
See you.

314
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,411
Shouldn't you be making some excuse?

315
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,181
There's no need to worry.
He was just kidding.

316
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:43,181
If I tried to defend myself,
that in itself would make him suspicious.

317
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:47,061
I see. But he dealt with that guy
so calmly and swiftly.

318
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,521
Is he used to this adultery stuff?

319
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:52,351
But that was your real name, after all.
I'm glad.

320
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:53,301
Huh?

321
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:54,801
No, I was just talking to myself.

322
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,061
Well then, I'll be on my way now.

323
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,211
Don't you ever cheat
on your wife again!

324
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,181
I'll be careful.

325
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:19,881
Very well.

326
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:23,821
Not that I should be the one telling you.

327
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:30,871
Goodbye, Mr. Asano.

328
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:33,231
I really...

329
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:36,541
loved you.

330
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,341
I'm all right.
There will be no more tears.

331
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:54,591
What a stupid ring tone?
That ruins the mood.

332
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,221
Yes, Nana here.

333
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,661
What? You're in high spirits.

334
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:01,931
Kyosuke?

335
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:05,031
Judging from your cheerfulness,
I guess he found you, did he?

336
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,791
Wh-Who?

337
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,441
So he didn't find you.

338
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,311
Well, it wasn't likely.
Where are you now?

339
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,831
I-I thought he meant Mr. Asano.

340
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,411
I'm right by the hotel.

341
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:18,441
I'll be there in a bit.

342
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:19,881
About an hour ago,

343
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:23,751
Shoji and Junko got all concerned
and went out looking for you.

344
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,521
If they find you,
it would be like some TV drama.

345
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:27,991
That could be fun.

346
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,951
Is it so much fun to mess
with my heart?!

347
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:40,271
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

348
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:42,461
Well, don't apologize to me.

349
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:43,771
I...

350
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,771
And don't cry to me.

351
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:48,871
But, .,!

352
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:52,241
It's all right.
Shoji is in love with you.

353
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,511
Liar!

354
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:56,481
You're the one who's lying,
and you know it.

355
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:05,031
Kyosuke...
Where do you think Shoji is now?

356
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:06,731
Who knows?

357
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:09,361
I imagine he's within walking distance.

358
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,931
Anyway, just come back to the hotel...

359
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:22,441
No luck, Kyosuke! I can't find her!

360
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,051
It would be quicker trying to reach her
on her cell phone!

361
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,351
So you finally realized.

362
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,411
The truth is I always loved him.

363
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,621
From that first time I saw him,
I liked him.

364
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:39,491
But at that time,
I was battered pretty badly.

365
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,271
I may have selfishly labeled myself
as a victim,

366
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,291
but I was hurting all over,
just the same.

367
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,271
I was afraid.

368
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,701
Afraid that if I got involved,
my scar would spread.

369
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,441
Whenever I'm with you,
Shoji, I always felt healed.

370
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:57,141
You hugged me gently with
all your heart, didn't you?

371
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,151
Right now, I want you to embrace me
with that warmth,

372
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:03,711
with all your strength.

373
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,121
Shoji... Shoji!

374
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,951
I reached into the sky

375
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:19,471
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

376
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:24,841
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

377
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:30,841
Like colorful balloons

378
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:32,951
I'm alone

379
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:36,681
My hand had no place to go

380
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:43,321
And gently you took it

381
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:44,491
Starless night

382
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:48,691
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

383
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:54,501
I want to feel your warmth

384
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:56,371
Tears are falling down

385
00:21:56,371 --> 00:22:00,471
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

386
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:06,971
Of your hand holding mine
