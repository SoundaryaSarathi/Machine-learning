00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:14,639
You got that? Let me say it
again just to be sure.

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,677
You are to kill a hundred
of this planet's people

3
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:21,111
and pile up their bodies
here by tomorrow.

4
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,621
If you do, we will
let you join our group.

5
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:30,856
And of course,

6
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:34,553
if there are no bodies here,
it will mean the death of your son.

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,998
Father!

8
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,335
T- that's gutless of you!
How can you use a child like that!?

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,337
--Yeah!
--He's right!

10
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,398
For one thing, there's no way
Goku could kill anyone!

11
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,010
That's fine.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,780
If you don't mind letting this one die,

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,806
then there's no need
to have those bodies ready.

14
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,019
However,

15
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,625
one way or another, every person
on this planet is destined to die soon.

16
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,161
Once we finish subjugating
our current planet,

17
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:12,528
we've decided that our next
target will be this one!

18
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:15,865
Y- you what?

19
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:20,305
The three of us Saiyans
ought to be enough

20
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:25,072
to wipe out the folks
on this planet in only a month.

21
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:29,648
Kakarrot, if you're the one
who kills a hundred people for me,

22
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:32,082
it's all the same in the end, isn't it?

23
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,996
Father! Father!

24
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:49,267
You got that, Kakarrot?
Any way you try to struggle out of it,

25
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:53,004
the only thing for you to do
is to join your brother's pals.

26
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,199
Give me back my child!

27
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,466
I'll be expecting a good answer from you.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,615
For your sake, as well.

29
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,886
You cannot consider going against me.

30
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:14,426
With your incomplete battle power,

31
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,759
you can't possibly stand up
to your older brother, after all!

32
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,967
Father!

33
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,960
See you later!
I look forward to tomorrow!

34
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,367
Gohan!

35
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,644
Father!

36
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,805
Gohan!

37
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:44,588
Damn it all! He made a mockery of me!

38
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:47,993
Are you okay, Son-<i>kun</i>?

39
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:52,998
W- we're sorry!
There was nothing we could do!

40
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:55,667
G- Goku?

41
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,430
Kinto-Un!!

42
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,673
Wait! That's crazy! Don't be rash!

43
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:04,943
You can't! You'll be killed!

44
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:08,003
If you go now,
do you think you could win!?

45
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:12,951
Damn! What should I do?

46
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,181
Think.

47
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,021
Hold on, now...

48
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:31,036
What a shock, huh? Here you
discover that you have a relative,

49
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,638
and of all people,
it turns out to be that guy!

50
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:37,802
Your brother... does have greater
than normal strength, and all.

51
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,979
His tail...

52
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,647
If I...

53
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:48,320
If I squeeze his tail hard enough,
his strength should drop off.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,989
That's how it was for me.

55
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,325
N- now that you mention it,
that's true!

56
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:58,330
B- but still, are you going
to be able to grab his tail?

57
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,798
It'll be impossible for me
to do it alone.

58
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:11,610
We will do as much as we can!

59
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,613
Yamucha and Tenshinhan aren't here,
after all.

60
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:18,750
T- that's right... And if the
three of us fight together,

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,285
it just might work...

62
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:22,549
Though I'm not very
confident about that...

63
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:29,294
Bulma-<i>san</i>, if we die, please bring us
back to life with the Dragon Balls, okay?

64
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,630
Leave it to me!

65
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:40,038
Kuririn, that won't work. Kami-<i>sama</i>
said that you can't ask Shen Long

66
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:41,630
to grant the same wish a second time.

67
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,712
Kuririn, both you
and Old Timer Turtle Hermit

68
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:51,307
have already had Shen Long
bring you back to life once.

69
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:55,475
And so... we can't do it another time...

70
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:01,315
Oh... really?
E- even so, n- no problem!

71
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,662
You'd help me out?

72
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,263
O- of course we will!

73
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,666
You bet we will! This time,
it's our turn to lend you a hand, Goku!

74
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:19,271
<i>T</i>- <i>this time for sure, l'm dead. Damn...</i>
<i>And I wanted to get married too...</i>

75
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,749
Speaking of the Dragon Balls,
what if we did this?

76
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:29,954
Get all seven together,
and ask Shen Long to save the world!

77
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,290
Oh, yeah!

78
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,627
Do you think we could get them
all together in a single day?

79
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,027
Oh, yeah...

80
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,861
All right! We launch a
surprise attack of our own!

81
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,370
He wouldn't possibly think
that we would attack him,

82
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,971
so his guard should be down.

83
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,974
B- but we don't know where he is, right?

84
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,311
Bulma, do you have your
Dragon Radar with you?

85
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,913
That's right!

86
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:58,872
The ornament at the top of
Gohan-<i>kun</i>'s hat was a Dragon Ball, huh?

87
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,654
That's it, that's it!

88
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,090
Look! It's moving at tremendous speed!

89
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:10,929
It stopped!

90
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:14,160
Thank goodness! He's not
out in space, he's on Earth!

91
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:19,768
All right, let's go! It's all
or nothing! Just hang on, Gohan!

92
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,611
R- right! Maybe we can win this!
The possibility is slim, though...

93
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,980
If we're going to be killed either way,

94
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,346
we'll feel better
if we've done all we can.

95
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:36,682
This is too much for you guys!

96
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,226
--Piccolo!
--Piccolo!
--Piccolo!

97
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,582
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,982
I followed him here.

99
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,590
You've already met him?

100
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,592
That's right.

101
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:18,119
If you go with those two,
you won't be able to defeat him.

102
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,391
I will go with you.

103
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:27,564
You must have realized that
his strength is extraordinary.

104
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:34,279
He's an opponent that neither
you nor I can stand up to.

105
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,947
However...

106
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:40,618
...if you and I team up, then there
is a slight possibility that we...

107
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,954
...can defeat him.

108
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:47,625
Just what the hell has come over you?

109
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,961
Don't get me wrong.

110
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,727
It's not as though I have
become awakened to peace.

111
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:57,226
I don't care what happens
to your son, either.

112
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,634
It's just that he stands in the way of
the world domination that I am after!

113
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:12,175
We'll team up, but once we've
taken care of him and his two pals,

114
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:17,655
I'm going to defeat you,
and this time,

115
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:20,925
I intend to take over
the world for sure!

116
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,261
I won't let you do that!

117
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:26,498
I won't let you do that, but up
through that part where we team up,

118
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:27,726
that's a good idea.

119
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,270
Looks like there ain't
any other way, huh?

120
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,433
That's right! We'll just
have to put up with it.

121
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,012
As far as I'm concerned, teaming up
with you makes me want to puke!

122
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:51,551
Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar.

123
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,314
Right.

124
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:59,297
Can you keep up with
the speed of Kinto-Un?

125
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:02,901
Don't be absurd! My own
technique's a little different

126
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,734
from that pathetic
<i>Bukujutsu</i> skill of yours.

127
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:41,169
I'm not sure whether
I should be elated or not...

128
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:46,807
You know, I would have never thought
that those two would team up!

129
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:52,214
There's certainly no stronger
combo than them!

130
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:56,411
It's just possible that they might win!

131
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:00,358
B- but I wonder, is it safe
for us to trust Piccolo?

132
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,026
It's worrisome, isn't it?

133
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:06,631
What are you talking about!? This is
going to be an incredible spectacle!

134
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:10,401
Bulma! Do you remember the location that
reading was coming from on the Radar?

135
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,868
We're going too!

136
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:22,345
I wonder if Gohan-<i>chan</i> is havin'
fun at Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>'s place.

137
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:29,951
Oh, my! He still hasn't finished doin'
his developmental homework, has he?

138
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:33,719
I hope he'll be all right.

139
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,968
Father, I'm scared!

140
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:27,206
Will you shut up!? How long are
you going to keep blubbering!?

141
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,113
You carry the valiant
blood of the Saiyans too!

142
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,120
Get in there!

143
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,335
Let me out! Let me out!

144
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,701
Let me out, I say!

145
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,679
Now then,

146
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,580
how about I go find something to eat?

147
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,181
That's strange. A warning signal...

148
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:15,016
A battle power of 710? It's close!

149
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,355
What?

150
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:35,313
Damn. A malfunction, huh?

151
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,543
Don't scare me like that.

152
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,659
We're close!

153
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,329
I think we'd better descend pretty soon.

154
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,665
That won't work! We're better
off going in like this.

155
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:57,335
He's using a strange device.

156
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:00,271
It appears to be able to
clearly tell the position

157
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,673
and even the strength of a target.

158
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,942
You mean the fact that we're
closing in on him, too?

159
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,001
It stands to reason that he knows.

160
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:13,050
Really? Well, that means that the only
thing we can do is attack him head-on!

161
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:24,522
Again!

162
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:35,037
Battle power 710.

163
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,101
Sure enough, it's malfunctioning.

164
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:42,313
<i>There are two readings!</i>

165
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:43,837
<i>They're heading this way!</i>

166
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,657
One... two...
Battle powers 322 and 334...

167
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,649
One of them is the same
as Kakarrot's ability.

168
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:01,065
But there's no way he
would be coming here.

169
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:04,936
He has to know that there's close to
zero probability of him winning...

170
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:08,337
And he doesn't know
where I am in the first place.

171
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:13,607
I've had it.
It's completely malfunctioning.

172
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,948
It couldn't be!

173
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:18,279
He's here!

174
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,583
<i>Then it's not a malfunction!?</i>

175
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:30,294
<i>No! There's definitely</i>
<i>some kind of mistake here!</i>

176
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:34,958
<i>lt's not possible for a kid that</i>
<i>small to have a battle power of 710!</i>

177
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:13,169
So that's it. You're the other one, huh?

178
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,943
How did you know about this place?

179
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,612
You expect us to tell you!?

180
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:27,285
Very well. I'll ask you a
different question, then.

181
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,620
What the hell have you come here for?

182
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,958
It's obvious, ain't it!?
We've come to take my boy back!

183
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,687
It's Father!

184
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:39,630
Which means...

185
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,233
...even though you may be a Saiyan,
like us,

186
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,225
you don't want to join our group?

187
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,501
That's what I said!

188
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:54,008
Oww!

189
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,650
Then you intend to defy your brother?

190
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,448
I ain't got any brothers!

191
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,053
Kakarrot...

192
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,721
I thought you'd be more sharp-witted.

193
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,798
To think that you'd be as foolish
as this... You disappoint me.

194
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,272
Don't tell me you've made
the ridiculous determination

195
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,265
that if the two of you attack me,
you can win!

196
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,743
That's enough of your tiresome drivel.

197
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,952
Piccolo,

198
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,621
have you been training
by wearing heavy stuff too?

199
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,181
Yeah, just like you.

200
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,295
It's been a long time
since I felt this light.

201
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,636
<i>His battle power has gone up to 408!</i>

202
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,764
I see. You've been desperately
training yourself too, huh?

203
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,641
Being able to fight together

204
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,734
as allies for the time being
like this is encouraging.

205
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,585
Maybe now we can have ourselves
a little bit better of a fight.

206
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,611
<i>Kakarrot is now at 416...</i>

207
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:18,262
You guys think you've gotten
all stronger by doing that?

208
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,930
What!?

209
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,932
Don't make me laugh!

210
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:24,935
To think that you would stroll
on in here with that kind of power!

211
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:28,272
This is what they mean when they
say you don't know your place.

212
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:32,572
Just being stronger in
a fight ain't everything!

213
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,478
We've got ourselves a strategy!

214
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,746
I've had enough of your smart-mouth.

215
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:47,691
Kakarrot, I've decided not to
let you join our group any longer.

216
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,683
It appears you'd just
slow us down, anyhow.

217
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:56,089
You're a disgrace to our family! Die!!

218
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:24,088
<i>H</i>- <i>he's fast! What speed!</i>

219
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,335
<i>And he came at us head</i>-<i>on! For him</i>
<i>to get behind us in that one moment!</i>

220
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,609
Your defense, at least,
appears to be pretty strong.

221
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,481
However, your deaths are
only a matter of time now.

222
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:48,077
Little by little, I'm going to
increase the strength of my attacks!

223
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:53,188
<i>T</i>- <i>to think that the difference</i>
<i>in our levels would be this great!</i>

224
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,963
<i>Somehow, I have to grab his tail,</i>
<i>and make his power drop!</i>

225
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:03,000
It's hopeless! No matter what strategy
you may have come up with,

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,900
there's no way you can beat me!

227
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:11,832
I know... Why don't I let you in
on something good before you die?

228
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,283
The two other Saiyans
besides me who are still alive

229
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,047
have an even higher
battle power than I do!

230
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:30,828
<i>What unprecedented terror!</i>
<i>Even if Raditz is defeated,</i>

231
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:34,559
<i>there are still even</i>
<i>more powerful warriors?</i>

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,528
<i>There is nothing that Goku</i>
<i>and Piccolo can do!</i>

233
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:51,528
