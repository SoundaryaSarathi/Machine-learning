1
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,225
Why?

2
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:14,335
How come?

3
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,303
Yukito-san…

4
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:24,776
Yukito-san…

5
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,151
Yukito-san…

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,155
[Sakura and the Last Judgment]

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,104
Sakura…

8
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:56,980
I wonder if Tsukishiro-san knows that

9
00:00:57,384 --> 00:01:00,683
Sakura has been gathering
Clow Cards all along.

10
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:02,783
No, I don’t think so.

11
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,517
Yue is the Judge.

12
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,190
He is not needed

13
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:08,723
until the Last Judgment.

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,757
His false form shouldn’t
know of his existence.

15
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:12,194
So…

16
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,932
Snow-rabbit simply thinks
(Yukito = snow-rabbit)

17
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,497
he’s a normal human being himself.

18
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,469
But you woke up

19
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,334
because she scattered
all the cards, right?

20
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:25,571
But he has come to Tomoeda

21
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:26,972
much earlier.

22
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,377
Someone…

23
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,912
Someone has wished it
so happened, perhaps?

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,548
There is no coincidence in this world.

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,226
There is only the inevitable.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,964
Same as the dream.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,238
Candidate of the
Mistress of Clow Cards.

28
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,248
Now,

29
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,319
with all the Clow Cards you have,

30
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,455
Defeat me.

31
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,591
No way… I…

32
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:22,493
I can’t!

33
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:28,232
Jump…

34
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:37,281
Jump.

35
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:45,249
Yuki… to… san…

36
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,750
Sakura!

37
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:22,294
Now, I shall conduct
the Last Judgment.

38
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:23,723
I can’t!

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,596
I can’t fight you, Yue-san.

40
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:33,038
Right now, you look different, But…

41
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,143
You are Yukito-san after all!

42
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:06,602
If you keep running away,
you cannot win against me.

43
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:53,553
No!

44
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,013
If Sakura gets help from anyone,

45
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:57,351
she loses right there, right then!

46
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:59,750
But at this rate, she’ll…!

47
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:05,523
Sakura should be able to convince Yue.

48
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,736
I believe in her.

49
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,372
If you don’t act serious,
this will be the end.

50
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:27,278
I gotta… I gotta do something.

51
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:33,693
A card that won’t hurt Yue-san…

52
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,060
Wood!

53
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,093
Not good!

54
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:06,218
Wood carries the attributes of the Moon.

55
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,297
You do not even know such a thing.

56
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:14,661
This is the end.

57
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:22,066
– You have lost.
– I lost…?

58
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,035
Right. You lost.

59
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,944
The seal on the cards
are broken once again.

60
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,576
On top of that,
the disaster befalls upon this world.

61
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,087
What is the disaster of the world?

62
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:40,785
What’s going to happen?

63
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:43,726
That is, to forget.

64
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:47,262
If the candidate chosen by

65
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,195
Kerberos the Appointer…

66
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,738
…cannot defeat Yue the Judge,

67
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,570
The Clow Cards, and everyone involved
with the Clow Cards will forget…

68
00:06:57,177 --> 00:07:00,544
…the feeling of “love” towards
the person they love most.

69
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,406
What?!

70
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:06,382
The Clow Cards treasure most the person

71
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,621
who sealed and signed on them.

72
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:14,253
But if this person does not qualify as
the Master or the Mistress,

73
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,958
In order not to grieve,

74
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:18,897
the cards would forget the person

75
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,325
they love most.

76
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,209
Forgotten…

77
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:41,544
Everyone’s feeling of loving someone
the most would be forgotten…

78
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,418
Even mine…

79
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:51,462
…would be forgotten…

80
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:03,738
I can’t…

81
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,912
I definitely can’t…

82
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,277
…let this happen!!

83
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,484
You have broken the magic that
was backfired at you.

84
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:27,532
Still, I will not say
that you did not lose.

85
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:40,245
Only Clow Reed is able to defeat me.

86
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,085
Dammit!!

87
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,233
I can’t… Everyone would forget…

88
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:09,871
They’d forget the people they love…

89
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,180
A dream?

90
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,524
Good morning!

91
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,301
Good morning.

92
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,644
Good morning!
Good morning, Father.

93
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:50,881
Good morning…

94
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,279
Is there something?

95
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,447
No, it’s nothing.

96
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:21,895
Good morning!

97
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,579
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan!

98
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:40,556
Class is going to start!

99
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,068
– Good morning!
– Good morning!

100
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,642
Mihara-san, the Japanese
class material for the first period.

101
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,112
Please get it ready now.
Miss Midori will be here soon.

102
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:54,578
That’s right.

103
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:01,144
Hey Chiharu-chan,
Yamazaki-kun calls you “Mihara-san”?

104
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:02,585
Yeah,

105
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,753
it’s not like
we know each other very well…

106
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,659
Can you come here for a second?
Yes.

107
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,334
Can you hand these
to your class teacher?

108
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:19,837
Yes.

109
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,874
– Good morning.
– Good morning!

110
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,953
– What?
– No, it’s nothing.

111
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,987
No one is here…

112
00:13:54,694 --> 00:14:03,295
Sakura-chan!

113
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:16,366
That person…

114
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,605
He is…

115
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,928
That’s it! He is…

116
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:47,466
…the person I love most!

117
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:55,673
She broke it!

118
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:00,975
Mizuki-sensei!

119
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,613
I’m glad you noticed it!

120
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,288
The bell…

121
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:12,993
This bell is left behind by Clow Reed,

122
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,891
in order to give you a second chance.

123
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,202
Its task is over,

124
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:20,396
so it vanished.

125
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,375
There will not be another chance again.

126
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,670
I got it.

127
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,772
Living in a world without the feeling
for the person you love most,

128
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,914
That is too harsh!

129
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:38,790
I’ll do my best!

130
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,092
I can do it!

131
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:44,523
It’ll be okay for sure!

132
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,762
Now, lift up your wand.

133
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,111
What is this?!

134
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,080
A new power.

135
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:10,784
Release!

136
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,137
The wand changed!

137
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,674
Wind, capture the one before you!

138
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:40,545
Windy!

139
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,322
Useless. Windy serves under me…

140
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,858
Impossible!

141
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:05,709
Yue-san,

142
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,644
you must like Clow-san very much.

143
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:15,444
Therefore,
I’m sure you understand how sad it is…

144
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,622
…to forget the feeling
for the person you love most.

145
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,422
I’m still a kid,

146
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,195
and I’m not nearly

147
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,824
as powerful as Clow,

148
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:28,260
But… I’ll work hard at it!

149
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,178
Rather than being the Mistress,

150
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,408
I would like to be your friend.

151
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:55,918
Close your eyes.

152
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,023
Do it now!

153
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:04,062
Judgment complete.

154
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,339
I, Yue the Judge,

155
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,869
Accept Sakura as the new Mistress.

156
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:30,818
You are…

157
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:34,998
I predicted the chances around you,

158
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:38,065
And little by little
made the inevitable happen.

159
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,133
You came across all of them,

160
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:44,543
And completed the story
with a happy ending.

161
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,042
Thank you very much.

162
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,709
Could you be… Clow-san?

163
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,821
Then, is this wand yours?

164
00:19:56,823 --> 00:20:00,657
No, You were the one
who created that wand.

165
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:03,760
Neither the Sun or the Moon,

166
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:06,189
It is your mere power of the Stars,

167
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,066
which resides in the wand.

168
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,059
Even though it only emits a small
amount of brightness at the moment.

169
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,736
The power of the Stars

170
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,473
keeps shining on their own.

171
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,501
Please treasure that power.

172
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:30,849
Hey!

173
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:35,821
Sakura-chan!

174
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,627
I did it!

175
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,726
You’ve been staying around
the whole time.

176
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,461
I guess.

177
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,103
Did you know Tsukishiro-kun isn’t human?

178
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,031
Yeah.

179
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,207
All is well.

180
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,072
Sakura is the new Mistress.

181
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,613
But with that level of power,

182
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,943
It is impossible for her to convert

183
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:36,845
all her cards.

184
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,950
You may be right.

185
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,853
For the time being,

186
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,788
I think it’s better for us
to return to our false forms.

187
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:38,681
Sakura!

188
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,652
Kero-chan! I did it!
