1
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,281
<i>I will make it such that those</i>
<i>who drank cannot use false names.</i>

2
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,438
<i>You can only converse with fellow</i>
<i>immortals by using your real names.</i>

3
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:16,370
We really are immortal!

4
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,455
I am absolutely overcome!

5
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:22,073
I'm Ennis. No last name.

6
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,044
Ennis. Ennis, right?

7
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:26,408
I don't dislike kids who are good at flattery.

8
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,131
So, what do you want?

9
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,883
Well, well, Senator Beriam.

10
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:15,095
I'm honored that you would
come all this way to visit me.

11
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:19,891
Your followers have gone
and made some trouble for me.

12
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,838
What have the Lemures done?

13
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:27,399
They've taken over
the transcontinental express <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

14
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,468
They're demanding your release,

15
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:32,237
in exchange for the lives of the passengers.

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
I see. So then, you want me to dissuade them?

17
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,938
My wife and daughter are aboard.

18
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:45,208
Manfred Beriam. Crazed for power and money.

19
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,868
Since when did you have a family to love?

20
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,589
Are you trying to make fun of me, monster?

21
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,092
There's the real you.

22
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:09,388
Convince them to surrender, Huey Laforet,

23
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,472
and you will come out no worse for it.

24
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:15,268
Rest assured, their plan will fall through.

25
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,281
What?

26
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,602
If the Lemures have taken over the train,

27
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,898
then my daughter is also aboard.

28
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,448
My daughter has sworn absolute loyalty to me.

29
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:27,902
Your daughter?

30
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:30,755
Chane Laforet, the fanatic?

31
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,118
If she finds out that what they are doing

32
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:37,260
could not be a bigger unwelcome favor to me...

33
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,727
Chane, you will not falter.

34
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,856
What's the matter, Chane?

35
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,203
Okay, listen.

36
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:19,010
Would you kill all of the people
in the dining car for me?

37
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:21,012
What?

38
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:26,298
Of course, I will compensate you accordingly.

39
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:30,689
You will obtain the pleasure you seek,
and I will be buying my safety.

40
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,678
You're no child, are you?

41
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:37,028
I'm glad you're so quick to understand.

42
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:41,032
If you will kill all of the passengers for me,

43
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,535
your reward will be $200,000.

44
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,539
That's out of the question.

45
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:52,127
How many people do I have to kill,
just in the dining car?

46
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,339
I'm not about to let myself be taken
in for that kind of spare change.

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,828
I've got no assurances that
you'll pay the money, either.

48
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:03,263
I have packed a great deal
of explosives on this train.

49
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:09,128
It is to make a deal with
the Runorata Family in New York.

50
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,508
I have their trust.

51
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:14,968
If you will do as I say,
I will put in a good word for you,

52
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:20,030
to see to it that the Runoratas treat you well.

53
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,808
This sounds a bit too convenient.

54
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,744
I have packed some extra explosives.

55
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,858
After you have dealt with
all of the people in the dining car,

56
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:32,068
I will set them off.

57
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:35,072
The train will stop, and in the meantime,

58
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:39,158
we will take the remaining explosives, and flee.

59
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:44,513
The incident will likely be chalked up to
the work of those black suits.

60
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:49,434
If you've got that kind of explosives,
why don't you just do it yourself?

61
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,263
I have need of the body
of one of them, you see.

62
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:56,316
I can't just violently blow them away.

63
00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:59,736
So, mister,

64
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,947
you'll do this for me, right?

65
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:07,786
It looks like you <i>don't</i> know
how to talk to me, after all.

66
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:12,278
<i>You</i> try being looked at with
such confident eyes.

67
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,252
Like it or not, <i>you'll</i> want to
kill them, too, don't you know?

68
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,511
What? You were attacked without warning?!

69
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,475
Yes...

70
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:29,252
I got hit, and when I woke up,
the girl was no longer here.

71
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:31,017
Damn it!

72
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:35,480
It's the Gandors!
This has to be the work of those Gandors!

73
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,290
Eve-<i>chan</i>! Eve-<i>chan</i>!

74
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,402
Elean-<i>san</i>?

75
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:58,368
Eve-<i>chan</i>, I'm sorry I startled you.

76
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,492
I don't know how to make it up to you
for what has happened.

77
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:06,261
For my part, I wish there was a hole
I could crawl into, and not come out.

78
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,628
You came to rescue me?

79
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,891
Yeah. I thought it was my duty to do so.

80
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,185
Thank you.

81
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:19,858
Eve-<i>chan</i>, we are in no position
to ask any thanks from you.

82
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,518
That goes for what happened to you,
as well as your brother.

83
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,268
Big Brother Dallas?

84
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:29,268
Do you know something about my brother?

85
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,438
It's top-secret information within the company,

86
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:37,334
and I only know the smallest fraction of it, myself,
but by way of apology, I'll tell you what it is.

87
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,908
The Gandor Family appears to be connected

88
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,756
to your older brother's disappearance.

89
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,924
Gandor...

90
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,346
You mean the mafia family?

91
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,185
Mm-hmm.

92
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,807
Please take me to them!

93
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:57,520
Please! Take me to wherever the Gandors are!

94
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,230
Pretty please!

95
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:08,808
Hey, Miria, do you suppose
Ennis got those four to the police okay?

96
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:11,534
I hope she got away all right afterward.

97
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:15,080
So, what was it she was trying to do?

98
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:17,858
Run away from home?

99
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:21,687
Run away, huh?
You might be right, Miria.

100
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,948
You have to admit, though,
she was really strong, huh?

101
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,242
She was strong, all right.

102
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,248
Women who are strong are cool, huh?

103
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,055
Just like Tomoe Gozen!

104
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:33,932
By the way, Isaac...

105
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:36,142
What, Miria?

106
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,895
Where are we going to go now?

107
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,600
Here's the thing about that...

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,802
When you steal money from the mafia,

109
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,888
if that money is taken from a really big family,

110
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:49,768
then a lot of people come after you,
and it's a lot of trouble.

111
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,518
The way around that is
to go after a smaller family,

112
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,648
not affiliated with anyone else.

113
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:58,278
According to my information,
around here, those organizations

114
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,042
would be the Martillo
Family and the Gandor Family.

115
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:03,169
As such...

116
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,788
let's start by going to
the Gandor Family hideout, which is near here.

117
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:10,305
Now, today, we're just going to case the place.

118
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,095
We're going to case the place!

119
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:15,792
Look, assuming we take that back to them,

120
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,462
you think we're really
going to get any money?

121
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,088
We'll just have to trust them.

122
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:23,106
But, Dallas, you saw
how easily he killed Scott, right?

123
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:27,262
Once he's through with us,
he might just eliminate us, too, right?

124
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,612
Forget about Scott.

125
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:33,366
Relax. Those guys want this booze.

126
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:37,398
So all we have to do is
hold the booze at gunpoint.

127
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,942
Tell them we won't hand it over
until we get our money.

128
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,292
I get you!

129
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,647
That shot must have made
you smarter, too, didn't it?

130
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:50,912
Huh, Miria... That must be, you know,
the organization's graft money.

131
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:51,968
A bribe, huh?

132
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:53,958
The three of them carrying it so cautiously

133
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,918
in the middle of the night
like that must mean...

134
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,974
It's money, right?

135
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:57,682
Right!

136
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,771
So there's only one thing we can do--
take that money from them, now!

137
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,520
Why?

138
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,314
Because they're carrying it now.

139
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,604
If we come back tomorrow,
their safe will be empty.

140
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:10,236
Oh, yeah! Isaac, you're so smart!

141
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,694
Hold it!

142
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,739
What?!

143
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,077
Who are you?!

144
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:23,458
The man who came back alive
from Reichenbach Falls, for a purpose...

145
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,585
Professor Moriarty!

146
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,264
Okay, then, make it Jack the Ripper.

147
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,934
Are you trying to mock us?!

148
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,718
We don't have time to be messing around
with a bastard like you!

149
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,523
Well then, how about messing with me?

150
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:47,899
What?

151
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,542
Isaac-<i>san...</i>

152
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:27,564
He's so useless.

153
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:34,417
<i>What do I do? I can't count on him.</i>

154
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,575
<i>I can't search out</i>
<i>any other immortals like this.</i>

155
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:44,539
<i>Back then, before I realized it,</i>
<i>I gave out my real name.</i>

156
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,627
<i>Which means that</i>
<i>there was another immortal there.</i>

157
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,881
I am not about to get devoured.

158
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,927
I'll have to devour them, first.

159
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,977
Didn't he just die a minute ago?

160
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,782
Ah, hello.

161
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,438
You're that man from the newspaper, right?

162
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,787
H-Hi there.

163
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:28,791
Aren't they nice?
I bought a whole bunch of them.

164
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,294
They cut very well.

165
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:33,755
Oh...

166
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,674
You're the man from that newspaper.

167
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,384
H-Hi there.

168
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,307
And just what is this about?

169
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,338
Well, as it happens...

170
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:47,518
Are you Gandor-<i>san</i>?

171
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,021
Yes, I am.

172
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,024
My name is Eve Genoard.

173
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,818
I am Dallas Genoard's younger sister.

174
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:57,638
Genoard...

175
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,682
Dallas? You mean that filthy punk?!

176
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:01,783
You know who my brother is, right?

177
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,772
I'm looking for him.

178
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:06,329
Please, tell me where my brother is!

179
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,210
You're absolutely certain you want to know?

180
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:16,547
Then you leave us little choice.

181
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,884
Gandor!

182
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,594
We have to find them.

183
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:27,350
Nice, you and Nick take the roof
and head to the dining car.

184
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,352
Donny, you're with me.

185
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,691
Nice, I'll be coming back here for sure,
so don't overdo anything.

186
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,743
You're pretty passionate, huh, Boss?

187
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,454
That was our first!

188
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,206
Huh?!

189
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,916
Your first? You mean...

190
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:56,095
Boss, you and Jacuzzi
have been an item for ten years, right?

191
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,923
And yet you never once kissed?!

192
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,828
Come on, Jacuzzi,
there <i>are</i> limits to cowardice, you know!

193
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:05,221
And that goes for you, too, Boss!

194
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,315
So then, why did you kill him, Ladd?
It was a good offer, wasn't it?

195
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:15,802
Indeed it was. But did you see his eyes?

196
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:19,444
That mug of his said,
"There's no way I'm gonna get killed here."

197
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:24,449
He was so convinced that
he wasn't going to be killed by us.

198
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,661
He looked down his nose at me,
Ladd Russo-<i>sama</i>!

199
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:32,318
It's like somehow,
my urge-to-kill gauge hit its max!

200
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:33,624
Yeah, but still...

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,158
But what really galls me is how,
right to the very end,

202
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:40,328
he had that look of confidence on his face!

203
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,248
Where does he get off, the son of a bitch!

204
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,134
Hey!

205
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,384
Keep it down!

206
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,637
Look at this!

207
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,777
This is not good.

208
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,154
There's no way past.

209
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,950
Have I found myself a new victim?

210
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,001
<i>What are you doing, Chane?</i>

211
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:23,288
<i>The white suits might come past here to attack.</i>

212
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,828
<i>Are you trying to protect</i>
<i>Guth and those other fools?</i>

213
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,668
<i>They are planning to kill you.</i>

214
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,015
<i>I know.</i>

215
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:35,422
<i>Once they have gotten you back,</i>
<i>they won't have any use for me.</i>

216
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:38,718
<i>Ultimately, what they really need</i>
<i>is the secret of immortality.</i>

217
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:42,568
<i>Their goal is to become immortals themselves.</i>

218
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:49,137
<i>Both you and I don't really matter to them.</i>

219
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,327
<i>Very smart, Chane.</i>

220
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:57,667
<i>I gave up my voice in order to</i>
<i>protect the knowledge I got from you.</i>

221
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,169
<i>I'm not scared anymore.</i>

222
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:03,881
<i>I'm not afraid of those who</i>
<i>are trying to take you from me.</i>

223
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:08,094
<i>Are you saying you will protect me, Chane?</i>

224
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:12,062
<i>You are immortal. You do not age.</i>

225
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:15,418
<i>In time, I will grow older than you,</i>

226
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:18,062
<i>and in time, I will die, before you.</i>

227
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,485
<i>But you are the only person who loves me.</i>

228
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,447
<i>You are my only family.</i>

229
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,535
<i>So I cannot afford for you to be taken from me.</i>

230
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,746
<i>I cannot afford to give you up to anyone.</i>

231
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,878
That girl is amazing!

232
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,538
Yo! Aren't you cold, wearing a dress like that,

233
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:51,637
with all this cold, wintry air whipping around?

234
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,798
You guys are all dressed up as an orchestra

235
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,646
to put on a performance
for me to listen to, right?!

236
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,441
For me, and for me alone!

237
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,153
For you to climb up onto the roof
like this for me...

238
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,406
It must be love!

239
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:16,078
I accept this tremendous love of yours.

240
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,291
Now, for you to accept <i>my</i> love.

241
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,908
I love you!

242
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,422
So die!

243
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,122
For real?

244
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,680
Hey, was that for real?
That's impossible!

245
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:41,270
Right back at you. Right back at you!
Right back at you, you dumb ass!

246
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,565
Is it humiliating? Could you just die?

247
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,278
I'm going to kill you,
whether you want to die or not!

248
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,032
Hey, are you for real?! Are you for real?!

249
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,825
For real?

250
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,290
Impossible, I say. Impossible, I say!

251
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,248
Those guys are freaks.

252
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:20,559
Yo! You've been sneaking
around on all fours for a while, huh?

253
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,397
Why don't you put your hands up,
and come down from there?

254
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,696
Luck Gandor?!

255
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,308
My, my, this is quite a racket.

256
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,938
You're supposed to be dead!

257
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:40,557
Come now, that's no big deal, is it?

258
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:42,707
N-No big deal?

259
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,418
I get it.

260
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:48,671
You must have used a body double, huh?

261
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,538
There's no end to the dirty tricks you'll pull!

262
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,912
Dirty tricks?

263
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,872
You're the one who took
Eve Genoard, aren't you?!

264
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:58,668
Gee, I don't recall anything like that.

265
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:01,298
Don't jerk me around! I've got proof!

266
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:03,758
You've teamed up with that brat Dallas!

267
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:04,979
That's not true!

268
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:06,856
E-Eve-<i>chan</i>!

269
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,192
Heh, and there's more proof than anything.

270
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,404
Pretty arbitrary, huh?

271
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:16,449
Yeah, arbitrary.

272
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,573
Do you get it now?!

273
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,658
Say what you will,
those with the power prevail.

274
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,837
Such is the law of this world.

275
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,354
W-What's going on here?

276
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:51,901
You see, there are powers
and laws such as <i>this</i> in this world.

277
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,613
That didn't work...

278
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:07,416
Who'd have thought it was liquor?

279
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,698
--Well, when faced with this...
--Well, when faced with this...

280
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:16,277
...we'll just have to rely on
the <i>other</i> mafia family, huh?

281
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,677
We'll swipe money from <i>them</i>, instead!

282
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,502
This time, we'll case
the Martillo Family's place!

283
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:26,644
--Martillo! Martillo! Martillo! Martillo!
--Martillo! Martillo! Martillo! Martillo!

284
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:29,146
Remember, Miria,

285
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,399
act naturally, like a customer.

286
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,052
Naturally, okay?

287
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,944
Mm-hmm, naturally!

288
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,125
--God's will be done!
--God's will be done!

289
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,622
Haven't seen you before...

290
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,778
Don't worry about it!

291
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:50,042
Don't worry!

292
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,002
Come on.

293
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:01,011
--God's will be done!
--God's will be done!

294
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,311
Welcome!

295
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:18,222
Listen, there's supposed to be
some sort of office here, somewhere.

296
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,598
Once we're there,
there should also be a safe.

297
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,228
Gotcha.

298
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,272
Also, act naturally, like a customer.
Naturally, okay?

299
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:27,371
Mm-hmm, naturally.

300
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,292
Sure enough, there's a basement office!

301
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:50,019
Ah! Sir, you shouldn't be there!

302
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:56,901
It's dangerous there! Move away, quickly!

303
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,432
God's will...

304
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:03,908
To celebrate the birth of a new capo,
I will fire the ceremonial gun.

305
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:13,584
Isaac has been killed!

306
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,086
There's a bit of a problem
with one of the customers!

307
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,498
Isaac!

308
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,288
Don't cry, Miria. I'm still alive.

309
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,645
But, but, but, you're gonna die!

310
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,475
Well, one day...

311
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,212
Isaac!

312
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:33,048
Miria!

313
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:35,933
You're the ones who were
at the hat shop this afternoon.

314
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,718
Oh, it's those guys.

315
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:39,762
The ones we passed earlier.

316
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:40,945
You two...

317
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:44,782
...are a father and sister?!

318
00:22:57,378 --> 00:23:07,377
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

319
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:21,599
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

320
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:33,192
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

321
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:40,238
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

322
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:47,288
<i>I believe so</i>

323
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:54,338
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

324
00:23:54,338 --> 00:24:01,848
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

325
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:08,518
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

326
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:18,573
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

327
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,054
<i>Hey, Miria, I think those</i>
<i>two mysterious people are us.</i>

328
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:31,721
<i>We made her silent, huh?</i>

329
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,851
<i>We did something</i>
<i>inexcusable, right out of the blue.</i>

330
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:34,974
<i>You're right.</i>

331
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,061
<i>And we don't even know who Chane-san is.</i>

332
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,897
<i>We've never even met her.</i>
