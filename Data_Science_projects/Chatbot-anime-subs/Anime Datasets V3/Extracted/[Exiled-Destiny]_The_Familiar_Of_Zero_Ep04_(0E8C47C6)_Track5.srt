1
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:22,777
I am grateful for the Institute's
understanding and cooperation.

2
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:24,446
When receiving an order
from the Palace,

3
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:26,515
there is no room for such concerns.

4
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:27,482
Then...

5
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:36,245
How about dinner sometime,
Miss Longueville?

6
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:40,295
That would be an honor, Count Mott.

7
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:42,831
I will look forward to it.

8
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:43,991
Yes.

9
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,599
What kind of impossibility did
the Palace ask for this time?

10
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:54,768
Oh, they just came to warn us
to be careful of thieves.

11
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,311
Thieves?

12
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,747
Lately, a fellow named Fouquet
has been causing a stir

13
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:01,249
by using magic to steal treasures,

14
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:04,052
concentrating on those
of the nobility...

15
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,754
Fouquet the Sculptor?

16
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,289
In our Institute, there
is the sacred treasure

17
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,057
that we have borrowed
from the Palace,

18
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:11,116
the Staff of Destruction.

19
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,088
The Staff of Destruction...

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,365
What a troubling name.

21
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,869
I don't know how splendid
a mage this Fouquet is,

22
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,439
but the treasure vault here
is a special one,

23
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,342
layered with many spells
by Square-class mages.

24
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:29,173
They're being overly anxious about it.

25
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:37,708
Wait...

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,163
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

27
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:56,502
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

28
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:07,212
The sky where two moons
never fade away

29
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,112
That's an impossibility, right?

30
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:19,894
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

31
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:25,667
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

32
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:32,129
Even if you trip and
become depressed

33
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:39,576
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

34
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:46,454
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

35
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:52,794
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

36
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:58,733
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

37
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:07,232
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

38
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:15,505
A Maid's Crisis

39
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,295
So cold...

40
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,498
Why am I doing this so late?

41
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,305
This is silk, you know?

42
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:40,308
You have to be more gentle
and careful in washing it!

43
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:41,502
Start over!

44
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:46,235
Dammit! What's with being
gentle and careful?

45
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:50,518
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

46
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:52,213
Oh, it's just you, Siesta.

47
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:54,277
Yes.

48
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:57,991
You have to make sure
to dry silk in the shade.

49
00:03:58,827 --> 00:03:59,994
Here.

50
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,296
You're a lifesaver.

51
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,699
I've never washed anything
by hand before I came here.

52
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,937
Come to think of it, Mr. Saito,
where are you from?

53
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:11,838
Well... How do I put it...

54
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,242
Anyway, somewhere very far away.

55
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,946
Very.

56
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,607
Um, Mr. Saito?

57
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,546
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,986
What's this, out of the blue?

59
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:27,389
You never give up
no matter what happens,

60
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,291
and you stand up against nobility
even though you're a peasant.

61
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,728
Seeing you like that, Mr. Saito,
has given me lots of courage.

62
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:37,220
I can continue to do my best
all because of you, Mr. Saito.

63
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,334
Well, thanks...

64
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,769
Good night.

65
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,703
Yeah. Good night.

66
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,306
Somehow, she seemed
to be acting funny.

67
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,048
Oh?

68
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:57,752
Hey, I have to get up early
tomorrow, so I'll see you later.

69
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:00,755
You know that sword
I bought the other day?

70
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:02,450
That huge, shiny one?

71
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:04,959
I don't need it,

72
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,429
and since I bought it, I might
as well give it to you.

73
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,497
Seriously? For free?

74
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:10,794
Of course.

75
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,359
For starters, let's talk inside.

76
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,498
Well, if it's just talk...

77
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,307
This is great after all!

78
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,109
It makes you feel like a hero

79
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:23,011
when you have something
like this on your back.

80
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,813
You don't have to be so reserved.

81
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,414
But Louise...

82
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:30,652
Don't worry about Vallière.
This is a sign of my love.

83
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:32,454
Hey, can I ask you something?

84
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,421
What is it?

85
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,945
Why me?

86
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,724
You have hordes of men
after you all the time.

87
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:43,364
You have lots of things
that none of them have.

88
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,933
There's just no comparison.

89
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,968
Do I really? For instance?

90
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,969
Well...

91
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,039
Speech and mannerisms that seem
to indicate an ill-bred childhood,

92
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,876
your shabby appearance, the
slight feeling of uncleanliness...

93
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:55,844
I'm gonna go home.

94
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:59,678
Oh, wait... Did I say something
that upset you?

95
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:01,347
All of it!

96
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,482
Wait a minute.

97
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,011
Well, then...

98
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,486
How about this?

99
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:11,526
What is it?

100
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:11,860
It's a talisman ring.
What is it?

101
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,861
It's a talisman ring.

102
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,453
It's very valuable.

103
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:15,864
Don't want it.

104
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,131
Then, how about this?

105
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:19,033
An earring of a fire-eater bird's blood.

106
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:19,868
Don't want it.

107
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,469
Then, what about this?

108
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,938
This book is our family heirloom.

109
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:27,475
You know, accepting anything
would be a problem.

110
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,375
You don't seem to get it...

111
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:32,374
I won't let you get away.

112
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,516
Hey...

113
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:35,583
The von Zerbst's blood,

114
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,585
that of the hunter of love,
is getting excited.

115
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:38,786
Hunter?

116
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:42,153
Targets that are hardest to obtain
turn me on the most.

117
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,014
Louise!

118
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:46,728
You always show up that way.

119
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,062
We're going home, Dog.

120
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,427
Yes!

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,535
I've told you often enough.

122
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,504
You're stupid, to accept another
one of her offers so readily!

123
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:57,605
Well...

124
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:59,641
Since Kirche said that she would
give me that shiny gold sword...

125
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,808
I couldn't help it.

126
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:04,679
You were the one that said
you were fine with that one.

127
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,876
Well, that's true, but if
I can get it for free...

128
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,853
An ornament like that
means nothing to you!

129
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:15,557
A familiar that follows someone
so readily after being lured by bait

130
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,422
needs more punishment.

131
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,461
Wait, anything but that...

132
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,565
Stupid dog!

133
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:40,114
From now on, you can wait outside
with all the other familiars.

134
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:40,915
Why?

135
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:45,053
Why? You snore, peek up
other girls' skirts...

136
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,522
You couldn't embarrass me more!

137
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:51,014
Stay put until my class
is over. Understood?

138
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,454
Yeah...

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,658
Stop it!

140
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,901
Get off me! Geez...

141
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,477
I can't stay in a place like that!

142
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,511
Hey, it's Our Sword!
I can't stay in a place like that!

143
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,705
Hey, it's Our Sword!

144
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,949
Our Sword! Swing by
the kitchen again!

145
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,041
Sure thing!

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,712
Sorry that I'm always
mooching off you guys.

147
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,925
You don't need to be modest.

148
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,628
These are all leftovers of
those nobles, anyway.

149
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:28,220
By the way, where is Siesta?

150
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,732
Oh, that's right.

151
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:35,036
She's not on the kitchen staff,
so she's not always here...

152
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,199
Siesta didn't tell you?

153
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,576
She quit?!

154
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,878
Yeah. It was sudden,
but it was decided

155
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:46,648
that she would be a servant for
this nobleman called Count Mott.

156
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,984
She was picked up and taken away
in a carriage early this morning.

157
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,086
You're kidding! Why so suddenly?

158
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:52,954
In the end,

159
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:55,857
peasants can do nothing but
obey every word of the nobles.

160
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:57,688
Now, work... Back to work.

161
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,590
Siesta...

162
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:02,254
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,034
Count Mott is a messenger
from the Palace,

164
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,636
and comes by the
Institute occasionally.

165
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:11,639
I don't like him, because
he always acts so cocky.

166
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,700
But why would Siesta be sent to
work for someone with that rank?

167
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:20,081
When a nobleman requests
a young girl by name,

168
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,217
it's usually an order for her
to become his mistress.

169
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,687
You don't even know that much?

170
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,155
Mistress?

171
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,623
Is that for real?!

172
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:32,582
I hear stories like that.
Nobles come in all sorts.

173
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,620
Siesta...

174
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:40,134
How wonderful! A mythril brooch.

175
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:43,104
Don't you think it will look good
on you, Montmorency?

176
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:46,607
And with this, I'm supposed to
pretend nothing ever happened?

177
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,304
Don't tell me you believe what
that vulgar familiar said...

178
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,246
Sorry for being so vulgar.

179
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,181
Saito!

180
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,650
Are you going to get in the way
of someone's romance again?!

181
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,641
I just want to ask something.

182
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,592
He's not back for dinner either?

183
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,321
Oh, where's Saito?

184
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,196
What's that?

185
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,363
Oh, this?

186
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,866
I feel sorry for him, having
such crude meals all the time,

187
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,596
so I thought about giving him
a bit of my meal.

188
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,873
You're trying to catch his
heart through bait now?

189
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:21,776
Don't you feed someone else's
familiar without permission!

190
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,644
I can't bait him if he's not here.

191
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:24,838
Where did he go?

192
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,616
He went to go wash dust cloths,
and still hasn't come back.

193
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,251
Where is he wasting time?

194
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:34,856
By the way, earlier he asked me for
directions to Count Mott's manor.

195
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:36,691
Count Mott?!

196
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,294
Maybe he got fed up with you and
decided to serve a different noble?

197
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:44,766
Though I've never heard of
a familiar switching masters.

198
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,801
But this is Louise's familiar.

199
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,736
Oh, that's right!

200
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:51,072
Though I can't possibly
imagine Count Mott,

201
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,734
someone who works in the Palace,
using someone like him...

202
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:56,102
Louise?

203
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:00,881
This is it...

204
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,352
Damn that snob.

205
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:07,185
He didn't tell me that it was
a full hour's walk away!

206
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:09,616
Who are you?

207
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,256
Hello...

208
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:26,707
How is the work?
Have you gotten used to it?

209
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:28,209
Yes. For the most part.

210
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,410
I see, I see.

211
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,946
Well, don't overexert
yourself too much.

212
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:32,947
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:40,354
I didn't hire you just for
household chores, Siesta.

214
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,083
Um...

215
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:44,225
What is it?

216
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:44,759
A Saito is here to see you!
What is it?

217
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,284
A Saito is here to see you!

218
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,056
Saito? Never heard of him.

219
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:51,795
Impossible...

220
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,903
I wondered what it could be,
but how meaningless...

221
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:56,871
Go home!

222
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:01,475
Just be thankful that I went out
of my way to see a peasant!

223
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,877
Please!

224
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:06,142
If you let Siesta go back to
the Institute, I'll do anything!

225
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,484
What kind of relationship
do you have with Siesta?

226
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:13,888
Well, we're coworkers that
work in the same place,

227
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,685
though we work in
different departments.

228
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,092
A servant of the Institute?

229
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:18,926
Um...

230
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:22,293
I heard that when a nobleman
requests a young girl by name,

231
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,694
it's usually her job to be
something like a mistress.

232
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,871
Siesta is an official servant
of the Mott household now.

233
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:33,040
The master is free to do whatever
he wishes to his servants.

234
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,108
Just as I thought!

235
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,244
What of it, say you?

236
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,246
A nameless peasant like you,

237
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:40,314
providing services to
a valuable nobleman like me...

238
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:42,783
There is no greater honor!

239
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,085
That's full of crap!

240
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,187
You're just doing
whatever pleases you

241
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:47,755
because you know Siesta can't say no!

242
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,357
That's just unfair, you old baboon!

243
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,849
You, a mere peasant,
dare to insult a nobleman?!

244
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,057
Sit down right there!

245
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,832
Stop it, Mr. Saito!

246
00:12:57,832 --> 00:12:59,367
Siesta! You were there?

247
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,236
Count, please forgive this
individual's rudeness!

248
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:03,204
I will not have it!

249
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:05,773
If I leave such
a peasant's rudeness be,

250
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:07,208
I will tarnish the name
of Jour de Mott!

251
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,776
Stand aside, Siesta!

252
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:09,510
I cannot!

253
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,044
What?!
I cannot!

254
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:10,478
What?!

255
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:14,982
Count Mott, I beg of you.
I will accept any punishment...

256
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,813
Siesta! Out of the way!

257
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:20,821
Saito, wasn't it? You said
you would do anything?

258
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,490
Is that really so?

259
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,257
Yeah.

260
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:26,193
My hobby is to collect printed matter.

261
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:28,996
Actually, there is a book that
I cannot cease to desire.

262
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:30,197
What book is it?

263
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:36,837
A book that a certain mage chanced
to summon in an experiment.

264
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:40,608
I hear that it is the heirloom of an
established family in Germania.

265
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:43,811
The daughter of that family
is currently at the Institute.

266
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,614
Germania? I think I've
heard of that place before.

267
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,983
I am not certain whether or not you,
a peasant, know of her,

268
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,185
but she is the daughter
of the Zerbst family.

269
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,413
Zerbst?

270
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:55,289
If you want Siesta back,

271
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:58,359
you must bring me the
Zerbst family heirloom.

272
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,190
Kirche, of all people...

273
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:04,865
Louise?!

274
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,436
What in the world were you thinking?

275
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,236
Why?

276
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:11,500
I don't care, just get on! Sheesh!

277
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:17,211
You're dealing with one of the
higher-ups from the Palace.

278
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,914
You can't even begin to make a
comparison between him and Guiche.

279
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:22,383
But don't you feel sorry for Siesta?

280
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:25,953
Of course I take pity for her
situation, but it can't be helped!

281
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:27,521
You can't just brush it off!

282
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,357
Don't scream right behind me!

283
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,658
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:33,627
Anyway, just give up about Siesta.

285
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:34,428
Got it?

286
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,663
Yeah... Got it.

287
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,298
Then hurry up and go to sleep.

288
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:38,196
Yeah...

289
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:44,197
Honest as always, so they say.

290
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,008
Our family heirloom?

291
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:47,997
Oh, that.

292
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:53,347
I'm not Tabitha, so I don't really care.

293
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,076
I've never even opened the book.

294
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,485
You had it the whole time?

295
00:14:57,485 --> 00:14:59,687
They made me bring it,
to prepare for my wedding.

296
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,122
Prepare for your wedding?

297
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:04,458
I heard that it has the effect of
stimulating men's sexual desires.

298
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,927
No wonder why that
old baboon wants it.

299
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:09,630
I don't need something
like this in the first place.

300
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,654
Don't you agree?

301
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,034
Well, yeah.

302
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:14,602
So I don't mind giving it to you.

303
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:15,534
Seriously?

304
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,907
But in return, you have
to go out with me.

305
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,272
Hey, isn't that a good deal?

306
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,144
You know...

307
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:25,669
You damned nobles are all rotten!

308
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,481
Saito!

309
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,682
What's he so upset about?

310
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
Come on, do what I'm telling you to!

311
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,053
Miss Siesta...

312
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,088
Yes?

313
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,324
The Count is waiting in his
bedchamber. Please hurry.

314
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:11,313
Yes...

315
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,354
Mr. Saito...

316
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:17,225
Hey, wake up!

317
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,301
What are you doing?

318
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,928
Stupid dog...

319
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,732
Kirche?

320
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,308
Wait, why are you here?

321
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,043
There's no time for that!

322
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,511
Vallière, your familiar...

323
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:36,450
Why do these things happen
one after another?

324
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,586
But that's part of Saito's charm.

325
00:16:38,586 --> 00:16:40,087
You've got to be kidding!

326
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:42,623
Think about the one that has
to take care of that familiar!

327
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,113
A noble's mansion.

328
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,228
If a peasant were to draw a sword...

329
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,462
Oh, brother.

330
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:51,625
It really was a short relationship
with this partner.

331
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,041
Is there anywhere I can get in?

332
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,008
Who's there?

333
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,220
You're...

334
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,653
Thanks for everything earlier today.

335
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:19,684
Ouch...

336
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:21,695
Come on, let go.

337
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:23,162
Let him go.

338
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:25,799
Man, that hurts.

339
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,103
What were you planning to do,
with such a thing on your back?

340
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,071
The roads are dangerous at night.

341
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,274
No noble is whimsical
enough to simply

342
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,643
hand over a treasure
to a mere peasant.

343
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:38,445
I wanted to enjoy your struggles,

344
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:41,148
but you certainly gave up quickly.
How boring.

345
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,616
I didn't give up.

346
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:44,379
I'm going to rescue Siesta!

347
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:47,417
You drew?

348
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,725
If he draws a sword in
a nobleman's mansion,

349
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:55,129
a peasant can't complain if
he gets executed on the spot!

350
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:56,397
I know that.

351
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:59,266
It won't just be your familiar.
You'll be responsible too.

352
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,367
I know that!

353
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:01,635
Tabitha, hurry.

354
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,398
Mansion. Landing.

355
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:13,147
I have never seen such
a foolish peasant as you.

356
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,580
People tell me that a lot.

357
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,175
Something's wrong.

358
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,151
When I was fighting Guiche...

359
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,525
I am known as Mott the Surge,
a Triangle-class mage.

360
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,193
So what?

361
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:28,821
My body is shaking... Dammit!

362
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:36,760
What?!

363
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,800
I can do something like this as well.

364
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,646
Saito!

365
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,707
What?!

366
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,115
Louise?

367
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:03,197
The level of conduct of the
Institute's pupils has fallen so.

368
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:06,533
I must impose a severe penalty
on Old Osman over this.

369
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,502
My apologies for entering the
estate without permission,

370
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,300
as the situation required me
to act swiftly.

371
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,374
And...

372
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,843
The misconduct of the familiar
is the misconduct of his master,

373
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:18,812
yours truly, Louise de la Vallière.

374
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:21,178
I am willing to accept
any form of punishment.

375
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:22,916
Louise...

376
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,887
Pointing a sword at an official
of the Palace is a serious crime.

377
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:30,379
Be prepared to have your entire
family face the consequences.

378
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,294
Hold on, I'm the one at fault here!

379
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,591
Count Mott,

380
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,164
how about we make a deal with this?

381
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,166
What are you...

382
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,158
I hear that you have a tremendous
desire to possess this, Count.

383
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,338
Pardon my belated introduction.

384
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:47,641
My name is Kirche von Zerbst.

385
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:48,876
Zerbst?

386
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,311
Then that is...

387
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:53,337
Yes, it is our family heirloom,
the summoned book.

388
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:55,942
Here.

389
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,321
This is that famed book...

390
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,812
Is it all right? It's your
family heirloom, right?

391
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,693
I peeked inside it, but I don't
need anything of that sort.

392
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:06,860
Unnecessary.

393
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,396
Anyway... First off,
give Siesta back to us!

394
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:11,498
Hand Siesta over to them.

395
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,430
Yes, sir!

396
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,165
It opened!

397
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:19,606
This is...

398
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:21,575
I don't know what language
these letters are in,

399
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,475
but to think there was such
a thing in this world...

400
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:25,176
Erotic PUNCH
April '75 issue

401
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,347
Japanese?!

402
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:26,447
April '75 issue
Japanese?!

403
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:26,970
April '75 issue

404
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,683
It's an old porn magazine.

405
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:30,751
Porn magazine?

406
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,887
Hey, you said earlier that
the book was summoned?

407
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:34,855
Right.

408
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:39,426
My grandfather just happened
to summon that book.

409
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:40,450
Summoned...

410
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:43,997
The same thing that happened to me.

411
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,332
That's...

412
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,424
The same?

413
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,705
Honestly, thank you so very much.

414
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,808
No, in the end, it was
all thanks to Kirche.

415
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,902
But it was all because you
did your best, Mr. Saito.

416
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,413
Besides, Louise also...

417
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,786
Good night!

418
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,515
Good night.

419
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:24,338
You know...

420
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:25,862
We're going back to our room.

421
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,966
Thanks, Louise.

422
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,411
I'm really sorry about this.

423
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,379
You stay quiet for a bit!

424
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:36,247
I'm thinking about how heavily
I need to punish you right now!

425
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:38,419
So there's going to be
something after all?

426
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:39,720
Of course!

427
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,989
A hundred lashes with the whip
is too easy on you.

428
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:44,981
Oh! Maybe no meals
until you almost die?

429
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,363
Wait a minute, can't you show
a tiny bit of mercy...

430
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:49,763
That's impossible!

431
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:50,397
Forgive me!
That's impossible!

432
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:50,697
Forgive me!

433
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:51,899
Can't! That's impossible!

434
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,332
No way!

435
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:11,818
As if I were under a real magic spell

436
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:22,852
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

437
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:34,541
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

438
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:45,645
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

439
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:57,626
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

440
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:08,498
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

441
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:14,745
For the day to start from zero

442
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:29,429
However you look at my familiar,
there's nothing good about him.

443
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:30,998
But we have to have
the entire Institute

444
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:33,466
judge every one of our familiars?!

445
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:36,403
It's so depressing.

446
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:36,503
Next Episode: Tristein's Princess
It's so depressing.
