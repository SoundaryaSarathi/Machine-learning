1
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:16,392
Are you ok?

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,165
Yeah… 
I’m just a little sleepy…

3
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,942
You don’t have a fever.

4
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,650
I’m just a litte sleepy,

5
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:37,812
so,
both of you,

6
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,481
go to work and go to school.

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,195
I’m ok.
Really.

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,663
Then I’m leaving now. ok?

9
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,030
Bye.

10
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:18,952
I’ll skip club today

11
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,921
and come home.

12
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,561
I’ll come home
as soon as possible too.

13
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,035
Geez,

14
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:29,736
things start happening again,
don’t they…

15
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:36,207
[Sakura and The Dangerous Piano]

16
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,683
Your brother noticed me after all!

17
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:43,416
On top of that,
he’s mad at me!!

18
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:50,551
Hey, Sakura.

19
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,825
You’re just playing sleepy,
aren’t you?

20
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:55,793
Hey, Sakura!

21
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,464
I can’t open my eyes at all…

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,930
Sakura is absent today.

23
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,237
I wonder what’s wrong.

24
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,139
Li,

25
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,881
would you like to go visit Sakura

26
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:48,980
at home today

27
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,818
Wh… Why me?

28
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,615
I’m sure Sakura will be happy.

29
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,621
You’re good at this,
Hiiragizawa.

30
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,232
Really.

31
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,332
Awesome,
Hiiragizawa.

32
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:09,896
I am used to making these.

33
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,408
– Do you make them often at home?
– Yes.

34
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,038
How many people are in your family?

35
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,446
Two. No,

36
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,815
three people

37
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,015
Oh, I see…

38
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,169
I wonder if Sakura’s doing okay…

39
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,507
Sorry to keep you waiting

40
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,775
The store was so crowded,
so it took a little longer.

41
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:58,253
Let’s eat.

42
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,358
Are n’t you eating
a lot more than usual?

43
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,192
I’m just more hungry than usual.

44
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,993
Even though I ate five times
more than normal for breakfast.

45
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:14,860
Yuki…

46
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,036
I think you don’t realize,
so let me tell you…

47
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,108
About you, I…

48
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,486
I jump!

49
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,220
Nakuru’s awesome!

50
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:42,992
That’s so cool!

51
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:44,532
Challenging the basketball team,

52
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:45,632
that’s awesome!

53
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,229
She look like Tsukishiro!

54
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,902
Touya!!

55
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,235
Did you see me?

56
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,339
Akizuki is awesome.

57
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,004
But she isn’t in any school clubs.

58
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,814
She’s like you.

59
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,320
You mean not being
in any school clubs?

60
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,289
Not only that…

61
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,297
– I slept well!
– You sure did…

62
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,045
3 o’clock already?!

63
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,517
Tomoyo! Li!

64
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,528
Sakura!

65
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,724
How’re you feeling?

66
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,360
I’m totally fine!

67
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:54,795
Just a little sleepy.

68
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,399
That’s right,
she slept like a pig.

69
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,537
Kero.

70
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,872
Oh right, we made these
in home economics lesson today.

71
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,147
The cakes look good!

72
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,784
I made this one,

73
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,411
Li made the others.

74
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:13,318
Thanks…

75
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,822
The one the brat made

76
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:21,922
is just okay.

77
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,287
What did you say?!

78
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,273
Bring it on anytime!

79
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:27,795
Take it easy.

80
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,130
So, the Key

81
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,733
wouldn’t transform

82
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,142
unless you used a new spell?

83
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,106
But why were you so sleepy today

84
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:38,514
that you couldn’t not even get up?

85
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:41,580
Like the wand,
the cards have to take a new form.

86
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,014
Yesterday,
when Sakura used her magic,

87
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,353
a new magic formation appeared
that is different from Clow’s…

88
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,184
Look.

89
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,433
Only the card Firey has changed,
Right?

90
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,333
The back of the card is different too.

91
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,201
The key transferred into the wand,
but it wouldn’t work on the card.

92
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,973
And so I thought, maybe the card
had to be changed too…

93
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,707
You changed it with your own power?

94
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,876
I don’t know…

95
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:17,481
No, Sakura herself
created this Firey Card

96
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,585
from the Clow Card

97
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:26,057
A card that I created by myself…

98
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,997
Then, this is no longer a Clow Card,

99
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,493
But a Sakura-chan Card

100
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,836
created by Sakura-chan, isn’t it?

101
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,966
Fighting against something
even more powerful

102
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:42,310
with her own Sakura-chan Card…

103
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,052
That’s splendid!

104
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:57,526
Calling it Sakura-chan
Card is a bit…

105
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,429
Then how about “Sakura Card”?

106
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,829
That too…

107
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,862
Then being sleepy…

108
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,201
Up until now,

109
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,773
she’s been using Clow Cards
that were created by Clow,

110
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,972
Of course, Magic Powers are
needed from the person who use them…

111
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,777
But other than that, Clow’s powers
residing in the cards

112
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,978
were the source of magic.
so it wouldn’t be nearly as tiring.

113
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,017
But the new card

114
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,886
was created by Sakura’s own magic.

115
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,281
That’s different.

116
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,554
And so I became really sleepy.

117
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,889
Last night when you were
caught in danger,

118
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,663
neither Yue or I
were able to do anything.

119
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,990
Don’t worry about it.
I’m okay now.

120
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,494
No, this isn’t something.
I just don’t worry about.

121
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,435
I wouldn’t worry
about it if we were in our false shapes,

122
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,848
but both of us were in our true forms.

123
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,052
You were in your true forms?!

124
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:50,398
The only people
who can freeze both Yue and I…

125
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,870
… are Sakura, who is the current
Mistress of the cards, and…

126
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,489
…Clow Reed.

127
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:11,593
Miss Kaho,

128
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,427
a mysterious event happened again.

129
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:19,808
Somehow,
I now have the star wand and a new card,

130
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:23,204
Oh, a new card

131
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:25,540
being one that

132
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:26,914
was created from a Clow Card

133
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,978
That was what Kero said.

134
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,179
But at that time,

135
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,316
neither Yue or Kero were able to move.

136
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,083
And the only one who could do

137
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,753
such a thing to them was Clow,

138
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,991
Kero said.

139
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,520
But…

140
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:43,692
Kero-san…

141
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,125
But Clow has passed away
a long time ago.

142
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,363
Eriol…

143
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:36,415
Sakura

144
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,152
Did you notice I was watching?

145
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,298
You play very well.

146
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,122
Thank you very much!

147
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:19,356
Oh, this is the song

148
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,656
Tomoyo has been practising in the choir.

149
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,262
Tomoyo

150
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,297
That’s wonderful!

151
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,537
I heard you were practicing
the song and I remembered it.

152
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,633
You have a wonderful voice.

153
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,777
Thank you very much.

154
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:39,648
That’s right! Tomoyo,

155
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,251
how about you sing
while accompanied by Eriol?

156
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,583
– Now?
– You can’t?

157
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,184
I don’t mind.

158
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,338
=When I am lonely,=

159
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:14,579
=I seek warmth=

160
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,784
=I trace far into the distance=

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,466
=Holding her=

00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,446
=beloved child in her arms,=

164
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:48,448
=a mother sings=

165
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:53,055
=a lullaby under the sun=

166
00:12:57,327 --> 00:13:01,388
=Someday,=

167
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:07,232
=in the clear blue sky,=

00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:12,002
=everyone can fly freely=

=as high as possible.=

170
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,083
=Fly freely…=

171
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:29,448
=With flowers blooming=

172
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:35,688
=in those hearts.=

173
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,532
Awesome! Awesome!

174
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:43,670
That’s wonderful, Tomoyo!

175
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,107
Eriol too, thank you!

176
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,415
You are not leaving yet?

177
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,015
I was thinking of
going home with Tomoyo.

178
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,920
Daidouji is still in the music Room?

179
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,154
She’s practicing
for the next competition.

180
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,664
She’s staying really
late to practise.

181
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,761
No one is here anymore.

182
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,773
It’s a solo competition.

183
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,468
I heard the song
during lunch break.

184
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,310
It was a really beautiful song.

185
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,607
Eriol was playing
the piano for her…

186
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,382
It was wonderful.

187
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:30,346
What’s matter?

188
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:34,515
Nothing.

189
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,461
Did Kerberos say anything after that?

190
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,967
About Clow?

191
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,739
Kero said he didn’t
know either.

192
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,009
because Clow

193
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,173
should have already passed away
long time ago.

194
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,246
What in the world is happening…

195
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,070
It is Tomoyo’s voice…

196
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,737
Tomoyo!!

197
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,246
Sakura!

198
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:45,322
– What happened?
– The piano suddenly…

199
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,192
WATCH OUT!!

200
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,138
Why did the piano
move all of a sudden?

201
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:15,784
Clow’s aura…

202
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,253
Sakura…

203
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,154
Watch out!!

204
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,097
Get out of here!

205
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:28,571
We can’t get away
if we stay in the room!

206
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,637
– Right. Tomoyo!
– Okay.

207
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,271
Hurry up.

208
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:43,750
Did the piano just
move all of a sudden?

209
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,016
I started to practise
the song for the next competition,

210
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,411
and suddenly…

211
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:05,304
King of Thunder, DESCEND!!

212
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,113
– Thanks.
– I wonder if we are ok now.

213
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,154
It’s moving again.

214
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:36,861
It simply looks
like it would not let me go…

215
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,470
I see.

216
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,275
Tomoyo, would you help me with this?

217
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:46,840
Yes!

218
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:50,008
We might be able to do something.

219
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:05,891
=When I am lonely,=

220
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,532
=I seek warmth=

221
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,542
=I trace far into the distance=

222
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,244
=my dear memories.=

223
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:27,553
=Holding her=

224
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:32,394
=beloved child in her arms=

225
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:37,260
=a mother sings=

226
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,864
=a lullaby=

227
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:50,904
=under the sun.=

228
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,842
=On the cheek of the infant playing=
=in the dreamland…=

229
00:18:56,152 --> 00:19:00,851
=…are the dimples of happiness…=

230
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:01,749
It is coming.

231
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,221
O Key which hides
the power of the stars,

232
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,665
reveal thy true form before me.

233
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,168
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

234
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,696
Release!

235
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:32,983
– It is here.
– Right!

236
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,187
O Card created by Clow,

237
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,991
discard thine old form and be reborn.

238
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,793
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

239
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,563
Song!

240
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:09,624
=Even after woken up from the dream,=

241
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:15,196
=there is still a smile.=

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,727
=Such as seed of kindness=

243
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:24,435
=remains in the heart=

244
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:33,112
=When a nervous heart…=

245
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,546
=It’s better…=

246
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:53,796
It is not moving.

247
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,662
Thank Gooddness.

248
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:05,778
Song turned into a Sakura Card too!

249
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,554
Just now,

250
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,412
I’m sure
I sensed Clow’s aura…

251
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:19,823
Sakura

252
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:23,258
Sakura!

253
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,567
Hey! Hang in there!

254
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:45,076
Things seem to be getting interesting.
