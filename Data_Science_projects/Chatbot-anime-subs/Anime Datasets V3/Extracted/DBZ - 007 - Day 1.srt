00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:34,593
What should I do for training?

2
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:39,598
W- what should I do to train?

3
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:45,270
To begin with, you don't need
to do anything. Just live.

4
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,938
Live?

5
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:51,068
Right. Try surviving all by yourself
without anything happening to you.

6
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,884
If you can survive without incident
for six months, I'll teach you how to fight.

7
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:04,480
Six months, by myself, in this place?

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,930
No way! I'll die of loneliness!

9
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,102
You won't be lonesome.

10
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:21,368
This place is teaming with beasts
that are thirsting for blood.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,912
No, don't do this!
Don't leave me here!

12
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:32,584
Right now, you don't have
time to be spoiled!

13
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,586
But...

14
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:39,591
Survive somehow for the next six months,
and make yourself tougher,

15
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:43,261
both physically and mentally.

16
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:48,867
Do not forget that you hold the key
to earth's fate in your hand.

17
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,536
Believe in your own power.

18
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:55,874
And learn some way to
effectively draw out that power.

19
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:58,209
But I...

20
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,912
See you later.
Oh, right, right.

21
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,107
Don't think about trying
to escape from here.

22
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:09,013
This place is surrounded by nothing
but expansive hellish desert.

23
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:11,856
In other words,

24
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:14,893
it's a world of death that's enough
to make this place look like heaven.

25
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:19,898
Wait! Where is there any food?
What about baths?

26
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:22,901
What about a bed? What about books,
and notebooks, and pencils, and...

27
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:28,573
You think there's any of that
arranged for you here, sonny boy?

28
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,404
Oh, no!

29
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,911
That's horrible!

30
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:38,941
If you have to blame something,
then blame your own fate. The way I do.

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,592
Wait!

32
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:51,528
I'm scared!
Don't leave me here!

33
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:31,399
Kami-<i>sama</i> look strange.
Something wrong?

34
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:40,245
Sure enough, there's something different
about Piccolo from how he was before.

35
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,447
He's still unmistakably evil,

36
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:47,180
but I sense that the devious abrasiveness
he had in the past is fading away.

37
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:54,192
Popo thinks so too. The old Daimao
not make Son Goku's son strong.

38
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,530
What made me clearly realize that there
was something strange about Piccolo...

39
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,867
...was that when Son Goku's
brother Raditz was killed by him,

40
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,030
his spirit went right
to the Other World.

41
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,288
Up until now, whenever anyone
was killed by the Demon Clan,

42
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,557
their spirit had been
unable to pass beyond,

43
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,958
and they drifted through the air,
as they suffered.

44
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,896
Did a guy named Raditz wash up here?

45
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,228
Yeah, he was here all right.

46
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,136
And yet, since Raditz had
gone to the Other World,

47
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,503
Piccolo is clearly different
from how he was before.

48
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,203
You mean Piccolo has good heart?

49
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:54,252
Perhaps he realizes it too.
My life- and thus Piccolo's life

50
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,743
-has only one more year left in it.

51
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,423
One more year?

52
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,161
Whether it's because
Piccolo will be killed

53
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:07,198
by the Saiyans that are
to arrive in another year,

54
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:13,603
or whether it's because that is when
my lifetime will run out, I do not know.

55
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,238
Kami-<i>sama</i>...

56
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:23,374
My death means death for Piccolo,
and Piccolo's death means death for me.

57
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:29,487
Even being Kami,

58
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:33,558
it is not a pleasant thing to know
the time when one's death will come.

59
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,828
He has to be sensing it too.

60
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,931
Maybe he just wants to leave
something of himself behind,

61
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:43,492
even if it is to Son Goku's son.

62
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,574
Then, possibility of
using Dragon Balls...

63
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,975
This next time will be the last one.

64
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,014
I'm scared!

65
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:14,498
Ee-yow!

66
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:23,469
Wait up!

67
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,024
You didn't have to go
around my neck like that.

68
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,732
I had no idea at all that Gohan
was as strong as all that.

69
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:10,208
He is my son, after all...

70
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:23,528
That's right! I don't have to run
along the entire road at all, huh?

71
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:24,790
All right then!

72
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:38,740
At this rate, I'll get there in no time!

73
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:28,248
That was close, that was close!
That's hell there beneath the clouds.

74
00:09:55,553 --> 00:10:01,219
" Son Goku has...
unfortunately... been killed."

75
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,230
I wonder if the shock
will be too much like that.

76
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,502
" Um, I'm terribly sorry,
but Goku will not be returning,

77
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:14,238
and has entered his eternal sleep."

78
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,742
Then again, he is coming
back to life, huh?

79
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,244
That's it! I'll do it cheerfully! Yeah!

80
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,578
" Goku died, but he's coming back
to life right away, so don't worry."

81
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,921
Kuririn!

82
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,589
G- g- good afternoon.

83
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,259
What are you doing out here,
mumbling to yourself?

84
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,490
W- well, you see, um...
as it happens...

85
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,601
Heya! It's been a while!

86
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,271
G- good afternoon...
That's nice of you...

87
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,206
Aren't you together
with Goku-<i>sa</i> and the others?

88
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:55,675
Yeah, um, the truth is,
Goku has d- d- ...

89
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:59,107
...d- d- d-...

90
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:01,886
What?

91
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,684
...d- don't worry, he says!

92
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:10,895
What's that?
So he is goin' to be late?

93
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:15,566
Yeah, um, yes. The truth is,
the late Goku will not be returning...

94
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,235
He said he's not comin' home?

95
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,904
Er, no, he'll be
returning to us very soon...

96
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:23,067
I don't get what it is you're sayin'!

97
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,678
Now, now, it's no good
to stand here talkin' like this!

98
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:30,511
Come on in the house!
Come on, come on!

99
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:39,790
I can't wait to see
my grandson's happy face!

100
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,426
I ain't even seen him
in a over year now.

101
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,917
I bet he's gotten a lot bigger, huh?

102
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,799
<i>l can't handle this. I can't tell them.</i>
<i>Not that he won't be back for a year...</i>

103
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:55,273
Nobody's told me anythin',
so I called the Kame House earlier,

104
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,968
but nobody was there.

105
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,177
Y- yeah, come to mention it,

106
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,680
everyone's gone off to some
uninhabited island somewhere to play.

107
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,548
That must be it.

108
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:08,886
You wouldn't be able to reach
them there... would you?

109
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:13,557
But Goku-<i>sa</i> and them will
be back by nighttime, yeah?

110
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,226
Y- yeah... I suppose...

111
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:21,232
Goku-<i>sa</i> aside, Gohan has his studyin',
you know? He can't just skip it.

112
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:25,464
You know, Goku-<i>sa</i> can't
do anythin' as a parent!

113
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:31,742
Don't go gettin' so jumpy, Chichi.
This is Goku we're talkin' about.

114
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:34,912
He'll be sure to bring
him home. Just relax.

115
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:39,617
Really? You're right. Good.
They'll probably be comin' back hungry,

116
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,919
so I better go make some dinner.

117
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,587
Um...

118
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,256
I should be heading on back soon...

119
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,925
B- but why? You just barely
got here, didn'cha?

120
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:52,196
You could wait here until
Goku-<i>sa</i> and Gohan get back.

121
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:54,532
At least have some dinner first!

122
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,867
B- but I have things to attend to...

123
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,267
Look, don't worry, don't worry.

124
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,349
Mother!

125
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:45,177
Help! Somebody help!

126
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,428
I can't get down!

127
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,443
Come on, come on,
they're goin' to burn!

128
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:20,711
Eat up, eat up!

129
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,908
Before long, Goku will
be bringin' Gohan home!

130
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,952
I can't stand for this any longer!

131
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,851
Ogre spirits.

132
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:03,187
One crazy dancer drink.

133
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:05,523
Sure, sure...

134
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,858
Here's my check.

135
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:11,862
Thanks for coming.
Here's your change.

136
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:18,869
10,000... 20,000... 30,000...
40,000... I'm 10,000 short.

137
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,700
I beg your pardon.

138
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,209
<i>H</i>- <i>how creepy!</i>

139
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,548
...and so, he said he does not wish
to be brought back to life for one year.

140
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:33,884
I see. And I should tell
this to the Turtle guy?

141
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,978
Yes. Please be sure not to forget.

142
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,588
Goku is a curious one, huh?
He still wants to become stronger?

143
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:54,538
Damn... that guy lied to me!

144
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:57,996
He said I wouldn't get hungry,
but here I am, hungry!

145
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:14,525
I'm scared and cold!

146
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:18,484
I'm so hungry I could die!

147
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:31,766
Apples! Some apples fell down!
How lucky!

148
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:41,775
Oh well...

149
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:52,225
Yuck, they're sour!

150
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:04,365
I want some juice or something to drink!
I want to eat <i>shao mai</i> dumplings!

151
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,081
I want my mother's curry!

152
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:40,605
Dirty brat! Give me trouble, will you?

153
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,818
I'm scared!

154
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:13,911
<i>Now listen, this is the last</i>
<i>time I lend you a hand..</i>

155
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:16,580
<i>From here on, if you</i>
<i>are unable to survive,</i>

156
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,251
<i>then that's all you're worth as a kid.</i>

157
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:24,922
<i>Exhausted, Son Gohan sleeps.</i>

158
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:27,458
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>he could have known</i>

159
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:32,486
<i>that one of his moments</i>
<i>of destiny was drawing near.</i>
