1
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:05,041
That night, we had jammed
until very late.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,081
Our neighbors in the building
came to complain...

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,741
as was to be expected.

4
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:30,831
When I was darkness at that time

5
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,671
With trembling lips

6
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,761
In a corner of a room I cry

7
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:41,841
The more I struggle

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,681
The more this wound deepens

9
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,841
The broken promise hurt me

10
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,581
Nobody can save me

11
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,761
God, I have only one request

12
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:59,391
Stop tearing apart my love

13
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:02,731
I need your love

14
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,961
I'm a broken rose

15
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,901
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,071
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,841
I need your love

18
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,151
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:20,081
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

20
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:24,041
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

21
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,021
I wanna need your love

22
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,251
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,591
I wanna need your love

24
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,211
I am so sorry!

25
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:48,571
Will you please give me a break!
Do you know what time it is?

26
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,081
Yes, I'm sorry!

27
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,551
This is the problem
with young people.

28
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,211
We'll be careful from now on.

29
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,951
Why do we always have trouble
with apartment 707?

30
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,391
Now, now, Ms. Yamada.
We're not supposed to talk about that.

31
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,321
A murder?!
In this apartment?

32
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,091
Whoever lived here before us
was murdered!

33
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,261
Who'd you hear that from?

34
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,631
- Ms. Yamada!
- Who's that?

35
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,841
I don't know!
An ageless woman!

36
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,701
In a nightgown, hair's done up in a twist,
wearing a mountain of make-up!

37
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:16,711
Why is that?!

38
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,331
I wonder if she's entertaining
some young man.

39
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,301
I really couldn't care less
about Yamada!

40
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:22,811
But I'm curious!
I wonder what he's like?

41
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,241
Do you think he's a bar host?

42
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,921
So this woman Yamada told you

43
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,711
that the person living here
before us was murdered?!

44
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,091
Well no, she didn't exactly
say it like that.

45
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,521
Apparently they're not allowed
to talk about it.

46
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,431
But she did say, "there's always trouble
with apartment 707!"

47
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,481
So that's got to be it!
There was a murder case here!

48
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:40,931
Go to bed!

49
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,761
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

50
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:52,001
Ah, but the rent here
is really cheap, right?

51
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,111
It's not unthinkable.

52
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,171
See? Don't you think so?
You do think so don't you?

53
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,341
Oh no, what am I going to do?
I'm too scared to sleep alone!

54
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,881
Would you like me to sleep
with you, Nana?

55
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,081
No way!

56
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:06,951
Thank you for your kindness,
but I do have a boyfriend!

57
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,021
I was kidding.

58
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,091
I'm sleeping in
Nana's room tonight,

59
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,431
so you can have my bed, Nobu.

60
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,291
You've had a long day,
traveling and all.

61
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,991
Oh, no problem.
I'll just crash somewhere out here.

62
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,361
No, you can't!

63
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,871
If you would just fall asleep
on my bed,

64
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,971
then Nana won't have any other choice
but to let me into her room.

65
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,741
Actually, she'd never let me sleep with her
unless something like that happened.

66
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,281
I see. So that's it.

67
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,911
Well then, if you don't mind,
I'll take your bed.

68
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,881
Thank you!

69
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,521
Your bedroom's big, too.

70
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:46,201
Oh... I have to work in the morning,

71
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:49,261
so I think I'll just get my clothes ready,
seeing as they all arrived safely.

72
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,161
- Work?
- Yup.

73
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,841
Oh, right. Then you've got
an early morning.

74
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,971
Sorry for partying so late.

75
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,241
That's no problem.
I can sleep in a bit, too.

76
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,871
As long as I get there by around ten,
I'll be okay.

77
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,341
Besides, I had a really
good time tonight!

78
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,511
I have never seen
a live band up so close!

79
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,471
It was so exciting!

80
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,151
Wait until you see us with a drum
and bass rhythm section.

81
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,421
You ain't seen nothing yet.

82
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,881
You can't really call us a band anyway,
with just the two of us.

83
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,421
I can't wait until we find
other members and do a real gig.

84
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,251
Right. New members.

85
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,321
I wish I could play the drums.

86
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,631
I'm pretty good
at the tambourine, though.

87
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,631
The tambourine?

88
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,571
You know. They've always got them
sitting around in the karaoke places.

89
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,701
Looks like a big ring.

90
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,101
I'm pretty good.

91
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,181
I didn't take you as one
to have rhythm.

92
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,041
What?!

93
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,081
But actually I would really
like Yasu on the drums.

94
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:44,881
You don't find a drummer
like that just anywhere.

95
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,621
You mean that Yasu?
So Yasu's a drummer.

96
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,821
Then he should come out
to Tokyo, too.

97
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:53,591
Yeah, but Yasu's got his work.

98
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,531
Besides, he told me he wasn't interested
in gambling his life away trying to go pro.

99
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,161
Gambling?

100
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,541
Looking like that in
a courtroom

101
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,771
seems a lot more like gambling
if you ask me.

102
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,301
Then what about bass?

103
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,241
Who was on bass?

104
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,401
Isn't that person interested
in coming to Tokyo?

105
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,721
Well, the bass player was also
in another band,

106
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,451
so he wasn't really
an official member.

107
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,351
In another band?

108
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,891
He had another band back home

109
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,421
and used to come and help us out
at gigs and stuff.

110
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,651
So that's fair game.

111
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,471
I guess Nana hasn't told you anything.

112
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:33,191
Yes?

113
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,361
About the band or anything.

114
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,941
Oh... No.

115
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,141
Nana doesn't talk about herself much.

116
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:47,411
But having heard her sing today,
I think I understand her a bit better.

117
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:51,351
She really came to Tokyo to
become a professional musician.

118
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,991
Yeah, her dream is to be able
to make a living by singing.

119
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:01,051
You know back home
she had some die-hard fans.

120
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,861
She was pretty well known locally.

121
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,691
I can't wait for Tokyo to listen to her.

122
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,871
Hey, I can help you find band members.

123
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,011
All you need is some members

124
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,811
and then she can start singing
at nightclubs right away.

125
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:22,341
Then everyone will fall in love
with Nana's voice.

126
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,281
Oh, and scouts won't leave her alone.

127
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,161
Hey Nana. Are you awake?

128
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,121
No.

129
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,991
Come on, you're awake!

130
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,461
I'm talking in my sleep.

131
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:41,241
My heart's beating so loud,
I can't sleep.

132
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:44,111
Are you that afraid of ghosts?

133
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:47,001
No, I'm excited about
something else now.

134
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:52,011
Huh? Sorry to disappoint you,
but I have no desire to hit on a woman.

135
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,111
No, it's not that either!

136
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,191
Would you shut up already?

137
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:58,241
I can't sleep. Do you want me
to kick you out?

138
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,631
Hey Nana. Do you want
a tambourine player on your band?

139
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:12,501
No, I don't.

140
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,931
What are these palpitations? I don't think
I've ever felt this way before.

141
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,341
Looking for a drummer and bassist!
Wanna join our band and go pro?
Those of you who like the Sex Pistols.
Ask the store clerk for details.

142
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,711
Looking for a drummer and bassist!
Wanna join our band and go pro?
Those of you who like the Sex Pistols.
Ask the store clerk for details.
What's this?

143
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,341
Looking for a drummer and bassist!
Wanna join our band and go pro?
Those of you who like the Sex Pistols.
Ask the store clerk for details.

144
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,441
Shoji! You've come!

145
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,851
I was gonna go to Jackson.
Wanna come?

146
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,711
Sure, I'll join you.

147
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:38,221
But what's this poster?
You made it, didn't you?

148
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,921
This is your drawing. These eyes.

149
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:43,001
Yup. Don't you think they look just
like Nana and Nobu?

150
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,231
Who's Nobu?

151
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,301
So she wants to make
a living by singing.

152
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,731
Now that's a pretty big dream.

153
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,371
Don't you think? I'm so excited!

154
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,541
Yeah, I guess I can get
into stories like that.

155
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,181
But I'm not sure if it's going
to be as easy as you think.

156
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:04,351
It'll be okay!

157
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,151
Everything's been going my way
since I got to Tokyo!

158
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,621
I don't think things going your way
has all that much to do with it.

159
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,821
I know! Let's go to karaoke tonight
with Nana!

160
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:17,731
I want you to hear her sing.
I'll play the tambourine!

161
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:21,031
Sorry man, I've got to work
to midnight tonight.

162
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,841
Work again? What are you working
so much for?

163
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,401
Your parents send you money,
don't they?

164
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,501
Not enough to live on.

165
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,481
When I start school,
I won't have time to work.

166
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,141
I've got to save up while I can.

167
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:37,391
That's what you say.

168
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,021
You're not spending money
on Sachiko, I hope!

169
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,891
Buying her Louis Vuitton bags
and Prada shoes.

170
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,891
But she really likes
these brands.

171
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,121
I'm just kidding!

172
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,761
You're the one that keeps
bringing her up!

173
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,461
I know, but I came all the way
to Tokyo to be with you

174
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,561
and you spend all of
your time working.

175
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,241
I just wish you would make
some time for me.

176
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:58,171
Oh come on. I do make time.
Like the other night.

177
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,411
You were the one that
went home early.

178
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,271
You're the one that's not
being considerate.

179
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:09,781
Why should I always have
to adjust to your plans?

180
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:20,291
Uh, I hate to disturb you at a time like this,
but your Jackson burger is ready.

181
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,191
- Koichi Sato!
- Yes!

182
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,371
I have a favor to ask.

183
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,161
My friend is looking for
some band members.

184
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,741
I wonder if you could put this up for me!

185
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,541
Hey Nana!

186
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,131
This place has nothing to do
with that band.

187
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,471
Besides, it's a punk band.

188
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,411
But...

189
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,041
I don't mind.

190
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:39,881
Since you're a good customer.

191
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,511
Really?! Thank you!

192
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,721
Then if anyone asks,

193
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,551
could you give me a call
on my mobile?

194
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,981
I'll write down my number here.

195
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,691
I've got to go to work now,
so I'm off.

196
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,701
I just remembered.
You sent me an email yesterday.

197
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:00,961
Huh?

198
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,671
Well, if it's not important,
never mind.

199
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,471
It's just that I fell asleep
without noticing it came.

200
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,641
Sorry.

201
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,241
Oh yeah, I did send one.

202
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,381
What did I write?

203
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,391
Shoji, I'm on my way home.
Call me when you get off work.

204
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,361
I can't believe it!

205
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,031
How could I half-consciously
send a message like this?

206
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,161
It's proof I'm taking Shoji
for granted.

207
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,871
And I didn't even remember
sending it.

208
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,271
Shoji probably came over
to see me before work

209
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,211
because he felt bad about
not being able to call.

210
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:46,741
And look at me...

211
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:51,641
I just wish you would make
some time for me.

212
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,951
Oh how selfish!
Am I self-centered or what?!

213
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,131
Why should I always have
to adjust to your plans?

214
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,331
I'm going to see Shoji at work
on my way home!

215
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:10,401
And I'm going to apologize. Sincerely!

216
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:11,301
Excuse me...

217
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,241
I wouldn't mind seeing him
in a waiter's outfit anyway.

218
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,001
- I'll wait for him to get off work, cheerfully!
- Um, hello...

219
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,271
- Then I'll let Shoji take me to his place.
- Do you mind?

220
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:20,251
And we'll make love and make up!

221
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:21,971
What a great plan,
if I say so myself!

222
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,081
Hello.

223
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,711
Oh hello! Can I help you
with something?

224
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,381
I just saw the poster out front.

225
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,621
S-So soon? And h-he's cute!

226
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:34,461
Things are really going
my way, aren't they?

227
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,391
Ahh...

228
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,191
Sorry, Shoji!
Plans for tonight have changed!

229
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,261
I'll make it up, I promise!

230
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,371
May I take your plate?

231
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:48,771
Busy again.
This place really needs more help.

232
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:55,381
Shoji, we got some new help
starting today.

233
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:57,241
- Well, that's good.
- Will you show her around?

234
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,111
Yes, sir!

235
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,511
And she's cute.

236
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,521
Shoji Endo. Pleased to meet you!

237
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,921
My name is Sachiko Kawamura.
It's nice to meet you.

238
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,461
What did you say... your first name?

239
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,401
Sachiko.

240
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:13,831
Do you...

241
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,931
Do you like Louis Vuitton and Prada?

242
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:16,901
Huh?

243
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,831
Resume Date: March 10, 2001
Name: Shinichi Okazaki
Birthdate: January 25
Age: 18 Sex: Male

244
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,781
You don't need a resume
to apply to be in a band.

245
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:26,751
What are you trying to pull off?

246
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:27,751
Oh really?

247
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,881
I had him write one out anyway
so you'd know more about him.

248
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,251
How am I supposed to know
a person from a piece of paper?

249
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,321
What are you doing?!

250
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,761
Can you just show me
what's in your heart

251
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,431
and what you can do?

252
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,131
Cool!

253
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,861
You making fun of me?!

254
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,401
No, not at all!
I wouldn't think of it.

255
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:55,041
You are just as cool
as Nana said you were.

256
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,941
Yeah? I don't think
you had to burn it, though.

257
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,941
How cool would it be
if you started a fire?

258
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,951
Please let me join your band!

259
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,551
If you're good.

260
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:07,781
So let me hear what you got.

261
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:08,621
Yes ma'am!

262
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,531
Hold on, cute boy!
Not here!

263
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,821
That ageless Ms. Yamada
will be back at us!

264
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:15,361
Hey, how much can
a bit of bass playing hurt?

265
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,001
Absolutely not!
Do you want to get kicked out?

266
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,521
We'll both be thrown out
on the street!

267
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,571
That's exactly what
the Demon Lord wants!

268
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,641
Demon Lord?

269
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,771
Go find a studio then.

270
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:26,661
A studio?

271
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:30,811
I know a cheap practice studio nearby!

272
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,851
Really? Hey, we could use you.

273
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,881
Let me ask if they have
any vacancies.

274
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,111
I'd be interested in listening
to your guitar and vocals, too.

275
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,651
Oh, hello?

276
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,521
You sure he's eighteen?
He looks more like sixteen.

277
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,461
He's lying about his experience.

278
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,891
So you did read through
his resume, after all.

279
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,991
Far out! It's available!

280
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:54,721
So cute!

281
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,831
He'd better not be
in elementary school.

282
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,501
I've never been in
a place like this before.

283
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:18,391
Okay then, you ready to play along
with one of ours?

284
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:21,761
Huh? But Shin doesn't know
any of your songs...

285
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,561
He can look at the score sheet.

286
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:24,761
Sure thing.

287
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:33,741
You ready already?

288
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:36,301
Yes. I'll give it a try!

289
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:38,701
Okay.

290
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,041
One, two...

291
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,381
Awesome! Awesome!
So great!

292
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,261
They are so tight!

293
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,491
You're not too bad, cute boy!
I'm glad you didn't just look the part!

294
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:52,381
What?

295
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,051
Ow!

296
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:57,721
Nana!

297
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,591
I'm sorry, did I do something weird?

298
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,191
No, it's not that at all.

299
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,831
You just surprised us.
You're a lot better than we expected.

300
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,771
What do you think, Nana?
This kid's good.

301
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:08,301
Let's let him in, okay?

302
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,601
So, your name's, Shinichi.
Is that right?

303
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:11,431
Yes.

304
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,441
Name a guitarist you respect.

305
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:15,971
Ren Honjo!

306
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,951
Huh? Ren Honjo?
You mean the Trapnest guitarist?

307
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:27,681
Yes.

308
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,481
Then we have something in common!
I like Trapnest, too!

309
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:33,851
I'm even in their fan club!
Although I like Takumi.

310
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,121
Oh, is that so.

311
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:39,191
But I guess I'm more of
a Ren fan than a Trapnest fan, though.

312
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:42,471
I played guitar for a long time
until I fell for Ren's music.

313
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,561
Then I started playing bass.

314
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,771
Huh? But Ren plays guitar.
Takumi's on bass.

315
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,871
Didn't you know?
Ren plays bass too.

316
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:50,911
Is that right?!

317
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,251
Ren does the bass on
the Sex Pistols tribute album,

318
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,721
and it is just incredibly awesome!

319
00:16:57,821 --> 00:17:00,791
Oh really.
I guess I need to do more research!

320
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:01,911
I see. That makes sense.

321
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,021
Oh, did I throw you off? I'm sorry!

322
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,061
No. Your bass is easy to sing with.

323
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,431
Will you join our band?

324
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:11,931
Yes, I'd be happy to!

325
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:15,531
Your singing and Nobu-san's guitar
gave me the shivers!

326
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:19,931
Oh but... there's one thing
you have to promise me first.

327
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:23,071
If you can't, then you're gonna hafta
decline right this moment.

328
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,811
Shin, do better than Ren.

329
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,481
Yes! Of course, that's what I intend to do.

330
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:39,361
Isn't that wonderful?

331
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,561
You found such a great bass player
in such a short time!

332
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:42,751
And he's cute!

333
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:45,031
So who do you have to thank?
Hey, who do you have to thank?

334
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:46,931
What are you getting at?

335
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,831
You want a prize that badly?

336
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,861
Let's see, then...

337
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,371
Don't litter!

338
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,411
Thank you, Hachiko.

339
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:13,031
I-I thought you didn't hit on women.

340
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:15,191
It's not right! I have a boyfriend!

341
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,701
What's she getting all uptight
about over a kiss?

342
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:18,961
It's not like she's a virgin.

343
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,801
You'll never change.

344
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,031
Sorry, Shoji! I just kissed someone
other than you!

345
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,571
But she's a girl,
so don't take it too hard, okay?

346
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:44,721
Wait...

347
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:47,321
This must look like I'm following her.

348
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:51,301
Um...

349
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,301
Miss Kawamura...

350
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:55,331
I'm not some molester.

351
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,471
Oh, Mr. Endo, it's you.

352
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,111
Sorry about that.
You scared me for a minute there.

353
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:05,451
This is a quiet street.
It's not safe walking alone.

354
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,581
But it's a shortcut to the station
and if I don't hurry,

355
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,021
I'll miss the last train.

356
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:13,221
Oh, me too. Shall we run together then?

357
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:13,981
Yes!

358
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:17,721
You're not getting
on the same train are you, Sachiko?

359
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,561
Oh, good. I made it.

360
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:29,731
Don't tell me we're getting off
at the same station, Sachiko.

361
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:34,741
Where are you getting off, Mr. Endo?

362
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,141
My stop's the third one.

363
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,271
How about you, Sachi...
Er, ah... Miss Kawamura?

364
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,311
Mine's the second stop.

365
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,411
Oh, uh, will you be okay walking home
from the station?

366
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,581
Yes I'll be fine. I live right
across from the station.

367
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:47,581
Is that so?

368
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:48,991
That's a relief then.

369
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,531
Thank you.
You're so kind, Mr. Endo.

370
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:58,831
Good night.

371
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:03,871
She's pretty cute, that Sachiko!

372
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,271
Quite a difference from
the make-believe Sachiko!

373
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:09,271
This isn't good!
I'll hafta keep away from her!

374
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:19,181
That was so much fun!

375
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,911
Settle down! You're making me cold!

376
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,061
D-D-Don't come onto this side
of the bed!

377
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,761
Whose bed is this anyway?

378
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,161
If you don't like it,
sleep on the floor!

379
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,271
There!

380
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:37,431
Come on!

381
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,131
There!

382
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,271
Hey!

383
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:48,081
I can tell you honestly now,
my feelings of looking up to you,

384
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,411
it was quite a lot like falling in love.

385
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,851
I really wasn't ready to grow up.

386
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:58,791
Yet within the reality of being expected
to fend for myself,

387
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:01,751
you always showed me
the sweetest dreams.

388
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,571
It was like first love
in its happiest moments.

389
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:12,661
I reached into the sky

390
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:19,181
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

391
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:24,551
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

392
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:30,551
Like colorful balloons

393
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,661
I'm alone

394
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:36,391
My hand had no place to go

395
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:43,031
And gently you took it

396
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,211
Starless night

397
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:48,401
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

398
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:54,211
I want to feel your warmth

399
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,081
Tears are falling down

400
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,221
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

401
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:06,681
Of your hand holding mine
