1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,616
What's happened so far!

2
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,193
I've been thinking, and well, I thought
maybe I could do the play after all...

2
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:06,358
I'm not doing it.

3
00:00:07:650 --> 00:00:08,322
What?!

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:11,992
Come on baby!

5
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:18,431
Arima-kun!

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:20,835
It's not worth seeing.

7
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:25,338
The Dean of the class!
Power. He has power!

9
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:30,353
We're going to put on a play.

10
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:36,116
What?!
Sis is going to be in a play?!

11
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,418
One of my friends is a writer.

12
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:40,360
Ah?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,020
The Week of September is almost over.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,315
Each group has decided on what they're doing.
*Next, about printing the programs, there
will be more meetings and discussions.*

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,790
Next week...next week is going to be hell.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,290
Everyone's going to begin preparations,

20
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,199
so things are going to get
nightmarishly busy again.

21
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,328
Now, onto the next topic.

22
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,172
That meeting dragged on.

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,712
Huh? They're not here.

24
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,109
Hey! Yukinon!

25
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:45,085
We saw you running down the hall

26
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,895
We're in a fix, All the classes have started
to fill up with plywood and cardboard boxes.

28
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,662
So there isn't a classroom we could use.

29
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,501
Not even the library or the science room?

30
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:54,234
No good. We went everywhere,

31
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,432
but they've all been taken over already.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,198
I told you so.

33
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,739
It's unreasonable to start a play

34
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:01,836
What should we do?

35
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:04,003
Hey, listen when I'm talking to you!

36
00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:06,310
Huh? Kawashima-sensei's beckoning to us.

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,907
What, no vacant classrooms?

38
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,956
Well then, use the student guidance room.

39
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:14,685
We won't be needing it for a while anyway.

40
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,055
Power!

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,587
Did you write down what preparations we need
to do between now and the performance?

43
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,321
Yeah, how's this?

44
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,592
Let's see?

45
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,335
Reading through the script,
rehearsal, dress rehearsal,

46
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:32,173
deciding on the look for the costumes,
the scene, the set and props...

47
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:37,773
Oh, we'd have to actually measure the
size of the stage in the gym before
we make the set or we'll screw up.

50
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,249
We'll check the lighting and sound setup then.

51
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:44,083
Deciding on the details for BGM,
sound effects, and lighting...

52
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:47,423
We can think about these while we're
reading our lines, so they can wait.

54
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,194
It's too bad that tomorrow's a Sunday.

55
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:56,096
Let's decide on the outline today and go
shopping for things tomorrow afternoon. Okay?

56
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:56,723
O-okay!

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,361
Yukinon really does the work
of ten people by herself.

58
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:02,428
Let's finalize the schedule first.

59
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,767
How much time we're going
to spend on what.

60
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,864
We can't afford to waste any time.

61
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,776
I keep telling you,

62
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,038
what can we do in only one we-

63
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:11,141
Have you come up with the set designs?

64
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,079
Yes we have!

65
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:16,781
And we can't get anywhere without
the actors knowing their lines,

67
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,246
so be sure to have everything
perfectly memorized by Monday.

68
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:20,386
WHAT?!

69
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:23,057
I could do it.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,289
What, you can't even do that?

71
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:26,760
Yes I can!

72
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,797
So this is the stage layout?

73
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,271
We came up with it.

74
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,000
Neat! So this is what it's like.

75
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:41,939
Wow, I can just see it happening.

76
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,944
Oh yeah, what are we going to
do about the giant monitor?

77
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,640
It's key to the story...

78
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,679
...but it would be tough to do.

79
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,043
That's taken care of.

80
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,216
My brother works for an AV company,
and when I showed...

81
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,715
...him the story, he got interested
and said he'd do it.

82
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:56,951
Huh? What's wrong?

83
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:59,655
You bastard!

84
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:00,654
Ow!

85
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,032
What the hell do you think you're
doing?! This is your project!

86
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,164
Are you trying to ruin it yourself?!

87
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:09,766
You want all of us to spend the day of
the Culture Fair suspended at home?!
I told you to quit! 

89
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:12,336
Huh?  When did I?

90
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:18,442
How's it going? I'd called you over because
I was going to offer some sweets.

92
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,621
We're finally done... It's dark already.

93
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,452
Okay, tomorrow at 12:30 in front of
the station.

94
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,224
Good work, everyone.

95
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,267
What's the matter, Yukinon?

96
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,935
The lights are still on in the stadium.

97
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:42,698
Arima might be there so...

98
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:43,662
...I'm going to take a look.

99
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,001
...Love-monkey.

100
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:45,964
How about you?

101
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,710
I'll pass.

102
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:51,211
Souichirou-kun gets really scary
if I'm around in a situation like that.

104
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:52,376
You go ahead.

105
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,844
Shall we go get something to
eat at a family restaurant?

106
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:55,776
Let's go!

107
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,446
Okay, I'll go for a little bit.

108
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,215
Bye Yukinon!

109
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:00,088
See you later.

110
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:01,521
Bye!

111
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,252
Wait, I'm coming too!

112
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,372
I've never seen Arima doing kendo.

113
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,342

114
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,039
What a waste.

115
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,341
This is exciting!

116
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,647
Waiting for my boyfriend, winner of the
Interhigh, to finish practice...

117
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:30,551
It's so luxurious!

118
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,070
That's all for today!

119
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:06,579
Oops, he saw me.

120
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:16,155
Thanks you for your help!

121
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:19,225
What's up?

122
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,701
The discussion for the play ran late,

123
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:22,866
so I was watching.

124
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,000
This was the first time
I've watched you do kendo!

125
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:27,233
You were so cool!

126
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:28,736
It was really exciting.

127
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:32,340
I should have done this sooner.
Can I come again?

128
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,423
Peeyew!

129
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:48,892
Ohmigod Arima,

130
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,766
you reek of sweaty armor!

131
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,468
I mean, just smelling like
sweat is one thing, but!

132
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,802
Get away! Don't touch me!
I can't believe you!

133
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:01,805
What is that rotten stench?!
How can you stand to wear that?!

134
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,573
Stay away!
There's no way I'd ever do kendo!

135
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:06,572
Ow! Who would poke their girlfriend?

136
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,211
...with their bamboo sword?

137
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:15,084
I came by bike today.

138
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,352
Then I'll ride too.

139
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:20,594
Go for it, Miyazawa!

140
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:30,071
Lift off!

141
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,602
Are you dragging your feet?
There's a strange sound...

142
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,041
No I'm not.

143
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:51,686
When?

144
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:54,454
When did you start kendo?

145
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:55,927
When I was seven.

146
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,633
You must really like it.

147
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,127
Yeah. It feels good to be moving around,

148
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,796
and I like the tensed atmosphere
of the stadium.

149
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,120
Miyazawa.

150
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,545
Practice is over!

151
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:33,651
Phew, am I beat!

152
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:40,591
Oh, I'm sorry, Tonami-san.

153
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,087
I didn't notice you there.

154
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,399
No, it's my fault for
standing behind you,

156
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:46,292
...Sakura-san.

157
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,972
I'm scared. Let's go home.

158
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,769
Good job guys...

159
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,509
Phew, I'm beat.

160
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,064
Hey. You still practicing?

161
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:25,639
You're really zealous.

162
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,472
You again.

163
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,237
When you get to be a starter
as a first year,

164
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,079
...you can't be disgraceful.

165
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,607
I'm busy, so leave.

166
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:43,716
I have nothing better to do, so I'll watch.

167
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,953
Just leave! I said, get lost!

168
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,823
Hey, why do you keep harassing me?

169
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:26,599
You just transferred here.

170
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,727
Why do you keep picking
fights with me?

171
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:41,440
Because I hate you.
I hate people like you.

172
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,290
No particular reason.

173
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:04,931
Hatred is just another facet of love.

174
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,708
Hatred is an obsession about another person.

175
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,577
It's the closest emotion to love.

176
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,571
Oh god, could it be?!

177
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,875
Wh-what are you talking about?

178
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,016
And this is a deserted gym!

180
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,050
Now, we have the perfect situation
for something to go wrong!

181
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:20,847
Hey, wait a sec!

183
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,920
Sorry, but I have no such
intentions, so go somewhere else!

184
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,193
I think you've got things mixed up.

185
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,359
I told you I hate you.

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,538
It looks like l,m doing weird things,
but that's not my intention.

187
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,301
You couldn't beat me in strength.
There isn't anything you can beat me in.

188
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,808
You moron!

189
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:47,376
You fight with your head!

190
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:51,984
You're a hundred years too young to beat me!

192
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:02,423
Dammit!

193
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,299
That wasn't enough.

194
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,932
I can't hurt her even a little
bit with something like that.

195
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,402
It's always been like that.

196
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:18,037
So aloof, and difficult to pin down.

197
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,584
Like a kite without a string,
she can't be restricted.

198
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:23,519
Even what happened now probably...

199
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,348
...just made her a little mad and
she'll soon forget about it.

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,352
She probably never thought about
me in the past two years.

203
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,292
How much those words hurt me.

204
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:41,129
Oh, the teacher asked me to look
after you back in elementary school.

206
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,269
With me around,

207
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:45,230
you wouldn't get beat up as much.

208
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,074
And it's rather my policy
not to beat people up.

209
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:51,576
Or what I went through in those two years.

211
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,709
Well, good luck at your new school.

212
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,740
That's what I hate about her.

213
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:59,215
My humiliation still can't hurt
you even a little bit.

215
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,314
I'll make you feel it someday, for sure!
The same pain that I felt!

216
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,000
Am I the last one here?

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,859
Asaba-kun's not here yet.

218
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,100
Tsubasa-chan, good morning!
You're as cute as ever!

219
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,753
Hey, she didn't scratch today.

220
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,000
She must be in a good mood.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,333
What do we do next?

222
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,301
Well, shall we go to a cafe first?

223
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,611
I want to go to the place where
they have fresh-baked bread.

225
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,075
They serve whole wheat bread
stuffed full of roast beef!

226
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,313
Sounds great!

227
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:30,747
Hey girls!

228
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:32,586
Wow, you guys are so cute!

229
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:34,886
You never find a group of girls
all looking this good.

230
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:35,721
Right?

231
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,483
Is that little girl your sister?

232
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,525
Are you going somewhere?
How about if we join you?

233
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:42,321
Shut up.

234
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,096
We have no need of you, so get lost.

235
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,232
We got yelled at by a babe!

236
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:47,564
You?

237
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:50,367
Okay, okay, excuse me.

238
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,809
All these girls here are with me.

239
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,046
A freaky dude!

240
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:02,512
Well, that was a close shave, kitten.

241
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,009
What're you doing dressed up
like a Dadaist for?

243
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,951
Or rather, do we have to walk around
all day with a guy dressed like this?

245
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:16,063
So, we can borrow the sound effects
CD from the student PA system.

247
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:19,090
And I called the president of
the wind ensemble last night.

249
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:21,928
You did all that after you went home?
What a day for you.

250
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:23,566
Nobody has any time to lose.

251
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,801
Oh, and about the show time...

252
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,341
Put some normal clothes on!

253
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:29,811
It's a waste!

254
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:33,744
About this?

255
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:40,015
Or this!

256
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:41,545
That's nice! Try this next.

257
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,490
We've digressed already.

258
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:45,891
Are you sure about these people?

259
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,292
Hey hey hey Tsubasa-chan!

260
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,030
Try this on! Hurry

261
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,061
Two acts?

262
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,336
Yeah. The script's pretty long.

263
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,670
When we actually do it,
I think it will take about two hours.

264
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,143
But a two-hour slot is hard to get.

265
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,639
So I was thinking we could break
it into two parts.

266
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,240
I wouldn't know without asking you,

267
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,244
so what do you think?

268
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,783
Hmm... that's a tough choice...

269
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,551
I'd like to do it all at once,

270
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,949
but it'll be tough physically too...

271
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,884
The problem is whether
the audience would come.

272
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,326
What kind of timeslots would it be?

273
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:27,768
We're a last-minute entry so
all the good times are out.

276
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,833
Nobody would come at like 9:30 A.M or 4 P.M.

278
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,730
So I thought we could use
the lunch hour.

279
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:33,631
Right?

280
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,441
And here's the latest!

281
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:39,107
The wind ensemble won't be using
the gym this year.

283
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:42,951
Its president is in my section
on the Student Council,

285
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,344
...and since being a
club president is tough,

286
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:47,253
I often help him out with
work, or trade assignments.

288
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:49,921
So when I asked him, he was really
eager to give us their slot.

289
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:51,924
You're just like a politician!

290
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:53,554
The world works through connections!

291
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,424
Where's the wind ensemble
going to play?

292
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:56,788
The roof.

293
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,099
They're going to play
the Titanic theme at sunset.

294
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,260
Sweet! Let's go!

295
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,868
My Heart Will Go On, huh?

296
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,130
What a great song.

297
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,941
Celine Dion is the modern songstress.

298
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,668
I can sing that.

299
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,273
I learned it with Kazuma.

300
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:14,341
Oh my gosh! I want to hear it!
I want to hear it!

301
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,245
Ooh, then shall we treat ourselves
to karaoke after this?

302
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,044
Great idea!

303
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,911
I'll sing Romance by Penicillin!

304
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,190
That's too you!

305
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,154
I'll do Shiina Ringo-san's
Queen of Entertainment!

306
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:28,554
Good choice!

307
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:29,760
We'll do Citron .

308
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:30,964
Not Kiroro?

309
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,227
Hey!

310
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,160
We're short on time, aren't we?
Are you sure you can be playing around?!

312
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:43,472
...and why do I have to be
the one who's worried?!

313
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:44,910
It's no big deal.

314
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:47,777
I'm glad you're finally into it.

315
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,015
As it turned out, Maho-san was?
forced to sing Nakayama Miho's song!

317
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,780
I want to go home...

318
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,151
I'm home!

319
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:01,591
I'm exhausted.

320
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,255
Sis...

321
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:04,994
You have to memorize your
lines by tomorrow, right

323
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,736
We're going to do a script reading.

324
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:09,499
Come on...

325
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:36,862
I'm pooped, but it feels good.

327
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:40,633
This is totally different from being
worn out from studying.

328
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,536
I wonder if this is how Arima
feels after practice?

329
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,427
The characters are swamped
by the steadily

330
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:57,929
advancing preparations for
the Culture Fair.

331
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,564
But unrelated to that,

332
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:00,802
Miyazawa Yukino and Arima Souichirou,

333
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,002
who worry about what others think,

334
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,102
were reflecting about themselves.

335
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:04,238
The two of them then?!

336
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:06,134
A Different Story from Before
