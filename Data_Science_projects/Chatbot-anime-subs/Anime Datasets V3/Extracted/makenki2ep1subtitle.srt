Sink your teeth into a moment.</font></font>

168
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,930
Bras by Runner's Senpai Adachi,</font></font>

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,210
Was wearing a size "F" field.</font></font>

170
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,400
If the second, Size should "never" be?</font></font>

171
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,540
This is... The mark, hide,</font></font>

172
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,980
The main pattern.</font></font>

173
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,210
This action?</font></font>

174
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,140
That's right.</font></font>

175
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,350

Oh, how are you so confident?</font></font>

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,820
I Yvsvyy a few moments ago, we were Senpai Adachi.</font></font>

181
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,090
A review of her breasts from two different angles,</font></font>

00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,890
We could have done a mutiny of his hot chest,</font></font>

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,020
United breasts theory</font></font>

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,020
What we call the theory of Matt breasts....</font></font>
