1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,294
I cannot forgive anyone who toys
with a girl's precious time!

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,206
Even the cuckoo in the
cuckoo clock is mad!

3
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:19,409
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon
will punish you.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

6
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,621
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

7
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:14,753
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

8
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

9
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

10
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,115
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

11
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:49,152
I believe in it, miracle romance

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,128
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

14
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:03,337
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

15
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:07,412
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

16
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,550
and gave me a peculiar transforming
brooch and made me a sailor warrior.

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,620
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

18
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,020
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:20,314
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:31,933
Usagi's Misfortune!
Watch Out For the Rushing Clocks

21
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,776
What?! Did you say the second
warrior showed up?

22
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:42,614
Yes.

23
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,876
The nerve!

24
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:49,648
Then all the more reason to hurry
and collect energy for our ruler!

25
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:54,622
Queen Beryl, I have a great idea.

26
00:02:56,028 --> 00:03:01,066
Humans produce more energy when
they are psychologically stressed.

27
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,591
For example, when they
are pressed for time.

28
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:07,933
So, if we steal their time and
cause them to rush about,

29
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,174
we can efficiently collect
their increased energy.

30
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,279
Very well. Proceed with your plan.

31
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,507
Yes, my lady.

32
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:23,822
Harajuku Station
Entrance

33
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,825
Harajuku Station
Entrance
Wow! There are so many people!

34
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,350
Harajuku Station
Entrance
I guess you've never come
to places like this before.

35
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:32,264
I'd read about them in books,
but that was all.

36
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:35,062
Ami, you're still young.
You need to go out more!

37
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,501
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:36,935
You don't need to apologize.
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,630
You don't need to apologize.

40
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,299
Anyway, since we're here,

41
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:44,507
let's have as much fun as we can
window-shopping!

42
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,102
Okay.

43
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,138
Ta-da!

44
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,684
Let's go over here next!

45
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:53,251
Oh, wait!
Let's go over here next!

46
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:53,808
Oh, wait!

47
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:55,746
Look, look, Ami!

48
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,889
What do you think?

49
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,151
I like this one!

50
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,182
I don't think so!!

51
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:05,797
What's wrong?

52
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,264
Oh, nothing.
What's wrong?

53
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:07,231
Oh, nothing.

54
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,636
Hey, did you find
anything interesting?

55
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:12,864
Yes, lots.

56
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,340
Ami, what kind of books do you read?

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,842
Shall we show each other
what we got?

58
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,077
It's all words!

59
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:20,476
It's all comics!

60
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,014
I'm tired.

61
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,049
Me, too.

62
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,017
What's going on? There are
so many people.

63
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:26,618
I don't know.

64
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:27,052
Clock Look
Big Spring Bargain Week
I don't know.

65
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,454
Clock Look
Big Spring Bargain Week
Oh, an opening sale.

66
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,589
Clock Look
Big Spring Bargain Week
Look at all those people.

67
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:31,022
Look at all those people.

68
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,625
Fifty to seventy-percent off!

69
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,856
Oh, wow, that's so cheap!
Wanna check it out?

70
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:41,223
I already have the watch I got
from my mother, so I'm okay.

71
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,470
You should act more your age!
It's free if we're just going to look.

72
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,801
So, it'd be a waste if we don't!

73
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,111
Welcome.

74
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,940
Please feel free to look around.

75
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,445
Wow! They're so cheap!

76
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,118
Are watches usually this cheap?

77
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,890
Nope, looks like this place is special.
It's unbelievable!

78
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,019
Look! It's so weird!

79
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:13,865
It's cute!

80
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,332
You're right!
It's cute!

81
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:14,699
You're right!

82
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,133
You're right!
Wow, it looks just like Luna!

83
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,436
Wow, it looks just like Luna!

84
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,337
Maybe I'll buy this one.

85
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,706
After all, I'm always late for school.

86
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:24,976
How do you like it?
It's a nice bargain.

87
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,206
I know. It's so cheap.

88
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:34,452
It may be cheap, but my wallet
still can't take it!

89
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:37,780
And if I'm late to school one more
time, I'll break my own record!

90
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,086
Usagi, if you want, I'll come
get you every morning.

91
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,061
So, please don't cry.

92
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,461
Yippie! Ami, I love you!

93
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,497
I'm home!

94
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,833
Hi, Usagi. I got you something
nice today.

95
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,941
Wow, talk about rare! So, what
did you get for me?

96
00:05:55,941 --> 00:06:00,605
Here. I went shopping with Naru
and Umino's mothers today.

97
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,782
Clock Look. So, you went there too.

98
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:06,151
The clock store we stopped by was
having an incredible sale.

99
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,847
Umino's mom bought seven clocks!

100
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:10,355
Oh! This is...

101
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:11,723
Isn't it nice?

102
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:15,921
I just remembered that you are always
late for school. Am I nice?

103
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:17,452
Thank you!

104
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,557
Looks like God didn't
abandon me after all...

105
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,861
Usagi, which part of this clock
looks like me?

106
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,940
Look very carefully! I'm better
looking than that clock!

107
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,909
Yeah, yeah... You're right.

108
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:34,208
Since Ami will be here tomorrow, I
don't need to worry about being late.

109
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:39,518
First of all, that cat
looks so sneaky.

110
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,586
Yeah, you're right... Good night.

111
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:46,990
Really, Usagi! Do I look
as sneaky as that cat?

112
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,289
I wonder if this is...

113
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:30,769
Yes! Oh, Miss Mizuno!

114
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,999
Is Usagi still asleep?

115
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,839
No. She already left.

116
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,976
What?! Already?! It's only 7 o'clock.

117
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:41,844
Are you kidding? Her brother,
Shingo, left home before 7.

118
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,149
You need to hurry.
Otherwise, you will be late.

119
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,352
Oh, I'm late! Then, see you tonight!

120
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,286
Okay, see you later!

121
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,090
Now, I have to vacuum the rooms
and do the laundry.

122
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,354
Oh, no! It's almost time for dinner!

123
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,794
What are you doing?!

124
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,891
Oh! I'm late!

125
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,430
They're late!

126
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,177
I can't wait anymore!

127
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,838
I'll go out there and get everybody!

128
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,515
Me, too! I can't stay here
like this anymore!

129
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,143
Then, me, too! Somehow,
I can't stay still!

130
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,886
That's enough! You can study
by yourself today!

131
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:25,924
I have no other choice.

132
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,324
It's already 8, and most students
haven't even shown up yet.

133
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:32,155
Anyway, I have four dates today.

134
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,828
So, I cannot stay here like this.
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,402
Then, me, too!

136
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,971
Once I finish eating my lunch,
I have nothing left to do.

137
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,106
That's right!

138
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:46,044
In old days, they used to say,
"Fall in love, life is short!"

139
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,375
You are so wrong!

140
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:51,278
Anyway, we shouldn't waste
our time like this!

141
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,480
You're right! Let's go home!

142
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:02,661
Why are the shops opening so early?

143
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,992
Ami!

144
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,633
I'm glad I found you.

145
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:12,470
I don't know what is going on, but
Usagi left home early today.

146
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,873
You, too. Why are you
in such a hurry?

147
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,409
I think something is wrong
with this clock.

148
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,138
Ami, can you check this?

149
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,473
I had no idea.

150
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,515
Anyway, let's open this and see...

151
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:24,812
Oh, yeah...

152
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,422
What is this?

153
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:33,983
To put it simply, it's a
compact supercomputer.

154
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:37,759
It's really useful for analyzing
and calculating things.

155
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:40,265
Are you sure I can have this?

156
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:42,801
Of course! Usagi would never
figure out how to use it,

157
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,326
but I know you'll be able
to use it easily!

158
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,472
Thank you, Luna.

159
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:49,107
Anyway, can you hurry
and check the clock?

160
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,199
Oh, of course!

161
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,214
That was...

162
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,579
What was that?!

163
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,215
Ami, look!

164
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,418
It's empty?

165
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:05,356
I thought so. This is
no ordinary clock.

166
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,025
The weird way people are acting

167
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,516
must have something to do
with that Clock Look.

168
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:50,029
Oh, no! I'm hurt! I need to rush
to the hospital!

169
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,596
Oh, I'm in trouble!
My plane already left!

170
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,471
Now, I have no choice,
I'm going to run to Paris!

171
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:00,573
Stupid humans, rushing
to your deaths.

172
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:05,914
The more you hurry, the more
energy you produce.

173
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:12,218
Once I collect all the energy
created by your impatience,

174
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:16,489
our great ruler is certain
to be very satisfied.

175
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,662
All the energy collected by
my clocks will be gathered

176
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:28,997
in this gigantic clock no matter
where they are.

177
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:36,176
You certainly know how to
manipulate time, Ramua.

178
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:41,242
Your magical power really paralyzed
their sense of time.

179
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,386
Thank you for your kind words.

180
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,357
Now, I leave everything to you.

181
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,261
There is a possibility
that they will appear

182
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,525
because of the commotion.
So, be careful.

183
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,761
Yes, sir. You can count on me.

184
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,774
Oh, it's slow, it's so slow!

185
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:02,408
It's too slow! Why is this bus
so darn slow?!
Oh, it's slow, it's so slow!

186
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,276
It's too slow! Why is this bus
so darn slow?!

187
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:07,439
Please be quiet! You're not the
only one getting impatient!

188
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,112
Then, do something! Remember?!
You're the one driving!

189
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:17,277
Ouch! What's going on?!

190
00:12:17,723 --> 00:12:19,850
If I can't go left, I'll go to the right!

191
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:24,430
I've been doing this for ten years!
I'm a genius, out of my way!

192
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,364
Stop Next

193
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,928
Oh, the bus!

194
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:32,838
Excuse me! I need to get off!
Please stop the bus!

195
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:35,574
Unfortunately, I've decided that
this bus will run express today!

196
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,142
So, don't expect me to stop
until the last stop!

197
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:37,877
What?!
So, don't expect me to stop
until the last stop!

198
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:38,310
What?!
Just stop the bus!

199
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,504
Just stop the bus!

200
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:43,782
It's weird. Nobody at school
answered the phone.

201
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:47,115
Where did Usagi go?!

202
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:48,821
What shall we do?

203
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,990
I'm not comfortable doing this
all by ourselves.

204
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,551
I know. I guess we have no choice
but to find Usagi.

205
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:58,631
I'm getting off!

206
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:58,998
Oh, my bus! My bus!
I'm getting off!

207
00:12:58,998 --> 00:12:59,865
Oh, my bus! My bus!

208
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:00,399
Oh, my bus! My bus!
We're going to be late!

209
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,195
We're going to be late!

210
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:04,670
What were you thinking?!

211
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,872
You should know I'm too busy for this!

212
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,430
Oh, Usagi!

213
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:10,100

How can you stay so calm?!

222
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,223
You think that clock store
is behind this, right?

223
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:26,214
Then, we should just
charge in already!

224
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,422
Usagi, you're completely under
the spell of the monster.

225
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:33,832
I have so many things to do today!

226
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:38,504
Go home early, eat snacks and
finish the rest of my game.

227
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:42,274
Then, take a bath... Oh, I didn't
know it's so late already!

228
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,776
Okay, I got it.

229
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:46,078
I'll figure out a way to get in.

230
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,342
So, just wait a minute. Right, Ami?

231
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,984
We could try to get in from the back,

232
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,286
but the enemy could already
be waiting for us.

233
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:55,921
Then, through the front! The front!

234
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:58,424
It doesn't matter which way we go,
if it's going to be a trap anyway!

235
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,459
Now, Ami, let's transform quickly.

236
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,824
What?! Already?!

237
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,292
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

238
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,798
You, too, Ami! Hurry!

239
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,800
Thinking isn't going to
get us anywhere.

240
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,502
Okay. I know they say, "Nothing
ventured, nothing gained."

241
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,078
Not you too, Ami?

242
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,070

243
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,685
Okay, let's go!

00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,522
Oh, wait for me!

245
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:19,428
Now, Moon Tiara Action!

246
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:36,817
I'm so unlucky...

247
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,726
Sailor Moon! That door!

248
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:41,784
I know!

249
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,556
Who's there?!

250
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,496
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

251
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:56,173
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!

252
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,342
We're here to fight you!

253
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:03,712
Well, well, I'm impressed. I never
expected you to show up so early.

254
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:08,153
I cannot forgive anyone who toys
with a girl's precious time!

255
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,485
Even the cuckoo in the
cuckoo clock is mad!

256
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:13,221
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

257
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:16,462
You're nothing!

258
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:21,422
I'll show you that this is where
you're going to die!

259
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,676
Now, come and get me, Sailor Moon!

260
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,211
You're not getting away!

261
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,812
Oh, Sailor Moon!

262
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,013
Are you ready, Mercury?

263
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes!
Are you ready, Mercury?

264
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,110
Yes!

Where did she go?

268
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:50,629
Be careful, Sailor Moon!

269
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,698
The monster has probably set
a trap somewhere.

270
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,199
I'm getting irritated.

271
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:57,760
You coward! It's cheap
not to show yourself!

272
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:02,204
I'm waiting right here.
Why don't you come?

273
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,977
You don't have to tell me that,
I'll be right there!

274
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:08,003
Oh, wait! It's dangerous to
just walk around blindly.

275
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,018
Mercury, just follow me!

276
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,007
Sailor Moon!

277
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,451
Not here!

278
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:23,787
Sailor Moon, if you just walk around
without thinking, we'll get lost!

279
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:27,257
Don't worry! Because
I've got you, Mercury!

280
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,176
Hey, what's that?

281
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:39,610
It's a computer. Luna gave it
to me just a while ago.

282
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,780
That looks awesome!

283
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,510
What's wrong? Are you still there?

284
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:48,380
Shut up! I'll be there soon.
So, you just wait!

285
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,990
Remember? You're the one
that's cheating here!

286
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,724
Oh, no!

287
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:53,192
And you're trying to...
Oh, no!

288
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:53,759
And you're trying to...

289
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,192
Sailor Moon, this way!

290
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:03,168
Oh, that was scary.

291
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:08,006
It seems like time here can go
faster or slower.

292
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,142
And sometimes it goes backward.
It's really unstable.

293
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,978
Then, there could be a room
where we become grannies?

294
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:13,845
Yes...

295
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:14,079
I'm the sailor warrior, Sailor Moon.
Yes...

296
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,343
I'm the sailor warrior, Sailor Moon.

297
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,308
No way!

298
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,827
So, they're not here.

299
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,367
Have you found something yet?

300
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:35,801
Just a minute...

301
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:36,835
I'm getting irritated.
Just a minute...

302
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm getting irritated.

303
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,165
Just as I expected.

304
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,801
Found something?

305
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:46,278
It seems like this maze is set up
in a certain way...

306
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:48,213
Then, where is she?

307
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:51,205
There's a 78% probability
she's this way.

308
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,151
Let's go!

309
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:53,318
Okay!
Let's go!

310
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,342
Okay!

311
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,063
Nice job. You finally found
where I am.

312
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:12,738
But this is the end!
I hope you are ready.

313
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,933
You're the one who should get ready!

314
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:23,136
Oh? I can't stand up. Why not?

315
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,548
Finally, it's starting to work.

316
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:31,550
Your energy has been sucked away
by my clock.

317
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:33,692
What?!

318
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:34,886
Her energy?

319
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:36,952
Now!

320
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,888
It hurts!

321
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,367
Sailor Moon!

322
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,766
You're in my way!

323
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:53,839
I can't move...

324
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,572
I just stopped your time.

325
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,383
So, enjoy watching Sailor Moon suffer.

326
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,918

00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:24,273
Oh! I got my power back!

00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,308
Oh, no! My energy!

329
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:30,749
Now, I can move!

Are you all right, Sailor Moon?

334
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,388
Thank you. I'm okay now.

335
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:51,229
She's over there!

336
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,862
Okay!

Let's go! Hurry!
Really?!

349
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,221
Let's go! Hurry!

350
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,359
It hurts!

351
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:56,268
I don't think her personality
will ever change!

352
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:56,468
It hurts!
I don't think her personality
will ever change!

353
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:58,403
It hurts!

354
00:21:58,403 --> 00:21:59,563
I suppose.

355
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:13,219
In my dream, you and I were together

356
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:19,852
Protected by the stars

357
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:35,104
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

358
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:42,242
And we casually talked to each other

359
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:51,019
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

360
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:57,988
I want to become prettier
right here and now

361
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:05,526
Something changes when
you fall in love

362
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:12,107
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

363
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:25,991
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
