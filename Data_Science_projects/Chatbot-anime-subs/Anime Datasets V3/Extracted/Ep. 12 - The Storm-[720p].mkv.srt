1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,796
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,907
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,201
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:15,402
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:19,484
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:23,799
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,962
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,124
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,965
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,173
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:38,908
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,533
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,082
We need you, Aang.

15
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:18,989
I need you too.

16
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:26,322
Be careful guys!

17
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,741
Guys?

18
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:29,959
Gyatso?

19
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:32,650
Why did you disappear?

20
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,946
I didn't mean to.

21
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:43,796
We need you, Aang.

22
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:54,600
We need you, Aang. We need you.

23
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:58,166
Huh? Uh... what's going on? Did we get captured again?

24
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:01,735
It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.

25
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,837
Don't have to tell me twice.

26
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,165
Are you all right, Aang?

27
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,281
I'm okay.

28
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:10,054
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,953
I think I just need some rest.

30
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:15,397
You guys want to hear about my dream?

31
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:19,422
That's ok, I didn't wanna talk about it anyway.

32
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:28,668
Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,102
Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food.

34
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:36,607
Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market.

35
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,308
What happened in your dream?

36
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,235
Food eats people!

37
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:47,535
Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things.

38
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:56,148
There is a storm coming. A big one.

39
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:57,621
You're out of your mind, Uncle.

40
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:00,633
The weather's perfect. There is not a cloud in sight.

41
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:03,675
The storm is approaching from the north.

42
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:07,710
I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.

43
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:11,605
We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.

44
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,926
Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.

45
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,965
The safety of the crew doesn't matter!

46
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:27,781
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.

47
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,048
He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up.

48
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,425
Ah, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!

49
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,037
I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.

50
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:48,385
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?

51
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,421
I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe.

52
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:55,644
I just realized we're out of money anyway.

53
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,418
Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do?

54
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,457
You could get a job, smart guy.

55
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:07,059
We shouldn't go out there!

56
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:10,921
Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm.

57
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,628
Ahh, you're crazy! It's a nice day.

58
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,848
No clouds, no wind, no nothing, so quit you're naggin' woman.

59
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:20,612
Maybe we should find some shelter?

60
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,094
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

61
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,125
My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.

62
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,260
Well, it's your joints against my brain.

63
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,032
Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, cause I ain't comin!

64
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:38,879
Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! How do you like that?

65
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:39,866
I'll go!

66
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:42,559
You're hired!

67
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:46,035
What? You said... get a job' and he's paying double.

68
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:50,397
Double? Who told ya that nonsense?

69
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:58,066
Uh! Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.

70
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,137
Lucky guess.

71
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:05,311
Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect, or I will teach it to you.

72
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:12,011
What do you know about respect? The way you talk to everyone around here,...

73
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:14,965
...from your hard working crew to your esteemed uncle...

74
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:21,210
...shows you know nothing about respect. You don't care about anyone but yourself!

75
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:28,315
Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?

76
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:32,193
Easy now.

77
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:40,020
Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long.

78
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:48,107
I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.

79
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:53,366
I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.

80
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:03,190
Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.

81
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:08,219
I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.

82
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:12,426
The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!

83
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:16,795
Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos...

84
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:21,100
...well I'll be a hogmonkey's uncle! You're the Avatar, ain't ya?

85
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,273
That's right.

86
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:28,154
Well don't be so smiley about it. The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years.

87
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,409
You turned your back on the world!

88
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:34,327
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone!

89
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,496
Oh? He wouldn't, uh?

90
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:41,909
Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering.

91
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,287
Aang is the bravest person I know!

92
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:48,436
He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.

93
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:56,263
It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang? What's wrong?

94
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,249
That's right! Keep flyin!

95
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:02,540
You're a horrible old man!

96
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:07,055
Appa, yip! Yip!

97
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:09,631
Hey, they left without saying goodbye!

98
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,860
You're friends ain't too polite, are they?

99
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,770
I know! This one time I was...

100
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:17,474
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, get below deck.

101
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,484
I'm sorry for running away.

102
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,946
It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line.

103
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,960
Actually, he wasn't.

104
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,659
What do you mean?

105
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,242
I don't wanna talk about it.

106
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:50,238
It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?

107
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,823
Talk to me.

108
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:56,005
Well, it's kind of a long story.

109
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:04,173
I'm gonna try to get a little fire going.

110
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:10,656
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.

111
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,233
I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall.

112
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:17,023
I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter...

113
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:21,965
First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.

114
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:30,046
Okay! Here goes!

115
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,624
Quick, get on!

116
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,882
You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top.

117
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:39,674
Man, that's hard.

118
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,434
Where'd ya learn that trick, Aang?

119
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:43,901
I made it up.

120
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:50,930
Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.

121
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,301
How do you know it's me?

122
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:05,911
We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?

123
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:10,409
Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!

124
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,984
You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang.

125
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,762
The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics.

126
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:23,174
These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.

127
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,898
I just chose them because they seemed fun.

128
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,898
You chose them because they were familiar.

129
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:33,508
Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned to sixteen,...

130
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:39,653
...but there are troubling signs, storm clouds are gathering.

131
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:43,179
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.

132
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,793
We need you, Aang.

133
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,784
I'm sick of taking his orders and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar!

134
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:59,283
I mean who does Zuko think he is?

135
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,358
Do you really want to know?

136
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,214
General Iroh! We were just...

137
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:06,447
It's ok. May I join you?

138
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:09,037
Of course, Sir!

139
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:16,228
Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man.

140
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,692
He has been through much...

141
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:25,216
Let me in!

142
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,230
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

143
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:30,429
I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!

144
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:36,333
You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.

145
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,283
If I'm gonna rule this nation one day,...

146
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,740
...don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?

147
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,765
Very well. But you must promise not to speak.

148
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,712
These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know.

149
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,305
Thank you uncle!

150
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,277
The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.

151
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:05,038
A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors,...

152
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:08,200
...so I am recommending the 41st division.

153
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:11,290
But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

154
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:15,413
How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

155
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:21,783
I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear.

156
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:25,509
What better to use as bait then fresh meat?

157
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,091
You can't sacrifice an entire division like that!

158
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:34,717
Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,651
Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out,...

160
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:44,719
...and there were... dire consequences.

161
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:50,358
So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

162
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,299
Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.

163
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:58,034
All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing...

164
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:01,078
Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!

165
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:05,451
Not only that, we made up a game you can play with the air scooters!

166
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:07,731
Great!

167
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:12,742
What's going on?

168
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,009
Now that you're the Avatar,...

169
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:18,043
...it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.

170
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:24,010
But I'm still the same... nothing's changed. So, what, I can't play?

171
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,944
That's the only fair way.

172
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,608
Oh, ok.

173
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:31,443
Sorry, Aang.

174
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:37,120
Okay, now who wants to have Jinju on their team?

175
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,051
Very interesting move, young one.

176
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,705
What do you mean?

177
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,806
Hey!

178
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:02,074
You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training.

179
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,900
Aang has already trained enough for today.

180
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:10,462
Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.

181
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,870
No, as long as I am his guardian,...

182
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:20,849
...I will decide when he trains and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.

183
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:33,726
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.

184
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:38,829
He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete...

185
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:44,634
...disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...

186
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,459
Agni kai. A fire duel.

187
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,110
That's right.

188
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:55,854
Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid.

189
00:13:55,945 --> 00:14:00,955
But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent,...

190
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,716
...he was surprised to see it was not the General.

191
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,369
Zuko had spoken out against a general's plan,...

192
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,554
...but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room,...

193
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,483
...it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.

194
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:22,630
Zuko would have to duel his own father.

195
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:27,259
Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened.

196
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:33,421
Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

197
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:37,138
Humph! You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.

198
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,815
Gyatso, I know you mean well,...

199
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,683
...but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.

200
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,667
All I want is what is best for him.

201
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:56,527
But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated.

202
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:03,817
The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.

203
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:15,619
That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.

204
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,124
How could they do that to me!

205
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:20,735
They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!

206
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,837
Whoa! Hot cinders!

207
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,158
I'm sorry I got so mad.

208
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:29,459
You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.

209
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:33,997
Well, that's not exactly what happened...

210
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:43,565
I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.

211
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:56,184
Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?

212
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:05,058
I never saw Gyatso again.

213
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:26,332
Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.

214
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,821
You ran away.

215
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:31,324
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.

216
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,799
My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.

217
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,788
You don't know what would've...

218
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,513
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.

219
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:38,374
Aang...

220
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:41,807
The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.

221
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,667
You're being too hard on yourself.

222
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:47,748
Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be.

223
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:51,349
If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.

224
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,568
You don't know that.

225
00:16:52,647 --> 00:17:02,589
I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.

226
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:10,886
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him,...

227
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:14,193
...he begged for mercy...

228
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,839
Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart!

229
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,767
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!

230
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:23,086
You will fight for your honor.

231
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,730
I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.

232
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:29,806
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko!

233
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,591
I won't fight you.

234
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:39,554
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.

235
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:42,474
I looked away.

236
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:51,555
I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident...

237
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,309
It was no accident.

238
00:17:54,389 --> 00:18:00,263
After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight,...

239
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:03,844
...Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

240
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:09,582
As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.

241
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:13,448
Only then could he return with his honor.

242
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:16,482
So that's why he's so obsessed.

243
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,574
Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.

244
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,349
Things will never return to normal.

245
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:31,835
But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

246
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:49,064
Help! Oh, please help!

247
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,843
It's ok, you're safe.

248
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,591
But, my husband isn't.

249
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,128
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

250
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:58,236
They haven't returned. They should've been back by now,...

251
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:02,694
...and this storm is becoming a typhoon. They're caught out at sea.

252
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,208
I'm going to find them.

253
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,416
I'm going with you.

254
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,972
I'm staying here!

255
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:13,169
We'll be back soon, I promise.

256
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,546
Where were we hit?

257
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:20,818
I don't know!

258
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,920
Look!

259
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,054
The helmsman!

260
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,645
Where are they?

261
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:59,852
Come on, Appa!

262
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,912
The boat! It's there!

263
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,940
The Avatar!

264
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,856
What do you want to do, Sir?

265
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,580
Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.

266
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:28,935
Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.

267
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,036
I'm too young to die!

268
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,924
I'm not, but I still don't wanna!

269
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,329
Hang on to the rope!

270
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:51,017
Uncle, I am sorry.

271
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:55,308
Your apology is accepted.

272
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:18,768
Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology.

273
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:20,655
He doesn't have to apologize.

274
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:26,377
Mmm, uh, what if instead of an apology I give him a free fish and we call it even?

275
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:28,267
Actually, I don't eat meat.

276
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:29,830
Fish ain't meat.

277
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,338
Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?

278
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:38,516
Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.

279
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:39,394
Really?

280
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,480
I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away.

281
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,730
I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it.

282
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,539
I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.

283
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:53,523
Uh, if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either.

284
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:58,131
Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

285
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:03,304
Do you hear that? It's stopped raining.

286
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,516
Appa!
