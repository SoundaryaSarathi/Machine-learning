1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,340
D- dammit! You say the other
two Saiyans are even stronger!?

2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,467
W- what's going on here?

3
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:57,176
It's too late for you now, even if you
do realize how terrible we Saiyans are!

4
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:01,286
You've got us there.
I wish we hadn't heard that.

5
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:02,887
There's only one thing

6
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:05,957
that fools who defy me without heeding the
warnings I so graciously offered get...

7
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,720
...and that's death.

8
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,622
You must be pretty excited,
huh, Son Goku?

9
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:17,369
Sorry, but this time,
I ain't all that excited.

10
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,305
I'm so scared, I'm trembling!

11
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:25,644
Of course you are! However, that terror
will turn to hopelessness very soon.

12
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:28,313
Never mind me, where is my son!?

13
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,981
Where have you hidden him!?

14
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,653
I haven't hidden him. I just locked him
up because he was bawling so loudly.

15
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:38,089
There's a hole behind you, right?
He's in there.

16
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,731
In there, huh?

17
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:57,942
Gohan...

18
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:03,281
Father! Save me, Father!

19
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:07,650
Hold on, Gohan! Daddy's going
to come rescue you right away!

20
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,956
Don't be ridiculous!

21
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:14,288
There's no way you can save him!

22
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:18,888
Not if you guys die first!

23
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:26,069
All right, let's do it!

24
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,432
That's all we can do!

25
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,882
Behind me!

26
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,555
Yikes!

27
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,608
Where did you go!?

28
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,506
I'm right here.

29
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,205
Even with both of you coming at me,

30
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,765
this isn't even worth
wasting my breath on!

31
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,443
Damn... Are you okay, Piccolo?

32
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:08,426
R- relax. I can still manage
to fight with o- only one arm.

33
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,199
It looks like your deaths are
finally drawing near, huh!?

34
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,857
I- I wonder if Goku is doing okay.

35
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,633
For some reason, I have this strange,
uneasy feeling in my chest.

36
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,434
I've never felt anything
like this before.

37
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:46,571
I hope nothing bad is happening.

38
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:51,242
Listen, teamed up with Piccolo,
he's not going to be done in so easily.

39
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,578
That's all the more reason
to be concerned!

40
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:55,580
What if Piccolo double-crosses Goku,

41
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,038
and teams up with that Raditz guy?

42
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:04,589
If those two are done in,
then there's nothing left that we can do.

43
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,386
It will be the end of everything!

44
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:13,689
<i>Goku...</i>

45
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:23,007
What's the matter?
Are you finished already?

46
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,998
Where did all that gusto
you had earlier go?

47
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:30,543
Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new reserve techniques?

48
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:34,285
Sorry, can't say I do.

49
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,521
Sheesh, ease up, will you?

50
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,958
And here I've been training seriously,
developing something new.

51
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,594
What are you two whispering about?

52
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,562
Whatever strategy you devise,
it won't work!

53
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:48,232
It'd be easier on you if you'd
just keel over right away.

54
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:52,570
Are you for real? You've got yourself
a new technique up your sleeve?

55
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,906
Yeah.

56
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,574
Can you do it with only one arm?

57
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:01,679
Yeah, that part's okay. But this
technique takes quite a bit of time

58
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,737
in order to build up enough <i>Ki</i>.

59
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,256
While I'm doing that, you fight him
by yourself, and draw his attention.

60
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,926
Got it! Will this technique
work against him?

61
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:20,364
Probably. If this doesn't work,
then there's no other way to defeat him.

62
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:26,904
I was saving this in order to kill you.

63
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,307
And instead, you might end up
saving me with it, huh?

64
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:39,879
If I am able to defeat him with this,
then your turn is next.

65
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,044
Is that right?

66
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,223
This is no time to be laughing,
you know.

67
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:49,560
<i>They're laughing... So they're</i>
<i>changing their posture, are they?</i>

68
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,330
All right, I'm looking forward to this!

69
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,232
Now then, let's see about
keeping him in check!

70
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,632
Hang in there as best you can!

71
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:04,102
<i>Makankosappo!!</i>

72
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,539
<i>So, you've finally resigned yourself?</i>

73
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,160
You're a persistent one!

74
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,970
<i>Ka...</i>

75
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,334
<i>me...</i>

76
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,315
I- impossible!

77
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:22,987
His battle power is rising!
Battle power 924... 925!

78
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,323
<i>ha...</i>

79
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:30,328
He's able to concentrate his battle
power into one point and raise it up!?

80
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:33,024
<i>me...</i>

81
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:42,940
T- this one's battle power
is now 1020! U- unbelievable!

82
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,567
It's still going up!

83
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:51,005
<i>HA!!</i>

84
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:08,989
You've got a lot of nerve!

85
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:39,353
He caught it!

86
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,672
W- what kind of guy is this?

87
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,576
This time, I'll present you with one!

88
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,126
Die!

89
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,977
You're going to be the one who dies!

90
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,290
Battle power 1330!?

91
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:48,422
A- all of his battle power is
gathered into just his fingertip!

92
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,604
Dammit! These guys can
manipulate their powers at will!

93
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:57,062
Try taking this on! <i>Makankosappo!!</i>

94
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:47,554
H- he avoided it! W- what kind
of bastard is he, with such speed?

95
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,629
You pierced through
this armor quite easily.

96
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,460
That's quite a technique.

97
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:57,268
If I had taken that head-on,
I would have been out!

98
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,603
That doesn't mean anything
if I don't hit you!

99
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:03,140
To think that you would
inflict injury upon me!

100
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,611
You're going to pay for this!
I'm through playing around!

101
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,602
W- we've had it now!

102
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:13,606
I'll obliterate you in an instant!

103
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,830
Rot in hell!!

104
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:46,906
You got careless, didn't you!?

105
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,653
I've got your tail!

106
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:03,267
Why, you... when did you get behind me!?

107
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,937
Piccolo! Now! Do that thing
one more time!

108
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:09,607
Y- you got it!

109
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:13,277
Nicely done, Goku!
Keep a firm grip on that tail!

110
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:16,614
I'm limited to only being able
to use this technique one more time.

111
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:22,286
K- Kakarrot! Are you planning
to kill your one and only brother!?

112
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:27,625
Shut up! I told you, any guy as cruel
as you are ain't any brother of mine!

113
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,294
As someone who was
going to kill my son,

114
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:31,629
don't you go saying
that self-serving junk!

115
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,433
I- I'll stop! I've had
a change of heart!

116
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:38,302
I'll leave this planet without
making any more trouble!

117
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:42,329
Don't be fooled, Son Goku!
There's no truth in what he's saying!

118
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,800
There's no way he would do that!

119
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,115
P- please! Believe me,
my younger brother!

120
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:53,879
Truly, I have done some
cruel things up to now!

121
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:58,783
To you, as well... But I will
keep my promise, no matter what!

122
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,593
Y- you really mean it?

123
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,652
I- I really do!

124
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:10,731
N- No!! Don't let go of his tail!
That's his tactic!

125
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:16,771
I'm begging you, Kakarrot!
B- believe me!

126
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,803
Son Goku!

127
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,629
Y- you miserable idiot!

128
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,712
Indeed! Fools such as yourself
are quite uncommon!

129
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,914
To think that you would be
so completely taken in!

130
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,439
Just as I thought, there's no way
that you could be a warrior!

131
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,254
T- that was dirty!

132
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,491
But I'm not like you.
I'm a first-rate warrior!

133
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:11,222
I have absolutely no hesitations about
killing you, even if you are my brother!

134
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,629
Shall I provide you with a sample?

135
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,263
Father...

136
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:34,578
There you go, there you go!
Suffer even more! Your death is near!

137
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:49,400
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to come at me?

138
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,992
Try doing that thing you did earlier!

139
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,898
H- he'll just dodge it
again like this!

140
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,972
Father...

141
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,573
That Gohan! I told him that
once he gets his tests back,

142
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:32,276
he should show them to me.

143
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,745
Still, you've done very well, Gohan.

144
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:38,949
Sure enough, it's worth it for him to
be studyin' every day for eight hours.

145
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:42,350
Once I show this to Goku,
I'm sure he'll say the same thing.

146
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:47,850
I sure wish Goku and Gohan
would both get back soon.

147
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:03,202
Scream some more! Cry out!

148
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,244
Your turn comes next!

149
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,337
Get yourself ready!

150
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,262
Well now, shall I finally
put you out of your misery?

151
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:27,598
Die, Kakarrot!!

152
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:29,293
W- what?

153
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:06,970
What!?

154
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,873
<i>With his father in a great pinch,</i>
<i>Son Gohan instinctively springs forth!</i>

155
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:18,479
<i>Though his body may be small,</i>
<i>his anger is something fierce!</i>
