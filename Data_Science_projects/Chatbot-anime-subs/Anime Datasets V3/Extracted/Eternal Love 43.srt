<i>[Episode 43]</i>

3
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,209
Say it!

4
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,269
Say that you're having
an affair with Yuan Zhen!

5
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,399
Quickly!

6
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,618
- I...
- There's no need to explain.

7
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:23,110
I believe you and Yuan Zhen.

8
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,306
Your Majesty.

9
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,662
The Crown Prince and I...

10
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,657
The Crown Prince and I...

11
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,867
Don't be angry.

12
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:58,038
I know that the power struggle
in the harem has hurt you.

13
00:02:58,038 --> 00:02:59,618
I can only blame it on the fact that

14
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:06,657
I had many concubines
and children before I met you.

15
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:12,920
Otherwise, I'd spend my lifetime
only with you.

16
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,044
This is my fault.

17
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:28,498
I know that among the people
and officials, they call me a temptress.

18
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:32,461
Your Majesty was deemed fatuous
because of me.

19
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,924
Leave those criticisms to
the later generations.

20
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,076
I fear none.

21
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,413
I regret none.

22
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,174
How well did I draw this wrinkle
around my eye?

23
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,112
Do I look older?

24
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,694
Little Princess.

25
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:19,694
Birth, old age, illness

26
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,295
encounters with ones you despise,
separation from ones you love

27
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,653
and not getting what you seek...

28
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:24,702
The six hardships of life.

29
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,274
Not one is to be left out.

30
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:27,995
Should Lord Dong Hua learn

31
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:30,607
that I've helped you to maneuver
his fate in the Mortal Realm

32
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:33,113
we would be severely condemned.

33
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,906
But I can't bear it.

34
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,684
I can't bear to see him suffer.

35
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:42,372
That's not for you to decide.

36
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,521
Little Princess, that's fate.

37
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:01,418
<i>Your Majesty, there are rumors
that Consort Chen</i>

38
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,238
<i>is unfaithful to you.</i>

39
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:06,684
<i>I've done everything to
stop such rumors from spreading.</i>

40
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:09,487
<i>Your Majesty doesn't have
to believe me.</i>

41
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:14,596
<i>However, all the concubines saw
them hugging in the Imperial Garden.</i>

42
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,928
<i>They even came up with
the lie of the fan.</i>

43
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:21,500
<i>Your Majesty, you mustn't be fooled!</i>

44
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:35,254
This bronze bell... You were already
wearing it when we got together.

45
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:44,730
Someone important gave it to me.

46
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,173
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince had
a heart attack in the bath!

47
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:56,733
What?

48
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,737
Crown Prince.

49
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,788
Pure Consort?

50
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,555
What a coincidence.

51
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,350
Coincidence?

52
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,153
If Father sees us
we will lose our heads!

53
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:01,586
Xiao Xiangzi!

54
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,069
Father...

55
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:24,271
Jiu'er, is there anything
you want to tell me?

56
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,790
I have nothing to say.

57
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,704
Return to the palace now!

58
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:40,817
No one is to know about this matter
apart from the three of us.

59
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:44,781
No one is to bring it up.

60
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:13,581
Father?

61
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,980
- Your Majesty!
- Father!

62
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,663
Your Majesty!

63
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,428
Guards! Take this bitch away!

64
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,096
She's not fit to be here!

65
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:10,908
Your Majesty, you never trusted me.

66
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:14,195
This woman saved you twice
but she took advantage of that

67
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:18,096
to do unspeakable things in the palace!

68
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,849
Your Majesty!

69
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,732
- Move it!
- <i>Your Majesty!</i>

70
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,283
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

71
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:40,158
Your Majesty!

72
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:42,722
Your Majesty! You must believe me!

73
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:45,125
I didn't betray you, Your Majesty!

74
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:51,662
Your Majesty, I had my reasons!
Your Majesty, I had my reasons!

75
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,236
Your Majesty, you must believe me!

76
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:04,754
Little Princess.

77
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,934
Little Princess.

78
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,023
You must remember that
the emperor is Lord Dong Hua.

79
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:20,071
When he dies in the Mortal Realm
18 years from now

80
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,938
he will be Lord Dong Hua again.
An immortal. Right?

81
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,058
Little Princess, why are you
tormenting yourself like this?

82
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:43,240
Star Lord, you don't understand.

83
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,071
Lord Dong Hua is my husband
only in the Mortal Realm.

84
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:51,511
When he's back in the Nine Heavens
he won't treat me so well.

85
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,370
Tell me.

86
00:10:57,517 --> 00:11:04,855
Will he still remember what he said
and did to me in the Mortal Realm?

87
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:10,870
Lord Dong Hua came to the Mortal Realm
to experience the six torments.

88
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,582
How could he forget everything?

89
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,428
You're right.

90
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,097
Although he will remember,
it won't change your relationship.

91
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:31,991
20 short years in the Mortal Realm
is but a snap of his fingers.

92
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,669
Heed my advice.

93
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,466
Regard this only as a heavenly trial.

94
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:38,014
The romance started and ends
in the Mortal Realm.

95
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:47,815
The romance started in
the Mortal Realm... and it ends there.

96
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,496
<i>Gods, don't play such a joke on me.</i>

97
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,421
<i>This is the little princess of Qing Qiu.</i>

98
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:59,065
<i>Clear my mind of all unworldly thoughts.</i>

99
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,754
What is the matter?

100
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,273
Nothing.

101
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,354
You haven't given it to me.

102
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,453
I forgot.

103
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:26,480
The Chime of Emperor's Demise?

104
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,148
Your Majesty!

105
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,389
This can't be right.

106
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:40,086
According to the Book of Destiny
the emperor doesn't die so soon.

107
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:47,788
Could he have been too badly
hurt by the loss of love?

108
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,585
What?

109
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,115
He's dead?

110
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:04,500
It seems that Lord Dong Hua has
pulled through the trial.

111
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:09,599
I have to head back to the Nine Heavens.

112
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:14,418
Star Lord!

113
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:17,303
Will I see Lord Dong Hua again?

114
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,003
Star Lord!

115
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:23,794
Star Lord...

116
00:15:54,995 --> 00:16:00,749
<i>Promise me that you'll never
forget these two years we shared.</i>

117
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,692
This flower... is very beautiful.

118
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:08,962
For some reason,
whenever I see this birthmark

119
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:12,493
I find it so familiar.

120
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,197
I still owe you a wedding.

121
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:18,403
I'll marry you once more
according to custom.

122
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:33,041
No one would dare
treat you unkindly in this palace.

123
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,368
Your Majesty!

124
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,599
Your Majesty...

125
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,903
<i>It can't be...</i>

126
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,726
<i>I just got here.</i>

127
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:20,714
Greetings, Lord Dong Hua.

128
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,685
You did get here very quickly.

129
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,755
It was my negligence that
caused Your Lordship

130
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,825
to return to your immortal self
ahead of schedule.

131
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,962
I have to come to seek forgiveness.

132
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:33,269
How was the scheduled 60 years
shortened by 18 years?

133
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,337
What went wrong?

134
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:43,689
A common mortal would have
gone as scheduled.

135
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,778
Perhaps Your Lordship is too prestigious

136
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:48,655
and the Book of Destiny can't
manipulate you.

137
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:49,906
Or perhaps...

138
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,842
Speak up.

139
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,885
Perhaps the six hardships
were too much to bear.

140
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:04,438
You're trying to say that my love trial

141
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:08,482
with Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu
was too much to bear?

142
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,232
I wouldn't dare say that.

143
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,446
I just returned to my immortal state

144
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:21,244
and there are already people in
the Nine Heavens coming to see me?

145
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,653
Crown Prince?

146
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,750
Lord Dong Hua.

147
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:32,644
Crown Prince, please have a seat.

148
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:33,817
I'm fine.

149
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:36,507
I only have two questions for you.

150
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:37,566
Really?

151
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,115
Ask away.

152
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:44,227
Is divine fungal grass essential in
cross essence repair between deities?

153
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,619
It is.

154
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,213
Have you ever fought
the four mystical beasts

155
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:49,624
in Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea?

156
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,332
Never.

157
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:56,596
However, 300 years ago,
Fox King Bai Zhi did attain the grass

158
00:19:56,596 --> 00:20:02,067
to cross essence with Bai Qian.
He fought those four beasts.

159
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:06,424
Although he attained the grass,
he was badly injured.

160
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:12,423
Not many are as powerful as the Fox King.

161
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,520
I am.

162
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,683
You could also give it a try.

163
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,654
Thank you, Your Lordship.

164
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,097
I will take my leave.

165
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,031
You're asking about it
because of Mo Yuan?

166
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,248
How did you know?

167
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,875
Not only do I know that you asked
these questions because of Mo Yuan

168
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,401
but I also know that Bai Qian was once

169
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:42,928
Seventeenth Disciple of
Kunlun Mountain, Si Yin.

170
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:48,614
The Celestial Tribe has been searching
70,000 years for Mo Yuan.

171
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,849
If Your Lordship already knew,
why didn't you say so sooner?

172
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,724
I believe that you must have heard

173
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,929
how tragic the battle of
Ruoshui Riverbank was.

174
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:08,614
However tragic it once was,
70,000 years have passed.

175
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,454
It's all forgotten.

176
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:13,017
What left an impression on me

177
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,959
was that image of High Immortal Si Yin

178
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,902
covered in blood and holding
Mo Yuan in her arms.

179
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,928
She sat there in Ruoshui River
crying her eyes out.

180
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:32,159
I hadn't had a taste of
the six hardships yet.

181
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,430
I couldn't understand
what her actions meant.

182
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:41,002
I just thought that
as a disciple of Kunlun Mountain

183
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:44,007
she had brought sorrow upon herself
due to the lack of cultivation.

184
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:50,517
Then I heard that Si Yin
and Mo Yuan's body went missing.

185
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,567
I found it ridiculous.

186
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:58,916
I thought this disciple of Kunlun
took life and death too seriously.

187
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,363
She was unlike a deity in training.

188
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:06,375
However, I understand it now.

189
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,718
It seems that I have learned
much from this trial in the Mortal Realm.

190
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,281
What do you understand?

191
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,576
If Mo Yuan is dead, he's dead.

192
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:23,461
No offering matters.

193
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,192
His most beloved disciple was Si Yin.

194
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:32,289
If he gets buried in Si Yin's hometown
and stays by her side...

195
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,733
it definitely would be better than being
buried in the Sea of Innocence.

196
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:41,003
Am I right?

197
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:45,252
I'm not High God Mo Yuan.

198
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:47,583
I wouldn't know what he thinks.

199
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:51,534
I have matters to handle.

200
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:53,590
I'll take my leave now.

201
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:28,483
Father, why have you brought out
the Soul-gathering Lamp again?

202
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:36,490
Didn't you say that if this lamp
keeps burning, Mother will return?

203
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,269
Now that Mother has returned
what use is this lamp?

204
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:43,682
I have to deliver the lamp somewhere.

205
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:46,045
Someone needs it.

206
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:48,002
Father, hurry up!

207
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:50,730
Whoever needs it
must be very anxious.

208
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:57,124
Father, can we visit Mother
when you've delivered the lamp?

209
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,809
A-Li, your mother is
the queen of Qing Qiu.

210
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,854
She has important matters to handle

211
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,695
so she can't stay here
with you every day.

212
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,155
I understand.

213
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,936
It's just that I miss Mother so much.

214
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:30,530
Of the four Water Kings

215
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,746
the King of the West Sea leaves
the least impression on me.

216
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:36,679
When I used to chat with Senior

217
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,518
he said that since the reign
of his grandfather

218
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:42,915
two generations of kings
of the West Sea keep a low profile.

219
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,930
Hence their clan is the least
noticed in the six realms.

220
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:51,701
This King of the West Sea gave up
keeping a low profile

221
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:54,621
for the sake of his first-born son.

222
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,069
Hasn't his son been ill for 600 years?

223
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,266
What else could he do besides
hire doctors to cure his son?

224
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,493
600 years ago, in order to cure his son

225
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:09,721
the Water King of the West Sea
announced...

226
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,683
- Water King, we'll take our leave.
- We'll take our leave.

227
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:18,923
General Hai.

228
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:20,186
Water King.

229
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,169
Put up an announcement.

230
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:28,336
Anyone who can cure my son
will be handsomely rewarded!

231
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,336
Yes!

232
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,013
Crown Prince!

233
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,615
- My Queen...
- My Queen...

234
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:20,512
Quickly!

235
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,666
Put the announcement up
for all realms and seas to see!

236
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:31,705
<i>[Anyone who can cure my son
will be handsomely rewarded!]</i>

237
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,102
Why would you meddle in that?

238
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:47,079
Some time ago,
Bai Zhen heard about it from your senior.

239
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,690
He thought of me and
asked me to help him.

240
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,513
It's no wonder...

241
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:54,471
Fourth Brother asked you
to help for the sake of my senior.

242
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:56,201
Why else?

243
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,836
How could I possibly come here
if it weren't for you?

244
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:06,298
Somehow, as if destined,
Senior found you for our mentor.

245
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:10,941
If not, how could we have tracked down
my mentor's spirit and soul so soon?

246
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,881
It's somehow destined.

247
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:18,903
If Mo Yuan is to recover

248
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,196
Die Yong's body must be looked after.

249
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:26,573
It will be hard on you
in the days to come.

250
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,873
This is my rightful duty.

251
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,326
What is hard about that?

252
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:58,103
When High God left, he said that
he'd bring an emissary back with him

253
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:00,414
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

254
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,473
This emissary is skilled in
taking care of patients like the prince.

255
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:10,200
While I'm away, she will be
looking after the prince.

256
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,492
I'll have to trouble the emissary then.

257
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:13,535
You're too kind.

258
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:14,776
This way, please.

259
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,787
High Gods, my son resides
in Fuying Hall ahead of you.

260
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:29,902
It's not right.

261
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:32,776
Emissary, what is not right?

262
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:34,978
Does it affect my son's health?

263
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:40,929
Water King, I suddenly recall
a matter of great urgency.

264
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,632
I see. Do tell.

265
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,536
I suddenly remembered that we'll need

266
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:49,898
a very quiet place
to nurse the prince back to health.

267
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:54,559
Could the Water King make it a rule
that no one else, including yourself

268
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,711
is to come near this place after today?

269
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:57,721
Yes.

270
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,190
My dear, head back to the palace.

271
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,259
I'll show the high gods in myself.

272
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:11,875
This way, please.

273
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:15,727
What is the matter?

274
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,339
I'm afraid that I'll run into my senior.

275
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,579
Water King of the West Sea!

276
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:24,230
I wonder where the second prince is now?

277
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,632
A letter was sent from
Kunlun Mountain yesterday.

278
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,493
It said that Die Feng
had already arrived there

279
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:32,631
and won't make it back for a few days.

280
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:36,163
This way, please.

281
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:39,307
He won't be back soon...

282
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:42,699
Even if he is, now that
Mo Yuan will soon be awakened

283
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,661
why are you still worried about
seeing your senior?

284
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:46,806
We'll discuss that later.

285
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,144
After you.

286
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:05,999
You must be so anxious to see Mo Yuan,
but frightened at the same time.

287
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,959
Go on.

288
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,981
You've waited 70,000 years for this.

289
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:25,900
Emissary, this is
my first-born son, Die Yong.

290
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:37,721
Die Yong, this brilliant emissary
standing before you

291
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:42,763
is the most outstanding disciple
of High God Zhe Yan.

292
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:52,261
From now on, your centuries-old illness
will be treated by this emissary.

293
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:55,702
Thank you, Emissary...

294
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,872
<i>This pulse is neither irregular nor solid</i>

295
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:09,913
<i>neither slow nor rapid,
neither increasing nor decreasing.</i>

296
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:12,211
<i>It is as Zhe Yan said.</i>

297
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,271
<i>The pulse is just right.</i>

298
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:19,653
Emissary, my son's illness...

299
00:31:25,364 --> 00:31:29,025
Water King, please wait outside.

300
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:33,876
I need to use my magical powers
to find the cause of his illness.

301
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:35,942
It has to be very quiet.

302
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,130
Yes.

303
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,491
Master...

304
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:54,823
Zhe Yan has told me
that you are right here in this body.

305
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:04,354
I've finally found you.

306
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,931
I am late.

307
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,701
Master!

308
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:32,857
Why are you crying?

309
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:35,576
Is this illness incurable?

310
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:39,935
Even if it's incurable, you don't
have to cry so hard.

311
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,619
Don't cry.

312
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,097
I won't blame you if you can't cure me.

313
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,631
These are tears of joy.

314
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:52,258
You...

315
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:54,790
I had thought that
you were too kind-hearted

316
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,278
but you're actually happy
to see me suffer?

317
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,480
I'm not happy about that.

318
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,648
Your Highness, get some rest.

319
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,222
<i>Zhe Yan is right.</i>

320
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:28,275
<i>If Master is to use Die Yong's
mediocre body to recuperate</i>

321
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,105
<i>it will take another
7,000 or 8,000 years.</i>

322
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:40,248
<i>However, if I can borrow
the Celestial Tribe's Soul-gathering Lamp</i>

323
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:43,460
<i>and transfer half of my
140,000-year-old essence to him</i>

324
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,710
<i>Master will wake up sooner.</i>

325
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,472
<i>It seems that I
will have to take a trip back</i>

326
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:51,233
<i>to the Nine Heavens
to see the Heavenly Lord.</i>

327
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:57,365
Where's High God Zhe Yan?

328
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:01,528
High God Zhe Yan said that
he had important matters to handle.

329
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:04,266
Emissary is to stay in the West Sea
and he will return tomorrow.

330
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,105
Where is your Water King?

331
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,898
An important guest has just arrived.

332
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,266
The Water King has gone to
the Grand Hall to welcome him.

333
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:13,840
Please feel free to ask us
to carry out trivial tasks.

334
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:16,527
Take me to the hall then.

335
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:18,108
I need to see the Water King.

336
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,864
The rest of you are to stay
and look after the prince.

337
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:22,706
- Yes.
- Yes.

338
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,431
Emissary, please come with me.

339
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:41,601
Emissary, this way.

340
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:04,159
<i>You didn't raise A-Li so
you only regard him as a stepson.</i>

341
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,849
<i>If he were your son,
would you still say such words?</i>

342
00:36:23,632 --> 00:36:24,920
Ye Hua...

343
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,507
Ye Hua...

344
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,684
You...

345
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,724
<i>This scar...</i>

346
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:50,166
<i>Were you scarred saving Mo Yuan?</i>

347
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:13,967
Bai Qian...

348
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:22,099
Do I have a place in your heart?

349
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,565
You've waited 70,000 years for him.

350
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:32,688
Now that he's returned...

351
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:40,164
You certainly couldn't care
for anyone else.

352
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,378
It was just wishful thinking.

353
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:54,670
Are you referring to my mentor?

354
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:03,016
Why would it concern you
whether my mentor returns or not?

355
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:10,652
Besides, only Zhe Yan, my fourth brother,
and I knew about my mentor.

356
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,951
How did you learn about this?

357
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:17,193
Zhe Yan told me about it.

358
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:23,063
I even know that in order
to make him wake up sooner

359
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:24,989
you will need the Soul-gathering Lamp.

360
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:28,864
Tell me.

361
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:33,768
What else do you plan
to do after getting the lamp?

362
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:42,719
I'm going to Yingzhou for
the divine fungal grass.

363
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:45,965
I'll use my cultivation
to create an elixir with the grass

364
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,365
and feed it to Die Yong.

365
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:52,637
Then my mentor will wake up
in no more than three months.

366
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,400
You're crazy.

367
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:02,829
You think that you can get
the divine fungal grass so easily?

368
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:07,317
I have to get that grass
no matter what happens!

369
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:16,204
I know that the four mystical beasts
guarding the grass are very fierce.

370
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:22,422
My father was badly injured
when he fought them.

371
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:28,775
And you still plan to do it?

372
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:30,474
Definitely!

373
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:38,032
You would risk your life for him?

374
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,039
Ye Hua, it's good that you came here.

375
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,570
I need to speak to you about something.

376
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,733
Our engagement...

377
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:57,585
Why don't we just cancel it?

378
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,867
What did you say?

379
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,760
I've heard that the Heavenly Lord will
pass on the throne to you.

380
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,126
I also know that during the coronation

381
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:23,626
you and I will have to take
81 sacred blazes

382
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:25,617
and 9 holy thunderbolts.

383
00:40:27,077 --> 00:40:29,175
Rightfully, I should
endure that with you.

384
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,202
However, I have to transfer
my cultivation to my mentor.

385
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:37,396
I might not be able to
take on fires of karma with you.

386
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,141
We weren't supposed to be married
in the first place anyway.

387
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:56,690
It was all because of Sang Ji's mistake
that embarrassed Qing Qiu.

388
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,059
The Heavenly Lord didn't want to look bad

389
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:04,463
so he arranged for us to be engaged.

390
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:09,925
Leave it to Qing Qiu to
break off the engagement.

391
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:14,469
We don't really have to care
too much about the past anymore.

392
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,257
I understand.

393
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:24,927
Come to my room tonight.

394
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:27,288
The Soul-gathering Lamp
isn't in the Celestial Palace.

395
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:28,692
I have it with me.

396
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:42,119
It all turns out to be
just wishful thinking after all.

397
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:53,324
How much do I owe you?
Who knows what you owe me?

398
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:56,561
It's all a mess now.

399
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,949
It can't be sorted out anymore.

400
