00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,444
Are you okay?

2
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,605
You can rest easy now.

3
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,786
Aw, did he leave?

4
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:07,622
Never mind that guy, what kinda idiot are you?
How come ya didn't finish him off?

5
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:14,799
Sorry about that, Kuririn...

6
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,070
Don't worry about it. I did feel bad
for everyone who died, though.

7
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,631
But even so, we might still be able
to bring them back to life.

8
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,311
H- he couldn't be!

9
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:52,437
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

10
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,106
C- Chichi?

11
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:59,778
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

12
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,939
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

13
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:05,105
C- Chichi!

14
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,119
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

15
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:25,403
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
Are you okay!? Wake up! Ma is here!

16
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:29,407
Gohan-<i>chan</i>... What an awful
thing to go through...

17
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,743
G- Gohan is fine.

18
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:39,417
Goku is in far worse shape than him.
See? You see? Over here. See?

19
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:43,421
You poor thing! Bein' forced
to go through somethin' like this!

20
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:48,586
You're never goin' to leave
your Ma's side again! You poor thing!

21
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:55,100
<i>That's just not right.</i>
<i>Goku had it hard, too.</i>

22
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,769
S- Son-<i>kun</i>...

23
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,104
Goku...

24
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,594
Son-<i>kun</i>...

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,442
Are you okay, Son-<i>kun</i>?

26
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,112
T- this is awful.

27
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:11,783
S- sorry... I let
the Saiyan get away...

28
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:15,453
Not at all. Just driving
him away was quite a feat.

29
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:18,123
Ah, Karin-<i>sama</i>...

30
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:21,726
Saying he was strong
doesn't begin to cover it.

31
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:29,401
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, Yamucha was... Except for
the four of us, everyone else was done in...

32
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:32,404
Uh-huh, we saw it on TV.

33
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:35,407
But Piccolo died, which means
that so has Kami-<i>sama</i>...

34
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:39,741
He's right. And that means
the Dragon Balls...

35
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,077
I know what that means!

36
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,757
Y- you knew, didn't you?

37
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,760
Y- yeah.

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,098
If only Piccolo had been
one of the survivors...

39
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,089
Well 'scuse me for livin'.

40
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:10,272
That's right! All you did was run away!
You didn't fight one bit!

41
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,779
What did you say!?

42
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:21,386
A good-for-nothing like you should have
died right off, instead of Piccolo!

43
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,616
You idiot!

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,732
If I hadn'a been there,
these guys wouldn'a survived!

45
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,403
This is pissin' me off!
I'm sick of bein' good!

46
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,238
All right, all right.

47
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,741
More importantly, we should hurry
and get the injured to a hospital.

48
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,732
There aren't any more Senzu.

49
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,405
Easy, easy! Easy now...

50
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:27,385
Everyone's bodies
are around here, right?

51
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,377
Um... a little more that way.

52
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,737
Bulma-<i>san</i>, don't cry. There's only
a very slim chance that this is possible,

53
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:49,741
and maybe it's even a little crazy,

54
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,743
so listen to me, but don't
get your hopes up.

55
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:59,081
I- it's possible that we can bring everyone
who was killed by the Saiyans back to life.

56
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,754
What do you mean?

57
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,088
Really?

58
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,091
This is going to sound
like grasping at clouds...

59
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:13,097
K- Kuririn... you said something
about that to me, too...

60
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:16,768
What do you mean? Tell us...

61
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,370
A- as it happens...

62
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,273
Just a minute.
I'll tell you later.

63
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:27,108
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, land here. We have
to load up everyone else's bodies.

64
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:53,071
Chaozu's body is the only
one left. Let's see now...

65
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:54,572
There isn't one.

66
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,735
He blew himself to pieces.

67
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,417
I really would like
to bring them all back to life.

68
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:11,089
As it stands, their sacrifice
was all too great.

69
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,926
Karin-<i>sama</i>,
all I feel is anger...

70
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:17,087
...at my own helplessness...

71
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,038
Now then...

72
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,768
That's okay. I'll pilot us.

73
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,045
I've calmed down a little.

74
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,104
O- okay...

75
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,479
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
Are you wakin' up?

76
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:28,426
Relax! It's Ma!
It's your Ma!

77
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,758
M- Mother?

78
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:37,769
You poor thing! It must have been
so scary! But you're okay now!

79
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,105
Yeah, you did great!
You're really something!

80
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:42,440
We got through it!

81
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,432
H- how? Where is the Saiyan?

82
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:51,783
He got away...
He got away from us.

83
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:56,788
B- but still, we all hurt him
something terrible, right?

84
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:59,120
He might never come back.

85
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,795
Where's Father!?

86
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,798
I'm in the back, Gohan...

87
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:10,461
Thanks to you guys,
I managed to survive somehow...

88
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:19,243
Hey, this is fine an' all,

89
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,146
but yer Goku's wife, right?

90
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:27,251
Stop worryin' about just the kid,
and look after yer husband, would ya?

91
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,254
How rude! Nothin' doin'.

92
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,257
It's because of Goku-<i>sa</i> that Gohan-<i>chan</i>
went through all that nastiness!

93
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,259
He didn't have to drag
my boy into that!

94
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,929
That's not true,
Mother! Father was-

95
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,424
I'm far more worried about your future,
Gohan, than I am about the earth!

96
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,599
Goku, can I slug her?

97
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,278
Kuririn...

98
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,281
Would you tell us about
what you were saying earlier?

99
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,112
O- oh, right.

100
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,623
The Saiyans probably learned about
there being Dragon Balls here on Earth,

101
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:11,295
via Goku's brother's radio, or whatever.
The part about having wishes granted, too.

102
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:16,300
So, as long as they were here, they were
trying to get the Dragon Balls, too.

103
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,301
Really?

104
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,302
Yeah.

105
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:23,241
But when they saw Piccolo's face,
they called him something weird.

106
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,141
A " Namekian."

107
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:33,584
Piccolo- and Kami-<i>sama</i>, too-
appears to have been an alien.

108
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:36,921
That's no wonder,
what with his face.

109
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:39,754
The important part
is what they said next.

110
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,928
Nappa! Kill them!

111
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:46,264
But what about the Dragon Balls?

112
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:49,934
I don't care!
I have an idea.

113
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:53,271
If we go to Planet Namek,
the home world of that Namekian,

114
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:57,942
I'm sure that there will be Dragon Balls
that are even more powerful.

115
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,945
Is that all they said?
That's nonsense.

116
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,613
I heard him, too.

117
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:07,618
He said that Namekians have the power
to create mysterious balls.

118
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:13,624
If- and that's a really big if- we were
able to go to this Planet Namek place,

119
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:16,460
we might be able
to obtain their Dragon Balls.

120
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,129
I- I get it.

121
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,233
If you did that, you would be able
to bring those who had died back to life.

122
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,235
Piccolo-<i>san</i> could come back to life!

123
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:26,904
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>,
how can you say that!?

124
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:30,241
That's right! If Piccolo came
back to life, so would Kami-<i>sama</i>!

125
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:33,733
And that means we could restore
the Dragon Balls here, too!

126
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,915
--Banzai! Banzai!
--T- that's incredible!

127
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:40,584
Then there's a chance...
There really is a chance!

128
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,075
Isn't there? Isn't there?
Isn't there?

129
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,260
You amateurs make it sound
so nice and simple.

130
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,597
There's no way we could pull off that kind
of dream. I hate to burst your bubble.

131
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:56,934
N- not even you can do it, Bulma-<i>san</i>?

132
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,602
In the first place, Kuririn,

133
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:02,436
how are we supposed to know where this
whatever-it's-called planet even is?

134
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,610
L- let me take care of that...

135
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,613
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you're listening, right?

136
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:15,286
Do you know where
this Planet Namek is?

137
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:21,559
Planet Namek? Of course I know. Whatever
else you may say, I <i>am</i> a Kaio, after all.

138
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,898
T- this is amazing. We can hear him, too.
This gentleman is Kaio-<i>sama</i>, is he?

139
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:33,404
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, it looks like everyone else
can hear you, too, so tell us.

140
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:39,243
Before I do, allow me to say
one thing. You all did really well.

141
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:43,247
Once Son Goku had been done in,
I honestly thought it was hopeless.

142
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:45,249
That was really something.

143
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:51,922
Still, I got a pretty big shock.
Not even <i>Kaio-ken</i> worked against him...

144
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:57,595
Yeah, even I greatly miscalculated
that Saiyan Vegeta's strength.

145
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,597
Who knew he'd be that strong?

146
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:03,934
M- maybe I really was wrong
to let him get away...

147
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,936
Maybe so.

148
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:10,274
H- hey, what does he mean?
Don't tell me Goku intentionally...

149
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,943
I- I'll tell you all the details later.

150
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:16,280
Now then, Planet Namek's location...

151
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,885
To put it in the terms
you'd use on Earth... let's see...

152
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:26,891
Bearing SW66 by...
no, no, let's see here...

153
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:34,231
Bearing SU83 by... 9045XY, is it?

154
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:37,902
9045XY, did you say!?

155
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:41,405
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>, do you
know where that is?

156
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:45,242
H- hey, Turtle-<i>chan</i>, take over piloting.
I've got to calculate this.

157
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:47,578
T- Turtle-<i>chan</i>?

158
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,581
I've got a bad feeling about this...

159
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:55,920
Planet Namek used to be a very
beautiful planet, as I recall,

160
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,256
but some time ago, they went through
a terrible bout of abnormal weather.

161
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:04,091
I thought that all of the
Namekians died out at that time.

162
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,600
The planet itself is currently
in the process of returning to normal,

163
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,270
but as for whether or not
anyone survived...

164
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,606
O- oh, no...

165
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:19,543
This is hopeless. Ain't no way
there're still Dragon Balls there.

166
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,878
H- hey, you!

167
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:25,883
Don't panic. Once I check up
on Planet Namek, I'll know.

168
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,217
Now, where was it?
Let's see...

169
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,060
This way, huh?

170
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,228
So that's it!

171
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:43,901
That's the reason why Kami- or rather,
the Namekian who became Kami- fled to Earth.

172
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,572
Kami himself may have forgotten that
because he lost his memory,

173
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:53,244
or maybe he was just too young a child.
Either way, it's a sad past.

174
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:58,582
Yeah, but Dragon Balls
can grant any wish, right?

175
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,584
If they're the guys
that could make them things,

176
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,588
they coulda just wished to have
the abnormal weather stopped, right?

177
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,924
That probably wouldn't have worked.

178
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,093
Shen Long said that he
couldn't grant a wish

179
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:14,598
that exceeded the power
of the Dragon Balls' creator.

180
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,269
That means he couldn't rein in
that incredible amount of power.

181
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,540
That's why Shen Long couldn't
do anything against the Saiyans.

182
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,603
What're ya talkin' about? I guess
the Dragon Balls ain't so great after all.

183
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,550
You're a sassy fellow!

184
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,552
What's this? There are some!
There are some!

185
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:37,555
There are some Namekians!
There's just under a hundred of them,

186
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:40,388
but they survived,
and are thriving again!

187
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:45,059
T- there're a hundred guys like that!?

188
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:57,241
Not to worry. Namekians are a very
mild-mannered race by nature.

189
00:16:57,241 --> 00:17:01,075
Like that guy who was
Kami on your Earth.

190
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,749
Piccolo Daimao was probably
someone who was born

191
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:12,746
of the evil influence of earthlings
that he encountered before becoming Kami.

192
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:22,533
That explains it.

193
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:26,537
There are some nasty types
out there in the world, after all.

194
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:27,538
Look who's talking.

195
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:29,540
But now there's a
possibility that Kami,

196
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,877
not to mention Yamucha and
Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

197
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:36,880
You're naïve!
You're absolutely naïve!

198
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,553
Indeed, I figured out where Planet Namek is.
But how are you planning to go there?

199
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:46,557
H- how? Well, in a
spaceship, of course.

200
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:50,227
That's where you're being
completely naïve, I tell you!

201
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:51,962
If you used a spaceship

202
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:54,898
with the world's most powerful engine,
an experimental model my dad made,

203
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,459
I calculated how much time it would
take you to reach Planet Namek.

204
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:03,907
Exactly how long do you
think it would take?

205
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:07,578
I came up with a positively
enormous figure.

206
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:12,149
Look here. It would take
4339 years and 3 months.

207
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:14,918
You'd have to live
to a ripe old age, huh?

208
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:18,820
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>,
what should we do?

209
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:25,325
Y- y- you're asking me?

210
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,868
If that's the problem,
I think we'll be all right.

211
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:35,873
I'm thinking of using the spaceship
that that Saiyan came here in.

212
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:41,879
The Saiyan's? But the Saiyan took
that one and ran away, didn't he?

213
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,881
We saw the spaceship
belonging to that Vegeta guy,

214
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:47,217
but it was very small, and anyhow
you look at it, it had to be a one-seater.

215
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:50,454
Which means that the spaceship
belonging to that other one who died

216
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,222
has to be out there somewhere.

217
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:57,561
T- that's right! And there's the one
that my brother Raditz came in, too!

218
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:01,899
Come to think of it, that one
got destroyed by Gohan...

219
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,568
But anyhow, there's still
one of them, right?

220
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:08,238
If I can find that one and analyze it,
I just might come up with something.

221
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:11,141
It's probably in Metro East.

222
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:14,144
That's the first place
the Saiyans destroyed.

223
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:16,135
We'll have to go look for it later.

224
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,584
I was thinking that, and picked up
a nice little something.

225
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:26,590
This. I'm sure that Vegeta guy
beeped this thing to call his spaceship.

226
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,820
It has to be a remote control!

227
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,593
We can do this!
We can definitely do this!

228
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:43,103
Yay! Yay!
Hope is in sight!

229
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,271
Planet Namek or bust!

230
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,618
<i>A destination planet had been settled on.</i>

231
00:19:54,618 --> 00:20:00,784
<i>However, there were still some</i>
<i>difficult problems to solve beforehand.</i>
