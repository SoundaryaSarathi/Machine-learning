1
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:20,242
It’s done!

2
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,983
Whoa… No matter how many times I try.
It always turns into Kero.

3
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,800
I’ll ask Rika
how to do it again later.

4
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,165
Kaho-sensei,

5
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:44,593
something weird happened
on Tomoeda again.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,338
This time, Li Shao Lan

7
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:51,540
got controlled by some threads.

8
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:53,841
But

9
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:56,641
we don’t know who did it.

10
00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,152
Same as last time.

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,952
I keep feeling Clow Reed, but

12
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:04,081
Kero-chan ensures me that

13
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,253
Clow…

14
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,086
has passed away long time ago.

15
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,699
What we could do,
is to develope our ability…

16
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:16,291
…to deal with sudden incidents.

17
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:17,931
So, I always carry
the cards around with me, but…

18
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:25,807
What else would happen?

19
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:29,146
– What is it?
– Eriol! Ah…

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,883
Is something troubling you?

21
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,348
Ah! It is nothing.

22
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,425
Is it OK if I stay with you?

23
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:42,253
Oh, it’s a letter.

24
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,161
Yeah, to Miss Mizuki Kaho,

25
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,690
who was my Maths teacher.

26
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,430
Is your current teacher Mr Terada?

27
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,228
Yup, Miss Mizuki Kaho

28
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,139
was here for the first semester

29
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,530
and now she’s out of the country.

30
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:58,570
She was amazing.

31
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:02,339
I wish I had a chance

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,317
to meet Miss Mizuki

33
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:06,510
Ah!

34
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:08,746
I’m still in the process of making it…

35
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:12,220
Is this what you bought the last time you
went into that store with sewing stuff?

36
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,069
Yeah, it is not so easy.

37
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,577
May I see it?

38
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:21,531
Eh? But, but, it looks weird
and nothing like a bear…

39
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,061
I don’t hate sewing so…

40
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:25,564
maybe I can help.

41
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,331
Don’t laugh.

42
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,173
I won’t laugh.

43
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:36,781
It’s something you put
a lot of effort into.

44
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:39,747
Thanks.

45
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,955
Eriol is really kind.

46
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,761
Over here.

47
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,559
If you make the ears
a little smaller

48
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,398
and move them up a bit,

49
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:55,530
would that not be better?

50
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:57,865
Since bears have
relatively small ears.

51
00:02:58,405 --> 00:02:59,235
Is that right?

52
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,503
…then let’s take that out

53
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,807
Shall we try?
Thanks.

54
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:10,476
And… for the new ear…

55
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:17,747
[Sakura and the Giant Teddy Bear!]

56
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,102
It’s done!

57
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,337
Wow! It’s a bear!

58
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,609
It actually looks
like a bear!!

59
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,549
It’s all thanks to you.

60
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:46,347
Right!

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,253
I want to return the favour.

62
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,650
What would you like?

63
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:53,785
Anything is ok?

64
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,160
Yeah!
If it’s something I can do.

65
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:57,989
Then.

66
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:25,991
I am envious of the person

67
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,318
who will be receiving
that bear from you.

68
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,091
Eriol.

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,148
– Here.
– Thank you.

70
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,278
– Can I open it?
– Yup.

71
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,049
It’s a stuffed bear.

72
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,325
Yeah, and about
the name of the bear…

73
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:06,228
Ummm… if one give a
teddy bear with their name

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,828
on it to someone they like…

75
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:09,169
Let’s call it Suhama.

76
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,804
I love Suhama.

77
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,531
Suhama

78
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,806
in the old days was really big.

79
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,504
It was about the size
of 20 pieces of dadami.

80
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,276
The bigger the Suhama,

81
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,205
more delicious it was

82
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,741
So in the old days,
the higher class,

83
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:26,015
people always tried
to build huge barns

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,944
to make the largest
Suhama possible.

85
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,990
That’s why,
in the old days,

86
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:34,860
each town had their own barn,
size of a school.

87
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:38,091
where they can make the largest Suhama.

88
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:39,390
Suhama that holds
Japan’s record for being the largest
was made in Kyoto that is about

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,633
360 meters in length…

90
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:45,501
Don’t you want to like me too?

91
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,199
Hehehe, why are you mad? Hehehe.

92
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,877
Why did I buy this?

93
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:30,431
That’s no use
in making something like this.

94
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,417
if one give another the bear
with one’s own name on it.

95
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,447
another person

96
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,153
who get the bear
is supposed to like them back.

97
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:40,253
Why don’t you say
so from the beginning?

98
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,661
Why am I seeing her?

99
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:52,002
That’s a cute bear.

100
00:06:58,645 --> 00:06:59,976
Ah, I’m about to eat lunch,

101
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:03,305
do you want to eat lunch with me?

102
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,652
Can you take this?

103
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,702
I don’t know why, but
I’ve been really hungry lately.

104
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:35,943
Don’t be shy and eat it…

105
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:37,281
Y… Yes…

106
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,197
Would it be OK if
I took a look at that bear?

107
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,332
It’s handmade.
Did you get it from someone?

108
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:03,710
So then you did it?

109
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:06,182
Wow, it looks great.

110
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:07,958
Are you planning to give it to someone?

111
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:12,476
Someone… to give…

112
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:20,385
Why?

113
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,386
Why can’t I not give it to her?

114
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,659
Ah!! this.

115
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,564
Why do I keep seeing her face?

116
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,729
The only time my face turned red

117
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,006
or my heart is about
to burst was when I met him.

118
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,746
Li.

119
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:22,718
Li-kun.

120
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:36,898
She…

121
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,502
Because of her heart is.

122
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:41,705
It feels

123
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,703
the same as when I met that guy

124
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,814
What is going on?

125
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,926
Yue…

126
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,590
One who bears Clow’s blood.

127
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,730
Reason why you feel
that way when you meet Yukito is

128
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:09,335
because you can feel

129
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:10,895
the presence of the moon’s powers.

130
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:14,096
– Moon’s powers?
– That’s right.

131
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,006
If you carefully look inside,

132
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,476
you’ll find what you really want.

133
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,475
What I truely want…

134
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,012
That is?

135
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,249
You figure out the rest.

136
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:43,393
When did I get here?

137
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,466
Oh yeah, I came

138
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:47,939
to return this to you

139
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:51,872
Since you worked so hard on it,

140
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,473
you should make sure
to give it to that person,

141
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:55,371
right?

142
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:23,902
On the hand?

143
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:28,980
Yeah.

144
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,112
but since Eriol lived
in England before…

145
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,351
I’m thinking maybe it was
just a different kind of greeting,

146
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,214
But, even though he’s
from another country,

147
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,252
Hiragiizawa is a
little different, neh…?

148
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:40,454
Like what?

149
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:43,886
Maybe, …mature, or careful?

150
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,199
I sometimes feel
he is like an adult.

151
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,299
Li also

152
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,033
is from a foreign country

153
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:52,662
They are so differnet.

154
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:57,376
Then again, Li was a
little weird today.

155
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:58,674
What was it?

156
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,605
During lunch,

157
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,370
he saw

158
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:03,807
my face and ran off.

159
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:05,812
I wonder if something happened…

160
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,442
I’m not sure,

161
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:08,878
but his face turned all red.

162
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:10,347
Oh, I see.

163
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,358
That’s because he met you.

164
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,424
Why does he run away
when he sees me?

165
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,898
Because you accept
everything so kindly.

166
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,759
It must be tough
for Li-kun as well.

167
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:25,662
Oh, by the way,

168
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,096
did you finish the bear?

169
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,807
– Yeah.
– Is it for Tsukishiro-san?

170
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,911
I have a favour to ask…

171
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:48,453
Haaa… It is embarassing.

172
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:50,952
You’re exploding with cuteness.

173
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,263
It’s good.
It’s good.

174
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,794
Why am I wearing the clothes
that you gave me,

175
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,963
coming to Yukito’s house?

176
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,699
The moment you are giving your
hand made bear to Tsukishiro-san

177
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,691
This is indeed a special day.

178
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:06,938
On a special day,
you can’t have yourself not look great.

179
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:10,781
Tomoyo, is that a new video camera?

180
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,816
Yes, last one broke,

181
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,243
so I got a new one

182
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,359
With this new digitial camera,

183
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,989
I can now record

184
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,954
Sakura’s image even clearer.

185
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:26,554
Toyomo…

186
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,041
Hurry up!

187
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:45,313
Now now, give the bear to him.

188
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,084
But I’m not prepared.

189
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:52,682
Fighting!

190
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:55,720
Yes?

191
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,829
– It’s me, Sakura.
– Sakura.

192
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,165
I’ll open the door now.

193
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,943
Sakura is too cute.

194
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,337
But wouldn’t

195
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,106
something edible been better?

196
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:25,590
Good evening.

197
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,691
Good evening. Hhh Ummm… this!

198
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,463
For me?

199
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,494
Can I open it?

200
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:46,745
Wow, did you make this?

201
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,709
Yes, it’s not the best
job in the world… but…

202
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,575
Thank you.
I’ll cherish it and take good care…

203
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:05,956
This is the best shot of the week.

204
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,335
I still think something
edible would have been better.

205
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,003
This aura… Clow’s?

206
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:41,533
Sakura…

207
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:09,152
Sakura…

208
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:15,939
Are you both OK?

209
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:21,698
– I’m OK, but Yue is… 
– I’m fine…

210
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:33,741
Ara… He fell.
They seem to be struggling.

211
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:36,086
Especially Yue…

212
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,688
Are you really OK, Yue?

213
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,578
Really really ok?

214
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,723
Yeah.

215
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,941
That’s a relief.

216
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,774
Kero, look after
Tomoyo and Yue please.

217
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,413
O Key which hides the forces of stars,

218
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,025
reveal thy true form before me.

219
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,829
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

220
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:22,198
Release!

221
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,479
I can surely feel Clow’s aura.

222
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,042
I can’t use the card like this.

223
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,255
O Card created by Clow,

224
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,726
Discard thine old form and be reborn.

225
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,885
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

226
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,563
Jump!

227
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,693
Yukito’s house is getting demolished.

228
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,532
How can I stop this stuffed bear?

229
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,797
It’s moving by magic,

230
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,995
you have to find the source.

231
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,203
That’s it.
Sakura!

232
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:37,241
You have to find

233
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,599
the source of the bear’s movement!!

234
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,071
What’s the source?

235
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:41,970
Place where its magic is the strongest.

236
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:45,507
Place where its magic is the strongest.

237
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,123
– It is ear?
– Cut it off!

238
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:56,689
Sword!

239
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,467
No good.

240
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:10,900
She can’t make it from there using Jump.

241
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,369
If she doesn’t use Fly…

242
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:15,212
But if she uses Fly to

243
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:16,775
fly away then the Sword will…

244
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,610
Right, Fly uses the wand

245
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:20,615
to grow wings on its end to fly away.

246
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,215
If she uses that,
then she can’t use the Sword.

247
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:33,324
Watch out!!

248
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:45,640
Please.

249
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,509
I have to use the Sword,

250
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,949
so help me fly in
the air without using my wand.

251
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,183
O Card created by Clow,

252
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,785
discard thine old form and be reborn.

253
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,252
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

254
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,599
Fly!

255
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:26,907
Sakura…

256
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,883
SWORD!

257
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:01,111
She did it!

258
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:09,958
Again, it really is Sakura.

259
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,345
The card again changed.

260
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,641
Sakura did a great job

261
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:35,114
What’s it, Yue?

262
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:47,261
This…

263
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,034
same picture as when
I use the magic Clow cards.

264
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,227
What’s going on?
