00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,044
Wow, this truly is amazing.
The universe really is a big place.

2
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:24,049
To think that there's a genius
even greater than myself out there...

3
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:28,720
This is no time to be admiring it, Dad.
Check it out as fast as possible, okay?

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,388
Okay, okay.

5
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:36,061
So anyway, this is an incredible spaceship.
It took us to Jupiter, just like that!

6
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,397
Really, it was amazing!

7
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:42,400
Huh? Sweet olives?
What's wrong with your nose?

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,071
No! Jupiter! Jupiter!

9
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:50,742
Anyhow, once we finish up here,
we're taking off, so get everyone together!

10
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:52,676
I'm counting on you!

11
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,853
Nah, it's nothin'.

12
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,035
Here.

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,703
I've had enough.

14
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:23,375
No you haven't! You've got to eat,
and recover from your injuries, quick.

15
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,808
Okay.

16
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,384
We've done it, Goku!

17
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,721
Cheer up! Word is, we've found a spaceship!
We can go to Planet Namek!

18
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,724
Piccolo and Tenshinhan and the others
will be coming back to life for sure!

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,060
Is that right?

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,994
Good work.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,352
I splurged, and bought this many! See?

22
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,128
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

23
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:33,378
Where did he go!?

24
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:34,713
What's wrong?

25
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,382
Gohan-<i>chan</i> isn't here.

26
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:41,386
Huh? He was there reading
his book just a little while ago.

27
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,822
He shouldn't even be able
to walk properly yet...

28
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,489
What if he breaks a bone!?

29
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,826
She's making too much of it.

30
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:05,009
35...

31
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,012
36...

32
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,015
37...

33
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,040
38...

34
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,122
That was close, that was close...

35
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,125
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

36
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:30,135
Where could Gohan-<i>chan</i> have gone?

37
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:33,468
His legs haven't healed,
so he couldn't be up walkin'...

38
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,818
All righty...

39
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:01,399
That should be okay.

40
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,735
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

41
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,828
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

42
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:13,011
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

43
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:16,014
What are you doin'
in a place like this!?

44
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:22,020
Mother... It was such a nice day,
I thought I would read my book outside.

45
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,284
Don't be so rash!

46
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,692
Come on, I'll carry you
back to the room.

47
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,786
I- I'm completely okay now...

48
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:36,133
That carelessness of yours
is dangerous. Come on, get on.

49
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:45,376
Good grief, you're so reckless.
Who are you takin' after?

50
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,379
What that all means is,
the spaceship is absolutely okay!

51
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,051
In that spaceship, you'll be able
to get to Planet Namek in just one month!

52
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,054
All that's left is to remodel
the interior a little.

53
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,724
I'd say you can
leave in five days.

54
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:01,059
That's right.

55
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:05,063
To Planet Namek in Kami-<i>sama</i>'s
spaceship, huh? Amazing!

56
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:08,066
That glimmer of light
looks like it's becoming reality.

57
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:13,004
And so, Popo-<i>san</i>, it's all up to you
to go to Planet Namek for us.

58
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,007
Mister Popo not going.

59
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:21,679
Mister Popo can't go. Be away from
Kami-<i>sama</i>'s palace two months. Can't.

60
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:26,684
Oh, no! But you're the only one
who knows how to speak Namekian!

61
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:30,355
You also seem pretty tough. Popo-<i>san</i>,
you have to be the one who goes!

62
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:33,085
No worry.
Teach you Namekian.

63
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:39,030
Well, Bulma-<i>san</i>, you'll have to go.

64
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,035
If anything were to happen, you're the only one
familiar with the mechanics, Bulma-<i>san</i>.

65
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:48,139
Fine, then. It doesn't
sound all that dangerous.

66
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,375
I'll have to build in
a shower room, too...

67
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,712
...and a more comfortable
bed, and a stereo...

68
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:58,716
But there's no way I'm going by myself,
okay? Someone come with me!

69
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:02,053
I'm tellin' ya right now,
there ain't no way I'm goin'.

70
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:05,056
Nobody was expecting you to.

71
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,058
Ahem...

72
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:12,664
Two months round trip, huh? All right,
I guess I've got no choice but to go with you.

73
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,333
That will just add
unnecessary danger!

74
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,001
I knew it.

75
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:22,674
Son-<i>kun</i> is in this state and all...
Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

76
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:30,014
M- me? That's okay and all,
but for two months? I wanted to train...

77
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,351
You never know when that
Saiyan will be coming again.

78
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,354
Nice for you.
I wanted to go, too.

79
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,358
I wanted to see what kind of Shen Long
would appear on Planet Namek.

80
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,694
Well, Goku, you stay here and rest up,

81
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,029
and come up with a strategy
against the Saiyan, or something.

82
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,032
Yeah, right. We'll be
counting on the both of you.

83
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,296
U- um...

84
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,327
What's the matter?
Have to go potty?

85
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,977
P- please take me, too!

86
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:18,663
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>! W- what kind
of silly joke is that?

87
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:24,002
It's not a joke!
I- I really want to go...

88
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:28,339
D- don't be absurd! It'll take two more
months, on top of everythin' else!

89
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,676
I'm sorry. I want to go,
no matter what.

90
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:36,347
I want to be the one who brings
Piccolo-<i>san</i> back to life myself.

91
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:39,350
So that's it.
Well said, Gohan.

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,021
What kind of nonsense
are you two talkin'!?

93
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:46,357
There's no reason for Gohan-<i>chan</i>
to be doin' any of this!

94
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:48,359
What if anythin' were to happen!?

95
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,696
For cryin' out loud,
he hasn't even healed enough!

96
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,699
We'd better stand back.

97
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,702
As far as my body goes, I'm fine.

98
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,371
W- what are you doin'!?

99
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:03,033
S- stop that, Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

100
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,378
I beg you, please take me.

101
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:11,315
I won't stand for this!
I absolutely won't stand for this!

102
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:15,319
It's two months! On top of the year
of anxiety I've already been through!

103
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,755
What about cram school?
What about your lessons!?

104
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,658
You've already fallen
way behind the other children!

105
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:23,161
Piccolo's got nothin'
to do with anythin'!

106
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,998
You are a little child,
and you should act like a child!

107
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,159
Shut up!!

108
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:38,342
Gohan-<i>chan</i>... you've
turned into a delinquent!

109
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:45,349
M- Mother... right now... right now really
isn't the time to be talking about that.

110
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:48,352
We all fought desperately
to save everyone on earth,

111
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,688
and we have to bring
those who died back to life,

112
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,691
to fight against
the Saiyan once again!

113
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,028
I can... I can fight, too!

114
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:00,698
I have to... I have to do something!

115
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:05,032
Understand, Mother.
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:10,367
That kid says some pretty
awesome things once in a while.

117
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,046
He's got you beat, Chichi.

118
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:20,051
Now let Gohan go off
into space willingly.

119
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:25,056
<i>Gohan, nice going.</i>
<i>You really have grown stronger.</i>

120
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:27,992
It's okay, I tell you.
He'll be completely fine.

121
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,983
Let us take care of him.

122
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,489
There won't be anything dangerous
this time around, after all.

123
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,070
Can you learn Namekian in five days?

124
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,006
Right, we'll have to input it all
into a translator device,

125
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,408
so... let's see,
we'll need ten days.

126
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:47,172
All right, let's meet up
ten days from now at Kame House!

127
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:49,845
Right!

128
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:19,377
" Good day" is " Pikonatto."

129
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,641
" Pikonatto," huh?

130
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,066
All right, you're fine.

131
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,328
Yow!!

132
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,752
You don't need to bother...

133
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:06,849
Oh, no! If you say that,
girls aren't goin' to like you.

134
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:12,697
Time for your medicine already.

135
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,688
Oh, water, water...

136
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:36,978
Hit me.

137
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,158
All right!

138
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:49,400
Don't hold back!
Hit me as hard as you can!

139
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,765
Right.

140
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,361
Good. If you can hit that hard,
you'll be fine, Gohan.

141
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,194
You'll do a great job
of standing in for me.

142
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,970
<i>And so, in the blink of an eye,</i>
<i>ten days went by,</i>

143
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,962
<i>and the day of launch had come.</i>

144
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:38,049
Whoo! Can we really get
to Planet Namek in this thing?

145
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,386
Well, don't you look sharp, Kuririn?

146
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,723
You're not, by any chance,
making light of outer space, are you?

147
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:51,320
I even cut my hair, because it would be
in the way inside my space suit!

148
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,401
Well? Isn't Gohan-<i>kun</i> here yet?

149
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,404
He'll be coming really soon,
from the hospital.

150
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,073
He hadn't been discharged yet?

151
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,743
No. Chichi-<i>san</i> insisted that he
remain up until the last minute.

152
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,746
Good grief, she's so overprotective.

153
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,681
Say, Bulma-<i>san</i>...

154
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:13,184
Do you think we should take umbrellas?

155
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:17,021
Planet Namek won't necessarily
have nice weather.

156
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,682
Suit yourself.

157
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,288
Oh, looks like they're here.

158
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:47,977
Sorry we're a little late.

159
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:55,317
So this is the spaceship, huh?
It's somethin' else!

160
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:04,164
Okay, Gohan-<i>chan</i>, make sure
you're careful as you go.

161
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,671
What's the matter?
Come on out.

162
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:29,292
Make sure you brush
your teeth after meals.

163
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,367
Is that really you, Gohan?
What happened to your hair?

164
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:40,371
F- Father laughed at me, too.

165
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,707
Whatever else you might say, this is
the first time man is goin' to outer space.

166
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:47,378
We don't want to be ill-mannered.

167
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:50,047
Uh, what is all that?

168
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:53,384
This is his change
of underwear and study gear...

169
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:56,053
this is two months' worth
of his medicine and vitamins...

170
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,388
his dryer...

171
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:00,057
his brush... his bowl
and chopsticks... also-

172
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,059
T- that's enough.

173
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,398
Well, shall we get going right away, then?
For some reason, I'm feeling discouraged.

174
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:11,335
We're depending on you. Make sure
you find the Dragon Balls for us.

175
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:12,666
Right!

176
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:20,003
" Piccolo"

177
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:44,702
Grandpa, Mother, Turtle Hermit-<i>san</i>,
Turtle-<i>san</i>, we're off. Take care.

178
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,704
" Piccolo"

179
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:50,374
Make sure to eat all your meals!

180
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:53,043
Send me a letter every day!

181
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,305
Bye!

182
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,652
This is a little exciting, huh?

183
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,999
Say, Bulma-<i>san</i>,
where should I put my bag?

184
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:19,670
You can stick it wherever you need to,
can't you!? Hurry up and sit down!

185
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,339
She's in a bad mood
for some reason.

186
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,605
Five seconds to launch!
Destination: Planet Namek!

187
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,681
J- just a minute!

188
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:31,682
4...

189
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:32,683
3...

190
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,018
2...

191
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:35,610
1...

192
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:45,124
W-w-we still haven't
f-fastened our b-b-belts!

193
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,702
It's too late to stop now, you know!

194
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:57,374
T- that truly is some tremendous speed.
They're out of sight already.

195
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:01,470
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
Be sure to rinse, too!

196
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,924
You can move about freely now.

197
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:17,328
Once we're out of the atmosphere,
everything calms down.

198
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,989
Eh? Already?

199
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,839
I wanted to see Earth.

200
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,349
Huh? What are you doing, Bulma-<i>san</i>?

201
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,352
How nosy!
I'm changing my clothes!

202
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,844
You're changing? You mean, into pajamas?
You're going to bed already?

203
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,696
Whoops, come to think of it,
I forgot to bring pajamas myself.

204
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,697
What about you, Gohan?

205
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,359
I made sure I brought some.

206
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,536
I know it's none of my business,

207
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,707
but can't you do anything
about that <i>Shichigosan</i> outfit?

208
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,538
This is just for the first part.

209
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:14,211
I actually have some clothes that I made
without Mother finding out about it.

210
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,325
Well?

211
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:31,001
You really do look up
to Piccolo, don't you?

212
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,993
Yes. About the same as I do Father.

213
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:47,685
Huh? T- those are unusual pajamas, huh?

214
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,353
They look hard to sleep in.

215
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:52,690
Of course they're not pajamas!
When I saw you guys,

216
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,353
I felt like an idiot for working so hard
getting ready to go into space.

217
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:03,033
Hey, did we do something wrong?

218
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,193
Search me.

219
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,648
<i>Good luck, Gohan.</i>

220
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,829
<i>The trio had departed for Planet Namek,</i>
<i>carrying the hopes of Goku and the others...</i>

221
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:48,504
<i>...with no way of knowing</i>
<i>the incredible terror that awaited them.</i>
