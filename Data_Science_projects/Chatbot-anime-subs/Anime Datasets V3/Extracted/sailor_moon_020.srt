1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,402
The blue sky! The sparkling sun!

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:07,205
Summer vacation is finally
here for us girls!

3
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:11,409
But... But how dare they interfere
with our vacation?!

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,913
How dare they steal summer away
from these helpless young girls?!

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:19,646
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

8
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,688
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

9
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

10
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:36,115
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

13
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

14
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,429
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

16
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:00,173
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

17
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,342
and fight against bad guys.

18
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:06,472
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

19
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:12,518
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

20
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:15,755
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

21
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,451
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

22
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,926
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

23
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:31,804
The Summer! The Ocean!
Our Youth! And A Ghost, Too

24
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,382
There!

25
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:44,450
We're here! We're here!

26
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:44,751
The Kagawa
We're here! We're here!

27
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:47,117
The Kagawa

28
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:52,258
Wow!

29
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,493
It's the ocean!

30
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,695
The smell of the ocean is so good!

31
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,492
It seems like a nice place.

32
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:00,527
I wish I could have brought Naru, too.

33
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,102
Usagi, this trip is not for fun!

34
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:07,801
We came all this way for training camp
to become better sailor warriors!

35
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:09,803
I know that!

36
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,243
Inaka Hama

37
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:11,577
Inaka Hama
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

38
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,512
Inaka Hama
Is the pension you reserved close by?
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

39
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,446
Inaka Hama
Is the pension you reserved close by?

40
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,782
Inaka Hama
Yes, it looks like it's on the
headland up ahead.

41
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,077
Yes, it looks like it's on the
headland up ahead.

42
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:20,153
Rei, this pension had better be
a nice place.

43
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,254
Don't worry!

44
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:22,243
Really?

45
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:25,725
"The blue ocean! And yachts sailing
with their white sails unfurled."

46
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,393
"A European-style pension
on the headland

47
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:28,795
with a great view of the sunset."

48
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:32,031
"A white private beach is just
waiting for you!"

49
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,999
A private beach?!

50
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,240
Motoki!

51
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,182
Tuxedo Mask!

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,045
Oh, that would be wonderful!

53
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:02,859
This is it! Yes, yes! This is youth!
Summer vacation!

54
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,189
What? Oh, no, wait for me!

55
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:15,308
Are we there yet?
Are you sure we aren't lost?

56
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:18,175
You're the one who insisted
it was this way!

57
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,583
It's your fault for not properly checking
things out! Rei, you moron!

58
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,210
What did you say?!

59
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,790
Oh, lightning!

60
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,621
This is bad. It looks like
it's going to rain!

61
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,760
Let's hurry!

62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,727
Yes!

63
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,531
I'm scared of lightning!

64
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:47,773
Usagi!

65
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:48,740
What's the matter?

66
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,067
Who's there?!

67
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:52,569
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,712
It's raining!

69
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,483
Please, this way.

70
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:01,420
Let's go!

71
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,754
Okay.

72
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:02,413
Yeah.

73
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:12,926
I hate this!

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,858
Lightning is scary!

75
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,933
It looks creepy.

76
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:28,214
Pension Adams

77
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,783
Pension Adams
This is it!
This is the pension I booked!

78
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:33,586
Gag! You're kidding me!

79
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:34,487
What?

80
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,114
It looks spooky.

81
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,988
Thank you, you were a great help.

82
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,928
We're soaking wet.
Are the flowers okay?

83
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:42,995
Oh, yes.

84
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,189
I'm glad.

85
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:56,876
Welcome!

86
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,110
Welcome!
Welcome!

87
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,805
Welcome!
Welcome!

88
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:03,612
I'm home.

89
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:06,141
Welcome back.

90
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:10,212
Are you the guests with reservations?

91
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,117
Yes! We're from Tokyo and
my name is Rei Hino.

92
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,552
We have been waiting for you.

93
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,365
Please!

94
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:19,865
Thank you.

95
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:22,001
It's nice to meet you. Oh?

96
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,127
Nice to meet you!

97
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:26,872
How long are you going to make a
fuss about this? It's embarrassing!

98
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:28,100
But...

99
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,337
Sakiko!

100
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,436
You're so noisy!

101
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:38,841
Where were you?!
Come here right this minute!

102
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:41,052
Yes, Father.

103
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:51,097
I'm so tired! I'm hungry!

104
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:52,999
I bet you would be, after making
such a commotion.

105
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,066
Speak for yourself, Luna!

106
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:54,967
Oops.

107
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,198
But don't you think the people here
are a little weird?

108
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:02,002
What if this place turns out to be
a haunted house?

109
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:04,841
Yes?

110
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,706
Excuse me.

111
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,284
What's going on?

112
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:12,718
Over there...
What's going on?

113
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:13,619
Over there...

114
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:14,313
What?

115
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:23,496
Oh, it came on. Sorry for disturbing
you. Dinner is ready.

116
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,463
Honestly!

117
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,631
Usagi!

118
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:29,502
But her neck snaked out and...

119
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:30,970
That's enough!

120
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,705
I'm sorry! Ami, help me!

121
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,107
No, Usagi, I'm not helping
you out anymore!

122
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:36,108
Why not?!

123
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,040
Wait!

124
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:40,413
They are such raucous girls.

125
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,381
But they seem like nice people.

126
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:47,216
Sakiko, stay away from those
frivolous girls! Understood?!

127
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,850
Yes, Father.

128
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,064
How about a second helping?

129
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,637
No, thank you. I'm already full.

130
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,517
How about some dessert?

131
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:20,007
I don't want any!

132
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,623
Rei, you idiot! Why did you book
a pension like this?!

133
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:27,421
Because this place is
incredibly cheap!

134
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:31,030
But the cooking is good

135
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,498
and the costumes of the
employees here are fun.

136
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,267
Thank you.

137
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:38,031
Those two are our selling points.

138
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:40,039
What?!

139
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,233
Not again!

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,176
I don't like this! It's creepy!

141
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,609
Is the owner crying?

142
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,945
It is not me.

143
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,514
That was scary!

144
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,347
Who's there?

145
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,865
What was that?

146
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,958
We didn't see anything!

147
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,799
Of course, not. It's just our eyes
playing tricks on us.

148
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:14,540
Could it be a monster?

149
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,565
I don't feel any monster aura.

150
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,709
But I did feel some kind
of strong power.

151
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:31,014
Good girl. You're a good girl.
You are a very good girl.

152
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:36,095
Sleep. Go to sleep.

153
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:41,465
Good. Good girl. Go to sleep.

154
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,467
Sleep, sleep.

155
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,399
Good. And now, you'll slowly,
very slowly wake up.

156
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:55,772
Slowly, very slowly.

157
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,540
Woohoo!

158
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,745
The blue ocean!

159
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,846
Wow! It feels so good!

160
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,123
It makes yesterday's commotion
seem like it never happened.

161
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:38,988
I know, it feels so good.

162
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,689
But you know...

163
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:42,856
I know.

164
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,833
This is definitely a private beach, but...

165
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,802
If it's because people avoid
coming here...

166
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,639
The silhouette of a ship
sailing off the coast.

167
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,106
A flock of seagulls flying.

168
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:59,446
Where are the white yachts?
Where are the cool guys?

169
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:04,042
Who cares about the ocean?!
Who cares about the ocean?!

170
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:05,815
But, I'll have fun anyway!

171
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,555
She's so happy-go-lucky.

172
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:09,322
Math II

173
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,424
Math II
Oh, that girl named Sakiko

174
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,526
Math II
didn't come out of her room
this morning either.

175
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:13,927
Didn't come out of her room
this morning either.

176
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,695
Now that you mention it...

177
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,832
Ami, you brought your
text books with you?!

178
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:19,491
Yes.

179
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:21,935
Oh!

180
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:26,106
Ami! Youth is a priceless thing
that you only have once!

181
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:28,909
Studying is important, but you have
to play when it's time to play!

182
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:31,811
I think it's important to create
nice memories that way!

183
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:32,971
Usagi...

184
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,776
Usagi is actually saying
something reasonable.

185
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,746
Okay, I understand.
Usagi, let's have lots of fun!

186
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,279
Yeah! That's what I want to hear!

187
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:43,715
Here!

188
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,058
Here!

189
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:49,062
Okay!

190
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:49,790
Ouch!

191
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:52,297
Oh... Here!

192
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:56,759
Ouch! Both of you are so mean!

193
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,172
Hey! Wait!

194
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:16,418
It's night again. I'm scared.

195
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:20,393
Luna, you're there, aren't you? Luna?!

196
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,862
I'm here! How many times
do I have to tell you?!

197
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:25,296
But I'm scared!

198
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,567
Begone, Evil Spirit
Begone, evil spirits!

199
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:28,898
Begone, Evil Spirit
Begone, evil spirits!

200
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:31,927
Now, no one will disturb us at dinner!

201
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,770
But that was no ghost. It was a
stronger, more tangible power.

202
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,779
Let's just do it.

203
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,480
What?

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,246
I'll go crazy if things like this
keep happening everyday.

205
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,553
We have no choice, but to do it.

206
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:51,624
I agree, but we can never
let those girls find out.

207
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:52,488
Right!

208
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:55,553
Oh?

209
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,560
Sakiko.

210
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,505
Huh? Oh, Miss Ami.

211
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:08,565
Oh, my. And I hadn't even
introduced myself yet.

212
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,245
I was watching you from
here all afternoon.

213
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:18,115
Ladylike Rei, slightly clumsy Usagi,
and the cat, Luna.

214
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:27,352
Sakiko, are you Ionely?

215
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:35,902
Cheer up! You remind me of how
I was not so long ago.

216
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,062
Because you're all by yourself.

217
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:42,073
I know! The best thing to do is to
become friends with Usagi!

218
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,811
She'll cheer you right up!

219
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:46,278
But I...

220
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:47,835
It's okay!

221
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:50,983
Sakiko!

222
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,954
How many times have I told you
not to talk to strangers?!

223
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:55,722
Father...

224
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,518
Excuse me.

225
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,723
You girls should get
out of here quickly!

226
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:03,321
That is, if you do not want to be
in more frightening situations.

227
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:04,522
What?

228
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:09,200
Father! Ow! Father, that hurts!

229
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:12,665
Father!

230
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:15,575
Ami and her friends
are nice people!

231
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,610
I was so close to becoming
friends with them!

232
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,736
Shut up!

233
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,616
Sakiko, you have a strong
psychic power.

234
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:25,852
Learn to master that power!

235
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:28,288
No, I can't!

236
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,586
Then just let me take care of it.

237
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:35,654
Your power has improved quite a bit,
thanks to my hypnosis.

238
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:40,863
Or are you saying you won't listen to
your father, your only parent?!

239
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:44,369
Father...

240
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:49,899
Now, focus on this coin, Sakiko.

241
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,806
Focus your attention on this coin!

242
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:59,786
All those people laughed and said
our psychic powers were fake.

243
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:03,187
Now, show them your
incredible power!

244
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,326
With your psychic powers,

245
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:10,057
you will become the pioneer of
the spiritual community.

246
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:13,857
Sakiko...

247
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:22,034
Ami! Rei! Where are you?!

248
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,157
What is this?!

249
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:38,124
You saw us.

250
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:44,987
Stop!

251
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:46,932
Usagi!

252
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:51,237
Rei, they really are ghosts!

253
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:54,541
It's okay! They're just normal
human beings.

254
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,875
But...

255
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,044
But right now, there's a
tremendous power

256
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,980
being brought into existence
somewhere in this mansion.

257
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,969
What?!

258
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:03,577
Something is coming.

259
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,984
Begone, Evil Spirit

260
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:05,609
Begone, Evil Spirit

261
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:24,595
Now, create the figure of a ghost!

262
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,607
That should be easy for you by now.

263
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:30,735
Scare all those noisy girls!

264
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:32,843
Stop!

265
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,343
You are...

266
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:47,553
Good, Sakiko!
You've done a splendid job!

267
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:50,897
Now, scare all those girls!

268
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:55,493
We'll get back at everyone
who called us fakes!

269
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,399
Good! It's perfect!

270
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,676
What? What's wrong?

271
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,879
What is this?!

272
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:26,465
It's here!

273
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,934
Sakiko...

274
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:42,682
Rei, you idiot! You just had
to book this pension!

275
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,184
This isn't the time for that right now!

276
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:48,888
Usagi! Rei! Transform now! Help him!

277
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:49,877
Sakiko!

278
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:50,657
No, I don't wanna!

279
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:51,357
No, I don't wanna!
Okay!

280
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:51,891
No, I don't wanna!

281
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:54,360
We're all going to become possessed
if we don't do anything!

282
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,764
What?! Oh, fine then!

283
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:01,723
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

284
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:05,797
Mercury Power Makeup!

285
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,772
Mars Power Makeup!

286
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,125
I'm the sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

287
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:39,272
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!

288
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,570
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

289
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:46,012
Mean ghost, ruining the vacation of
these helpless young girls!

290
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:49,778
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will...

291
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,219
punish you!

292
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,710
But, I'm still scared!

293
00:18:56,055 --> 00:19:01,928
Sakiko, stop! Stop it!
Can't you hear me?!

294
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:06,331
Sakiko! Sakiko! Wake up! Sakiko!

295
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,224
I don't want to.
I don't want to anymore.

296
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:19,802
Moon Tiara Action!

297
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:27,549
No way!

298
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:32,620
Sakiko! Wake up! Please!

299
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,395
Sakiko!

300
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:36,862
Oh, I...

301
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,002
Father!

302
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:46,339
Sakiko, can't you erase that
ghost somehow?!

303
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:51,106
It should have disappeared once
I woke up! Why is it still here?!

304
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,081
I'm scared!

305
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:56,082
Mercury!
I'm scared!

306
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:56,514
I'm scared!

307
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:57,550
Father!

308
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:02,455
Sakiko, run! You cannot control
that ghost anymore!

309
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:04,457
What is going on?!

310
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:07,693
Sakiko didn't want to listen to
her father anymore,

311
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:12,460
and that feeling was magnified,
making it uncontrollable!

312
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,036
Are you all right?

313
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,206
Run, Sakiko!

314
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:21,240
Father!

315
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,380
I am sorry. I knew you just wanted
to live like a normal girl, but I...

316
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,540
Father!

317
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:33,841
Sakiko!

318
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:44,052
Stop it!

319
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,340
Sakiko!

320
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,398
Sakiko!

321
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,076
Father!

322
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:58,578
Sakiko!

323
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:04,116
Everyone, I just wanted everyone
to acknowledge

324
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:07,487
that Sakiko possessed
truly strong powers,

325
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:12,220
and though I knew that she hated her
powers, I continued training her.

326
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,995
And I used the guests who happened
to come to this pension

327
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:18,759
to conduct experiments.

328
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,990
Then, what about those other people?

329
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,737
They were probably just
scared of the ghost

330
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,568
and tried to conduct an exorcism.

331
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,370
Oh, okay.

332
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,068
Here!

333
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:33,246
Here!

334
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:33,940
Ouch!

335
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:35,348
Here!

336
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:39,785
Ouch! Why do you guys
keep picking on me?!

337
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:44,357
Hey, Sakiko, you laughed at me,
didn't you?!

338
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:45,654
Wait!

339
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:49,656
Will there really be no more ghosts?

340
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,198
We're such scaredycats,

341
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:56,102
we just can't deal with
apparitions and ghosts!

342
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:59,970
Don't worry. It'll never show up again.

343
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:01,468
Not ever.

344
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:13,186
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne
