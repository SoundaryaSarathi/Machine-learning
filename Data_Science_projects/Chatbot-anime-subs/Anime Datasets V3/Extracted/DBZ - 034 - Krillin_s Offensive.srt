1
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:44,095
Stay with it, Kuririn...
Gohan can't control this <i>Ki</i>...

2
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,947
T- t- there it is!
Is this-?

3
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:59,618
A <i>Genki Dama</i>...
You did it...

4
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:04,956
Hit him... with that...

5
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:11,630
I can't make another <i>Genki Dama</i>...
Make sure you hit him... please!

6
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,397
Y- you got it! I'll try.
Let me take care of it.

7
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:39,082
He's so strong! He should be fairly
worn out from fighting with Father, too...

8
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:05,208
<i>You're a tough little runt, but you</i>
<i>appear to be nearing your limit.</i>

9
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,958
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, fight!

10
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,893
Fight, Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

11
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:22,967
W- w- what are you sayin', Chichi!?
Gohan's no match for that guy!

12
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,401
Gohan, get out of there!

13
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,974
<i>Gohan-chan...</i>

14
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:32,568
Chichi, are you-?

15
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:36,744
Pa!

16
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,080
Chichi...

17
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:47,519
They've vanished!

18
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,028
Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

19
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:03,370
Uranai Baba, hurry up
and show me Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

20
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:10,615
A- all right! All right!
I'll try! Let me go!

21
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,880
You've got a ridiculous amount
of strength for a woman!

22
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,740
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

23
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,070
Is that your last-ditch effort!?

24
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:45,511
Darn it!

25
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,846
One more!

26
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:15,375
Damn! With my skill, I can't hit him
when he's moving around like that!

27
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:20,952
<i>You don't hit him with the</i>
<i>Genki Dama by using your eyes.</i>

28
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,622
<i>You sense out his evil Ki</i>
<i>and shoot at that.</i>

29
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,385
W- who's there!?

30
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:33,898
I am Kaio, the one who taught
Son Goku the <i>Genki Dama</i>.

31
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,234
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

32
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,571
Everything will be
decided by your one shot.

33
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:45,168
Know that the ball of that <i>Genki Dama</i>
is filled with the hopes of the whole earth.

34
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,674
The ball is filled with
the hopes of the whole earth?

35
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:06,693
No matter how many of you scum gang up
on me, you're still no match for an elite.

36
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,537
It looks like once you realized
that, it was already too late.

37
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:25,950
S- sense out his evil <i>Ki</i>
and shoot at that... So that's it...

38
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,286
<i>Kuririn, we're counting on you!</i>

39
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,880
<i>You'll only get one chance.</i>

40
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:40,724
I'm done playing around.

41
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:20,605
You think you can get away!?

42
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:24,871
<i>F</i>- <i>feel it!</i>
<i>Feel his evil Ki!</i>

43
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:44,221
<i>K</i>- <i>Kuririn!</i>

44
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:51,569
<i>H</i>- <i>he's fixin' to do somethin'.</i>
<i>That's a humungous amount of Ki.</i>

45
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,231
<i>lf you're gonna get him,</i>
<i>then get him, already!</i>

46
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:19,093
Watch closely, Kakarrot!
This is the end of your foolish son!

47
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,600
I've got him!

48
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,271
What're ya doin', ya dimwit!?
Hurry up and hit him with that!

49
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:28,272
<i>W</i>- <i>what?</i>

50
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,607
T- that idiot!

51
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,939
Damn it all!

52
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,943
W- what is that!?

53
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,216
Hit him!

54
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,226
It missed!

55
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:04,575
W- what happened!? How could
my crystal ball crack!?

56
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,066
G- Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

57
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,748
It's hopeless now!

58
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Bounce it back, Gohan!</i>

59
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:25,263
<i>Gohan, that thing is on our side!</i>

60
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:28,926
<i>As long as you don't have any evil in you,</i>
<i>you should be able to bounce it back!</i>

61
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,046
You did it!

62
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:52,950
Yahoo!

63
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,619
We did it!

64
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:57,288
We did it!

65
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,222
We did it, Goku!

66
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:24,315
Turtle, do you have
any quick-drying glue?

67
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:29,753
Glue? Hmm, I seem to remember
having some around here somewhere...

68
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,424
What about Gohan-<i>chan</i>!?

69
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,928
Uranai Baba, can't you do something
about the crystal ball!?

70
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,596
Chichi! Stop that!

71
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:43,601
Pa! Gohan-<i>chan</i> is still
alive! So's Goku-<i>sa</i>!

72
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,698
Y- you're right. But how are we goin'
to get to where Goku and them are?

73
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:54,946
All right, Chichi-<i>san</i>,
I'll take you there.

74
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,049
Really? But how?

75
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,846
In my airship.

76
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,954
Bulma-<i>san</i>, thank you!

77
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,958
If I were to ever have a husband
and son who were in trouble,

78
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,628
I would rush to their side,
no matter what. That's human nature.

79
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,297
All right, I'm going too.

80
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,958
I'm going, too.

81
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,498
K- Karin-<i>sama</i>!

82
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,028
Father...

83
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,368
You guys finally got him, huh?

84
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:01,279
Time and again, I thought
we were done for.

85
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,948
You two sure are a mess.

86
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,882
We're not as bad off as you.

87
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,903
T- the Saiyan!

88
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,570
It's okay. He's dead.

89
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,411
We can relax, now.

90
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:51,191
Damn it all, he was one horrible fellow,
but we could at least dig a grave.

91
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,867
You mean, a grave for you guys?

92
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:17,212
T- t- that's impossible!
He took that <i>Genki Dama</i> dead-on!

93
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:25,963
You put me through quite
the awful experience, huh?

94
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:30,229
E- even I thought I was
going to die from that one.

95
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,742
I may have taken
quite a bit of damage,

96
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:41,405
but I still have enough power left
to take care of you trash.

97
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,856
After I've killed you,

98
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:56,350
I'll wait until I've recovered my strength,
and then thoroughly destroy this planet!

99
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:21,952
Just keep on going straight.

100
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:25,890
Bulma! For Karin-<i>sama</i> to deign
to give you directions...

101
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,382
...is an <i>extremely</i> magnanimous
thing for him to do!

102
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:35,061
It is? He looks like
an ordinary cat to me.

103
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:07,861
Y- you guys dare to make me, Vegeta-<i>sama</i>,
use up nearly all of my power?

104
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:19,610
Never mind that you ganged up on me,
against trash like you, it wounds my pride...

105
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,376
Would you die, already!?

106
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:32,289
D- dammit... Dammit!

107
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,382
G- Goku!

108
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,594
Damn it! Coming from me,
that destructive force was pathetic!

109
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:19,927
All three of them
are still barely alive!

110
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:43,220
I- I've taken more damage than I thought...
I- I have to put them all away quickly...

111
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,051
...and then recuperate...

112
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:15,586
T- this brat has...

113
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,749
...re-grown his tail!

114
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:26,761
H- his tail? That's right... In the past,
Goku's tail suddenly grew back, too...

115
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:46,950
If he were to transform,
that would be a problem!

116
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,887
<i>Gohan's tail has</i>
<i>once again grown out.</i>

117
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:52,623
<i>Could this be a symbol</i>
<i>that the fate of the earth</i>-

118
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:58,562
<i>that the fate of mankind</i>-
<i>is to be saved from extinction?</i>
