[narrator]
<i>Ash and his friends are in for a surprise</i>

13
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,444
<i>at this small-town Pokémon Center.</i>

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,824
-Is your name Ash?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,867
I have a message for you.

16
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,286
-For me?
-Pika. Pika.

17
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,789
<i>Greetings, Ash. It's Professor Oak.</i>

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,041
<i>Give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance!</i>

19
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,294
It's from Professor Oak.

20
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,587
I guess it's been awhile
since you talked him, Ash.

21
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,340
-Why don't you give him a buzz?
-[Ash] Okay, let's see.

22
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,634
Professor. I hope he's around.

23
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,428
[ringtone]

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,722
Hi, Professor Oak. It's Ash!

25
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,265
<i>Hello there, Ash!</i>

26
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,310
<i>I suppose my message</i>
<i>finally found its way to you!</i>

27
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,688
-Yeah.
<i>-How is everyone? Say...</i>

28
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,566
<i>-Pikachu sure is looking well.</i>
-Pikachu!

29
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,901
-I'm fine, too.
-I'm glad to hear it!

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,987
Well, they say no news is good news,

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,157
uh, but I do wish you'd let me know
how things are going now and then.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,201
I know. We've been kind of busy. Uh...

33
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,786
[Muk] Muk. Muk. Muk.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,413
Come on. Cut that out!

35
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,750
[chuckles] My Muk seems to be doing okay.

36
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,502
Taking care of it hasn't been so easy!

37
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,129
Will you behave?

38
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,674
I hope the next Pokémon you send
will be easier to manage!

39
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,970
I hope so, too, Professor,
but I haven't caught any new ones.

40
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:17,929
That's right.

41
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,642
Well, make sure the next ones
aren't so mucky!

42
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,061
-Muk.
-[groans]

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,312
I almost forgot.

44
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,606
Have you heard about
the new Pokédex upgrade?

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,567
<i>Pokédex upgrade? No, I haven't!</i>

46
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,529
Well, now you can get details
on all the latest Pokémon discoveries.

47
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,198
<i>Wow! How can I get it?</i>

48
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,702
<i>Just put your Pokédex</i>
<i>into that slot and I'll do it.</i>

49
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:45,582
<i>Once upgraded, your Pokédex will have</i>
<i>an updated database and even a new voice!</i>

50
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,627
All right! I'm putting it in right now!

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,963
[computer bleeps]

52
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,174
<i>Okay. It's all done.</i>

53
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,176
[Ash] Gee, thanks!

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>Okay, no time to lose.</i>

55
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>Go capture more Pokémon</i>
<i>and collect some new badges too!</i>

56
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,601
Professor...
we're on our way right now!

57
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,654
Where to next?

58
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,490
We could head to Cinnabar Island
and the Cinnabar Gym.

59
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,409
The Cinnabar Gym.

60
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,701
-[Brock blows]
-Pika.

61
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,496
Hey, Brock, when do you think
that eggs going to hatch?

62
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,456
[Brock] Who knows?

63
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,377
-Hey, look what I found.
-[both] Huh?

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,920
Are you sure it's all right
to just take that?

65
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,215
Maybe I should have given
this Pokémon egg to Joy.

66
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,591
-No way!
-Huh?

67
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,759
I'll raise this one for you.

68
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,389
And I've been keeping it close to me
every night so it'll stay nice and warm.

69
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,766
What?
You mean you sleep with that egg?

70
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,937
It's the only way it'll hatch.
What else can I do?

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,605
[groans]

72
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,192
So, Brock, what kind of Pokémon's
going to hatch out of that thing anyway?

73
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,611
To tell you the truth, Ash,
I don't know.

74
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,865
You mean it might even turn out
to be a Tentacruel?

75
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,533
It could be, Misty.

76
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,368
[sighs]

77
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,954
I'd just love a Tentacruel!

78
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,083
Oh!
But it could it even be an Aerodactyl?

79
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,877
[Brock] That's a possibility, too.

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,795
[screams]

81
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,467
-Maybe it won't be.
-I'd like it to be a Golem!

82
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,137
Oh, imagine if it were a lovely Lapras.

83
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,057
I can't wait to see what kind of
Pokémon hatches, no matter what it is.

84
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,062
Did you hear that?
They're hatching a new Pokémon!

85
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:36,067
-I think he said a Dragonair.
-No, no. He said an Aerodactyl!

86
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,570
Whatever it is, we gotta get
our hands on that egg.

87
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,156
This could be the chance
we been waiting for.

88
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,284
Imagine when the boss hears
we've captured a Pokémon!

89
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,494
He'll be shocked.

90
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,578
Don't forget.

91
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,999
We haven't even succeeded in capturing
that one little Pikachu from those kids!

92
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,752
We have a proud tradition
of failure to uphold!

93
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,255
-[Jessie] Then you fail!
-And we'll win!

94
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,759
What? Hey, what's up?
Hey, let me in! Oh, come on!

95
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,178
I can break tradition!

96
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,473
-So, how far to cinnabar island?
-[Brock] Hmm.

97
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,392
-It looks pretty far.
-[all] Huh?

98
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,562
Hello, everybody! Good day! [giggles]

99
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,023
I don't believe my eyes!

100
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,277
[both giggling]

101
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,281
[both] We kick up our legs
so you will buy our eggs!

102
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,577
What kind of Pokémon eggs are they? Ah.

103
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,539
[chuckles]
Wait and find out when they hatch!

104
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,707
Won't you buy some?
Please! Please! Please!

105
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,711
We don't need any Pokémon eggs
'cause we already have one of our own.

106
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,005
-Yeah.
-Ah!

107
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,424
Let me see it. Show me!

108
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,134
Okay, okay.

109
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,680
Here. Like it?

110
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,307
-Oh! It's pretty! Lovely!
-Beautiful!

111
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,143
[both] One, two...

112
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,896
[all yell]

113
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,400
Which one is ours?

114
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,901
They aren't egg sellers!

115
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,319
[Team Rocket laugh]

116
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,782
-Prepare for trouble!
-Make it double!

117
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,828
-To protect the world from devastation!
-To unite all peoples within our nation!

118
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,916
-To denounce the evils of truth and love!
-To extend our reach to the stars above!

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,334
-Jessie!
-James!

120
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,836
-[Brock] Is that it?
-[both] Huh?

121
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,130
Hmm. Let's see.

122
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,258
-Hey! You didn't let us finish!
-Yeah, that's right!

123
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,260
And we didn't even get to the best part.

124
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,597
Ah. Is this it? Huh? Ah.

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,725
-Ah. Isn't this it?
-Huh?

126
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,185
-[both groan] Huh?
-[Meowth laughs]

127
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,104
Is this what you're looking for?

128
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,107
That's it! Meowths got our egg!

129
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,692
-It was...
-Your egg.

130
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,777
Let's beat it!

131
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,113
Come back, you thieves!

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,953
-[Meowth] Eh, we did it!
-[Jessie] A great success!

133
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,832
It was because I made
such a cute egg salesgirl.

134
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,125
Yeah, maybe.

135
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,210
So shall we cook it over easy?

136
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,297
Or maybe we can scramble it? Or I know!

137
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,216
-We can make a little fried rice!
-[Meowth yells]

138
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,969
You're not cooking it
because I'm hatching it.

139
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,639
-But how will you do that?
-Very simple.

140
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,892
I will warm it with my body.

141
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,893
-Ah...
-[Jessie and James] Huh?

142
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,062
[munching]

143
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,691
-Still holding that egg?
-Of course I am.

144
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,528
If I put it down my beautiful egg,
it'll cool off, and it won't hatch!

145
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,488
[Jessie and James] Hmm?

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,245
Now, my little eggy-weggy,
while you and I share a nice hot soak,

147
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,873
I'm going to tell you a bath time story.

148
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,917
Hmm. Once upon a time...

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,378
Ah, you're boiling it!

150
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,713
I like mine soft boiled.

151
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,593
Huh? Boiled? I told you
I'm going to hatch it not eat it!

152
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:54,015
Good night, little egg.
Time for us to go sleepy!

153
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,186
-I never realized Meowth could be so...
-Revolting.

154
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,736
Hey! Ah.

155
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,530
Look, it's another one!

156
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,200
If we just follow these eggs, they'll
lead us all the way to Team Rocket!

157
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,371
Wow, they're pretty dumb, aren't they?
Leaving us a trail of broken eggs.

158
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,958
If they're so dumb, how come
they're the ones who have the egg?

159
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,378
I guess you have a point there. [sighs]

160
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,673
Pika! Pika! Pika!

161
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,716
[all gasp]

162
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,051
[Brock] They must be in there!

163
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,474
[Jessie gulps]

164
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,519
Rise and shine, my little eggy-poo!

165
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,773
Meowth's going to make you nice and shiny
because we got a lot of incubating to do.

166
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,233
Here!

167
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,652
-What's that?
-Your scrambled eggs!

168
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,280
-I told you to lay off the e-g-g-s!
-Ah.

169
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,824
How can you be so insensitive,
you numbskull?

170
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,580
-That's definitely the egg.
-Right, now's our chance.

171
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,753
Go, Pidgeotto!

172
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,421
[squawks]

173
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,341
-Go, Geodude!
-Geodude!

174
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,136
Staryu, I choose you!

175
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,179
[gasps]

176
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,141
-Psy-ay-ay!
-No, not you! [grunts]

177
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,226
-What?
-What's going on?

178
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,936
[grunting and groaning]

179
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,816
-[squawks]
-Ah. Huh?

180
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,069
Good work, Pidgeotto!

181
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,612
Hey, give me back my egg!

182
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,115
That's funny. And all along,
I thought this was our egg.

183
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,284
Go get them and my egg!

184
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,287
-Go, Arbok!
-Weezing, go!

185
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,875
-Weezing!
-Charm!

186
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,669
[all coughing]

187
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,297
Careful, Ash, the egg!

188
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,965
-Charm!
-Argh!

189
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,884
Huh?

190
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,766
[grunting and groaning]

191
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,976
-The egg!
-Nyah! Nyah!

192
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,187
Geodude! Tackle attack!

193
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,231
[grunts]

194
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,192
-I got it!
-I've got it!

195
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,487
Hey, Staryu! Airborne tackle! Now!

196
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,489
[laughs] Huh? Oh!

197
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,992
-Got it! [grunts]
-Got it! Ooh!

198
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,828
Yeah! Ah!

199
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,204
[laughs]

200
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,789
Can't see.

201
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,875
Pidgeotto, Gust attack!
Blow this gas away!

202
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,962
[squawking]

203
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,424
[Meowth screams]

204
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,844
[all gasping]

205
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,930
Quick, somebody catch it!
The eggs going to break!

206
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,182
[grunts]

207
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,060
[yells]

208
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,270
[all gasping]

209
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,356
[grunts] I missed it! Huh?

210
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,778
Pika!

211
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,698
-Pikachu.
-Pikachu!

212
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,782
[all sigh]

213
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,369
-You did it, Pikachu!
-Nice catch, Pikachu!

214
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,204
-Kachu!
-Huh?

215
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,664
What's wrong, Ash?

216
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,376
It feels like there's something
moving inside!

217
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,629
-Huh?
-Pika...

218
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,302
[all gasping]

219
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,604
-It's starting to crack!
-Yeah, it's about to hatch!

220
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,188
Pika!

221
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,066
Hey! Oh, let me see!

222
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,156
[squeals]

223
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,617
Ah!

224
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,079
It hatched! It hatched!
Oh, how cute, heh!

225
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,206
[squeals]

226
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,001
Oh, hello to you too!

227
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,296
[squeals]

228
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh, we're so lucky!

229
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,466
[Brock and Ash]
We are!

230
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,343
If Pikachu hadn't caught it...

231
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,303
-That precious little Pokémon
might have...

232
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,304
[all gasping]

233
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,724
-We have a battle to finish!
-I almost forgot!

234
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,728
-[Meowth] Let's get them!
-Pikachu, Thunderbolt attack!

235
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,146
Pikachu!

236
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,190
[all screaming]

237
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,568
-See you!
-Later!

238
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,611
Bye!

239
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,573
[trembling] My egg!

240
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,913
Where am I? Hi!

241
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,832
[squealing and chattering]

242
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,710
-It's so cute!
-It sure is, Misty.

243
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,839
-But what kind of Pokémon is it?
-Ah, good question.

244
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:41,052
Hey, now that Dexter's been upgraded,
he'll know the answer!

245
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,888
[Pokédex] <i>Togepi, an egg Pokémon.</i>

246
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,142
<i>Specific information about this Pokémon</i>
<i>is still unavailable.</i>

247
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,729
So, Togepi is your name.
You even sound cute!

248
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,982
-Pika!
-[squealing and chattering]

249
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,484
You think so too, don't you, Pikachu?

250
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,944
Pikachu!

251
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,780
Of course it's cute.
All newborns are cute.

252
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,906
That's right!

253
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,408
[trilling]

254
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,827
[babbling]

255
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,328
[trilling]

256
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,415
So now which one of us
gets to keep Togepi?

257
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,293
I think I should.
I'm the one who incubated the egg.

258
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,546
But I was the one
who found it in the first place.

259
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,589
I just let you watch it for a while!

260
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,174
I mothered it!

261
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,300
-Well...
-Huh?

262
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:25,763
I think I should keep Togepi
because it likes me best, right, Togepi?

263
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
[squealing and chattering]

264
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,435
It's obvious.
Togepi has made the right choice.

265
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,229
No fair! I found it, so it's mine!

266
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,773
Well, maybe you should have
taken better care of it!

267
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,193
-But you never took care of it!
-That's right! I took care of it!

268
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:44,657
Oh, yeah? I took care of it
more than all of you put together!

269
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,783
[all gasp]

270
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,579
That's right. You never saw how much
Meowth cared for that egg.

271
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,749
They were together when they ate.
They were together when they slept.

272
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,877
They even bathed together.
It was touching!

273
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,589
Please, James.
Just hearing it brings tears to my eyes.

274
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,258
I never knew you were so sensitive.

275
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,803
Save your pity.
All I want from you is my Togepi!

276
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,180
[Jessie and James] Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

277
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,349
Team rocket's acting almost human.

278
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,687
All right! The only way to decide this
is with a Pokémon battle!

279
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,439
A Pokémon battle?

280
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,193
That's right. We'll have a tournament,
and whoever wins gets to keep Togepi.

281
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,154
-Are you in, or are you out?
-[Team Rocket whispering]

282
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,615
Count me in!

283
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,243
-So we'll have a six-way tournament.
-Right!

284
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,579
-Wait a minute!
-[Ash] Huh?

285
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,040
These two have no right to participate!

286
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,542
-Hey!
-What do you mean?

287
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:42,382
I hereby testify that neither of you
performed a single act to assist Togepi.

288
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,593
I can't believe you're being so selfish!

289
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,178
What about Team Rocket?

290
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,347
Then just the four of us will battle!

291
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,140
Sounds good to me.

292
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,353
Let's make it a sudden death battle
by using just one Pokémon each.

293
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,979
-[Brock] Okay!
-[Misty] Let's do it!

294
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,314
[Meowth] Fine with me!

295
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,401
Now, let's see.
Which Pokémon should I use?

296
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:05,613
I forgot!
I don't have any Pokémon to battle with!

297
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,574
Hey, guys, could I borrow
one of your Pokémon?

298
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,826
[both] Not a chance.

299
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,870
Agh! What am I going to do now? Huh?

300
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:19,293
Uh. Oh, yeah, I forgot! I am a Pokémon!
I can battle for myself!

301
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,422
First up is Brock versus Meowth.

302
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,926
[both growling]

303
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:32,348
-Go, Onyx!
-Go, Meowth!

304
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,683
Argh!

305
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,185
[screaming and grunting]

306
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,357
Meowth! Give them your Scratch attack!
Unh. Okay! Here goes!

307
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,446
-Being your own trainer must be tough.
-Must be.

308
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,655
Meowth!

309
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,657
Meowth isn't doing all that badly.

310
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,868
I didn't know Meowth was so spunky.

311
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,705
Your scratch attack can't do anything
against Onyx's hard stone body.

312
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,957
Onyx! Rock Throw now!

313
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,546
-[growls]
-Ah!

314
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,425
What's wrong, Meowth? Hang in there!

315
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,552
But Meowths scratch and bite attacks

316
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,638
aren't any good against
that giant rock Pokémon!

317
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,392
-[squealing and chattering]
-[Pikachu] Pika, pika, pika!

318
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:21,063
I'll do it for Togepi!
Meowth refuses to lose!

319
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,316
Huh? That's it!

320
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,944
Onyx is weak against water!

321
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,363
What do you say, Meowth?
Do you surrender?

322
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,116
Meowth never says die!

323
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,620
The absolute victory drench
with water attack!

324
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
[Onyx bellows]

325
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,707
[all gasping]

326
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,335
Fury swipes attack!

327
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,634
Onyx! Are you okay?

328
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,844
Hey, throwing water is cheating!

329
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,598
I am merely a parent
fighting for its child!

330
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,850
And I'm going to win this tournament!

331
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,186
-Well, well...
-Meowth won.

332
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,688
[Brock] Next up is Ash and Misty.

333
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:07,652
-Our first battle since Cerulean Gym!
-This time I'm going to beat you!

334
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,864
Bulbasaur, I choose you!

335
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,324
Bulbasaur!

336
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,994
Ah, yes, just as I expected.
You chose Bulbasaur!

337
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,081
-So I'll choose...
-Psy-ay!

338
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,791
[screams]

339
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,210

Okay, aim for Psyducks head,
Bulbasaur!

343

Its head? Yeah, like I'm that dense!

344

-Bulbasaur, go lick Psyduck on the head!
-Bulbasaur!

[grunting and groaning]

346

No, Bulbasaur!
You'll never lick Psyduck if you lick it.

347
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,277
Good! Now, use the Tickle attack!

348

-[Pikachu] Pika!

356

and all we went through together.

363
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,493
For your sake, Togepi,
I, Meowth, will win you back!

364
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,913
All right! Victory will be mine!

365
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,875
Use your Fury Swipes attack! Right!

366
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,462

-[Meowth grunting]
-[Pikachu] Chu!

368
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,385
I lost so fast, I'm a little shocked!

369
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,971
-The winner!
-We did it!

370
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,892

-The heroes always get the breaks.

Good-bye now.

Uh, what's wrong?

377
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,161
Togepi, hey... It's no good.

378
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,622
I told you, but you didn't
want to believe me.

to anyone else but me now.
