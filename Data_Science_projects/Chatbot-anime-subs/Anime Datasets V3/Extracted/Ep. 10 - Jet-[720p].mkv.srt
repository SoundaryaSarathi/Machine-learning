1
00:00:02,817 --> 00:00:05,190
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,067
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:09,177
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,468
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:15,669
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,751
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,066
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,225
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:31,390
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:33,232
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,439
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,171
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,797
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,514
Where's Momo?

15
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,322
Hang on Momo!

16
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:41,000
All right... you too.

17
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:44,350
This is gonna take forever.

18
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,073
That works...

19
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,994
These are Fire Nation traps... you can tell from the metalwork.

20
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,135
We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.

21
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,390
Ah-ah... no flying this time.

22
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:02,173
What?

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,355
Why wouldn't we fly?

24
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,753
Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

25
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,454
It's because they spot Appa... he's just too noticeable.

26
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,833
What! Appa's not too noticeable!

27
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:17,569
He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head... it's kinda hard to miss him!

28
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,142
Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.

29
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,162
I know you all want to fly,...

30
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:24,406
...but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.

31
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,126
Who made you the boss?

32
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:27,963
I'm not the boss... I'm the leader.

33
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:32,295
You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!

34
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:36,029
I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. So... I'm the leader!

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,034
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.

36
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:43,731
Are you kidding... he's just a goofy kid!

37
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:44,381
He's right.

38
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,550
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader?

39
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:50,421
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.

40
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:53,046
I-I've kissed a girl... you... just haven't met her.

41
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,703
Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.

42
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:58,480
No... besides Gran-gran.

43
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,834
Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot...

44
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,079
...and a leader has to trust his instincts.

45
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,671
Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.

46
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,090
Who knows... walking might be fun.

47
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,657
Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?

48
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,134
I don't know Aang.

49
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,785
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts... they seem to know everything.

50
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:21,130
Haha. Very funny.

51
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,266
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,447
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!

53
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:31,270
That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind...

54
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,764
Okay, okay... I get it.

55
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:34,526
Look guys, I'm tired too.

56
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:39,993
But the important thing is that we're safe from... the... Fire... Nation...

57
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,743
Run!

58
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,432
We're cut off!

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,157
Sokka, your shirt!

60
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,679
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.

61
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,409
What are you doing?

62
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,854
Bluffing?

63
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,790
You? Promise not to hurt us?

64
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:13,623
Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?

65
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,923
Uh... instinct?

66
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,213
Look!

67
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,254
Down you go.

68
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,722
They're in the trees!

69
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,886
Hey, he was mine!

70
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,309
Gotta be quicker next time.

71
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,208
Man!

72
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,399
Hey.

73
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,257
Hi.

74
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,604
You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!

75
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:45,006
Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!

76
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,667
My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters.

77
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:53,674
Sneers... Longshot... Smellerbee... The Duke and Pipsqueak.

78
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:57,842
Pipsqueak... that's a funny name.

79
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,177
You think my name is funny?

80
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,271
It's hilarious.

81
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,642
Um... thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.

82
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:27,799
I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning...

83
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:31,108
...we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.

84
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:33,202
We were relying on instincts.

85
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:37,195
You'll get yourself killed doing that.

86
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:43,011
Hey Jet... these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.

87
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:44,730
That's a great score.

88
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,658
And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!

89
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,734
Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.

90
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,762
We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.

91
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,383
You guys have a hideout?

92
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:55,090
You wanna see it?

93
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,865
Yes we wanna see it!

94
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,043
We're here.

95
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:03,733
Where... there's nothing here?!

96
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:04,762
Hold this.

97
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,458
Why... what's this do?

98
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:09,245
Aang?

99
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,002
I'll get up on my own.

100
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:17,666
Grab hold of me Katara.

101
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,706
Nice place you got!

102
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:39,532
It's beautiful up here!

103
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,197
It's beautiful... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.

104
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:46,090
They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?

105
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,200
It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,266
Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?

107
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:52,964
I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble.

108
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:56,482
See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.

109
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:59,572
We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines,...

110
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:02,356
...and doing anything we can to mess with 'em.

111
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:06,368
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.

112
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,147
That's so brave.

113
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,992
Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse.

114
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,044
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

115
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,561
No problem. He probably had a rough day.

116
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:17,313
So, you all live here?

117
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,651
That's right. Longshot over there?

118
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,025
His town got burned down by the fire Nation.

119
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:26,782
And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.

120
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,233
What about you?

121
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:32,385
Fire Nation killed my parents.

122
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,481
I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.

123
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,709
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.

124
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,138
I'm so sorry, Katara.

125
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:58,051
Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.

126
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,515
I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face,...

127
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:08,490
...when the Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.

128
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,232
Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids...

129
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:20,669
...hiding in the trees. Maybe they're right.

130
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:27,397
Or maybe... they are dead wrong!

131
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,071
Hey Jet, nice speech.

132
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:36,736
Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang.

133
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,985
That was some great bending I saw out there today.

134
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:43,781
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training.

135
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:47,114
Avatar huh? Very nice.

136
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,565
Thanks Jet.

137
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:51,230
So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.

138
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,056
Unfortunately we have to leave tonight.

139
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,931
Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.

140
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,879
What mission?

141
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,082
What are you doing?

142
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,900
Shh~ it amplifies vibrations.

143
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,238
Good trick.

144
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:23,380
Nothing yet. Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.

145
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,365
How many?

146
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,270
I think there's just one.

147
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,693
Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

148
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:38,350
Wait! False alarm... he's just an old man.

149
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:44,559
What are you doing in our woods, you leech?

150
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:48,596
Please sir, I'm just a traveler.

151
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,719
Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!

152
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,649
Oh... please let me go... have mercy...

153
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:11,002
Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!

154
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,998
Jet, he's just an old man!

155
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,870
He's Fire Nation! Search him!

156
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,506
But he's not hurting anyone!

157
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,921
Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!

158
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:22,639
We've got his stuff, Jet.

159
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,396
This doesn't feel right.

160
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:28,169
It's what has to be done... now let's get outta here.

161
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,880
Come on Sokka!

162
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:41,815
Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!

163
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:49,284
Ow! Quit it!

164
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,408
Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?

165
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,590
Yeah... he's back. But we're leaving.

166
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:54,465
What?

167
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,964
But I made him this hat.

168
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:58,938
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

169
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:01,305
What? No, he's not.

170
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:02,896
He's messed up Katara.

171
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:07,472
He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life... a really fun way of life.

172
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:10,727
He beat and robbed a harmless old man!

173
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,846
I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.

174
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:14,647
Sokka...

175
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,069
...you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?

176
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,928
No, he conveniently left that part out.

177
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:24,545
Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian.

178
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:27,481
He was an assassin, Sokka.

179
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,675
See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife.

180
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:35,373
He was sent to eliminate me... you helped save my life, Sokka.

181
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,517
I knew there was an explanation.

182
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,175
I didn't see any knife!

183
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,183
That's because he was concealing it.

184
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:44,820
See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.

185
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:50,209
There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things.

186
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:53,281
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.

187
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:54,446
What can we do?

188
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,095
The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest.

189
00:12:57,171 --> 00:13:00,890
If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires.

190
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:06,180
But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.

191
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:11,815
We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!

192
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,546
I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.

193
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,172
You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!

194
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:23,443
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct...

195
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,973
Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet.

196
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,441
Come on Aang.

197
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,966
Sorry Sokka.

198
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,875
Let's go.

199
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:07,922
Now listen... you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal.

200
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,970
If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.

201
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,208
But what about the people in the town... won't they get wiped out too?

202
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,879
Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation.

203
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:25,128
Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal... got it?

204
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,258
Where do you think you're going, ponytail?

205
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,682
Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.

206
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,290
I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

207
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:44,022
Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.

208
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:47,562
There are people living there Jet... mothers and fathers and children.

209
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,410
We can't win without making some sacrifices.

210
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,969
You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!

211
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,807
Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.

212
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:01,664
I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.

213
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:07,811
I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.

214
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,624
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. Take him for a walk... a long walk.

215
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,403
You can't do this!

216
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:21,546
Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.

217
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,600
Jet... I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.

218
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,246
No worries... he already apologized.

219
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,989
Really? Sokka apologized?

220
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:34,597
Yeah... I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.

221
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:35,782
Yeah, I did.

222
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,711
I guess something you said got through to him.

223
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,341
Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

224
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:46,392
I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.

225
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,822
All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents.

226
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,686
I need you guys to help it along.

227
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:57,229
I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know.

228
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,881
Katara. You can do this.

229
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,388
What about me?

230
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,338
I know the Avatar can do this.

231
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,595
Yes! Good job!

232
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,678
This river empties into the reservoir... a few more geysers and it'll be full.

233
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,931
Look, there's another steam vent.

234
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:38,919
Okay. You two keep it up... I'll go check on things at the reservoir.

235
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,783
When we're done we'll meet you over there.

236
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:47,371
Actually... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.

237
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:58,120
I bet that's enough... and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.

238
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,169
Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.

239
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:02,542
I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.

240
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:08,392
Well, we finished early... I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

241
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,953
Come on... move along!

242
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:14,671
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?

243
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:17,349
Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader.

244
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:23,410
We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.

245
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,971
If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.

246
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,408
Hey!

247
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:38,486
While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work.

248
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:45,361
Hey Smellerbee... you gonna eat your leechee nuts?

249
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,369
What are they doing?

250
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,312
Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.

251
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:56,981
Why would they need blasting jelly?

252
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,216
Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.

253
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:03,881
What? No... that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.

254
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,815
I've gotta stop him.

255
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:09,605
Jet wouldn't do that.

256
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,535
Yes I would.

257
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,861
Jet... why?

258
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:15,956
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think.

259
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,736
Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother...

260
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,511
...we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.

261
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:23,271
This isn't the answer!

262
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,967
I want you to understand me Katara.

263
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,413
I thought your brother would understand, but...

264
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,418
Where's Sokka?

265
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,140
Katara.

266
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,904
I need to get to the dam.

267
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,825
You're not going anywhere without your glider.

268
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:48,082
I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.

269
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,859
You'll have to if you want your glider back.

270
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:38,971
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me... you're sick and I trusted you!

271
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,162
What are you doing?

272
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,346
You're too late.

273
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,053
No!

274
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:55,479
Sokka's still out there... he's our only chance.

275
00:20:55,567 --> 00:21:02,016
Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.

276
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:09,739
No...

277
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,071
Sokka didn't make it in time.

278
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,141
All those people... Jet... you monster!

279
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:36,969
This was a victory, Katara. Remember that.

280
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,972
The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.

281
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:43,852
It will be safe... without you.

282
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,049
Sokka!

283
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,763
I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.

284
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:48,562
What!

285
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:52,696
At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy.

286
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:56,417
But one man vouched for me... the old man you attacked.

287
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:02,299
He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.

288
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:07,342
Missus Pretty!

289
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,394
Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!

290
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:13,132
Who would be free... everyone would be dead.

291
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:14,266
You traitor!

292
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:18,499
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.

293
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,255
Katara. Please... help me.

294
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,582
Goodbye Jet.

295
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,026
Yip yip.

296
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:32,995
We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?

297
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:35,758
Lemme guess... your instincts told you.

298
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:37,747
Hey... sometimes they're right.

299
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:41,545
Um... Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?

300
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:44,381
And sometimes they're wrong.
