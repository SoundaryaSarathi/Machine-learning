1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:03,823
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:05,701
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,814
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,110
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:14,319
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,404
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:22,726
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,893
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:30,061
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:31,903
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,114
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,854
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:41,480
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,853
So travelers, the next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking,...

15
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:06,970
...take a closer look, it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man!

16
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:11,564
A member of a secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity...

17
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:16,210
...and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!

18
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,070
Aren't airbender stories the best?

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,865
Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?

20
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:26,144
I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,033
Jingle, jingle!

22
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:33,910
Sorry!

23
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,153
Aww. Cheapskates!

24
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:38,205
Hey thanks for the story!

25
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:41,196
Tell it to the cap, boy!

26
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,145
Much obliged little bat thing!

27
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,487
It means a lot to hear airbender stories.

28
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,826
It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.

29
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:59,315
What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the air walkers last week!

30
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,700
Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple!

31
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,161
This is where they had the
championships for sky bison polo.

32
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:15,680
Do you think we'll really find airbenders?

33
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:17,809
You want me to be like you, or totally honest?

34
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,239
Are you saying I'm a liar?

35
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,386
I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.

36
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,742
Hey guys, look at this!

37
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:36,313
Huh! They really are airbenders!

38
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:37,909
No, they're not.

39
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,941
What do you mean they're not? Those guys are flying!

40
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:44,532
Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move.

41
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:49,183
They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.

42
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:57,836
I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited!

43
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:12,773
We better find some solid ground before it finds us!

44
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:25,529
Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!

45
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,300
Hey there! You're pretty good.

46
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:46,462
Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!

47
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,974
Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...

48
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:28,774
What do you think?

49
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,574
It's great.

50
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:50,860
Hey! You're a real airbender! You must be the Avatar!

51
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,782
That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.

52
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:55,503
Thanks.

53
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:58,082
Wow! This glider chair is incredible!

54
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:03,596
If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.

55
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,637
Yeh, my Dad is the mastermind behind this whole place!

56
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,391
Everything's powered by hot air.

57
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,699
It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift when we're gliding.

58
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,476
This place is unbelievable.

59
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:38,278
Yeh, it's great isn't it?

60
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,569
No, just unbelievable.

61
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:43,129
Aang used to come here a long time ago.

62
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,096
I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.

63
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,379
So better!

64
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:57,200
This is supposed to be the history of my people.

65
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:15,617
I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.

66
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:23,222
It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.

67
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,225
Look out!

68
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:37,253
What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites?

69
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,004
We have to make room for the bathhouse!

70
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,491
Do you know what you did? You just destroyed something sacred!

71
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,274
For a stupid bathhouse!

72
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:48,105
Well, people around here are starting to stink.

73
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,264
This whole place stinks!

74
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:02,708
This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way.

75
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,773
I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.

76
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,211
The monks? But you're twelve!

77
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,544
Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.

78
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,883
What are you doing? Who said you could be here?

79
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:22,894
Hmmm... doing here... A long time ago, but not a hundred years,...

80
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,929
...my people became refugees after a terrible flood.

81
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:33,374
My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.

82
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,550
I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,030
Couldn't believe it! Everywhere pictures of flying people.

84
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:47,892
But empty! Nobody home! Then I came across these fan like contraptions!

85
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,675
Our gliders.

86
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:53,058
Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea.

87
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,406
Build a new life for my son, in the air!

88
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:01,559
Then everyone would be on equal ground, so to speak!

89
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:06,448
We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here and after all,...

90
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,388
...isn't that what nature does?

91
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,197
Nature knows where to stop.

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,935
I suppose that's true.

93
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:18,229
Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.

94
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,656
Look at the time!

95
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:25,034
Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.

96
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:29,006
Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.

97
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,855
The candle will tell us. Watch.

98
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,761
You put spark powder in the candle!

99
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:43,051
Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle!

100
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,271
If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife sharpener!

101
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,617
Only took me three tries to get it right!

102
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:54,154
Follow me!

103
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:57,341
Hey Aang, I want to show you something.

104
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,935
I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.

105
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,353
I don't know about that.

106
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:05,190
The Temple might be different, but the creatures that live here...

107
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:09,218
...are probably direct descendents of the ones that lived here a long time ago.

108
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:14,194
You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.

109
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:18,954
Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.

110
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,752
Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.

111
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:25,772
Only an airbender can open it... so inside it's completely untouched,...

112
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:30,637
...just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.

113
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,254
Aang?

114
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:35,635
I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was.

115
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,190
I want it to stay that way.

116
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,182
I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.

117
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,901
Thanks.

118
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:52,778
These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.

119
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:55,362
Why would you want to use fireflies for light?

120
00:09:55,432 --> 00:10:03,100
Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.

121
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:11,606
Cover your nose and hold your breath.

122
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:15,950
Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.

123
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:16,836
Wrong.

124
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,387
It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here.

125
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:25,479
Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time.

126
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:29,353
Nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky high.

127
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,019
Thought my eyebrows would never grow back!

128
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:35,804
Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving.

129
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:41,716
From time to time we have gas leaks and they're nearly impossible to find.

130
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,548
So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?

131
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:51,717
Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.

132
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,725
The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you...

133
00:10:54,782 --> 00:11:00,553
...something even lighter than air, and that something takes over when you fly.

134
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:05,146
I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.

135
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,343
Impossible! Everybody has it.

136
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,455
Spirit.

137
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,744
What?

138
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,589
That's the something you're talking about.

139
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,579
Yeh, I suppose it is.

140
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:16,272
Are you ready?

141
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,364
No!

142
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,568
I can't believe I'm flying!

143
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:34,146
Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!

144
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:40,277
Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.

145
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:45,914
Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.

146
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:51,068
I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room,...

147
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,205
...I'd be happy to open the door for you.

148
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,228
Great!

149
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:57,242
Wait! How do I land this thing?

150
00:11:57,298 --> 00:12:05,677
What if I land... eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!

151
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:12,249
I said don't touch anything!

152
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:19,226
Oh, don't worry, that experiments old and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.

153
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:22,180
Ugh! Week old egg smell!

154
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,158
Quick! Find that egg!

155
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:29,869
I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside.

156
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:45,667
How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!

157
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:48,471
That's the solution to our problem!

158
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:49,552
Yeh!

159
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:53,595
If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...

160
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,636
The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...

161
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:57,908
Then, if there's a leak...

162
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,831
You smell rotten eggs!

163
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,904
Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...

164
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:06,564
And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!

165
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,050
You're a genius!

166
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,565
Something's wrong I've got to go.

167
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,552
This is a nightmare.

168
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,902
You don't understand.

169
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:33,275
You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!

170
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:43,958
You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?

171
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:47,114
Explain all this! Now!

172
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:53,521
It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement.

173
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,285
You were too young to remember this tale.

174
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:59,684
They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground.

175
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:05,684
I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer.

176
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:12,573
I offered... my services. You must understand, I did this for you!

177
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,058
When are they coming?

178
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:27,304
Soon. Very soon.

179
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,803
You can't give them more weapons.

180
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:34,533
If I don't give them what they want they will destroy this place.

181
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:40,341
How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?

182
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,963
I need some time to think.

183
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,279
You need to leave! Go!

184
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,264
We're not leaving!

185
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,887
Then hide, quickly!

186
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,905
You know better than to keep me waiting.

187
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,987
Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.

188
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:02,473
Well? Is there a problem?

189
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:05,577
No, right this way.

190
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,515
The deal's off!

191
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,053
The Avatar!

192
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,776
Aang, don't get involved!

193
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:16,911
If I don't get what I came for the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!

194
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,921
Get out of here!

195
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:21,552
You're leaving empty handed!

196
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:26,375
Then the destruction of this temple will be on your head.

197
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,456
This is bad! Very bad!

198
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:41,414
Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?

199
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,395
I'll tell ya how. We have something they don't.

200
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,267
Air power! We control the sky.

201
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:51,126
That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!

202
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,537
I want to help.

203
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:57,049
Good, we'll need it.

204
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,217
We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka.

205
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,777
This boy's a genius!

206
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,907
Thank you. You're a genius!

207
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,558
Thank you!

208
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:09,880
See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne,...

209
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,498
...but once you did, it just kept going.

210
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,810
You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.

211
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,963
So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?

212
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:23,069
Ugh, if only we knew.

213
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:29,190
A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.

214
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,966
Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.

215
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:36,815
Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...

216
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,893
...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!

217
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,607
They're coming!

218
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:49,849
Are we ready?

219
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:52,844
Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?

220
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,295
We'll have to start without him.

221
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,572
Take them out of the sky, now!

222
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:06,090
We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!

223
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,600
Those things are unstoppable!

224
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,511
I think I know how they work.

225
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:45,735
I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system.

226
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,782
Something to do with water. Works great, huh?

227
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,344
Water? Can you get me close to one?

228
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:53,357
No problem!

229
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,969
We're out of bombs!

230
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:39,710
Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?

231
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:50,252
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

232
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:53,425
The insignia! They think we're on their side!

233
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,559
Then I guess they won't see this coming.

234
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,539
Bomb away!

235
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,569
Oh no! That was the last one!

236
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:11,234
Wait a second, you smell that?

237
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,628
Rotten eggs!

238
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,522
There! That's where the gas is escaping!

239
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,388
What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!

240
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:27,358
It's the only bomb we've got!

241
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,198
Look! They're retreating!

242
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,839
Yeh!!!

243
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,253
We're going down!

244
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:55,484
No! Sokka! Hold on!

245
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,534
Get ready!

246
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:16,299
You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now.

247
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:20,123
It's like the hermit crab, maybe you weren't born here,...

248
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,145
...but you found this empty shell and made it your home.

249
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,081
And now you protect each other.

250
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,944
That means a lot coming from you.

251
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,182
Aang, you were right about air power.

252
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:35,309
As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!

253
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:54,699
This defeat is the gateway to many victories.
