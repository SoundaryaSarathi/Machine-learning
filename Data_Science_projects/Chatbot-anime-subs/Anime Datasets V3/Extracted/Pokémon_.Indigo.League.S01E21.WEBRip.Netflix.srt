So this is the way to Saffron City,
huh, Misty?

18
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,851
I knew we shouldn't have listened to you.
Now we'll never get out of here.

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,646
As if. Your sense of direction's so bad,
you can't find yourself in a mirror.

20
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,898
-You crack mirrors.
-You big baby.

21
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,276
That's enough, guys.
You two don't want to stand here

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,736
and insult each other like this.

23
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,903
[both] Yes, we do.

00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,239

Where'd she run off to?

Beats me,

Winners?
There's something real fishy about this.

51
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,326
Why should we win something
just for walking into town?

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,036
There's a simple explanation.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,205
It just so happens
that you're the millionth,

Fool. It's Telekinesis.

152
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,794
You can't control a psychic-type Pokémon
without using Telekinetic powers.

153
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,046
Hmm, that's what you think.

154
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,926
Telekinesis is okay, but I have my own
secret method for bending spoons.

[All] Huh?

165
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,037

than a Pokémon gym.

00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,014
It's the little girl
who brought back Pikachu.

173
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,310
[grunts]

174
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:25,106
Forgive me, great one. It's not my place
to decide whom you battle.

175
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,902
[yelling]

176
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,528
[all scream]

177
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,198
I told you there was something
really strange about her.

178
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,743
-Right, but who is she?
-Are you really Sabrina?

179
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,704
[giggling]

180
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,416
Sabrina, I demand an official match
to compete for a Marsh Badge.

181
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,377
Mm-hmm.
I'd like to have a match.

182
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,796
Well, that was easy.

183
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,173
-[Sabrina] But if you lose...
-[all] Huh?

184
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,635
...you have to be my friends
and let me play with you.

185
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,680
Uh, be your friends? Uh, okay, you bet.

186
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,766
You both got to have
a little more faith in me.

187
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,102
Even if she does have
some Telekinetic powers,

188
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,229
she's still only a little girl.

189
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,148
Ah, just don't let your guard down, Ash.

190
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,191
[Ash] Huh?

191
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,950
So now, time for us to play.

192
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,743
[all gasp]

193
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,211
So you are really Sabrina, The Gym Leader.

194
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,427
One-on-one. An all-out match.
Agreed?

195
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,679
Agreed.

196
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,223
Come now, Abra.

197
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
Go get him, Pikachu.

198
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:51,985
Pikachu!

199
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,905
[snores]

200
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,365
Pi?

201
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:03,288
Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi.

202
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,707
Pika. Pi. Pikachu.

203
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,377
I don't get it. Nobody sends
a sleeping Pokémon into a match.

204
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,421
Maybe she's making fun of me.

205
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,383
[Pokédex]
<i>Abra, a psychic power Pokémon.</i>

206
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,762
<i>It sleeps 18 hours a day but employs</i>
<i>telekinesis even while sleeping.</i>

207
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,223
-Telekinesis?
-Be careful.

208
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,726
No problem. Pikachu, Thunder Shock!

209
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,269
Pi!

210
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:32,692
Pikaaaaaaa-chu!

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,031
Pi? Pika?

212
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,990
Pika!

213
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,949
[all] Whoa!

214
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,075
It teleported itself.

215
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,161
Childish fools.

216
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,588
-Kadabra.
-Cha!

217
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,173
What's that?

218
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,759
[Pokédex]
<i>Kadabra, a psychic Pokémon.</i>

219
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,344
<i>The evolved form of Abra.</i>

220
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,138
<i>Employs powerful telekinetic attacks.</i>

221
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,767
That isn't fair.
I thought this was one-on-one.

222
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,603
But evolving during a match
isn't against any rules.

223
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,980
Be careful.
Kadabra is really powerful.

224
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,982
This time,
you won't get away from Pikachu.

225
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,444
It's against the rules to leave a stadium,
even by teleportation.

226
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,572
Pikachu, fill up
this whole stadium with lightning.

227
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,783
Hit them with your best shock.

228
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:27,664
Pika... chu!

229
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,340
-Kadabra.
-Pi?

230
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,550
-Now what?
-Confusion.

231
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,766
[groaning and screaming]

232
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,312
-Pikachu!
-Psychic attack.

233
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,817
-[groans]
-Kadabra.

234
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,614
That's right, Pikachu, don't give up.

235
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,119
Pika. Pikachu. Pika.

236
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,163
Heh, look at that.
Pikachu feels like dancing.

237
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,751
That's no dance. Kadabra's using its
psychic powers to control Pikachu's body.

238
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,879
-Huh?
-Pika, Pikachu.

239
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,339
-Kadabra.
-[groans]

240
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,049
Pikachu!

00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,760
[groaning]

242
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,642
-Oh, Pikachu!
-Cha! [groans]

243
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:34,022
[angry grunt] That's it. Stop the match!

244
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:34,981
[gasps]

245
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,900
Pikachu. Are you all right?

246
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,652
[whimpers]

247
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,364
-I forfeit.
-Be my friends.

248
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,908
You promised I could play with you.

249
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,870
[all] Huh?

250
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,041
[all grunt]

251
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,209
Now where are we?

252
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,462
Ah, looks like
we've been teleported again.

253
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,089
Sabrina must've teleported us
from the Pokémon Gym.

254
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,216
This place is empty.

255
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,721
-I'll take a look around.
-We'll come with you, Ash.

256
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,056
[grunts]

257
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,224
Is anybody home?

258
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,728
Please, can somebody help us?

259
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,315
Hey.

260
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,526
-That cake looks delicious.
-Ah!

261
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,155
Sabrina wanted to play with us but I guess
we're going to have lunch first.

262
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,281
I wonder where she is.

263
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,118
Guess it's rude not to wait for her
but I can't resist.

264
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,332
-Ah! This stupid cake is fake!
-Huh?

265
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,293
Now what's in here? Oh!

266
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,256
Oh, I'm very sorry. I really didn't think
that anybody was home. I just...

267
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,883
-Huh?
-Pika, Pikachu.

268
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,343
Hmm?

269
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,932
Huh? Something's not right here.

270
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,519
That thing is a doll.

271
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,731
Ash, you're not going to believe this,
but we're inside a doll house.

272
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,982
This is a doll house?

273
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,361
Everything in here is made out
of plastic, including the food.

274
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,570
How can that be?

275
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,449
[rattling]
[clamoring]

00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,868
[giggling]

277
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,079
Now I can play with you all.

278
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,998
Wow, she's pretty tall for a little girl.

279
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,543
Actually, I think we're the ones
who got a lot smaller.

280
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:23,506
[giggling]

281
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,550
Run for it.

282
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,720
How can we get away from her?

283
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,681
The houses, the streets,
they're all her toys.

284
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,059
-That means we're...
-That means we're trapped!

285
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,394
Trapped inside her toy box.

286
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,604
Must have shrunk us with telekinesis.

287
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,316
So when she said she wanted
to play with us, she really meant it.

288
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,238
[giggling]

289
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,917
[all panting]

290
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,921
-[all] Huh?
-It's a dead end.

291
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,339
What's that?

292
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,093
[all gasp]
[girl giggles]

293
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,804
-She's coming this way.
-Uh-oh.

294
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,639
We're going to have a ball.

295
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,981
I want to play catch.

296
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,237
We're going to get squashed.

297
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,948
[giggles]

298
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,533
[all scream]

299
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,952
Listen. Let your minds rely on mine.

300
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,163
Teleportation.

301
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,216
That was fun.
Let's play again sometime.

302
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,467
[giggling]

303
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,184
[all groan]

304
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,228
-Now what?
-This is a real place.

305
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,687
Ha, we made it.

306
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,525
-[Misty] There's that guy.
-Thanks for the help.

307
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,360
But why did you decide to rescue us?

308
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,112
Sabrina is a dangerous Pokémon trainer.

309
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,991
I got the chance to help you this time,
but next time, you won't be so lucky.

310
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,619
You'll all be trapped in her toy box
for eternity.

311
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,662
[all] Huh?

312
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,790
Give up your crazy idea
of challenging Sabrina.

313
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,584
Leave Saffron City
and never come back here.

314
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,671
I can't do that. I have to win
Sabrina's Marsh Badge

315
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,131
so I'll be able to get into
the Pokémon League.

316
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,094
You will never be able to defeat
Sabrina and her psychic Pokémon.

317
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,347
Yes, I will. We just need to make
a quicker attack

318
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,141
before she can kick in
with her psychic powers.

319
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,019
Hmm?

320
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,272
[all yell]

321
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,734
-Ash what do you think you're doing?
-It's not me. My body's moving by itself.

322
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:54,198
Heh, if you can't beat me,
you haven't got a chance against Sabrina.

323
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:58,160
What do you mean?
Can you use telekinesis too?

324
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,163
Please teach me how to use
psychic powers.

325
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,250
Argh! Ugh.

326
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,127
[both] Whoa!

327
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,547
You usually have to be born
with telekinetic powers.

328
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,842
-You can't just learn them.
-Please wait.

329
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,553
Just forget about it, Ash.

330
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,806
You haven't got a chance
against telekinesis.

331
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,017
I may not have telekinesis

332
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,811
but I've still got the guts
to take on Sabrina again.

333
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,399
Whoa!

334
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,486
Wise up, kid. Not even I have
the powers to defeat Sabrina.

335
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,116
Guts don't count in this contest.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

336
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,327
-Don't, Ash.
-Better call it quits, Ash.

337
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,412
[grunting]

338
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:49,670
[groaning]

339
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,591
-Ash, give it up.
-Please.

340
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,885
I need your help.

341
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:01,432
I've got to defeat Sabrina
for the Marsh Badge. I have to.

342
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,476
You've got to help me beat her.

343
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,437
Please show me how. Ugh.

344
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,441
Well, that's one determined kid. Hmm.

345
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,777
[panting]

346
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,529
There just may be one way
you can defeat her.

347
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,489
Huh?

348
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,076
Only one other type of Pokémon
can battle the psychic type.

349
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,162
If you capture a ghost Pokémon
from Lavender Town,

350
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,372
you might have a chance.

351
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:28,751
A ghost Pokémon from Lavender Town.
Thank you.

352
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,127
Hm. [groans]

353
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,090
-Ash. Hey, Ash.
-Ash!

354
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
Uh, are you okay?

355
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,803
You haven't got a chance
against a psychic Pokémon.

356
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,764
Ha. Let's go. On to Lavender Town.

357
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,229
With some luck, that kid may be
the one who can rescue Sabrina.

358
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,067
[narrator]
<i>Who is this mysterious bearded man?</i>

359
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,237
<i>And what's the secret</i>
<i>of the Pokémon trainer Sabrina?</i>

360
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,241
<i>Will Ash have what it takes to capture</i>
<i>a ghost Pokémon in Lavender Town?</i>

361
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:05,329
<i>Only the future will tell us and that's</i>
<i>exactly where our heroes are headed.</i>

362
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,708
[grunts] Still can't move a muscle, huh?

363
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,128
-We're paralyzed.
-Now I know how a statue feels.

364
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,339
Meowth.
This is getting to be a real drag.

365
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,801
[Jessie]
Maybe we should call the psychic hotline.

00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,931
