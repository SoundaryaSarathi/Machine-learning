72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,690
! </font>No, it's right as "Aevrdasnt Avalon", which seeks to Alofajad beloved</font></font>

. </font>I mean, that you and I share the same Alrvh</font></font>

98
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,810
. </font>No, nothing wrong</font></font>

99
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,440
. </font>I mean, I formed friends now</font></font>

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,730
. </font>And strange to have two do not love each other together Micharcan</font></font>

101
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,070
. </font>It would be comfortable for both of us when this ends</font></font>

102
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,780
. </font>A-Yes, I certainly hate after all</font></font>

103
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,290
Huh? </font>Than you are angry?</font></font>

104
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,960
. </font>I am not angry</font></font>

105
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,670
... Listen, Arzogaoa Rico</font></font>

106
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,300
What is there?</font></font>

107
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,720
. </font>This is the message I am sending all now</font></font>

108
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
. </font>Check with them so make sure that it is fine</font></font>

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,220
You have to ask from Kimto-sama this request, is not it?</font></font>

110
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,520
. </font>But this is something I want to make sure of it as you can see</font></font>

111
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,900
. </font>This is really an important message</font></font>

112
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,570
. </font>It has a reason to avoid all yet</font></font>

113
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,660
What do you want me to read?</font></font>

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,870
You are the most popular girl in the classroom, right?</font></font>

115
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,200
. </font>Hate to admit this, Loken this is not for nothing</font></font>

116
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,170
. </font>I think you always know how others feel and what is the right that we have to do</font></font>

117
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,130
... Sometimes I think about little ways you say things</font></font>

118
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,630
. </font>And the way you attract things together really wonderful</font></font>

119
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,970
For this reason I want you to check them probably do not love me</font></font>

120
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,430
! </font>But you are the only person who I asked him this, please</font></font>

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,230
. </font>Okay</font></font>

122
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,810
! </font>Oh really ? </font>Horrible</font></font>

123
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,700
. </font>It's a long</font></font>

124
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
. </font>I used to write letters</font></font>

125
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,120
! </font>It was not complicated</font></font>

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,710
. </font>I continued to read and read, but the primary goal has not become clear never</font></font>

127
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,210
. </font>Long apology at the beginning is not important</font></font>

128
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,670
. </font>In general, all these words to say words Kemeto-sama I can say that</font></font>

129
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,510
. </font>heavy</font></font>

130
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,180
A-Do you think this!?</font></font>

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,600
. </font>Yes, Adjalleha more intensive and informal</font></font>

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,100
... For example, leave the this part, so</font></font>

133
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,900
K-How is this?</font></font>

134
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,190
. </font>"Listen, I have something important to say</font></font>

135
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,950
 There is a reason to avoid you so far</font></font>

136
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,580
I have a tendency to say in all frankness what I think, Do you know this?</font></font>

137
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,040
Because of this, my friends were hurt in the past</font></font>

138
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,710
Because for this avoided talking with others</font></font>

139
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,340
I am afraid to be repeated this again</font></font>

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,930
I really wanted to become a friend Mekn</font></font>

141
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,470
Sorry for all of this from now on, be my friends, okay?</font></font>

142
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,310
- Tancubashi Ica "</font></font>

143
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,020
Such a simple thing better?</font></font>

144
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,770
. </font>This is enough, in fact, still a little bit long</font></font>

145
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,570
Huh?</font></font>

146
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,650
. </font>You do not need a lot of words in the beginning</font></font>

147
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,360
why not ?</font></font>

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,410
I mean, you fend off already become close to their friend, is not it?</font></font>

149
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,450
. </font>Oh, yes, well I have sent</font></font>

156
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,810

157
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,940

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,630
In that case, you should not correct the misunderstanding?</font></font>

288
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,420
. </font>If I liked the cool things</font></font>

289
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
