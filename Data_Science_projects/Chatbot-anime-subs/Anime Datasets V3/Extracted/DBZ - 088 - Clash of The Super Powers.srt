00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,590
"The Two Superpowers Collide! A
Fistfight Where Both Turn Serious!!!"

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,990
Sit tight, Gohan! Your Ma is comin' to
save you right now!

3
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,000
Say there, Chichi-san, won't you
please re-think this?

4
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,000
Planet Namek will be dangerous for you.

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,670
He's right! Let's leave all of
this up to Son-in-law!

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,010
My Bulma-chan is there with him.
It will be fine!

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,350
No! I'm goin'! After all, you can bet
Goku-sa ain't makin' Gohan-chan do
his homework properly!

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,250
Yajirobe!

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,030
I've brung a message from Karin-sama.
'Parently Piccolo got to Namek all right.

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,360
Piccolo!?

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,980
If he hangs around with the likes of him,
Gohan-chan will become a delinquent!

12
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,210
I can't dawdle around any longer!

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,310
Let go of me! Let me go!

14
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,160
The repairs to the spaceship aren't
likely finished yet!

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,330
- That kinda thing takes a lotta time!
- That's right!

16
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,180
Ah, here, everyone's all together!

17
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,360
The third time around, I could handle
it without even looking at the blueprints.

18
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,300
Well, Chichi-san, the repairs on the
spaceship are finished. I can have
you take off any time.

19
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,210
l- Is there something... ?

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,210
There's no other way, is there? We can't
very well let Chichi-san go alone.

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,650
At this point, we all go together...

22
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,330
Listen here! If we all put our efforts
together, we just may be of help to
Goku and the others!

23
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,330
Why d'ya need me too!?

24
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,160
You seem to be much stronger than
I thought. I'm a little surprised.

25
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,230
To think that there was someone in the
world who could reach even higher than
Commander Ginyu...

26
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,330
- But you are still no match for me.
- Maybe not. But we just don't know!

27
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,330
I know!

28
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,010
Right back at you!

29
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,280
He's escaped from my Kiai-Ho!

30
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,310
Damn!

31
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,850
Hurry and come back up! It'll take more
than that to beat you.

32
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,700
That rat has incredible speed as well.
So, now what do I do?

33
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,280
He can't find his opponent by just feeling
out their Ki, the way we can.

34
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,380
He's always used his eyes to locate me.

35
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,220
All right, let's make use of that!

36
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,060
W- What's wrong?
Goku still hasn't come up!

37
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,730
It's okay! Father's Ki hasn't
diminished one bit!

38
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,340
You know, it's been a while since I've
done this. I wonder if Old Man Turtle
Hermit is doing okay.

39
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,850
Ka... me... ha... me...

40
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,350
Ha!

41
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,020
Okay, just like that, just like that!

42
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,280
What's the matter? Not ready yet? And
here I was about to deliver a final blow...

43
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,380
I guess we're just about ready.

44
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,720
All right, here goes!

45
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,390
Off you go!

46
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,890
Here he comes!

47
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,330
That's not him!

48
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,340
And the other!

49
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,170
This way?

50
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,170
No!

51
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,360
Father!

52
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,150
A great success!

53
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,020
Huh? He ain't the least bit affected?

54
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,980
To think that you could do this much.
You're the first one aside from my father
who I've had to dust off after.

55
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:32,590
This might be the first time I've ever been
this excited. How shall I dish this out?

56
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,570
You got me! I thought that would have
at least had some effect on you.

57
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,780
I think I'll torment him a little...

58
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,260
That bastard! This is telekinesis!

59
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,940
Dammit!

60
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,290
Okay, if that's how it is...

61
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,580
You are impudent!

62
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,920
- What is this!?
- It's like a whole island!
An island is floating there!

63
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,580
Goku!

64
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,770
This is the end for sure.

65
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,930
- You've fallen for it!
- Oh, hell!

66
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,620
I... can't... move... !

67
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,950
This serves you right!

68
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,300
When I miss, you're finished!

69
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,540
If I don't somehow find my way out of this... !

70
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,890
We're just about at Game Set! Are
you getting tired of this?

71
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,910
- What!?
- You might die this time, huh?

72
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,310
Gohan!

73
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,650
Ah, Piccolo-san!

74
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,960
- Goku...
- Father...

75
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,800
What kind of guys are these!? Freeza's
just playing around!

76
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,970
If he felt like it, he's got the power to
destroy this whole planet.

77
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,970
And yet, seeing as how we're
all still alive here...

78
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,640
- It means he really is just playing around?
- What a punk he is!

79
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Piccolo-san, what about Father... ?

80
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,660
There's no use worrying! That jerk hasn't
gotten serious yet either!

81
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,490
Look over there!

82
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,610
Father!

83
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:42,790
That was a little too close. I'll have to
be on guard against that attack.

84
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,640
Didn't I tell you earlier? Don't bust other
people's planets up so much!

85
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,650
Goku... But how?

86
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,650
At the moment of the explosion, he
escaped from being bound up in
there at super-speed.

87
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,260
He did something that incredible?
In that instant?

88
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,920
They're freaks! Both of them, dammit!

89
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,270
- You're a persistent one! Even I am
starting to get annoyed.
- So am I.

90
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,610
I think I'll put an end to all this warming up,
and finally get serious about this.

91
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,280
Me too.

92
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,790
A clash of technique against technique!
Explosive power versus power!

93
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,960
However, to Goku and Freeza, is this no
more than simple warming up?

94
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:09,960
