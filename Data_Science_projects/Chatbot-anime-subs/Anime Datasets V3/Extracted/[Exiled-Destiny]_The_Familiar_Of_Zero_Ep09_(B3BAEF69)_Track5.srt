1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,438
I don't want you to go!

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,106
I'm just going to do laundry.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,443
You're lying! You're going to
sneak off and go see another girl.

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,346
I won't see anyone, okay?
I'll be right back!

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,380
Really?

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,348
Really.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,516
Really, for real?

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,351
Really, for real, really!

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,080
So you behave, okay?

10
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,490
Yeah. I'll be lonely,
but I'll be waiting.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,354
Then...

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,683
Saito...

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,629
Hurry back.

14
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,427
Louise...

15
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,878
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:53,377
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,920
The sky where two moons
never fade away

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,994
That's an impossibility, right?

19
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:16,744
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

20
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:22,516
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

21
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:29,012
Even if you trip and
become depressed

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,459
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

23
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:43,504
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

24
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:49,643
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

25
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:55,616
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:04,115
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

27
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,423
Louise's Change of Heart

28
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,902
A love potion?!

29
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,005
It was a slight error
that Louise drank it.

30
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,508
You must have been there
when the effects kicked in.

31
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,643
Montmorency!

32
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,237
Can it be that you were trying
to make me drink it?!

33
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,515
Oh, how touching!

34
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,007
To think you would go that far
to capture my feelings.

35
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,522
It doesn't have to be
you in particular.

36
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,547
Seeing someone is nothing
but a way to pass time.

37
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,821
I just don't like being cheated on!

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,932
There is no way that I would cheat.

39
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,924
I am an eternal servant of love.

40
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,639
Save that for later!

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,266
You have no eye for the mood.

42
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,310
Hey, Mon-Mon!

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,579
My name is Montmorency!

44
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,514
Hurry up and get Louise
back to normal!

45
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,649
The effects will wear off in due time.

46
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,673
When is that?

47
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,719
Maybe a month from now,

48
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,920
or a year from now.

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,946
Wait a minute, you were
planning on making me...

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,057
You've got to be kidding!

51
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,633
Good morning.

52
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,970
Oh, Siesta...

53
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,744
You really were waiting
for another girl!

54
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,045
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,513
No matter how you look at it,
she was just passing by!

56
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,585
I love you so much, yet you...

57
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,254
Saito, you idiot, idiot!

58
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,688
Come on!

59
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,747
Don't cry...

60
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,295
Oh, um, this isn't what it seems to be.
There's a bit of a reason...

61
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,830
What isn't what it seems to be?

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,299
Saito, don't you love me?

63
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,062
No, nobody said such a thing...

64
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,969
My, aren't you popular?

65
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,529
Siesta, I'm telling you, listen to me!

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,743
Hey, Siesta!

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,579
You really love that woman
after all, don't you?

68
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,012
That's not it!

69
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,181
Saito, you idiot!

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,244
Sheesh!

71
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,762
Here we go.

72
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,968
You know, about earlier...

73
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,026
It's all right.

74
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,738
I don't mind at all.

75
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,840
Besides, there was nothing
there to begin with.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,375
In any case, just listen to me.

77
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,741
That's all because of a love potion.

78
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,980
Love potion?

79
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,685
Yeah, apparently she mistakenly
ingested one somehow last night,

80
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,585
and she's been like that ever since.

81
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,857
You don't have to tell such a lie.
I really don't mind.

82
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,848
A lie? It's not a lie...

83
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,625
Even peasants like me know.

84
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,734
Drugs to alter people's emotions
are banned by law.

85
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,928
What was that?!

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,395
I'm sorry, but I'm busy now.

87
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,837
Hey, wait, Siesta!

88
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,110
So that's what it was.

89
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,372
Damn that Mon-Mon...

90
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,882
Louise must be mad.

91
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,652
Welcome back.

92
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,729
What are you doing?

93
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,390
At least put on a pair of panties!

94
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,032
I won't put one on!

95
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:32,930
Why not?

96
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,670
Um... if you'd like,
you can tell me why...

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,772
Because I have no sex appeal.

98
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,708
I know that because I was told
so many times the other day.

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,800
The other day?

100
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,837
Oh, at the Fairy Café...

101
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,752
That's why you keep going
to other girls, Saito.

102
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,787
That's why you won't
do anything to me

103
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,255
even though we're always
in the same room.

104
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,052
Anything?

105
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,830
Does that mean I can do something?

106
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,800
That's off limits!

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,068
Of course...

108
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,470
But if it's a little bit,
I'd look the other way.

109
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,172
If it was for like an hour,

110
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,867
I'd close my eyes and pretend
I didn't know about it.

111
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,069
You say that, but...

112
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,844
Anyway...

113
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,404
Please, put something on, okay?

114
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,456
I was lonely for all this time!

115
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,821
You idiot!

116
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,499
Look, you're acting strange
because of a love potion.

117
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,236
That's not true. It's not
because of a love potion!

118
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,771
When I look at you, Saito,

119
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,365
my heart gets all painful,
and it starts to race...

120
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,015
Saito!

121
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,850
Ouch...

122
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,984
Dammit!

123
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,219
What's wrong?

124
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,278
Don't make faces like that!

125
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,292
You wait here. I'll make sure
to turn you back to normal.

126
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,200
Isn't it all right?

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,569
I think it's a bit better for her
to be smitten over you

128
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,037
than to be scolding you
left and right like before.

129
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,299
Shut up!

130
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,343
I don't need the power
of a love potion.

131
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,913
Am I not always at your side like this?

132
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,905
Isn't it just that there's no other girls
to woo because of summer vacation?

133
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,115
That's not...

134
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,145
Hey, Mon-Mon!

135
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,523
Why don't you knock?!

136
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,426
You still have no manners at all.

137
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,894
Shut up!

138
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,963
Get Louise back to normal, right now!

139
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,798
Didn't I tell you before?

140
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,799
Until the effects wear off...

141
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,169
There's some potion or a way
to undo the magic, isn't there?

142
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,937
It's not that there isn't one,

143
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,072
but you can't do it here.

144
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,040
I don't have the potion
necessary to do it with.

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,342
And where is that?

146
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,078
Saito... Is that how you treat nobility?

147
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,410
Want to have another duel, Guiche?

148
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,884
Well, not really.

149
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,843
It's useless to speak of nobility
and peasants with you, anyway.

150
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,493
Montmorency, for now, I think it's
best if we listened to his orders.

151
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,324
You're so pathetic.

152
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,925
You say that, but even getting
a Spirit Tear is really difficult!

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,930
Would you like to eat
stale bread, Mon-Mon?

154
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,897
I heard somewhere that
making love potions is illegal...

155
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,933
That's...

156
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,113
I guess I'll have to inform
the principal about this.

157
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,115
Oh, all right! I guess
I have no choice!

158
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,481
I'll go there and get it myself soon!

159
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,189
Go get such a rare potion?

160
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,857
I know where it is.

161
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,127
Though whether I can get it
by going there is another matter.

162
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,029
All right, let's go tomorrow.

163
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,291
Tomorrow?

164
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,462
Come to think of it, I think I saw
Mr. Colbert in the lab earlier.

165
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,905
I'll go! You want me
to go, don't you?

166
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,477
So where is that location?

167
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,111
Lake Lagdorian.

168
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:09,138
Water-based mages bind
a pact with the spirit there.

169
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,550
Though I've only been there once,
as a small child.

170
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,425
You just have to sleep
together with me!

171
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,892
If you don't, I'll punish you!

172
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,697
All right, I get it, now sleep!

173
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,665
We're getting up early tomorrow.

174
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,927
Yeah...

175
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,080
I've seen this often enough...

176
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,952
Argh, I can't sleep at all now!

177
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,692
Along the border with Galia?

178
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,394
It'll take half the day to get there.

179
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,663
I didn't ask you to
come with me, did I?

180
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,365
What would your knight be doing

181
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,458
if he didn't go with you
at a time like this?

182
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,236
So sleepy...

183
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,431
Is she really going to be
back to normal?

184
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,151
Lake Lagdorian is up ahead,
past this hill.

185
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:22,019
So we finally get to see Lake
Lagdorian, our destination.

186
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,393
He really is carefree. What
part of him is a knight?

187
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,521
You know, I knitted this
for you yesterday, Saito.

188
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,303
I see... It's a lovely hat.

189
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,538
It's not a hat! It's a sweater!

190
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,996
Oh, I see! You're right...
It's a lovely jellyfish sweater!

191
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,744
Do you like it?

192
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,676
Yeah...

193
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,285
Help me!

194
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,055
What's this? Water up to here?

195
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,158
Is the Water Spirit or
whatever really here?

196
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,427
It looks like the Water Spirit is upset.

197
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,628
Upset?

198
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,630
The water level is unusually high.

199
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,731
Unusually?

200
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,028
Look.

201
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,235
They're all underwater.

202
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,570
When I came here with my father
as a child, it wasn't like this.

203
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,077
Let's wait a little while.

204
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,477
The spirit won't come out
until after the sun sets.

205
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,114
Don't just sit there chatting idly!
Before all that, save me...

206
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,491
All right, Robin... I want to
contact one of my old friends.

207
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,502
Now, this should identify me.

208
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,070
Tell the old Water Spirit that

209
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,268
someone who bid a contract
with it would like to talk to it.

210
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,680
If she can find it,
Robin will bring it to us.

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,581
Will it come?

212
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,605
Who knows...

213
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,684
And the actual person
involved is asleep.

214
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,422
In the past, I came here
with my father,

215
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,557
and bid a contract with the spirit.

216
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,394
If the spirit remembers,
I'm sure it will come.

217
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,294
And after that, we collect a tear...

218
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,199
Do we have to tell
sad stories or something?

219
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,169
Idiot. It's just called a Tear.

220
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,772
We have to have it split off
a tiny portion of its body!

221
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,106
Listen, okay?

222
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,642
If you make the spirit upset,
we can forget the Tear,

223
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,211
and our lives will be in danger too!

224
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,076
You really have to be careful!

225
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,441
Gotcha.

226
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,346
It's here!

227
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,115
This is the Water Spirit...

228
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,848
Hey, this takes me back.

229
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:45,432
I am Montmorency Margarita
la Fere de Montmorency...

230
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,169
A water user, of a family that has
had a lasting pact with you.

231
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,638
If you remember anything
about my blood,

232
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,096
please answer me in a way
that we can recognize!

233
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,215
I remember, lonely one.

234
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:06,119
I remember the fluid
that runs in your body.

235
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,177
It spoke!

236
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,452
I'm glad. O Water Spirit,
I have a favor to ask.

237
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,194
A favor?

238
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,863
I would like to have
a small piece of you.

239
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,161
We decline, lonely one.

240
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,203
Don't say that! Please, Water Spirit!

241
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,305
Wait! Knock it off!

242
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,706
If she gets in a bad mood...

243
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,368
I'll do whatever you tell me to,
so just a bit...

244
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,234
A tiny bit...

245
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,779
Very well.

246
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,255
You would do anything, say you?

247
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,725
Yeah...

248
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,394
We are occupied with
increasing the water,

249
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,897
and have no time to
drive off attackers.

250
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,165
Attackers?

251
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,269
Some of your kind are attacking us.

252
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,338
We desire to be rid of them.

253
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,243
Attacking the Water Spirit?
Who'd do such a fearless thing?

254
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,178
There's no way I'd know that!

255
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,304
All right.

256
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,583
If we defeat them, you'll give us
a piece of your body, right?

257
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,914
We shall bestow it.

258
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,420
I don't want to be involved in a fight!

259
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,718
You want to be locked up, Mon-Mon?

260
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,215
All right! Do as you like!

261
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,754
Attacking the spirit that is
at the bottom of the lake...

262
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,368
That's quite a mage we're up against.

263
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,271
How do you dive into the lake?

264
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,239
Most likely a user of air.

265
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,208
I think so too.

266
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,510
Using air magic, you can
create a sphere of air

267
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,246
and use it to walk along
the lake bottom.

268
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,544
I think we're up against
quite a caster.

269
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,676
Is that so?

270
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,488
You're talking only to Montmorency!

271
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,324
You love her much more than
you love me, don't you?!

272
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,360
That's not it! We're talking
about something important,

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,029
on how to turn you back to normal!

274
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,897
Turning what part of me
back to normal?

275
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,766
I'm totally normal right now.

276
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,401
I just love you, Saito!

277
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,836
I understand!

278
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:07,440
I love you too, Louise, so can you
be quiet for a little while?

279
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,409
Yeah! I'll stay quiet.

280
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,277
For that to happen to Louise...

281
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,676
It really works well.

282
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,344
Don't think it's someone
else's problem!

283
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,311
Someone's here!

284
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,753
It sounds like a spell is being cast.

285
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,687
Well, there's no doubt about it.

286
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,619
Be a good girl and
stay here for a while.

287
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,430
Saito!

288
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,398
Montmorency...

289
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,901
As long as I am with you,
I won't let you face any danger...

290
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:39,339
It's all right! You hurry up and
go too! Hurry up and stop them!

291
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,330
Yeah... I guess so.

292
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,932
Hold on.

293
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,806
The opponent is a user of
pretty powerful magic spells.

294
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,417
There's no way we would win
going head-to-head against them.

295
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,685
You're going to help me?

296
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,287
Of course.

297
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,790
A noble would be shamed if he
made a peasant fight all by himself.

298
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,825
Sorry!

299
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,428
Guiche, I had totally lost
my faith in you until now.

300
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,830
Don't worry about it.

301
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,298
So, what do we do?

302
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,799
The plan is like this...

303
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,836
I'll use magic here to
draw their attention.

304
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,771
Use that to surprise them
with an ambush!

305
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,407
Understood!

306
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,576
Wait... Are you trying to
swing by with the easy part?

307
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,378
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,381
I am a mage, and you are
a swordsman, aren't you?

309
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,882
Considering our tactics...

310
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,317
Yeah, yeah...

311
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,388
Then I'll run by behind them,
so I'm leaving the rest to you.

312
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,412
Yeah...

313
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,896
I came here thinking it
would be a little vacation.

314
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,558
Why do I have to be
in such a situation?

315
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:48,601
Earth, robust mother, answer my
wishes and become a moving wall!

316
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,777
Huh?

317
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:02,689
They're taking turns using their
magic, so they're never off guard!

318
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,986
Draw me, partner!

319
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,393
Now!

320
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,570
Hot!

321
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:21,971
Look out!

322
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,986
Not good! Saito, run!

323
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,681
Don't be mean to Saito!

324
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,764
Saito?

325
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,890
Did someone say Saito?

326
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,634
Oh, it's true.

327
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,470
Looking closely, it really is Saito.

328
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,459
Huh?

329
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,708
Guiche, Montmorency... Even Louise?

330
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,403
Why are you all here?

331
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,414
I see, so that's what's going on.

332
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,617
But why did you make such
a dangerous thing as a love potion?

333
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,785
That's because...

334
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,453
Ouch!

335
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,555
I just wanted to make some.

336
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,990
That puts us in trouble.

337
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,595
We have to defeat the Water Spirit
for Tabitha to keep face.

338
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,531
Why do you have to defeat it?

339
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,966
That's because...

340
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,168
Tabitha's family asked her to.

341
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,003
The water level is rising every day,

342
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,437
and their territory
is getting damaged.

343
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,501
You have your own reasons
for being here... This is tough.

344
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,517
Hey, Mon-Mon, you were saying that
the Water Spirit was angry, right?

345
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,085
I did, but why?

346
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,145
For now, we can ask it the
reason why it's so upset.

347
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,106
Why are you overflowing
the lake with water?

348
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,141
It's causing everyone trouble.

349
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,612
Because one of your folk abducted
the treasure that we were guarding.

350
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,081
A treasure?

351
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,606
We can exist only in water.

352
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,554
Therefore, should we fill this
entire world with water,

353
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,989
we will someday have the
treasure back in our hands.

354
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,727
Fill the world with water?
That's a long-term plan...

355
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,029
That can't be helped.

356
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,597
Spirits are immortal,

357
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,100
so their sense of time
is different from ours.

358
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,568
All right, if that's the case,

359
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,002
I'll bring whatever that
treasure is back to you!

360
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,640
Saito, it's easy to say that, but...

361
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,976
What's the name of that treasure?

362
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:42,115
Andvari's Ring. A ring that
has spent much time with us.

363
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,851
Andvari... I've heard of it.

364
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,654
I think it was a magic item
that grants artificial souls.

365
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,590
What kind of person stole it?

366
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,856
One of the individuals
was called Cromwell.

367
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,063
We know nothing else.

368
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,298
Cromwell, is it?

369
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,633
Okay, all right.

370
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,836
I'll make sure to find that guy
and bring the ring back!

371
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,204
I promise!

372
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,839
You should give up.

373
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,809
Who would believe the promise of
someone who randomly showed up,

374
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,246
let alone someone like you,
who isn't even a mage?

375
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,508
We believe.

376
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,082
The Spirit Tear!

377
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,622
Why?!

378
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:27,126
Gundolf kept oath with us
in the distant past.

379
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,563
If it is Gundolf, it is worth believing.

380
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,631
Gundolf?

381
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,698
What's that?

382
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,567
That again?

383
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,904
Well, in any case, I will make sure
to keep the promise someday.

384
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,572
Someday?

385
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,574
Spirits don't die, right?

386
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,634
Then no matter how many years
it takes, it doesn't matter.

387
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,115
So can you put all the overflowing
water back to normal?

388
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,582
We shall so promise.

389
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,824
Owe you...

390
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,792
Saito...

391
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,897
How horrible!

392
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,600
The biggest embarrassment of my life,
no, the biggest mistake of my life!

393
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,670
I thought you'd forget everything
when you returned to normal!

394
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,705
I remember all of it!

395
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,941
To think! Me! To this dog!

396
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,603
Doing this and that!

397
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,979
Don't take it out on me!

398
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,048
It's Mon-Mon's fault
for making the potion,

399
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,849
and yours for drinking it!

400
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,184
Be silent!

401
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,742
You dog!

402
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,655
Who is it?

403
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,091
You are as rowdy as ever.

404
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,817
Can it be...

405
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,055
Princess?

406
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,201
The time has come.

407
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,635
It is finally time to go through with it.

408
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,808
As you wish, Your Excellency,

409
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,207
Lord Cromwell.

410
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:11,760
As if I were under a real magic spell

411
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:22,630
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

412
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:34,353
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

413
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:45,423
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

414
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:57,404
My true feelings, the
shards of loneliness

415
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:08,276
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

416
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:14,687
For the day to start from zero

417
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,507
Princess, I will take the
feelings you harbor,

418
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,941
and head to the kingdom of Albion.

419
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,802
The magic knight that will guard us...

420
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,937
Why is it you?
