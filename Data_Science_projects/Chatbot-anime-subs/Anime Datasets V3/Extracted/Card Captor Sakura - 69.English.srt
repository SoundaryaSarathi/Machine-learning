1
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:04,849
I am currently known as Eriol.

2
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:11,587
But I used to be called… Clow Reed.

3
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:15,250
Clow is dead!

4
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,662
Yue and I saw it!

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,959
But he is Clow.

6
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:24,302
Suppi?? You too!?

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,460
It’s easily proven right?

8
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,707
Akizuki-san… why?

9
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,813
O Key that contains the power
of darkness…

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,813
reveal thy true form to me.

11
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:47,749
By our contract, I,
Eriol, command you.

12
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:50,525
Release!

13
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:03,738
Return to your original forms… 
Spinel Sun, Ruby Moon.

14
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:24,552
[Sakura and the Return of Clow Reed]

15
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:28,528
It’s the same as what I saw in my dream.

16
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,963
And that staff… 
it looks like Clow-san’s.

17
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,536
Yeah… Clow made that staff.

18
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:39,408
Then… is Hiragizawa really
Clow Reed reborn?

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,744
If what you say is really true, why have
you been causing Sakura so much troubles?

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,148
You will understand soon,
Kerberos.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,522
Clow…

22
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:55,651
Shall we begin?

23
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,408
The Sun and Moon are disappearing!

24
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,978
Tomoyo-chan!

25
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:28,053
This power is Clow!

26
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:30,356
What’s wrong?!

27
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:36,860
Clow…

28
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,255
Shao Lan-kun!

29
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:05,861
What have you done?

30
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,900
This town has been covered in darkness.

31
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,661
Everyone has fallen asleep.

32
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:13,695
What?

33
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:15,770
Why have you done such a thing?

34
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:22,872
I had intended for you to
fall asleep as well.

35
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,445
You’ve become quite strong.

36
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:34,586
Unless this darkness is ended by dawn,

37
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:38,525
everyone will stay asleep.

38
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,991
For how long?

39
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,899
Forever.

40
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,769
And how am I to wake them?

41
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:57,540
You must defeat my darkness
with your magic.

42
00:03:58,851 --> 00:03:59,681
What!?

43
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,642
No way…

44
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,378
You’re wasting time on questions,

45
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:05,448
Sakura-san.

46
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,453
But

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,824
I can’t use my magic against you!

48
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:15,930
Then you will lose.
You may play for a while.

49
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:20,767
No you don’t!

50
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:34,044
Well done…

51
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,615
however…

52
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:46,164
Kero-chan!

53
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,793
Damn it…

54
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:55,331
Our master is quite powerful, isn’t he?

55
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,581
Yue-san… brother!

56
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:13,491
What’s wrong with him?

57
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:15,222
He’s asleep.

58
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,223
Him too?

59
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:20,955
Because he gave all his magic to me.

60
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,064
Clow.

61
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,998
This is the second time we’ve met.

62
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:36,310
The first time, I returned to Yukito’s
form against my will.

63
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,340
You caused that.

64
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,444
It was not yet time for us to meet then.

65
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:46,989
Why did you send us to a new master,
when you would be reborn?

66
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:52,896
Now that Yue’s here,
I shall have to make my entrance.

67
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,408
Yue-san!

68
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,220
You took all Touya-kun’s magic power, eh?

69
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,583
Your master must be weak.

70
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:24,354
It’s not her fault!

71
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,089
I was just too careless!

72
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,336
This time it’s for real.

73
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:33,870
Prepare yourselves!

74
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:43,973
Let’s go!

75
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:45,713
STOP!

76
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:54,653
Shao Lan-kun, please take care
of Tomoyo-chan and my brother.

77
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,257
Gotcha.

78
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,398
I still don’t understand
why are you doing this?

79
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:12,810
Both Eriol-kun and Clow-san
have helped me so much.

80
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:14,276
WHY!?

81
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:19,851
Before you hear the answer,
you must defeat my magic.

82
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,484
Morning is approaching.

83
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:31,258
Are you ready, Sakura-san? Or would you
prefer that they never wake up?

84
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,189
NO!

85
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,367
But… but…

86
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:42,497
It’s coming!

87
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:43,306
Sakura!

88
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,569
Shield!

89
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:53,849
Jump!

90
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:05,929
Sakura!

91
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:06,954
Hold it right there.

92
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,359
We are your opponents.

93
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,772
God of wind, come forth!

94
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:26,743
Are you ok?

95
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,279
Trying to cast magic
when you’re already weak?

96
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,350
That won’t work.

97
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,423
Shao Lan-kun!

98
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:38,024
Damn…

99
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:39,727
Shao Lan-kun!

100
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:43,293
Sakura.

101
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:45,398
Shao Lan-kun…

102
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,433
If you wish to save
him and everyone else,

103
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,074
defeat my magic.

104
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,633
O wind, become the
chain that binds.

105
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,300
Windy!

106
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,914
Just like with Yue,
this cannot defeat me.

107
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,157
Fly!

108
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:46,855
Sakura!

109
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:04,614
Sakura!!

110
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,287
Damn you!

111
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:14,917
Out of my way!

112
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:23,498
Sakura!!

113
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:28,629
Hmm… it seems they’re
a bit stronger than us.

114
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,309
To protect their mistress.

115
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,543
Cards.

116
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:45,356
You were worried about me?

117
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:47,386
Thank you.

118
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,160
But what should I do.

119
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,296
There are still eight Clow cards left.

120
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,438
Are you ok, Sakura?

121
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:17,785
Maybe the card I need is within these…

122
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:23,127
Please lend me your strength so that

123
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,795
I may defeat Eriol and save everyone.

124
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,498
Card created by Clow,

125
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,599
listen to my words and be reborn.

126
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,908
I, Sakura, command you

127
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:52,855
She turned them into
Sakura cards all at once?

128
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:57,025
Her magic has gotten so much stronger.

129
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,223
Well done,

130
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:06,235
but not all the cards have changed.

131
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,675
Light? Dark?

132
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,007
They haven’t changed?

133
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:20,349
Light and Dark huh?

134
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,521
Why? What’s wrong?

135
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,084
Light and Dark
are the strongest cards.

136
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,657
Sakura’s magic isn’t strong enough
to change them yet.

137
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,895
Darkness is night

138
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:40,596
when everything sleeps…

139
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:42,930
and to wake…

140
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:47,138
you need

141
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:48,910
Light?

142
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,912
As the card said,

143
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,548
only Light can chase away Darkness.

144
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,151
Light can get rid of this darkness.

145
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:00,218
Alright! One more time!

146
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,259
O Card created by Clow!

147
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,729
Listen to my words and be reborn!

148
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,731
I, Sakura, Command you.

149
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,460
Light!

150
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:16,096
Light! Light!

151
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,650
No way!

152
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,284
At this rate… 
everyone will fall asleep.

153
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:40,229
No! I can’t let that happen!

154
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,997
I guess it’s time for us to step forward.

155
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,130
Kero-chan. Yue-san.

156
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:54,738
Light and Dark are always together.

157
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:57,315
They should be together
when you change them as well.

158
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,447
But they didn’t
change the first time… or the second.

159
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,347
Light and Dark are the strongest cards.

160
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,424
We may be able to help you.

161
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,255
You two can?

162
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,429
But don’t they only respond to the staff?

163
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:15,991
Yup.

164
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:19,570
The staff is the only thing

165
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:20,700
that can change them.

166
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:23,040
Then how can you help me?

167
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,505
We can transfer ourselves into the staff.

168
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:29,871
Once we’ve been absorbed

169
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,283
we can help you change the cards

170
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,482
Will you be okay if you do that?

171
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,908
Can you come back?

172
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:39,351
They will be able to return
once you defeat this darkness.

173
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,484
And if I can’t change the card?

174
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:44,788
Like everyone else,

175
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:48,526
they will sleep in that staff forever.

176
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:52,298
NO! I won’t let you!

177
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:53,863
If I can’t do it

178
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:57,241
I’ll never see either of you again! Nooo…

179
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,615
If we don’t,

180
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:13,923
nobody will ever wake up.

181
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:17,324
Is that what you want?

182
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,332
Don’t worry.

183
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:26,836
You have your own spell.

184
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,768
“It will surely be alright”

185
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:41,615
Let’s do it!

186
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,109
Alright.

187
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:16,986
Cards created by Clow,

188
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:19,420
listen to my words and be reborn.

189
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:23,022
I, Sakura, command you.

190
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,802
Please… change!

191
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:42,506
I believe in the cards…

192
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:44,413
and in myself!

193
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,266
Shao Lan-kun?

194
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,004
I’m a descendant of Clow Reed,

195
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,102
I might be able to help.

196
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,676
But if it doesn’t work you’ll…

197
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:21,815
If the cards don’t change,
you’ll fall asleep too…

198
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:24,146
Don’t worry.

199
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:28,722
I’m sure you can defeat him.

200
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:32,287
Right!

201
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:34,425
Let’s go!

202
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:35,499
Yeah.

203
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:47,536
It’s alright.

204
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:51,905
“It will surely be alright!”

205
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:11,097
Light!

206
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:55,801
Oh my, it looks
like she’s beaten your magic.

207
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:59,248
Is this what you wanted Eriol?

208
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,819
Yeah, it’s finally over.

209
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:11,587
Shao Lan-kun!

210
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:15,660
You did it.

211
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:18,162
Thank you.

212
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,831
Thank you so much.

213
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,684
Kero-chan… Yue-san…

214
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:36,913
Thank you!

215
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,347
It was nothing.

216
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:41,252
We’re friends after all.

217
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:48,963
Tomoyo-chan!

218
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:50,463
Sakura-chan?

219
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:52,528
Are you hurt?

220
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:55,295
No, are you ok?

221
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:57,939
Yes, but what happened?

222
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,041
Brother!

223
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,308
It’s ok, he’ll wake up soon.

224
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:06,707
Sakura-san.

225
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:14,151
It’s over. I won’t harm her.

226
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:17,123
Over? What is?

227
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:21,054
They’re all Sakura Cards now.

228
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:53,262
These are the Sakura cards that
I made with the power of the Stars.

229
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,513
Well, you promised us an explanation.

230
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,452
Why were you bothering Sakura!?!?

231
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,283
The… they’re gone!

232
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:22,783
Sakura!

233
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:25,355
Shao Lan-kun!

234
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,131
Are you alright?

235
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:35,565
Sakura…

236
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:36,763
What?

237
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,899
I…

238
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,907
I…

239
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:49,348
I really like you!
