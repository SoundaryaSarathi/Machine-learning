<i>[Episode 38]</i>

3
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:40,437
I figured you would
have questions for me.

4
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,478
So, I didn't allow myself go to sleep.

5
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:47,877
You surely have incredible foresight.

6
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:52,918
Ask away.

7
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,237
Since you know about Mo Yuan now

8
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,997
I don't want to keep the rest
from you anymore.

9
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,638
It is still the same two questions.

10
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,237
Two questions?

11
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:11,717
I'm old and my memory fails me.
Ask me again.

12
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:16,877
After Qian Qian's battle
with Qing Cang 300 years ago

13
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,798
she was left unconscious for many years.

14
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,318
Is that true?

15
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,198
Of course it is false.

16
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:30,918
After her battle with Qing Cang,
she was missing for many years.

17
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,798
What is the matter?

18
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:41,038
I did lie to you back then.
Are you going to keep asking then?

19
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,598
What is the second question?

20
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,397
Has she forgotten anything?

21
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,957
She has forgotten.

22
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:59,198
As for what she forgot, I am not certain.

23
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:03,237
I only remember
after she was missing many years

24
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:06,717
she suddenly appeared one day in
the peach tree woods, covered in wounds.

25
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:09,518
She was very depressed.

26
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:15,078
It was the same day I saved you
after you jumped from Zhuxian Terrace.

27
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,997
So you fed her an amnesia potion?

28
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:24,437
No, I didn't feed it to her.
She asked me for it at the time.

29
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:28,958
I saw the state she was in and
felt it would be better for her to forget

30
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,958
so I gave it to her.

31
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,398
She didn't tell you...

32
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,798
what she forgot?

33
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,958
She really never told me.

34
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:48,757
However, I later guessed

35
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:54,798
the Su Su that I met in
the Celestial Palace is her, right?

36
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:57,598
That's right.

37
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,197
She is Su Su.

38
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:04,557
How did you recognize her?

39
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,958
When we met again at the Eastern Sea

40
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,358
a lot of her mannerisms
felt quite familiar to me.

41
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:21,757
When I later saw the scar on her wrist,
I was certain... it is really her.

42
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:28,197
That scar was from crimson hellfire.
It cannot be removed.

43
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,478
So that is what gave her away.

44
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:40,997
High God, do you really not know

45
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:43,437
or are you not telling me
for my own good...

46
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:51,557
that she wants to forget me...
because of Mo Yuan?

47
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,557
Mo Yuan?

48
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,838
<i>Compared to High God Mo Yuan</i>

49
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,598
<i>the tragic love between us
over those years</i>

50
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,757
<i>was perhaps just a trial for
her ascension to high goddess</i>

51
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,437
<i>that held no significance
worth remembering</i>

52
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:11,918
<i>and was instead an impediment.</i>

53
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:04,117
Ghost Lord has issued a decree.
You are to be executed tomorrow.

54
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,398
Ghost Queen, you treated us well.

55
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:09,942
There is not much I can do for you.

56
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:13,557
But, I've prepared
some good food for you.

57
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,158
Thank you.

58
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,677
Can you bring my son to me?
I want to see him.

59
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:26,677
- Are you talking about the sick child?
- No, he isn't a sick child.

60
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:30,317
He will get better.
He will get better!

61
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,437
The sick child was left in
the adjacent cell.

62
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,117
Nobody is looking after him.

63
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:38,557
He's supposed to be burned
along with your corpse tomorrow.

64
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:43,697
If you really want to see him,
I'll bring him to you.

65
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:47,358
Thank you, thank you!

66
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:11,158
Ying'er, Ying'er!

67
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,798
Ying'er! Ying'er!

68
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:18,877
Ying'er, why are you so cold?

69
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,997
They treated you so poorly?

70
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,317
No matter what,
you are still the lord's prince!

71
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,478
You are his only child!

72
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,778
I am still the only one
who loves you dearly.

73
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,717
Eat up.

74
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:09,118
I am over here.

75
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,477
I am over here.

76
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,477
What do you want me to do now?

77
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,278
I want you to kill me.

78
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,038
Kill you?

79
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,398
That's right.

80
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,118
Kill me.

81
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:59,437
My father once cast a curse
on the three of us siblings.

82
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:07,278
Every time one of the three of us dies,
his powers will greatly increase.

83
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:11,197
So you just have to kill me

84
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:14,077
and my father will have the chance
to break out of the Bell

85
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,077
and once again rule the world!

86
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:20,638
Qing Cang will break out of the Bell?

87
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,638
Don't you want to kill
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

88
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:31,477
She has already ascended to high goddess.

89
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:34,077
Even if you have the chance
to escape from here

90
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:38,798
you wouldn't be able to kill her even if
you train for dozens of millennia.

91
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,677
The only one in this world
who can kill her is my father!

92
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:54,957
Li Jing imprisoned me here
for 300 years. I can't even die!

93
00:10:56,317 --> 00:11:01,238
The heavens finally couldn't stand it!
I have made it to this day!

94
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:06,918
Follow the path I told you about
yesterday to escape from here

95
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:08,677
and you'll be able to find the woods at

96
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:10,957
the common border between
the Ghost Realm and Qing Qiu.

97
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:16,918
After you pass through the woods,
Qing Qiu will be towards the west

98
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:20,278
while the mortal realm will be
towards the east.

99
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,278
Do not go the wrong way.

100
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,837
Head east to the mortal realm
to find Yan Zhi.

101
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,638
In the same way that you deceived
your way into Kunlun Mountain

102
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:35,597
to steal the tactical formation strategy

103
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,758
deceive Yan Zhi to gain her pity.

104
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:45,477
She is most kind.
She will surely help you.

105
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,878
And what you need to do is

106
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:51,557
do what you will do to me,
and kill her!

107
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:56,878
I am carrying a piece of jade.

108
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:01,158
It will point you in the direction
to find Yan Zhi.

109
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,837
You must take it.

110
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:09,317
When you are near Yan Zhi,
this jade will burn hot.

111
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:15,197
Even if you cannot see,
you will be able to recognize her.

112
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:20,398
You people of the Ghost Realm
are indeed all vicious!

113
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:33,317
You cannot blame me for that.

114
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:36,998
Li Jing dared to do this to me.

115
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,878
Even if I die, I must have him
buried with me!

116
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:46,918
As long as my father returns
and learns of the things Li Jing has done

117
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:49,118
and having allied with
the Celestial Tribe

118
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,118
he will definitely avenge me!

119
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:58,918
What other choice do you have now
other than to kill me?

120
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,677
Come. Do it.

121
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:07,317
Kill me. Kill me!

122
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,758
Li Yuan?

123
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,597
So it is you.

124
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:23,878
I have raised a good son.

125
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:28,038
You were the only one
willing to sacrifice your life

126
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:32,118
to allow my powers to greatly increase.

127
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:35,758
When I break out of this Bell

128
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:39,437
I will slaughter all in the four seas

129
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:43,717
and have the whole world
buried along with you!

130
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:10,437
Didn't Dijun say the seal on the Bell
is lifted only once every 70,000 years?

131
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:14,278
What is... What is going on tonight?

132
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:58,677
<i>Mother, I don't want to
go the mortal realm.</i>

133
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:02,238
<i>My eyes hurt so much.
I miss you so much.</i>

134
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,278
<i>I am coming to see you.</i>

135
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:08,438
<i>Mother, look, I've even brought
your grandchild.</i>

136
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:34,357
<i>Mother, do you still
remember me, your daughter?</i>

137
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,077
<i>It's been 70,000 years.</i>

138
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,557
<i>Every time I sent someone to pick you up</i>

139
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,637
<i>you would always refuse to
come to the Ghost Realm.</i>

140
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,718
Mother.

141
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:48,597
Xuan Nu's Mother, it's so late.
Why are you still out here walking?

142
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,438
No, I can't see Mother like this.

143
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:04,917
Mother is old now. She'll scare easily.

144
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:09,357
I'll clean up first and see her tomorrow.

145
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:17,198
It's the middle of the night.
Aren't you afraid of tripping?

146
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:20,038
Like last time, you might lie here
all night without anyone knowing.

147
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,958
Don't call me Xuan Nu's Mother.
Don't call me that.

148
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,557
I don't have a daughter.

149
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:27,998
But, no matter what,
no matter how wrong she was

150
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,718
she is still your daughter.

151
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:33,397
Don't speak up for her. She is a traitor.

152
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,998
High God Mo Yuan was such a nice person.

153
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:41,518
So was High Immortal Die Feng,
and High Immortal Si Yin.

154
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,597
They all took her in.

155
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,998
But what did she do? What did she do?

156
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,998
She betrayed us!

157
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,478
My biggest regret is giving birth to her.

158
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:56,478
She isn't my daughter.
I never gave birth to her.

159
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:59,597
All right, all right.
Let's not talk about it.

160
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:06,518
Mother, I am still your daughter.

161
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:14,637
Bai Qian, it is all your fault.

162
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,637
You caused me to have
no home to return to.

163
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:20,238
Even my mother doesn't want me.

164
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:26,518
I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you!

165
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,958
Ghost Lord.

166
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,397
Aunt doesn't want to see you.
You had best leave.

167
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,157
I must see her.

168
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,917
<i>I suffered so much punishment for you.</i>

169
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,438
<i>You were even going to
let them behead me tomorrow.</i>

170
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:22,958
<i>And you... You are here waiting for
Bai Qian to take pity on you and see you.</i>

171
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,317
<i>The mortal realm will be
towards the east.</i>

172
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,357
<i>Do not go the wrong way.</i>

173
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:29,998
<i>Head east to the mortal realm
to find Yan Zhi.</i>

174
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:33,157
<i>In the same way you deceived your way
into stealing the tactical formations</i>

175
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:35,117
<i>deceive Yan Zhi to gain her pity.</i>

176
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,438
<i>She is most kind.
She will surely help you.</i>

177
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:41,958
<i>And what you need to do is
do what you will do to me, and kill her!</i>

178
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,117
<i>As long as my father returns
and learns of the things Li Jing has done</i>

179
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,871
<i>and having allied with
the Celestial Tribe</i>

180
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,678
<i>he will definitely avenge me!</i>

181
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,630
<i>[Taichen Palace]</i>

182
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,157
Dijun has gone to the mortal realm.

183
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,478
Dijun has gone to the mortal realm?

184
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:29,557
Dijun is taking two months time
to go to the mortal realm

185
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:33,397
to experience the hardships
of mortal life.

186
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:37,238
It has been 48 days now.
You should come back next month.

187
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:43,077
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

188
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:51,557
Star Lord, weren't you going to
the mortal realm?

189
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:55,357
Yes, I'm going to check on Dijun.

190
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,877
Could I have been seeing things in
my old age and just been overly paranoid?

191
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:16,837
There are only about 20 days left.
I'll wait for Dijun to return.

192
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:35,637
You may all go.

193
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:38,157
- Your Majesty, that--
- Leave the umbrella here for me.

194
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,357
You all can leave.

195
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,958
- Yes.
- Yes.

196
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,317
Your Majesty is letting them all go?

197
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,837
It's raining so heavily now.

198
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:56,597
Even with an umbrella, our socks
and shoes will get wet when we head back.

199
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,397
Are you blaming me?

200
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:03,917
I don't dare.

201
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:06,958
I'll carry you back.

202
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,278
I'll carry you back.

203
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,518
That's...

204
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:16,798
That won't do. Empress will scold me.

205
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:22,557
Didn't you tell me about
your mother and father?

206
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:26,117
You said your father is normally
serious and old-fashioned

207
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:29,038
but he loves your mother
especially dearly.

208
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,998
When it is raining, he won't even allow
her socks and shoes to get wet.

209
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,317
My father does love my mother dearly.

210
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,877
Come. I'll carry you on my back.

211
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:47,678
Your Majesty, let's wait for the rain
to stop before heading back.

212
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,518
Are you going to make me
issue an imperial edict?

213
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:52,678
I don't dare.

214
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,758
Get on.

215
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,758
Look at you. You're drenched all over.

216
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:40,678
I think the story you told me
about your parents

217
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:43,518
must have been a lie.

218
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:45,397
How could it be?

219
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:50,557
Look, I carried you back here
in the same way

220
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,397
but not only are your clothes wet

221
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,557
but your shoes and socks
are also mostly soaked.

222
00:25:56,678 --> 00:26:00,678
I think this isn't a good method.

223
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:03,077
It is probably because
the wind and rain were too strong

224
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:05,198
so one umbrella couldn't
withstand the weather.

225
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:09,518
<i>Besides, my parents have powers.</i>

226
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:12,557
<i>My father did it solely for
delighting my mother.</i>

227
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,518
You still caught a cold.

228
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,518
It's no matter.

229
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:30,438
Jiu'er.

230
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:36,917
I have already doted on you for so long.

231
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,238
Why hasn't there been any activity?

232
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:41,877
Activity?

233
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:45,958
I want to have a child with you.

234
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:52,077
That sort of thing isn't only up to me.

235
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,117
You mean...

236
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:58,557
I don't dote on you enough?

237
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:01,518
Staying every night still isn't enough?

238
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:04,798
Look at you. You're always so frivolous.

239
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:11,837
Am I? I am like this only to you.

240
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:14,077
Even if Your Majesty's harem
may not number a thousand

241
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,678
there are at least hundreds.

242
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:18,511
Is Your Majesty not afraid of being
laughed at for being this way?

243
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:21,238
It's different.

244
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,917
You are not the same as them.

245
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:52,758
Empress, it's been half a year.

246
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,678
During this time, His Majesty has only
favored Pure Consort Chen

247
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:57,758
and has never called upon us.

248
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:58,958
Putting that aside

249
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,678
His Majesty even personally carried her

250
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,165
through the rain
back to Handan Quarters yesterday.

251
00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:07,557
Your Highness, His Majesty also
issued a decree today

252
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:11,278
to build a residence outside the palace
for Pure Consort Chen.

253
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,557
She once saved His Majesty's life.

254
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:17,557
There is nothing that can be said
if His Majesty treats her differently.

255
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:20,317
But...

256
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:24,317
His Majesty once built a Daoist temple
for the Crown Prince's mother.

257
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:26,077
Leave them be.

258
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,478
Is it bitter?

259
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,718
I ordered them to prescribe
medication that is especially bitter.

260
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:15,958
Is it because bitter medicine
is more effective?

261
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,637
That's not why.

262
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:23,077
If you don't find it bitter,
then you won't learn.

263
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:25,117
The next time you fall sick again

264
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,902
I'll have to tire myself out again
feeding you medicine.

265
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:32,798
Then I should drink this myself.

266
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,718
I am an emperor.

267
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:39,597
Since I have started feeding you,
I should continue on to the end.

268
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,198
Here, drink slowly.

269
00:29:56,077 --> 00:30:00,478
Your Majesty, will you always
treat me this well?

270
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:05,837
Of course I will.

271
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:37,758
It seems Dijun is
a very affectionate person.

272
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,917
You aren't here to tell me to...

273
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:46,557
I think Your Highness has
Dijun's heart in your hands now.

274
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:49,678
Now, we shall start to break his heart.

275
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:52,998
No, he hasn't truly fallen for me yet.

276
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:54,998
You're the only one
he's favored for months now.

277
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:57,278
What more would Your Highness want?

278
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,718
It can't be.

279
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,278
I just found a bit of
the same feeling I had for Dijun

280
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,478
back in the Celestial Palace.

281
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:05,357
It's already been months?

282
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:08,998
Have you had a blissful time
with Dijun over these months?

283
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,238
Dijun dotes on me very much.

284
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,038
He is nothing like how he was
in the Nine Heavens.

285
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,038
That's good.

286
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:20,238
Although you're here to repay your debt

287
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:24,557
I do feel happy for you
while watching from Heaven.

288
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:28,077
So much time has passed.
Your wish has been fulfilled as well.

289
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,917
Keep on going.

290
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:36,238
Finish this life
according to Dijun's terms.

291
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:42,917
I know. I just...
don't have the heart to hurt him.

292
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,117
Even if I have to devote my life to it,
I will demolish your entire tribe!

293
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,278
Let me go!

294
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:13,718
Si Yin, casualties are inevitable in war!

295
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,038
Moreover, my father has been sealed away!

296
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:18,637
Please do not implicate any others!

297
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,557
Isn't she the Ghost Realm's princess?

298
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:27,038
Why is she here?

299
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,718
Greetings, fellow.
I have a question for you.

300
00:32:42,718 --> 00:32:45,238
That lady just now, does she work here?

301
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:48,117
She is the owner of this restaurant.

302
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:51,038
She cannot speak, but she can cook well.

303
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,438
She's a mute.

304
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,038
- A mute?
- Yes.

305
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,557
She looks quite pretty,
but she cannot speak.

306
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:00,637
Why do you ask?
Have you taken a liking to her?

307
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:11,438
<i>I haven't heard any news of Si Yin
all this time in the mortal realm.</i>

308
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:16,038
<i>Perhaps I might find some leads
by following this Ghost Realm princess.</i>

309
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:20,518
<i>After all, it was her brother
who said he once saw Si Yin.</i>

310
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:23,917
<i>But how can I remain by her side?</i>

311
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:28,317
Every time we're here, we encounter
a bully dallying with an innocent lady.

312
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:31,877
If she is not married yet, there will
surely be a hero who will help.

313
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:35,317
If she is married, a husband will
appear out of nowhere, wielding a sword.

314
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,316
- Whether it is a hero...
- Or a husband...

315
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:40,157
- he's certain to be wearing white.
- he's certain to be wearing white.

316
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,837
Seventeenth's plans are the best.

317
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:46,478
However...

318
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:51,877
Miss, don't run.

319
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:53,837
Miss.

320
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:57,478
The heavens are on my side,
sending me just what I need.

321
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,478
Look at how pretty you are.

322
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:03,397
Why don't you come home with me?

323
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:07,837
It pains me to see you
suffering in such a place.

324
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,918
It pains me.

325
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,637
What are you staring at?

326
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:17,478
I give you my patronage every day.
Do you really not know my intentions?

327
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:21,197
<i>If you keep spouting nonsense, I'll use
my powers to turn you into a chicken!</i>

328
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:23,597
Miss, come home with me.

329
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,918
You dare dally with a woman?

330
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,038
Hurry and scram!

331
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:41,038
Spare my life, young hero!
Spare me! I'll leave!

332
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:44,197
<i>How did you a young hero appear?</i>

333
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,958
Miss, you must have been shocked.

334
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,197
I'll help you clean up.

335
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,557
<i>Although he's a bit foolish,
he's quite adorable.</i>

336
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,077
Aunt.

337
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,958
The Crown Prince said you will be
going to the Nine Heavens today?

338
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,237
Yes, I'm going to the Nine Heavens.

339
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:17,038
I've traveled throughout the world,
but I've never been to the Nine Heavens.

340
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:20,878
I'll get to visit this time
because of Ye Hua.

341
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,637
That's something good
to come out of this.

342
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:25,438
His Highness has been waiting
for you outside the cave.

343
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:27,918
I'll be back soon.
Keep an eye on the Fox Den.

344
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:29,918
You'll be back soon?

345
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,717
In light of His Highness's character

346
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:35,117
I'm afraid you'll have so much fun

347
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,677
and you'll forget about
Qing Qiu and the Fox Den.

348
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:40,237
You're quite brave now.
You dare to tease me?

349
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:42,077
I don't dare, I don't dare.

350
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:44,878
Go to my room right now
and bring me my fan.

351
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:47,398
The new one that
Zhe Yan gave me yesterday.

352
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:51,958
I'm going to take the fan to heaven
to soak up some of their divine energy.

353
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,277
All right.

354
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:17,677
Zhe Yan was right.

355
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:21,878
What ought to be concluded
should be concluded as soon as possible.

356
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,797
If you are the only one
to think it is over

357
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:25,797
it does not mean it is truly over.

358
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:28,557
It seems you have a lot of experience.

359
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,838
I'll wait for you up ahead.

360
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:24,398
A-Yin, I thought...
I thought you would never see me again.

361
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:29,958
Are your injuries fine now?

362
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:34,197
I'm sorry for worrying you, Ghost Lord.

363
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:37,117
I have always been quite robust.

364
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:39,557
These minor injuries are
of no consequence.

365
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:42,878
That is good.

366
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:01,077
What is the meaning of this, Ghost Lord?

367
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:07,157
I made a grave mistake
in a moment of weakness.

368
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:13,717
Take this soul jade now
and place it in Mo Yuan's mouth.

369
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:15,958
Then you will no longer need to
use your heart's blood.

370
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,117
Thank you for your
good intentions, Ghost Lord.

371
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:28,878
It's just that Master's body no longer
needs to be preserved with my blood.

372
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:35,438
Ghost Lord, you had best take back
this treasure and take good care of it.

373
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,117
A-Yin.

374
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:49,978
Is it really not possible for us to
return to the way we were?

375
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:57,398
You are only devoting
all of your attention to me

376
00:39:57,398 --> 00:40:01,358
because you see that I didn't kill myself
by running headfirst into a wall

377
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,757
after I was abandoned

378
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:06,358
but am instead living well as I am now.

379
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:12,358
So, you must think I never cared for you

380
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,677
and that is why you keep hounding me.

381
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:20,597
A-Yin, do you think I only feel
bitterness towards you?

382
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:26,797
I'm afraid talking peacefully
as we are now

383
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:29,358
will not happen again after today.

384
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,597
So, it would be best to
clarify things today.

385
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:40,197
70,000 years ago, I did experience
my first taste of love because of you.

386
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:45,637
Because it was my first time, I was not
like the experienced ones

387
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:48,277
and naturally acted rather
indifferent and passive.

388
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:52,157
Nevertheless, I was indeed
brimming with affection for you.

389
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:56,958
As you know, there was some animosity
between our two tribes.

390
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,237
So during that period of time,
I tried every day to think of

391
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:05,717
how I could persuade my parents
to allow me to marry you.

392
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:09,157
At the time, I had thought of
a good reason

393
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:13,157
so I happily wrote it down,
in fear that I would forget it.

394
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:18,358
Now that I think back on it,
it was truly absurd.

395
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:22,358
And you...

396
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:28,318
When my feelings for you were
at their strongest, you knocked me down.

397
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,557
You only saw that I let go easily

398
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:35,918
but did not see how much sadness
and misery I felt behind it all.

399
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:41,277
When my master passed away

400
00:41:41,277 --> 00:41:44,478
despite my abject heart

401
00:41:44,478 --> 00:41:47,878
I went to Grand Ziming Palace
to borrow the soul jade from you.

402
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:52,797
You will never understand
how much courage I had to summon up.

403
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:58,998
Nor will you ever understand
how sorely disappointed you left me.

404
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:10,637
