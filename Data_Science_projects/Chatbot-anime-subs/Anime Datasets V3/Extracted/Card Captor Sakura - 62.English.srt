1
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,138
You look really good!

2
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:16,540
Thank you, Kero-chan

3
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:18,440
But, Kinomoto-Sakura,

4
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,682
without that kimono you look
completely different.

5
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:22,842
What do you mean!?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,047
Alright alright, just joking.

7
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,323
Fine,

8
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,617
then I’ll just tell daddy not to buy any
food for you to eat then.

9
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:33,895
Now that’s too much!

10
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,729
Your kidding right?

11
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,327
I was just saying that you look so cute!

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,138
Your dress is really cute too.
You really are a hundred times cute!

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,775
So will you forgive me?
Dear and sweet Sakura!

14
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,907
It really looks good?

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,845
I’d dare to say…

16
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:53,273
Yes, nothing is

17
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,448
cuter then you, really!

18
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,088
OK, Kero-chan, it’s just too much.

19
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,647
I’ll bring back some food.

20
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,552
That’s great!

21
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,853
I really want to eat new years cake!

22
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,801
[Sakura and the Mysterious Fortune]

23
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,206
Happy New Years.

24
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,113
Happy New Years.

25
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:33,554
What are you looking at?

26
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:35,920
You are going to say my kimono
isn’t good looking, aren’t you?

27
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,627
No, it looks good.

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,627
For a monster…

29
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,126
What did you say?

30
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:51,071
What? The big new years
monster wants some food?

31
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,765
I’m not a monster!

32
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,546
Happy New Years, Touya-kun.

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,983
Happy New Years.

34
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,379
Sakura-san do you like your new clothes?

35
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,185
No problem.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,190
Here, these are new year cards,
they’re for you.

37
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,595
– Thank you!
– No problem.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,861
Will you guys wait for me for a second?

39
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,231
I am going to finish some work.

40
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,922
When I’m done we’ll go
together to the festival.

41
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,607
OK!

42
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:33,480
I wonder what everybody wrote to me!

43
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,186
Naoko-chans card has a picture.

44
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:40,983
Rika-chan’s card is very pretty.

45
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,521
This is Yamazaki-kun’s card!

46
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,159
It is said that on this very day,

47
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,432
at China

48
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,735
there was something
called a very big dragon.

49
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,435
There was 1 year and 1 day,

50
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:55,838
so they waited.

51
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:57,833
So it’s like that!

52
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:02,643
(Yamazaki-kun’s card has fake information
on it, so be careful, Chiharu-chan)

53
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,674
Fake? Really…

54
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:11,583
This is Tomoyo-chan’s card! Tomoyo-chan’s
words are very pretty, just like her.

55
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:14,519
Oh! This is Shao Lan-kun’s card!

56
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,185
Is it that brat from Hong Kong?

57
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:22,095
He isn’t a brat!
His name is Li Shao Lan-kun.

58
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,092
I’ll call him brat.

59
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,465
Shao Lan-kun is a very good person.

60
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:28,828
Before, we had a lot of disagreements.

61
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:32,639
But now Shao Lan-kun does
a lot of things for me.

62
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,510
So, I don’t like him.

63
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,107
What did you say?

64
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:44,115
Don’t eat the new year cards,

65
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,153
Monster.

66
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,988
Awww you called me monster again!

67
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,485
Let’s go.

68
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,694
Hurry up, monster.

69
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:04,906
Sakura-san, this year what new year
resolutions do you have?

70
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,676
Let me see…

71
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,579
I am going to help father
and not be too worried.

72
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,308
I also want to be on time
for school.

73
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:17,615
Still, still I want to be
better at some things.

74
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,286
And to do better.

75
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,115
How many do you want to have?

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,031
Hey, brother, did Yukito-san
really say that he’s going to come?

77
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:39,181
It’s strange for Tsukishiro-kun
not to keep his promise.

78
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,706
I’m going to go to Yukito’s
house to look.

79
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,501
You two can go home first.

80
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,440
Say hi to Tsukishrio-kun for me.

81
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,343
Yup…

82
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,182
He went late to school, too…

83
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,628
What’s up with Yukito-san?

84
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,468
It’s Tomoyo-chan!

85
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,358
Tomoyo-chan!

86
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:06,523
Sakura-chan!

87
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,618
Where? Where?

88
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,578
Sakura-chan!!!

89
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,394
Kinomoto-sensei…

90
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,673
Happy New Year,
Tomoyo-chan!

91
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,286
Happy New Year!

92
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,681
First let me get out my camera so I can tape you…

93
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,643
Last time, grandfather told me that
it was really too great

94
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:00,319
to be able to talk to me.

95
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,093
Me too.

96
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,392
Thank you, Sonomi-kun.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
I only bought grandfather
a present for you.

98
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,762
He thanked me already.

99
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,670
It was you who told grandfather

100
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,933
to come and see us.

101
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:21,667
How do you know?

102
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,407
When we saw each other,

103
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,472
grandfather said it.

104
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:29,746
I told him not to say anything.

105
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:30,698
Oh yeah!

106
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,150
I brought my camera.

107
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:33,251
Lets go and take a picture

108
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:34,523
of them for New Years.

109
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,853
Sakura-chan, Tomoyo! I’m going to
take a picture, hurry up and come!

110
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,763
OK.

111
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:52,966
I’m about to take the picture!
OK, say “Cheese”.

112
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:56,238
I took the picture!

113
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,007
I’m very tired.

114
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,015
I bet the picture will be very pretty.

115
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,418
Because my mother’s camera is very good.

116
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,884
Also because you are very pretty,

117
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,116
I’m sure that it will be very pretty.

118
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,452
It’s already this late?

119
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,495
I have to go to work now.

120
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:15,991
You still have to go
to work on New Years?

121
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,762
Because today I said
that I would go work

122
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,595
So, you have to come
to our house and play ok?

123
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,902
Yes!

124
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,375
So, I guess I have to leave too.

125
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:29,868
I need to go home and do
some new year things

126
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:31,741
I want to help too!

127
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,316
Yesterday you already helped
Touya and me a lot.

128
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:36,679
You can not help it will be ok.

129
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,653
You go with Tomoyo and play.

130
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,830
Sakura-chan!

131
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,655
Remember to come to our house to play!

132
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,527
Yes!

133
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,702
Let’s go get some fortunes, ok?

134
00:07:59,042 --> 00:07:59,804
Yes.

135
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,246
Excuse me, can we have some fortunes?

136
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:13,482
OK, hold on.

137
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:15,583
Eriol-kun!

138
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,886
How come you’re here?

139
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:21,025
Because the lady that was here is gone.

140
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:22,622
So I came to help.

141
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,933
Mizuki-sensei went abroad.

142
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,703
Still, I was surprised…

143
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,902
Do you know the shrine keeper?

144
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,270
I am the only one.

145
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:38,603
Now, were done talking hurry and choose.

146
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,473
Yup, yes.

147
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,549
I got 75.

148
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:48,617
I got 42.

149
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,451
Please wait a minute.

150
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,659
– I hope I get a good fortune.
– Same here.

151
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,503
Thank you for waiting for so long,

152
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,407
this is Daidouji-san’s.

153
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,036
Thank you very much.

154
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:13,279
– And this is Sakura-san’s.
– Thank You.

155
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:17,481
– What’s wrong?
– I got a good fortune!

156
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,652
The words on here are lucky!

157
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,084
That means…

158
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:26,254
An old day will come

159
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:27,928
and give me Sakura-chan.

160
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,990
And then I can make her pretty clothes!

161
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,060
What does that mean?

162
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,800
Sakura-chan, what does yours say?

163
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:39,999
What?

164
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,778
Your fortune

165
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:45,814
will come in your dreams.

166
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:49,409
That is a very weird card.

167
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:52,011
What’s wrong?

168
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,317
This fortune doesn’t have anything
really good on it.

169
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,393
That is the one you chose.

170
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,154
Is it right?

171
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:11,438
In my dreams?

172
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,300
What is that supposed to mean?

173
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:20,109
That fortune is
especially for Sakura-san.

174
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:24,576
We’ll see each other tonight.

175
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:37,193
Yuki! Are you home?

176
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,600
Yuki!

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,469
Yuki!

178
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,309
Yuki! Whets wrong?

179
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,651
Hey! Yuki!

180
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,714
– Yuki!
– Touya.

181
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,119
What’s wrong with you?

182
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,960
I really wanted to sleep.

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
I’m OK

184
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,402
How come you came to my house?

185
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,233
Your still asking?

186
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,838
Didn’t you say that you wanted to go
to the festival with us?

187
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,476
So we waited for a long time,
and we still didn’t see you.

188
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:23,770
Sorry.

189
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:26,674
That’s ok, if we hurry then

190
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,740
we can still catch up with
Sakura and the others.

191
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:30,776
Hey Yuki!

192
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,923
Sorry, I really want to sleep.

193
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,318
Yuki.

194
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:01,142
– I wonder who that could be.
– I’ll go see.

195
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:03,882
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:06,522
Yeah.

197
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,581
How come you guys are here?

198
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,986
Happy New Year!

199
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:15,625
But why did you come here?

200
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,692
We went with our family
to the festival and we were

201
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:19,401
on the way back home.

202
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,465
But Tomoyo-chan said that
we should come and see you.

203
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,732
So we came here

204
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:30,106
Oh My, two very cute guests.

205
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:34,146
Wei-san!
Happy New Year.

206
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,151
Thank you for coming over.

207
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:41,281
Happy New Year!

208
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,381
Come, Come, hurry and come inside.

209
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:45,088
I will make some tea.

210
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:47,494
But it’s not nice to just come in.

211
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:50,625
What are you talking about?
Right, Shao Lan?

212
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:52,626
Yup.

213
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:54,726
Since we were invited

214
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,126
why don’t we just go in for a while?

215
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,503
Right!

216
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,403
– Please come in.
– I’m coming in!

217
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:05,325
There’s something that
smells really good in there.

218
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,797
Really!

219
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,642
– I… 
– Yes?

220
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,915
Thank you.

221
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:15,453
Yes.

222
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,793
– Thank you very much.
– Don’t mention it.

223
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,265
Cute! This is very well made.

224
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,268
This is really really good!

225
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:37,512
It really is!
Did Wei-san make these?

226
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,038
No, it was Shao Lan who made them.

227
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,388
You really know how to make these,
Shao Lan-kun!

228
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:49,680
Sakura…

229
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:52,756
– What?
– No, nothing!

230
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,720
Before, only family members

231
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,599
could call Shao Lan, Shao Lan.

232
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,197
So it’s like that?

233
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,502
This year let’s continue our friendship, 
right, Shao Lan-kun?

234
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:07,941
Yup…

235
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,877
The food that your dad made
is really good.

236
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,848
This one is very good.

237
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,480
Having a new year is really good.

238
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:24,984
But if we could of gone with Yukito-san

239
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,158
to the fair then it would be very good.

240
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:29,724
What’s wrong with Snow Rabbit?

241
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,493
He said that he would come
to the festival with us today.

242
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,831
But, he said that tomorrow

243
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:39,400
he’s coming to our house!

244
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,308
I think that today he was busy.

245
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,710
Sakura’s power isn’t enough

246
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,351
to keep Yue from staying alive.

247
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,045
So, I could give her some of my power.

248
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:55,852
If something doesn’t change,

249
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,390
then Snow Rabbit will…

250
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,026
Kero-chan,

251
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,021
Kero-chan!

252
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,494
What’s wrong? So he’s coming tomorrow?
That’s great.

253
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,010
It’s a fortune?

254
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,110
That is very weird.

255
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,107
That’s what I was saying,
but I drew it.

256
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,551
But, isn’t it that place
where that lady used to be?

257
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:27,516
It could be because of her…

258
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,088
Why don’t you

259
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,760
go to sleep and see?

260
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:34,896
Yes…

261
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,230
I’m going to turn off the lights ok?

262
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,635
Good night, Sakura.

263
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,169
Good night, Kero-chan

264
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:37,216
Sakura-san. Sakura-san. Come…

265
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,592
The Clow key?

266
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:49,831
Come…

267
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,701
O Key which hides
the forces of the stars,

268
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,839
reveal thy true form before me.

269
00:16:57,513 --> 00:17:00,778
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

270
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,114
Release.

271
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:23,599
Dream?

272
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:26,800
This is my very idea. Call it.

273
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,368
Wants me to call it.

274
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,676
O Key which hides the forces of stars,

275
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,808
reveal thy true form before me.

276
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:39,379
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

277
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,356
Dream!

278
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,941
Am I flying?

279
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,132
It’s the moon tower?

280
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,133
What?

281
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:52,755
The sun, the moon.

282
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,220
They’re both gone!

283
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:02,834
Who is it?

284
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,337
Who are they?

285
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:17,349
I want to come here to fight.

286
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,551
I think this won’t be a problem for you.

287
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,320
I know, I’ve seen him before.
You are… You are…

288
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:28,628
Sakura! Sakura!
Whats wrong with you?

289
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:30,730
Sakura! Are you ok?

290
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:36,535
Did you have your dream?

291
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:40,068
I’m fine,
I just had a strange dream.

292
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,877
Thank you for worrying about me.

293
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,111
If you’re fine then that’s good…

294
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,741
What’s this?

295
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,754
Isn’t that the star staff?

296
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,025
How?

297
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,695
It’s not just that,
look at your left hand!

298
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:06,065
Clow Card?
No, you put it there yourself.

299
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,197
I think it was when you were sleeping.

300
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,101
Dream?
This is what I used in my dream…

301
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,307
So, dream gave you that dream,

302
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:17,705
that wasn’t a normal dream.

303
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,037
What did you dream about?

304
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,116
It was about…

305
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:24,983
I was flying over the city.

306
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:28,150
I was flying
and I saw a lot of different places.

307
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:33,663
But, when I got to the moon
tower the sky became dark.

308
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,826
The sun and the moon were covered.

309
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,758
Then it was all dark.

310
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:42,291
Then on top of the tower
I saw somebody.

311
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,245
Who?

312
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:46,207
It was too dark,
I couldn’t see their faces.

313
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:49,269
There was a person with long hair
and wings.

314
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:52,405
There was also a very huge dog.

315
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,850
That sounds just like me. That’s not all,
was there a Yue shaped person?

316
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:00,155
Then there was still
a boy with a dark face.

317
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,882
I think I’ve seen him before.

318
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,657
But, I don’t know…

319
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:09,793
This isn’t a normal dream…

320
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:12,429
You said you don’t know
who that person is.

321
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,596
But he was probably
a very important person

322
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:15,929
telling you there is no problem.

323
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,408
Sakura,

324
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,371
in your dream was
there anything very scary?

325
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:25,470
No.

326
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,073
So it’s like that,
don’t worry!

327
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,481
Because you are the powerful Sakura!

328
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:37,918
It’ll surely be alright right?

329
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,319
Of course! You still have me!

330
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,231
Do you think that

331
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,626
I will see these people
in my dream again?

332
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,529
At the moon tower…

333
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,133
I think that you might.
