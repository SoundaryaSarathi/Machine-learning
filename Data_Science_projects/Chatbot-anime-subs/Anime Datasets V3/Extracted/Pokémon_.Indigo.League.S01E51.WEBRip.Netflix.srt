Pika-um. Pika.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,660
[narrator] <i>It all began with</i>
<i>an innocent question from Misty.</i>

16
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,329
You know, you haven’t gotten
a badge in a long time, Ash.

17
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,872
You think you’ll ever get another one?

18
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,916
[gasps and gags]

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,961
I guess you could make another
gym leader feel sorry for you

20
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,337
and get another badge that way.

21
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,881
Take it easy, Ash. Drink this.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,260
[grunts and sighs]

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,554
Skill! I win matches with skill!

24
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,266
How much skill does it take to win
a match against Team Rocket?

25
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,434
[all] Huh?

26
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,439
Okay! I’ll show you some skill.
I challenge you to a match right now!

27
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,773
-Pika, pika.
-Huh?

28
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,526
-No, I will not change my mind!
-[Todd] Hold it!

[camera shutter clicks]

30
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,948
-Why should I hold it?
-Not you, Pikachu!

31
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,825
That’s a perfect expression!

32
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,661
-Pika?
-Hey, cut it out!

33
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,999
Okay, okay. It looks like you want
to prove you have skills somehow, right?

34
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,335
That’s exactly what I want to prove!

35
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,046
Well, why don’t you
just get yourself admitted?

36
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,049
-Admitted?
-Take the Pokémon League admissions exam!

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,135
-The Pokémon League...
-Admissions exam?

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,096
-Pika?
-Togepi!

[Narrator]
<i>To get into the Pokémon League,</i>

40
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>a trainer has to travel from</i>
<i>one Pokémon gym to another</i>

41
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>and collect badges to prove that</i>

<i>However...</i>

43
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,034
Here at the Pokémon League
Admissions Center,

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,538
we evaluate applicants based on a combined
written and practical skills exam.

45
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,751
And all those who pass receive this badge
qualifying them for the Pokémon League!

00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,960
[all gasp]

47
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,546
Take this. It’s your testing number.

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,717
[Ash] Lucky seven!
See, Misty, I have skill and luck!

49
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,303
-A little modesty wouldn’t hurt.
-Pika.

50
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,764
Oh, no. I wanted number seven.

51
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,433
[gasps]

52
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,601
[grunts]

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,646
Uh, age, 17. Profession, diva.

54
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,689
Hmm, that girl looks familiar.

55
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,151
Wow, look at all the different kinds
of people showing up for the exam!

56
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,905
[Ash]
Yeah. Nobody I’m not better than.

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,661
-Oh, Nurse Joy!
-Yeah, but which one?

58
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,287
-[Man] Just a minute!
-[both] Huh?

59
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,873
You’ll have to leave your Poké Balls
here with me.

60
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,833
[Ash] Why?

61
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,752
You’re not permitted to use
you own Pokémon in the exam.

62
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,674
-What? Hmm, here.
-[man] Thank you.

63
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,635
Can I take care of his Pikachu
during the exam?

64
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,221
Of course. Good luck, Mr. Ketchum!

65
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,432
I’d wish you luck, too
but you’re just so skilled.

66
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,601
-You got that right.
-Pika.

67
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:51,064
[Ash] Uh, so you want to become
a Pokémon Master, too, huh, Nurse Joy?

68
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,109
Well, it always has been
a dream of mine.

69
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,822
-So, uh, where are you from, Nurse Joy?
-I’m Nurse Joy of the Fuchsia City Joys.

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,907
Sister to the Vermilion City Joys.

71
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,327
Aha, you’re the most beautiful one yet!

72
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,414
-That’s what you always say, Brock.
-Togepi!

73
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,793
I came here for the exam because my work
keeps me too busy to travel very much.

74
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,337
This exam is really a great idea.

75
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,842
Yes, it’s perfect for people whose age or
health keeps them from traveling around.

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:23,138
And it’s also nice for people like me
who can’t ever seem to get away from work.

77
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,017
I can feel it.
I’m sure you’re going to pass the test!

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,018
I hope you’re right.

79
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,395
That’d make a nice human interest shot.

80
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,274
-Hey, save your film for Pokémon!
-[all] Huh?

81
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,613
[gasps and gibbers]

82
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,575
That’s weird.
That guy looked really familiar, too.

83
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,872
-Here’s the exam form.
-Fine. Let’s see. Your name is James.

84
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,875
-Urgh. Will you please keep it down!
-Huh?

85
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,087
-Is that...
-Huh, hey, get lost, old bat!

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,549
Huh? Old bat?

87
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,843
[both grunt angrily]

88
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,058
What are you, unhand me, you...
Please let me go! Come on! Ow!

89
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,769
So I’m an old bat, am I?

90
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:16,233
You’re Jessie? That outfit is atrocious.

91
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,153
-And what are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

92
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,658
Well, truth to tell, I,
not unlike many other people,

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,202
dream of becoming a Pokémon Master.

94
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,955
Make fun if you must! [laughs]

95
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,624
No, you’re doing just fine on your own.

96
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,670
I want to live my dream,
instead of my... my reality.

97
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,672
Hm. I can see why.

98
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,632
What’s your reason for being here?

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:46,096
I simply wanted to add another talent to
my very impressive and extensive resume.

100
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,767
As you know I’m already an accomplished
hostess, florist, costume designer,

101
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,186
wine expert, beautician, style consultant.

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,566
-In fact one of the only things I’m not--
-Is a Pokémon Master!

103
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,025
[both] Meowth!

104
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,987
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

105
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,532
The one who suddenly remembered
an important engagement.

106
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,996
This seems suspiciously unlike a visit
to your sick uncle’s bedside.

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,790
And I thought you
had a dental appointment!

108
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,958
Well, I...

109
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,462
-It was just such a beautiful day.
-We decided to have a picnic!

110
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,382
-Don’t try to fool me!
-[Jessie and James grunting]

111
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,510
[Meowth] Come clean.
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,847
-Mind your own business!
-Take this and leave us alone!

113
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,348
[grunting]

114
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,852
-[Jessie] Hurry up!
-[James] The exam’s about to start.

115
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,605
Pika, pika! Pika, Pikachu.

116
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,525
[man] The first test will measure
your overall knowledge of Pokémon.

117
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,529
-Ready. Begin!
-I can’t wait. This’ll be easy!

118
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,158
[Pokédex]<i> Lickitung’s tongue</i>
<i>is twice the length of its body.</i>

119

<i>known as the punching demon.</i>

123
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:14,100
Let’s see. It’s either Hitmonlee
or Hitmonchan that’s the puncher.

124
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,269
Oh, I think it’s true!

Argh, Magikarp!

-[Jessie] True.
-That’s true, too.

132
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,751
Look at her. She’s so good.

-[Jessie] True, true, true.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,887
All I have to do is guess
and I’ll get half of them right.

136
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,431
Pika, pika. Pikachu.

137
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,935
Now we will measure your ability
to recognize Pokémon.

138
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,146
Please name the Pokémon
by identifying its silhouette

139
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,649
or any part of its body
as it’s displayed here.

140
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,610
All right!
This is going to be a piece of cake!

141
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,572
Here’s the first question.
Identify this Pokémon.

142
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,410
This is going to be a breeze for me.
It’s a Voltorb!

143
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,747
Ah, how simple.
It’s a Poké Ball, without a doubt.

144
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,916
Obviously, it’s an Electrode!

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,920
And the answer is Jigglypuff,
seen from above.

146
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,213
[all gasp]

147
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,675
Next question.
What Pokémon displays this pattern?

148
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,135
I’ve never seen that!

149
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,889
-It must be an Omanyte’s shell!
-It’s an Arbok when it’s all coiled up.

150
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,851
Hmm, hey! It’s a Poliwhirl!

151
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,562
The correct answer, Poliwag!

152
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,813
[all grunt]

153
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,692
As any Master would know,
when Poliwag evolves into Poliwhirl,

154
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,278
the swirl on its stomach
reverses direction.

155
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,363
Hey, this is hard.

156
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,991
-And it’s getting harder by the minute.
-Pika.

157
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,953
Question 15.
What Pokémon does this tail belong to?

158
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,332
Hmm. It’s either Charmander, Charmeleon,
or Charizard?

159
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,376
Yeah, it’s got to be Charmander!

160
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,338
The answer is Ponyta.

161
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,299
No, it can’t be!

162
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,761
Argh, can’t you ask one question
that I know the answer to?

163
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,429
-[all] Huh?
-[man] Please, take your seat!

164
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,224
This is a joke! These stupid questions
won’t make you a Pokémon Master!

165
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:22,145
For your information, young lady,
a Pokémon Master must understand

166
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,147
all aspects of their Pokémon's life

167
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,441
in order to achieve oneness
with their Pokémon.

168
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,445
Argh, you’re not making any sense at all!
I’m through with this!

169
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:35,158
-Get out!
-I can’t wait to go, huh!

170
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,493
But, Jessie, uh...

171
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,955
-Dear. What a shame.
-That girl’s attitude seems familiar, too.

172
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,917
Meowth, Meowth.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,294
-Hey, let’s go!
-Unh!

174
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,545
Where am I going?

175
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,007
You’re going with me to help me
get my revenge!

176
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,717
Huh?

177
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,427
[woman]
Here comes the scoreboard!

178
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,678
[all chattering]

179
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,808
The ones on the right got the low scores,
and the ones on the left got the highest.

180
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,268
[Brock]
Look! Nurse Joy is near the top!

181
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,937
Hey, where’s your picture, Ash?

182
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
Uh, it must be
where they put the highest scorer.

183
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,774
-[Misty] Ash!
-[all] Huh?

184
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,111
-Uh, down here. Here’s your picture.
-Huh?

185
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,154
[Ash] That’s impossible.

186
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,239
[camera shutter clicks]

187
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,117
-Quit it!
-Ah, just a little souvenir, Ash!

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,454
Well, Ash, it looks like you didn’t have
enough luck or skill to pass the test.

189
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,291
Huh? Pokémon isn’t about tests.
It’s about battles!

190
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,793
-[laughs]
-Uh...

191
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,337
[James] Jessie’s been expelled!

192
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,298
Now I’ll have to do my best for her!

193
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,260
Pika, pika! Pika!

194
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,387
[bell rings and cheering]

195
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,931
All right, Squirtle! Water gun attack!

196
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,059
-Squirtle!
-Char!

197
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,520
Squirtle, give it the skull bash now!

198
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,231
Nurse Joy, you’re doing great, yeah!

199
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,943
All right, shoot away. I want 8x10
glossies and wallet sizes, too.

200
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,986
Yeah, sure.

201
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,697
-Now, select whichever one you like.
-[James] Hmm?

202
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,159
[Ash] Uh, I don’t know which one to pick.

203
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,620
You can’t tell us what kind of Pokémon
are inside them, huh?

204
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,497
[man] That’s what makes it a test.

205
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,877
All of these Pokémon are trained
for battle, so they’ll obey your commands.

206
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,880
This test determines
whether a trainer can adapt

207
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,090
regardless of what Pokémon
comes out.

208
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,176
-With whom do we have to battle?
-[man] With me.

209
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,430
-Right! Then I’ll take these!
-I’ll take these.

210
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,389
[bell dings]

211
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,390
[grunts]

212
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,350
[cheering and applause]

213
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,936
Come on, James! Beat that ignoramus!

214
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,813
Right, really beat the guy.

215
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,566
This one’s for you, Jessie!

216
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,403
Pikachu.

217
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,072
[all] Huh?

218
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,408
-Pika, pika?
-Pikachu.

219
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,954
Heh, with this, I can’t lose!
Thundershock! Thunderbolt!

220
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,125
I’ve been destroyed by Pikachu’s attacks
so many times, I know them all by heart!

221
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,085
[laughing]

222
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,922
That’s kind of pathetic
when you think about it.

223
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,048
Yeah.

224
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,636
Now, we begin! Go!

225
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,389
-Graveler!
-It’s a Graveler.

226
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,642
-Pikachu, thunderbolt!
-Pika!

227
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,603
Oh, that feels great to say!

228
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,439
[both grunting]

229
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,113
[grunts]

230
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,533
I don’t get it. How come the thunderbolt
attack didn’t work?

231
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,454
You should’ve known that electricity
doesn’t work on rock Pokémon!

232
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,707
-Minus one point!
-Well then. How about this?

233
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,629
-Char!
-Ivysaur!

234
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,797
[gasp]

235
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,383
With these I can win!
Now what do you say?

236
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,051
[laughing]

237
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,053
-Goodbye!
-Argh!

238
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,806
It’s against the rules
to use two Pokémon at once.

239
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,308
I never play by the... Huh?

240
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,020
-Ugh.
-You’re expelled. Now get out!

241
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,647
He failed again.

242
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,733
Don’t think of it as failing,
think of it as not succeeding.

243
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,779
Now we’ll see if Ash can win one!

244
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,906
-Go get them, Ash!
-Pika!

245
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,908
Thanks. Just leave it to me!

246
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,119
Hey, Todd, make sure
you get lots of great shots!

247
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,579
Don’t worry. Just make sure you win!

248
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,749
[James] I’m such a loser!

249
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,543
-[Jessie] James.
-Huh?

250
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,504
I have a plan that will make us
all winners.

251
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,505
Yeah.

252
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,633
-Are you ready, Ash?
-Ready!

253
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,385
Poké Ball, go!

254
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
Flareon!

255
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,266
Okay, now I need something
to beat a Flareon.

256
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,936
First Poké Ball, go!

257
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:38,109
-Weezing!
-Argh, I got a Weezing?

258
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,277
[all] That’s bad!

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,740
[Todd] I got to get this.
His face looks just like Weezing’s!

260
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,743
-Not now!
-It’s time to start the battle!

261
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,995
Flareon, go. Flamethrower now!

262
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,248
[both grunting]

263
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,918
Argh. Oh, I know.

264
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,296
Weezing, give him your smog attack now!

265
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,928
[all gasp]

266
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,680
Now, Flareon, the leer!

267
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,186
Come on, Weezing,
fight back with smokescreen!

268
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,818
-Hey, not too shabby.
-Go, Weezing! Tackle attack!

269
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,154
[grunting continues]

270
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,991
All right! My first victory!

271
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,078
I guess Ash is a pretty good battler
after all!

272
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,955
Even Team Rocket could win
if they fought like that!

273
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,582
Hurry, take notes! Take notes!

274
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,961
-Now round two!
-Jolteon!

275
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,716
Okay, a Jolteon? Next Poké Ball, go!

276
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,805
-Arbok!
-Ugh.

277
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,016
-Ash got the Pokémon Jessie has!
-Chu.

278
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,977
Let’s see. What are Arbok’s attacks?

279
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,813
Jolteon! Agility attack!

280
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,564
[grunting]

281
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,817
I remember. Arbok, glare!

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,486
[grunting]

283
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,115
Now squeeze it with your wrap attack now!

284
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,909
[both grunting]

285
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,706
Ugh, that was no good!
I forgot about all of Jolteon’s spikes!

286
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,460
Quick, Jolteon, use the thunder attack!

287
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,800
-Arbok, no!
-Too bad you overloaded Jolteon’s spikes.

288
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,137
Sizing up your opponent
before an attack is a fundamental rule.

289
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,390
Argh! Arbok, return!

290
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,312
Okay, third Poké Ball. Go!

291
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,026
-Meowth!
-Heh, Meowth?

292
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,280
-Pika?
-This ought to be interesting.

293
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,489
Toge! Toge!

294
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,199
Hey, Meowth, good luck!

295
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,161
-Meowth.
-Let’s see. Meowth’s attacks are...

296
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,038
-Use the fury swipes!
-Huh?

297
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,498
Poké Ball, go!

298
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,295
-Vaporeon!
-A Vaporeon!

299
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,047
-Okay, Meowth! Use the fury swipes!
-Meowth!

300
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,884
Vaporeon, use your ice beam now!

301
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,385
Vaporeon!

302
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,845
Ah!

303
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,724
Oh, Meowth.

304
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,601
Looks like another victory for me.

305
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,937
-That was fast.
-[Meowth] Look what you did!

306
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,565
How could you treat a fellow
Meowth that way!

307
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,528
Ugh, sorry you had to go through that!

308
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,532
Say, now, I’d love to catch that
talking Meowth there!

309
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,034
Poké Ball, go!

310
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,997
[all gasp]

311
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,417
[man]
Return those Pokémon immediately!

312
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,629
We’re not taking orders from you anymore,
Mr. Exam Man!

313
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,256
Now we’re the ones
who’re going to test you!

314
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,134
-What?
-Prepare yourself for trouble.

315
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,428
I strongly suggest
you make that double.

316
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,555
Oh, it’s Team Rocket!

317
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,849
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

318
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,018
To unite all peoples within our nation.

319
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,395
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

320
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,523
To extend our reach to the stars above.

321
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,525
Heh, Jessie!

322
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,820
James!

323
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,117
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

324
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,913
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

325
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,081
Meowth! That’s right!

326
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,041
Don’t interfere with my test.

327
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,545
Just go home and study harder
and you can try again next time.

328
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,422
Unfortunately for you,
there won’t be a next time!

329
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,009
But now that we’ve rounded up
all these Pokémon, it’s payback time!

330
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:37,014
Pikachu, Ivysaur, Charizard, go!
Are you ready?

331
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,101
And I’m going to teach you a lesson
for picking on a Meowth!

332
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,728
-Huh?
-We’re not going to let you do it!

333
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,647
-Go, Pikachu!
-Pika!

334
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,568
-Ivysaur! The vine whip now!
-Charizard! Flamethrower now!

335
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,570
Pikachu, thunder now!

336
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,032
Listen up, Ivysaur, Charizard, Pikachu!
About face, now!

337
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,410
[Team Rocket gasp and grunt]

338
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,664
How did you...

339
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,042
Oh, they obeyed you because
you’re the one who raised all of them!

340
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,210
Very good, Ash!

341
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,672
Meowth, Weezing, Arbok,
stop Team Rocket!

342
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,925
-Stop it, Arbok, that hurts!
-[all grunt]

343
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,219
Weezing, please! I can’t breathe!

344
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:20,016
-Okay, Weezing! Explosion now!
-Weezing!

345
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,689
[all] Looks like Team Rocket’s
blasting off again!

346
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,407
[man] I am terribly sorry, everyone.

347
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,661
But Team Rocket’s intrusion has interfered
with the entire examination.

348
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,122
We have to start over
from the very beginning.

349
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,083
You mean, after all that hard work,
we did?

350
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,962
Well, young man, you did a fine job
of getting rid of Team Rocket!

351
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,090
What do you say?
Do you want to give the test another try?

352
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:57,053
-Ah, no thanks, sir. I don’t think so.
-I’m sure you’ll pass this time.

353
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,557
Oh, it’s not that. I just think I’m better
off getting badges my own way for now.

354
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,893
-Right, Pikachu?
-Pika!

355
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,312
You proved you’re a great battler
after all.

356
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,189
Thanks, Misty. I guess so.

357
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,026
Well then, if you learned that lesson,
I’d say the test really was worth taking.

358
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,278
Yeah, that’s true, Misty!

359
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,866
Anyway, it sure was awesome to battle
with all those different Pokémon!

360

<i>Many roads lead to the Pokémon League.</i>

361
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,374
<i>Ash’s chosen path is to win</i>

362
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:31,087
<i>Only then can he continue to fulfill</i>
<i>his dream of reaching the ultimate goal,</i>

363
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,339

364
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,468
-Hey, where’s Ash?
-They already left.

365
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,136
They’re on their way to the next Gym.

366
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,265
-Huh? What’s wrong with that Meowth?
-It got hurt in the explosion.

367
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,894
-Where am I?
-This must be...

368
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,146
Huh? Meowth!

369
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,358
What going on? Where’s Jessie?
Where’s James? Huh?

370
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,568
I finally got my talking Meowth!

371
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,571
Uh! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute. Argh!

374
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,205
We’ll show those twerps next time!

375
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,499
Next time, Team Rocket triumphs!

376
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,168
Meowth, don’t you have anything to say?

377
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,545
Meowth-eowth!

378
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,505
[both] Huh?

379
