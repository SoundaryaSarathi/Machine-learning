1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,769
Jadeite, don't underestimate
the power of girls!

2
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,973
We're not just crybabies, you know!

3
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:14,238
Your countless evil deeds
need to be stopped!

4
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:19,542
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

6
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

7
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

8
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

9
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,568
Guided by the light of the moon

10
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

11
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

12
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

13
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
I believe in it, miracle romance

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,969
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

15
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,307
I'm clumsier than others

16
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,275
and a bit of a crybaby.
That's about it.

17
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,413
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

18
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,415
and gave me a peculiar
transforming brooch

19
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,280
and made me a sailor warrior.

20
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:14,315
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

21
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,781
That makes me really nervous.

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,358
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

23
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:31,931
Girl Power! The End of Jadeite

24
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:44,477
Jadeite, you collected a great
amount of energy on Earth.

25
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:48,578
However, you also had
a great many failures.

26
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:55,427
Furthermore, Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury and Sailor Mars
have appeared.

27
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,794
But in spite of the appearance
of this opposition,

28
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,833
you have yet to destroy them.

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,801
But Queen Beryl...

30
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,030
I do not want to hear your excuses!

31
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,031
You will defeat the three sailor
warriors standing in our way.

32
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:15,169
If you cannot destroy them, you will
be sentenced to "Eternal Sleep."

33
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:17,649
Did she say "Eternal Sleep?"

34
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,139
Oh, how terrifying!

35
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,248
Jadeite, I hope you already know

36
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,458
that once you are sentenced
to "Eternal Sleep,"

37
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,224
you will fall to the bottom of
darkness, never to return!

38
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,640
The Swan.

39
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,742
The Archer.

40
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:47,710
The Balance.

41
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,812
The arcade guy constellation.

42
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:54,215
The Tuxedo Mask constellation.

43
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,058
Wow! I'm so unfaithful!

44
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:01,821
I'm in love with both of them.

45
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:04,028
I'm so bad.

46
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,100
It's one-sided anyway.

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,669
Usagi's love is the same as
the foam in the sea.

48
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,102
It'll be short-lived.

49
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:17,541
It's tough being a maiden in love.
But what if

50
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:21,112
Tuxedo Mask was actually Motoki?

51
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,853
I love you, Usagi.

52
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,844
Oh, I'm so happy!

53
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,686
What's that?!

54
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,436
I am Jadeite!

55
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:48,304
Listen closely, Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury and Sailor Mars!

56
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,176
Haneda Airport at 1 a.m. Tomorrow.

57
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,874
Come to runway F.
But if you do not...

58
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:06,124
How dare he?!

59
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,330
That was just an illusion!

60
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,828
But if you do not show up,
I will burn Tokyo to the ground!

61
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:26,343
I know Jadeite will burn Tokyo
just like he warned us!

62
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,169
What shall we do now?

63
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,281
We should go! When evil challenges
us, we have to accept!

64
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,746
But we would just be
walking into a trap.

65
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,584
Even if that's true,
we should still go!

66
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,527
What do you think, Usagi?

67
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,188
We should fight against evil, right?

68
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,021
We should think about it
carefully, right, Usagi?

69
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:51,060
I don't want to go,
because it's too scary!

70
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,030
As for the mysterious image
that suddenly appeared in
the sky last night,

71
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,278
the Metropolitan Police believe it
to be a vicious prank

72
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:02,679
intended to scare the public by
displaying strange images in the sky.

73
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,818
However, the threat to burn Tokyo
to the ground cannot be ignored,

74
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,855
and plans are being made to
assign police officers

75
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:11,755
to the vicinity of Haneda Airport
tomorrow night.

76
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:13,358
Come on, let's go together.

77
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:13,692
Yeah, let's go!
Come on, let's go together.

78
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:14,681
Yeah, let's go!

79
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,495
This is a problem.

80
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:19,831
If everyone goes there, they'll
get caught in the crossfire.

81
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:20,866
That's true.

82
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,858
Maybe we shouldn't go after all!

83
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:24,770
Usagi!

84
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,804
I'm just kidding.
Usagi!

85
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:26,204
I'm just kidding.
Hey, Usagi, what do you think?

86
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:27,933
Hey, Usagi, what do you think?

87
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,576
It's got to be a practical joke.

88
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,010
It is not!

89
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,079
That was an alien!

90
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,244
It was an alien warning us corrupt
humans on this Earth!

91
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:44,022
Oh, Umino! You've been reading too
many third-rate science fiction comics!

92
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,124
Either way, it sounds fun!

93
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:49,861
Let's all get together tonight
and go to Haneda!

94
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:51,797
Wait, everyone...

95
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,131
No, you will not!

96
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:57,067
Junior high school students are not
allowed to go out so late at night!

97
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:00,639
That's right! Ms. Haruna's exactly right!
You shouldn't go!

98
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,740
Why not?

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,908
Because it's dangerous.

100
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:03,308
Why is it dangerous?
Because it's dangerous.

101
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,476
Why is it dangerous?

102
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:05,077
Well...

103
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:05,577
Miss Usagi, you know
something, don't you?
Well...

104
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:07,179
Miss Usagi, you know
something, don't you?

105
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,814
I don't know anything!

106
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,149
Anyway, if you have time to go
out at night for fun,

107
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,344
I think you should be
at home studying!

108
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,488
Miss Tsukino!

109
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:18,690
You're suddenly sounding so serious...

110
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,954
Well, you don't have a fever.

111
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,056
Do you have any problems
you want to talk about?

112
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,853
If you want, I'm here to listen.

113
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:29,234
Oh, you think it's weird for me to
say something serious?!

114
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,725
That's mean. That's mean!

115
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:34,735
Crown

116
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,909
See? Isn't it horrible?

117
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,605
But I completely agree
with your teacher.

118
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:45,513
Part of your charm is how you don't
say normal, serious things.

119
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:50,686
If anything, I like girls with
unique personalities.

120
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,819
Yippy!

121
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,259
He paid me a compliment!

122
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,368
Ouch!

123
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:04,562
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,270
Again?!

125
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,872
You hit me with your shoe again!
Did you aim for me on purpose?

126
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:13,712
It's your fault for not paying attention
to where you're walking.

127
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:15,737
Oh, yeah? You are so not cute.

128
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:19,313
Can't you talk more properly
like a normal girl?

129
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,245
No, I can't!

130
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,956
Because someone told me that

131
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:27,659
he likes me better because
I don't act normal!

132
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,355
That's stupid! Guys like that
are just losers!

133
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,588
He's much more charming
than you are!

134
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:36,301
Birds of a feather flock together.
Every Jack has his Jill.

135
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,636
Dust goes in a dust bin!

136
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:40,070
A loser for dumpling head?

137
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:44,609
You're so mean. I can't do anything
about you calling me names,

138
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:48,272
but how could you say bad things
about Motoki?!

139
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:50,882
Hey, don't...

140
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:51,116
How dare he can make a girl cry?
Hey, don't...

141
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:51,683
How dare he can make a girl cry?

142
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:52,350
How dare he can make a girl cry?
Meanie! Meanie!

143
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,418
Meanie! Meanie!

144
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,512
I'm sorry. I have some urgent
business to take care of.

145
00:08:57,489 --> 00:09:00,014
Here, you can have your shoe back.
Well, bye!

146
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:26,509
I have no business with you people,
so you can sleep for a while!

147
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,591
Come on, sailor warriors!

148
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:43,935
Monorail Haneda Line

149
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,204
Monorail Haneda Line
Usagi, you're a rabbit,
why are you so slow?!

150
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:47,472
Monorail Haneda Line
You're acting all bossy again!

151
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:47,939
Monorail Haneda Line
Now is not the time to be fighting
amongst ourselves!
You're acting all bossy again!

152
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:48,640
Monorail Haneda Line
Now is not the time to be fighting
amongst ourselves!

153
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,607
Now is not the time to be fighting
amongst ourselves!

154
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,837
Oh, no. Looks like it's not running
anymore after all.

155
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,976
I guess we have to take a taxi.

156
00:09:58,884 --> 00:09:59,684
What?!

157
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,118
What's going on?
What?!

158
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,085
What's going on?

159
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,985
Looks like the enemy is inviting us in.

160
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,590
Just what I like to see!

161
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,158
Oh, wait!
Just what I like to see!

162
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:06,954
Oh, wait!

163
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,294
The door!

164
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:35,745
I feel like we're walking further and
further into the enemy's trap.

165
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,488
Wow, there are so many
police officers.

166
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,266
It seems like nothing's happened yet.

167
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,166
We should stay alert.

168
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,009
The will to kill!

169
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,008
This can't be real!

170
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:04,616
Why are the police officers after us?!

171
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,384
This way! Hurry!

172
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:10,320
I hate this! I can't believe these
Japanese police officers!

173
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,318
Wait for me!

174
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,953
It's strange! Something's wrong!

175
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:43,623
Okay!

176
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:46,490
Mercury Power Makeup!

177
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,641
Okay, me too then!

178
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:05,509
Mars Power Makeup!

179
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,190
What?! I'm the last one?!

180
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:28,096
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

181
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:20,386
This means...

182
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:23,150
They aren't real police officers!
They're made of clay!

183
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,990
Now that I know that, I won't
show them any mercy!

184
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:27,950
Fire

185
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,629
Soul!

186
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:44,844
I did it!

187
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,607
They're clay figures, just like you said.

188
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,348
Sailor Mars, you're great!

189
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:50,610
You could say that.

190
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:55,020
Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury
and Sailor Mars!

191
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,655
I saw who you are!

192
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,121
Oh, no! He found out!

193
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:06,029
The life of a flower is short
and full of suffering.

194
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,356
Today will be the end of
your lives as well!

195
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:11,470
They say beauty and good fortune
seldom go hand in hand.

196
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,270
But I guess, I'm going to die young
because I'm beautiful, too!

197
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,733
Just which part of you
makes you beautiful?

198
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,313
Well, I think I'm at least prettier
than you are!

199
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,543
Really?! Which parts? Which parts?

200
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,382
Of course, around here!

201
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,490
You're so funny! I think a monkey at
Ueno Zoo is prettier than you are!

202
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,792
I can't believe you said that!

203
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:33,325
I told you already, this is not the time
to be fighting amongst ourselves!
I can't believe you said that!

204
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,828
I told you already, this is not the time
to be fighting amongst ourselves!

205
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,056
Sorry!

206
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,259
We have a mission!

207
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,163
We can't die now!

208
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,435
Poor little lambs, you are
all going to Hell.

209
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,786
No way!

210
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,925
We're going to get run over!

211
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:06,625
Run!
We're going to get run over!

212
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,319
Run!

213
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,869
Oh! There's another one over here!

214
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:19,269
I can't believe this!
Someone, help!

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,842
I need to use my Fire Soul!

216
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,145
You can't! Do you know how much
a jet airplane costs?!

217
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:27,446
All your allowances put together

218
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,582
for the rest of your lives
couldn't pay for one jet!

219
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:30,749
What?!

220
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,051
It costs that much?!

221
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:33,853
Then we have only one solution!

222
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:34,453
What?

223
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:34,920
Run!
What?

224
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,721
Run!

225
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:36,847
What?!

226
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,993
No way! Getting run over
by a car is one thing,

227
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:44,156
but I'd be too embarrassed to say
I was run over by an airplane!

228
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:46,964
There is no more runway!

229
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,699
Oh, no!

230
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:57,441
This is it!

231
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,308
The jet stopped.

232
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,051
Are you having fun bullying
these helpless girls?

233
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,219
You appear again, Tuxedo Mask.

234
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,120
I'll send you to Hell along
with those three!

235
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:17,785
A villain who toys with innocent
people. You will not get away with it.

236
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,191
Tuxedo Mask!

237
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,530
Die!

238
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,647
Tuxedo Mask!

239
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,368
Where's Tuxedo Mask?

240
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:59,030
Oh, no! What happened to him?!

241
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,746
Your trusty Tuxedo Mask is dead!

242
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,248
Cry and wail!

243
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,650
Can you do nothing without
the help of a man?!

244
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,278
Women are such foolish
creatures in the end!

245
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:20,416
Only old men think men are better
than women these days!

246
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:24,321
That's right! Scorning women is
positively feudalistic!

247
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,865
Down with sexual discrimination!

248
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:30,096
We must fight against Jadeite,
the arrogant man!

249
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,364
Foolish girls! Behold my powers!

250
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:41,413
Oh, not again!

251
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,641
This way!

252
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,353
Don't let the jet distract you!

253
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:49,355
Our opponent is not the jet,

254
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,845
but the guy manipulating
the jet, Jadeite!

255
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,524
Luna is right!

256
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,260
We have to work together!

257
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,128
And defeat Jadeite!

258
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:58,964
Since you understand that, you can
keep running as the decoy!

259
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,056
What?! Why me?!

260
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:01,966
Bubble

261
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,438
Spray!

262
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,952
Oh, no! This isn't fair, you two!

263
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,622
Where are the other two?

264
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,024
I'm here!

265
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,616
I'll take care of you in the same way!

266
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:34,667
Begone, evil spirit

267
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:39,638
Begone, evil spirit
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai,
Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!

268
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:42,129
Begone, evil spirit

269
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,766
It's useless to run!

270
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:46,238
Die!

271
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,550
What is this?!

272
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,544
Why are they coming towards me?!

273
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,197
Don't underestimate girls!

274
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:08,534
We're not just crybabies, you know!

275
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:11,526
Why?! Why are my thoughts in chaos?!

276
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,906
Because you have evil thoughts.

277
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:17,398
You fell into your own trap!
You're the fool!

278
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:20,368
Your countless evil deeds
need to be stopped!

279
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,114
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

280
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:41,164
Moon Tiara Action!

281
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,686
Queen Beryl...

282
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:10,292
Fool! So, you have the shame
to come crawling back!

283
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:14,764
Queen Beryl, I have discovered the
identity of the sailor warriors.

284
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:16,997
Excuses are unbecoming!

285
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,571
Sleep for eternity!

286
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,073
Queen Beryl!

287
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,509
Ah! How frightening...

288
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:38,320
Useless minions can only
be tossed aside.

289
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:46,458
You will be the next
strategic commander!

290
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:52,197
Jadeite was a fool.
Leave matters to me.

291
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,505
Tuxedo Mask...

292
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,719
It's no use just staring out there.

293
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,778
It's sad, but we should get going.

294
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,520
No way, I can't do that!

295
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,519
Thank you for worrying about me!

296
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,760
Tuxedo Mask! You are alive!

297
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,936
I do not die so easily.

298
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:31,210
Tuxedo Mask, why do you always
come to our rescue?

299
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,873
I know! It must be because
he loves me!

300
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,506
Who in the world are you?

301
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:40,216
I cannot reveal my identity yet.

302
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:44,122
Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury
and Sailor Mars,

303
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,522
continue to value your friendship!

304
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,323
Good-bye.

305
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:13,440
In my dream, you and I were together

306
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:20,352
Protected by the stars

307
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:35,569
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

308
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:42,708
And we casually talked to each other

309
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:51,519
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

310
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:58,454
I want to become prettier
right here and now

311
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:06,003
Something changes when
you fall in love

312
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:12,571
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

313
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:26,457
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
