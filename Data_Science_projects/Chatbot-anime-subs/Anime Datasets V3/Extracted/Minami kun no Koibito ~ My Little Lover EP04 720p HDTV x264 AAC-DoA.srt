3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,870
<i>I want to be small again. Minami-kun.</i>

<i>Where are you, Chiyomi?</i>

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,010
<i>Over here, Minami-kun!</i>

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,220
<i>In Tokyo?</i>

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,300
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,210
<i>So, I told you yesterday. The dance workshop.</i>

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,290
<i>Please, I really want to do it.</i>

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,450
<i>So, please let me stay with you.</i>

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,090
<i>On that day, you fainted at the sound of thunder. Then, you woke up finding yourself small. Correct?</i>

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,090
<i>I see! If I do the same thing here again...</i>

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>So, it's impossible after all.</i>

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,460
<i>Are you okay?</i>

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,420

<i>Nomura-san...</i>

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,220
Dad, Mom, Asuka, how are you doing?

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:32,260
I am doing fine here... in T-Tokyo...

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,960
That's not good. They will know you're lying right away.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm so nervous...

22
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay then, I'm shooting one more time.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,940
Dad, Mom, Asuka, how are you doing?

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,170
I am doing fine in Tokyo.

25
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,140
I know you are worried about me, but I'm fine. I'll send you another video some time.

26
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,420
Good. It went okay.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,980
Nothing strange is captured.

28
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,800
<i>It's been almost a week since my body became strange like this.</i>

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,950
<i>There is no sign of me getting back to normal.</i>

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,990
Oh right. They won't know it is from Minami-kun even if you send it from there, right?

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,920
Right. I got a free email address that is different from mine.

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,210
<i>I had stopped talking to Minami-kun before I knew it although I used to love him when we were kids.</i>

33
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,130
<i>I thought we would be like this forever.</i>

34
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,120
Okay then, why don't you input your dad's address?

35
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,560
<i>But, it was Minami-kun who found me when I had become like this.</i>

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,130
h... a... n... a...

37
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,460
It's more difficult than I expected.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,490
Okay.

41
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,250
<i>I can't show what I look like now to my family or friends.</i>

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,930

It's Chiyomi. Honey, it's Chiyomi.

65
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,920
We are not fine. How could we be?

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,930
Because of Chiyomi, we are worn out and look older.

67
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,150
Be quiet, honey.

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,340

Hah~?

72
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,710
What's this uncool dress? Did she have these kinds of clothes?

73
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,570
She hasn't said anything we want to know.

74
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,720
Well, you are right, but aren't we happy just to see that she's doing okay?

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,740
It's so frustrating.

76
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,580
That's so unfashionable. Look at that ribbon.

77
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,980
Why doesn't she just call us instead of doing annoying thing like this?

78
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,400
Well, maybe she can't call us because she is scared of you two.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,210
- What are you saying? You are the one who hit her.<br>- Huh?

80
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,130
It's domestic violence, Dad.

81
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,940
Hey, you are mistaken. That's not it.

82
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,880
Right? Right? That's not it, right?

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Hello, this is Horikiri residence. Chiyomi?!

Hey, Chiyomi? It's you?

86
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,960
Y... Yeah. It's me. Did you see the video?

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,560
<i>We watched it now. What have you been doing?</i>

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,010
Well, the workshop...

89
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,140
<i>How long is the workshop? Isn't it too long?</i>

90
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,920
Well, it's kind of getting longer.

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,750
The organizer has an artistic temperament, you know...

92
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,370
- Artistic temperament... Gosh.<br>- Hey, give it to me.

93
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,630
Hello, Chiyomi. What happened to your cellphone?

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,820
<i>It broke.</i>

95
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,070
- It broke? Get a new one.<br>- I don't have money.

96
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,450
I will send you money. Where should I send it? Where are you?

97
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,750
Well... I want to focus on the dance,

98
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,980
so I won't have it fixed and will endure loneliness.

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,710
<i>Why are you talking like a trainee monk?</i>

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,590
Anyway, please trust me. This is a pay phone. Oh, I'll be running out of 10 yen coins.

101

<i>Hey, Chiyomi?</i>

102
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,450
It's going to run out.

103
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,720
<i>Chiyomi, hey. Chiyomi?</i>

104
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,650

105
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,090
I know.

106
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,950
But, I can't possibly tell them the truth.

107
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,880
I can't let them see how I am now.

108
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,790
You are enduring loneliness...

109
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,170
What?

110
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,030
You idiot, Minami-kun.

111
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,370
Idiot? Hey.

112
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm still weak after getting sick. Don't vent your anger on me.

113
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,710
I didn't vent my anger...

114
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,830
<i>Right. He was sick in bed with fever yesterday.</i>

115
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,370
<i>No. Stop it!</i>

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,570
<i>Minami-kun.</i>

117
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,210

120
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,160
<i>You are causing me such trouble. Idiot.</i>

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,170
<i>Minami-kun?</i>

122
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,170
<i>Idiot!</i>

123
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,420
<i>Eh? He is talking in his sleep?</i>

124
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,380
What's with you?

125
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,480
So, Horikiri-san is the only one absent.

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,280
You have to prepare for the college entrance exam. Take care of your health, okay?

127
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,300
Excuse me, Sensei.

128
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,400
Yes, Nomura-san?

129
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,260
Has Horikiri-san contacted you?

130
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,960
Her parents called me and said that she is still in Tokyo.

131
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,130
It's cold.

132
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,770
- May I have another one?<br>- Sure.

133
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,630
Amippe, why don't you eat this?

134
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,110
<i>Ouch.</i>

135
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,510
What? What's the matter, Riku?

136
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,040
Ah, I think I heard Horikiri-shi's voice.

137
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,790
Don't touch it!

138
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,470
Sorry.

139
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,050
What's the matter, Minami?

140
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,080
What's the matter with Minami?

141
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,610
<i>- He didn't have to get so mad.<br>- Scary.</i>

142
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,040
Ouch...

143
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,260
Are you okay?

144
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,050
I think I am. It hurts.

145
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,880
Minami-kun.

146
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,620
Minami!

147
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh. I finally found you.

148
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,790
Give me a break. Why do I have to do that?

149
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,790
So, I'm not asking you to come back to the kendo club. Just participate in one match.

150
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,100
That's not right. I have quit the kendo club already, you know.

151
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,250
Takatori got injured. Without him, we won't have enough people to participate in the competition.

152
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,090
Then, you don't have to participate in it.

153
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,970
Come on. We are fighting against Awa-Higashi High School.

154
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,790
Every year, freshmen join our club after watching the matches.

155
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,000
Just give up. I can't do it.

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,550
I'm begging you. If no freshmen joined us this year, the kendo club would be abolished.

157
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,720
Abolished?

158
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,220
The kendo club with a long history at Tateyama Daiichi High School would dissapper.

159
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,470
And, Awa-Higashi got a transfer student who finished 5th in the national competition last year.

160
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,130
5th in the national competition?

161
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,680
We can't beat him, but you might be able to win.

162
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,660
Even if you don't, you might have a good match with him.

163
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,080
I am begging you, Minami!

164
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,630
I am sorry. Ask someone else.

165
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,600
If there was someone else, I wouldn't be asking you.

166
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,000
I made up my mind to enter a med school right after graduation. I won't have time to participate in it.

167
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,660
Hey, Minami. Please! We are best friends, aren't we?

168
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,500
<i>I will call you later. I'll be waiting for you.</i>

Here you go.

171
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,430
What's wrong? You'd normally gobble it up.

172
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,670
Well...

173
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,740
You know...

174
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,830
Huh?

175
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:15,800
Every morning, you wake up early and go for a run. Then you practice swings, don't you?

176
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,260
That's to build up my stamina. I won't be able to survive the college entrance exams without it.

177
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,460
Why don't you participate in the match?

178
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,320
You heard me there...

179
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
Yabuki-kun is your best friend, isn't he?

180
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,540
He is not. He is just saying it himself.

181
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,180
I don't think you would fail the exam just by participating in the match for just one day.

182
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,240
I know you want to do kendo.

183
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,920
You are itching to do it!

184
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,450
Huh? What are you saying?

185
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,960
Are you scared, by any chance?

186
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,780
Scared?

187
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,170
You just don't want to find yourself being defeated by the opponent.

188
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,090
Shut up.

189
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,210
It's okay to be defeated. You haven't practiced kendo for a while.

190
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,030
It won't be uncool even if you were defeated because you have done your best on what you like.

191
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,590
I said, shut up!

192
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,330
The Minami-kun I love...

193
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,670
is not such a coward!

194
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,670
Umm... I didn't mean it...

195
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,470
Don't talk big.

196
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,420
I am sorry.

197
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,750
You can't do anything without me.

198
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,830
Minami-kun.

199
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,850
I was looking for you.

200
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,520
Nomura-san.

201
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,170
You often eat alone on the rooftop, don't you?

202
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,920
Umm... because it feels nice.

203
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,620
Then, I will eat with you here from now on.

204
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,510
Eh? Ah...

205
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,800
Hmm?

206
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,670
<i>I won't be able to eat if you do that.</i>

207
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,790
Ah, no.

208
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,460
Eh? Why?

209
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,940
By any chance, do you have someone else in mind?

210
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,790
Ah, no. That's not the case, but...

211
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,210
- Horikiri-san.<br>- Eh?

212
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,050
Did Horikiri-san really go to Tokyo?

213
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,370
Why are you asking me such a question?

214
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,550
I was just saying. Hey...

215
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,960
Can I see you after school today?

216
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,260

220
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,060
You don't have to answer it? It's been ringing several times.

221
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,260
Ah... It's okay.

222
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,300
Minami-kun. I don't understand this.

223
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,430
Where?

224
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,990
Eh?

225
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, Minami-kun.

Nomura?

227
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,250
You were hungry.

228
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
Ah, no...

229
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,450
To hide it, you had a fake cough like that.

230
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,250
Do you want to eat something?

231
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,090

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,810
Yeah.

233
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,590
Your father disappeared, right?

234
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,990
<i>Why does she have to ask such a thing?</i>

235
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,000
That is a taboo question to ask Minami-kun.

236
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,920
He didn't disappear...

237
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,170
He got a lover and left us. I don't consider him as my dad.

238
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,800
<i>Eh? Why are you telling that to her with no hesitation?</i>

239
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,790
I'm the same. The one who gave birth to me left us, too.

240
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,330
I don't consider her my mom.

241

<i>What's this atmosphere? It seems as if they understand each other without words.</i>

242
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,920
Well then.

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,260

Your dad influenced you to start kendo, right?

What are you saying, all of a sudden?

269
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,970
Even now, you practice swings every day even though you quit kendo for the college entrance exam.

270
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,090
Is it because you want to somehow stay connected with your dad who left you?

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,750
That's a lie.

276
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,750
Because you have changed so much since then.

277
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,080
Of course! My dad deserted and left my mom and grandma.

278
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,650

That is...

291
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,090
the real reason why you won't participate in the match, huh?

292
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,090
- You were up?<br>- I couldn't sleep for some reason.

Him?

300

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,940
No grudge?

303
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,170
Hmm. I wonder. I think there was a time I did.

304
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,310
I'm asking you seriously.

305
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,410
I'm sorry. Well...

Every day I have lived with all my might.

307
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,880
So, I had no time to have a grudge or anything.

308
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,420
You had no time?

309
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,070
Right. Of course I have had a hard time after he left me,

310
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,610
but I wouldn't have met you if I hadn't gotten married to Noboru-chan.

311
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,120
I wouldn't be living with your grandma like this, either.

312
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,660
So, that evens things up, you know.

313
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,840
That evens thing up?

314
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,290

After getting a point, he was doing a great job.

378
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:54,760
That izumi... he was so strong. We can't beat him.

Riku, I didn't know you had a special skill like this.
