1
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:05,263
Minako's boyfriend is a handsome boy
who was born in London!

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:07,199
But what do you know?!

3
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,468
A pretty older lady named
Katarina showed up.

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,104
What to do? What to do
with this love triangle?

5
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:15,807
Anyhow, anybody who makes
a girl in love cry,

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,436
in the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

8
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short
sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

10
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

12
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

13
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,808
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta no
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

16
00:01:57,022 --> 00:02:02,726
Sailor Venus's Past, Minako's Tragic Love

17
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,235
Let's see.

18
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,002
Not here...

19
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,838
Not here, either.

20
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,949
That leaves...

21
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,253
Sorry for being late.

22
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,347
Oh, I am dead tired.

23
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,258
How was it?

24
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,159
The Japanese confectionery
store we checked

25
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,492
wasn't the doorway to the
Dark Kingdom's hideout.

26
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,866
I see. So these aren't
the places either.

27
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,501
Monsters are being sent in

28
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,904
one after another from
the Dark Kingdom.

29
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,806
There has to be a doorway
for them somewhere.

30
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,475
Rei, how about the places
you guys checked?

31
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,375
No leads whatsoever.

32
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:54,941
Not one place that looked like
the entrance to a hideout.

33
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:57,182
That just leaves us with Minako.

34
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:59,084
I'm so tired!

35
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:02,988
Usagi, everyone's working hard,
so be a little more patient!

36
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,591
But, I'm starving!

37
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,360
What did you just eat
at that confectionery?

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,629
Three plates of sweet dumplings
and two cups of jelly with fruits!

39
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,324
It was yummy!

40
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:16,435
But that's not close to being enough!

41
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:18,537
You guys are pretty rowdy in here.

42
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:20,272
How was it?

43
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:21,874
Big disappointment.

44
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:25,110
We checked all the public baths
in Tokyo, but we found nothing!

45
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,513
I see. Thanks for your hard work.

46
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:30,215
Why don't we call it a night
and go home for today?

47
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,150
Good idea.

48
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,879
Usagi, we're going home!

49
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,753
What is this?!

50
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,626
This is...

51
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,931
It's the same as that other time.

52
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,566
What other time?

53
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,702
The way the sunspots are spreading...

54
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:53,305
It's just like when the Moon Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

55
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:54,499
What?!

56
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:59,042
When the sunspots blanket the sun,

57
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:03,409
I shall be brought back to life
from my eternal slumber.

58
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,884
Queen Metalia will be revived?

59
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,225
Once Queen Metalia is revived

60
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:17,457
and we get hold of the Silver Crystal,
the world will become mine.

61
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:21,367
The day you will hold the Silver
Crystal should not be too far away.

62
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,527
What?

63
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:26,071
I found somebody who knows
Sailor V's true identity.

64
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,299
What's this?

65
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,475
She is a policewoman,

66
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,944
who works for Interpol in England.

67
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:34,480
I received information
that she used to care

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,414
for Sailor V like a younger sister.

69
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:38,910
It sounds interesting.

70
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:43,789
Sailor V is certain to be related
to Sailor Moon in some way.

71
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,057
I will leave this matter to you.

72
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,217
Yes, my lady.

73
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,359
What is happening?!

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,107
This man possesses the same
wavelength of energy that I do.

75
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:11,279
He is worthy of inheriting my energy.

76
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:19,447
What's wrong?

77
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,450
Tuxedo Mask...

78
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,196
You must have had a bad dream again.

79
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,765
I understand how you feel, Usagi,

80
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,501
but it's bad for you if
you keep worrying.

81
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,504
You need to get enough sleep
and eat properly.

82
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:33,835
I know...

83
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:37,209
I have no problem with
eating properly, but...

84
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,344
I guess I just wasted my time
worrying about you.

85
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:43,872
Somehow, looking at the moon makes
dumplings taste better.

86
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,918
Oh, I'm so happy!

87
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,484
Sorry, Usagi!

88
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,596
What's wrong, Artemis?

89
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:00,399
It's terrible! Minako's disappeared!

90
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,535
Water... Give me water!

91
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,003
I wonder if she found the passage

92
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:07,172
that leads to the Dark
Kingdom's hideout?

93
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:08,907
Give me water!

94
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,210
If she did, she would take me with her.

95
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,609
Water!

96
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:15,247
Don't you have any idea
where she might be?

97
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:16,448
There is one thing.

98
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,746
She got a phone call from
a woman named Katarina.

99
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:21,846
This might have something to do
with that woman.

100
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,523
I thought I was gonna die!

101
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:28,053
Idiot.

102
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,300
Minako...

103
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,363
No, Sailor V.

104
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:45,810
I was surprised when I learned
that you were well.

105
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:53,016
Why didn't you let me know
that you were alive?

106
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:57,613
I hear you still transform into Sailor V
to do good deeds.

107
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,491
Yes.

108
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,527
I want to help you, too.

109
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,325
Say, you're friends with the
sailor warriors, aren't you?

110
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,794
Won't you introduce them to me?

111
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,559
What about Allan?
Is he doing all right?

112
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:13,198
Yes, he's fine.

113
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:26,114
Allan wanted to see you, too.

114
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,712
Katarina, I guess you kept
wearing that necklace.

115
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:36,890
Of course. You gave it to me
for my birthday, after all.

116
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,666
Anyway, I want to be of
some use to you, too.

117
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,260
Please, introduce me to
the sailor warriors.

118
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:50,209
Katarina, you are a great
international police officer,

119
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,871
but this is our problem.

120
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:55,846
I don't want to expose you to danger!

121
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,406
I'm glad I had a chance to see
you again. Thank you.

122
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,820
Good-bye!

123
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,082
Minako!

124
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:05,417
Wait!

125
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:09,855
Master Kunzite...

126
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,057
It does not seem more questioning
will help us.

127
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,166
Transform into the monster,
Papillon, and attack that girl!

128
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:26,770
Papillon!

129
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:36,716
Allan...

130
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:38,917
Minako...

131
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:43,155
Allan...

132
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,229
A butterfly at this time of year?

133
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,562
Who's there?!

134
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:56,932
If you died once, you should just
let me kill you!

135
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:59,467
You're a monster, aren't you?!
All right!

136
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:04,844
Venus Power Makeup!

137
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,665
What?! Minako was Sailor Venus?!

138
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:27,597
Crescent Beam!

139
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,075
You're wasting your time.

140
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:35,948
What?!

141
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,282
I know the way you fight. Take this!

142
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,693
I know your weaknesses,
inside and out!

143
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:59,065
You're Katarina? Why?

144
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:04,233
Now, tell me the identity
of your friends!

145
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,803
Katarina, please...

146
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:08,780
Sailor Venus!

147
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,978
Oh! What should I do?!
That monster looks tough!

148
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,123
Usagi, let's get on that thing
and get out of here!

149
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,359
What?! That's impossible!

150
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:23,428
I don't know how to pilot a boat!

151
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:25,931
Then, why don't you turn
into a sailor?!

152
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,865
Oh, right!

153
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,202
Okay, then!

154
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:36,072
Moon Power! Turn me into
a cute sailor!

155
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,867
Let's get out of here while we can!

156
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,061
Okay!

157
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,442
How did you find me here?

158
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:14,513
We hit all the hotels that had
a Katarina staying there.

159
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:16,415
Then, we found out she was staying at

160
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,645
the Hillside Hotel with
a view of the pier.

161
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:23,719
Where did they go?! I won't
let them escape!

162
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,893
Anyway, we have to...

163
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,485
It's coming!

164
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:58,089
All right, time to go full speed ahead!

165
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,161
It looks like we'll make it!

166
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,822
Usagi, thanks a lot!

167
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:06,322
No problem!

168
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:13,068
Usagi, let's find shelter in that luxury
liner anchored over there!

169
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,036
Roger!

170
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,183
I can't go any further!

171
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:34,660
Quit dragging your feet!

172
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,563
You were just sitting on my head!

173
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,326
Anyway, let's hide somewhere!

174
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,832
Where are they hiding?

175
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,315
It looks like there's nobody
here, after all.

176
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:58,084
But don't let your guard down.

177
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:01,247
The monster is aware that
we got on this ship.

178
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:06,292
By the way, Venus, you were
calling that monster Katarina.

179
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,850
Just who is she?

180
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,433
Luna, sometimes, there are things
people don't want to talk about.

181
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,730
It's okay.

182
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,266
It's okay.

183
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,504
It was just about six months ago.

184
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,144
I got information

185
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:28,181
that one of the Dark Kingdom's
monsters was in England,

186
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,876
so I went to London.

187
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,591
There, I fell in love with Allan,
whom I'd met.

188
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,632
Then, one day, I came across
a crime in progress.

189
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,010
Wow!

190
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,581
It's amazing!

191
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,949
Thank you!

192
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:52,523
After that, we became good friends.

193
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,303
She taught me English

194
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,464
and acted as my confidante too.

195
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:06,574
I adored her like a big sister.

196
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,379
And she took care of me like
I was her younger sister.

197
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:20,325
Katarina! Allan! Hurry!

198
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,799
I also introduced Allan to Katarina

199
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,767
and the three of us had
a lot of fun together.

200
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,303
Then, one day...

201
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,734
Minako!

202
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,023
Allan...

203
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:27,982
Allan, Minako was... Minako was...

204
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,456
What happened to Minako?!

205
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:36,928
Be strong. You have me.

206
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,445
That was when I first realized

207
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:49,642
that without my knowing it,
Allan and Katarina had...

208
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,044
I disappeared from both their lives.

209
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,388
I thought it would be happier for them
if I just pretended that I was dead.

210
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:01,394
So, you came back to Japan and...

211
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:04,130
You devoted yourself to fighting
against the enemy

212
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,462
to try to forget those sad memories.

213
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,725
No!

214
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,708
I don't like that. That's so terrible.

215
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,902
Usagi...

216
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,786
Are you so happy you're going
to be killed by me

217
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,754
that you're crying?

218
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:32,024
This place will be your grave!

219
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,059
I'm in a bad mood right now!

220
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,084
You better watch out or you'll get hurt!

221
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:40,429
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

222
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:18,596
What?! You are Sailor Moon?!

223
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,870
At this point, I don't care if
you found out who I am!

224
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:30,944
I'm a sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

225
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,051
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

226
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,845
Enough of your nonsense!

227
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:47,132
I won't run away today!

228
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:51,034
I'll never forgive anybody who crushes
an innocent girl's love!

229
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,128
Die!

230
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:02,209
Moon Tiara Action!

231
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,208
Please save her!

232
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,197
What?

233
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,712
She was turned into a monster
because of me!

234
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:37,116
She knew I was a sailor warrior.

235
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:39,744
That's why the Dark Kingdom used her.

236
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:44,615
None of this is her fault!

237
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,785
You adored her like your own sister
and she betrayed you!

238
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:51,289
Please help her.

239
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:55,868
But she stole your boyfriend!

240
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:57,267
He...

241
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:01,499
But she's the person Allan
fell in love with.

242
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:07,773
Please.

243
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,739
Okay, then!

244
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,523
Moon Healing Escalation!

245
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,657
Refresh!

246
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:32,964
Katarina!

247
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,173
Katarina!

248
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:42,844
Minako...

249
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,616
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,551
It's okay.

251
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:54,985
I didn't know your feelings.

252
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:59,187
I thought you were still a child.

253
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,129
I'm sorry.

254
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,062
It's okay.

255
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:15,743
What in the world happened to
Minako?

256
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:18,082
She looks so sad.

257
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:22,184
Shouldn't we go to her side?

258
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:24,990
We should just let her be by herself.

259
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,150
What?

260
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,288
Because Minako is much more
grown up than we are.

261
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,195
This is how it should be.

262
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,476
Because the person he chose
is Katarina.

263
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:50,781
As long as they're happy,
that's all that matters.

264
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,247
That's all that matters.

265
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:14,961
