00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute

00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
Shikou kairo wa short

00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:08,313
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight

00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:14,754
Datte junjou dou shiyou

00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:22,294
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

6
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,774
Seiza no matataki kazoe

8
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
Onaji kuni ni umareta

9
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:49,153
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

10
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:57,838
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

11
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:00,207
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

12
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,543
and fight against bad guys.

13
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:06,843
I'm the sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

14
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:12,445
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno

15
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:15,779
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

16
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:19,160
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,094
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

18
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:32,069
A Powerful New Enemy!
Nephrite's Evil Crest

19
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,568
Jadeite randomly stole
energy from anybody.

20
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,746
If you ask me, that is a ridiculous
way to take care of business.

21
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,584
Really?

22
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,486
Then Nephrite, how would you do it?

23
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:52,259
I will not go after big groups
of people like Jadeite did.

24
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,525
I will show you that I can get enough
energy from one individual.

25
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,431
Is that so?

26
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,469
All humans are controlled by
the movement of the stars.

27
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,903
And every one of them
has their own fate.

28
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,039
The same is true of their energy.

29
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:10,405
Each human has a moment in their
life when their energy level peaks.

30
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:13,547
In short, I will read the movement
of the stars

31
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:17,449
and go after the humans when their
energy level has peaked.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,315
You seem very confident.

33
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:24,189
Zoisite, why are you here?

34
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:27,190
Overconfidence can be your downfall.

35
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:29,629
Go away!

36
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,666
I will infiltrate the human world

37
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,361
and take advantage of
their weaknesses.

38
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,204
I do not need advice from you!

39
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:42,164
I can picture you throwing yourself
at Queen Beryl's mercy.

40
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:45,501
Ooh, how scary.

41
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:50,974
Nephrite, I leave this
in your hands.

42
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:53,753
Oh, there she is!

43
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,726
Rui, how are you doing?

44
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,453
Do you think you can win the
next tournament?

45
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,398
I don't know.

46
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,971
Everyone in Japan is cheering for you.
Please say something!

47
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,438
Sorry, but I have practice.

48
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,022
The stars know everything.

49
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:46,764
O stars, grant me your
mysterious powers.

50
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:06,393
The proud Sagittarius, Chiron,

51
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:09,385
is about to fire his arrow at the
center of the Milky Way.

52
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,289
The target that Sagittarius
has chosen...

53
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:19,799
Rui Saionji, I will take your energy.

54
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,545
Saionji, go for it!

55
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:24,912
Saionji!
Saionji, go for it!

56
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,140
Saionji!

57
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:34,017
Yeah! She did it!

58
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:37,049
Rui, sister, you're the best!

59
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,762
I never knew.

60
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:42,596
Knew what?

61
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:42,930
That Rui was your older sister.
Knew what?

62
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,600
That Rui was your older sister.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,701
Huh?

64
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:48,102
I will punish you if you keep
secrets from your friend!
Huh?

65
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:51,238
I will punish you if you keep
secrets from your friend!

66
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:52,606
You're so stupid, Usagi.

67
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:52,706
Stu...
You're so stupid, Usagi.

68
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:52,740
Stu...

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,407
Stu...
Stu...

70
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:53,774
Stu...

71
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:56,877
That's mean, Naru! You didn't
have to go that far!

72
00:05:56,877 --> 00:06:00,745
I'm an only child. Besides, we
have different surnames.

73
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,519
That's true. But didn't you
just call Rui your sister?

74
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:13,083
Well, Rui's mother has been a good
customer at our store for a long time.

75
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:17,022
So, we've been playing together
since we were little.

76
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:33,914
She's only a year older than me, but
she's been like a big sister to me.

77
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,506
Oh, so that's why.

78
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,128
Wow, he's gorgeous!

79
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:49,527
Oh my god, you're right!

80
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,399
I heard that he's a
successful businessman.

81
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,200
Do you know him?

82
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,767
He's supposed to be the president
of a company
Do you know him?

83
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,402
He's supposed to be the president
of a company

84
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,303
that was established around
here recently.

85
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:56,603
That was established around
here recently.
Wow!

86
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:57,262
Wow!

87
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,338
He's so handsome!

88
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:15,285
Please don't enter the court
without permission!

89
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,354
Use your weight more
when you hit the ball!

90
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,024
What?!

91
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:25,766
Your racket, please.

92
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,166
Here...
Your racket, please.

93
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,224
Here...

94
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,993
Okay, try now!

95
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,051
Rui!

96
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,611
A fly could land on
a serve like that.

97
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,222
Who are you?

98
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:54,892
Masato Sanjoin, just
an eccentric coach.

99
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,833
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:08,272
My loyal monster,
possess this racket,

101
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:13,473
bring Rui Saionji's energy to
its peak level and steal it!

102
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,123
Just think of putting your
weight behind the ball.

103
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,127
Yes, Sir.

104
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,764
Someone come receive her serve!

105
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,335
Me, me! I'll do it!

106
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,737
When did he get in there?!

107
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:38,472
First come, first serve!

108
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:41,441
Miss Saionji, I'm ready any
time you are!

109
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,291
Amazing!

110
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,521
Did you see that?! It's amazing!

111
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,728
Thank you so much...

112
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,602
The more you use that racket,

113
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,838
the more your energy will grow.

114
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,711
Oh, shoot!

115
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:29,388
It feels good.

116
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:30,990
She's so cool!

117
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,691
Something's not right with Rui.

118
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:37,023
Jubancho
Shopping District

119
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,297
Code name 0091. This is Luna.

120
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,936
My secret password is "The rabbit
on the moon makes rice cakes."

121
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,338
Please respond.

122
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,573
"The moon rice cakes are sticky."

123
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,598
"When I grilled them,
they puffed up."

124
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,612
I have found out who the enemy is.

125
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,380
What? Really?

126
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,915
Of course!

127
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,216
Right.

128
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:56,416
The name of the enemy organization
is the Dark Kingdom.
Right.

129
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,852
The name of the enemy organization
is the Dark Kingdom.

130
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:04,958
They seem to be after human
energy for some reason.

131
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:07,789
Human energy?

132
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,460
Hikawa Shrine

133
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,521
Dark Kingdom...

134
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:16,359
We have to brace ourselves
to get these guys.

135
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,632
Let's go after them and crush
them with one blow!

136
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:22,904
The way we are now, we aren't
capable of that yet.

137
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,507
Exactly! Right now, you need to study
more and make yourselves more fit.

138
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:32,410
I know! How about playing tennis
to make ourselves more fit?!

139
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:38,589
There's this super-cool coach
named Mr. Masato Sanjoin.

140
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:44,857
I see. So, you're going to give
up on Tuxedo Mask?

141
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,598
I didn't think about it like that.

142
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,666
That is a problem...

143
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,700
I'm glad I have Ami and Rei.

144
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,809
If Usagi was all I had,

145
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:01,213
the Dark Kingdom would have stolen
all of mankind's energy by now.

146
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:02,649
What?!

147
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:03,083
Maybe it's some kind of mistake that
Usagi is a member of our group.
What?!

148
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,018
Maybe it's some kind of mistake that
Usagi is a member of our group.

149
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:08,822
What's with you?! What's with you?!
What's with you?!

150
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:11,224
Both of you, you're going too far.

151
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:14,561
Ami! Ami, you're all I've got!

152
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:17,223
You're the only one who
understands me!

153
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:21,602
So, why don't the two
of us play tennis?

154
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:24,935
Oh, but I have cram school. Sorry.

155
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:26,532
Knew it!

156
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,383
Miss Saionji...

157
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:45,715
What's wrong? If it's about the racket,
I already gave you another one.

158
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,860
Let's keep going.

159
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,431
Yes...

160
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:54,798
Rui, you weren't like this before.

161
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,257
Jewelry

162
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,495
I'm sorry for the short notice.

163
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:22,122
That's okay, I don't mind.

164
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:24,430
You have something on your mind?

165
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:29,602
Well, I don't know what to say.
I'm just worried about Rui.

166
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,304
Now, she misuses tennis
equipment and things.

167
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,442
She never did things
like that before.

168
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,409
It's like she's a totally
different person.

169
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:43,445
Maybe she's just tense because the
important tournament's coming up.

170
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:48,047
That's what I thought at first,
but that's not it.

171
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:54,222
I wonder what's happened to her?

172
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,287
Rui, did something happen?

173
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,296
If there's anything I can help
you with, just let me know.

174
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:28,796
This is none of your business.
If there's anything I can help
you with, just let me know.

175
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,491
This is none of your business.

176
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,533
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,838
I don't know why Rui
would act like that.

178
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,501
I think maybe something
terrible has happened to her,

179
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,240
but she won't say anything to me.

180
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:48,415
I see.

181
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,688
Hey, Naru. Why don't we
investigate what happened?

182
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:55,417
I will help you!

183
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,257
Usagi...

184
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,324
Cheer up!

185
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:08,402
Is this the tennis
school Rui goes to?

186
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:12,361
Yeah. She practices
here after school.

187
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:14,742
What's wrong?

188
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:15,376
Oh, nothing!
What's wrong?

189
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,343
Oh, nothing!

190
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,707
I have a bad feeling about this.

191
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,882
This couldn't be the work
of a monster, could it?

192
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:24,452
Oh, but if I do a good job here,

193
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:27,114
I can get back at Luna and Rei.

194
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:29,956
Usagi...

195
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,796
Hey, are you all right?

196
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,263
What a ball!

197
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:40,696
What's wrong? You're both pros!

198
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,829
You should be able to hit this!

199
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,064
Please give us a break!

200
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,108
Okay, here comes the next one!

201
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,416
Stop!

202
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,087
Out of my way!

203
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:00,521
No! Please stop acting
like this, Rui!
Out of my way!

204
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:03,456
No! Please stop acting
like this, Rui!

205
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,058
Get out of my way, Naru!

206
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,195
No!

207
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:07,628
Naru is worried about you!
No!

208
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,029
Naru is worried about you!

209
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,466
Move!

210
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,596
Move!

211
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,712
The energy level is at its peak.
Go, Tesnie!

212
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,308
Your energy is mine now!

213
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:02,747
It was a monster after all! Okay!

214
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,082
It's time to show them what
you've got, Usagi!

215
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:09,948
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

216
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,662
A monster can never
aim for the ace!

217
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,797
Misusing tennis for evil deeds...

218
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,165
I bet even Navratilova
is crying now!

219
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:59,668
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

220
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,172
Sailor Moon!

221
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:10,712
In the name of the moon, I
will punish you!

222
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:13,181
Impudent girl!

223
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,237
What is this?!

224
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:31,966
This is so sad!

225
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:37,835
It's so high!

226
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,548
I should have come here
with everybody!

227
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:45,712
You look good out there!

228
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:03,863
Who's there?!

229
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,680
Tuxedo Mask!

230
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,382
If you interfere with me,
you will end up like her!

231
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,652
It looks fun. Why don't you try it?

232
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:26,092
You fool. Then you can find out
for yourself if it's really fun!

233
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,581
You're so cool, Tuxedo Mask!

234
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,118
He did it! Oh?

235
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,485
Thank you so much!

236
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:02,930
Don't let your guard down!

237
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,330
Okay!
Don't let your guard down!

238
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,092
Okay!

239
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,232
Why you...

240
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,168
Watch out!

241
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:07,802
Yes!
Watch out!

242
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:08,234
Yes!

243
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:11,434
I never thought I'd get to fight
with Tuxedo Mask.

244
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:13,462
I'm so happy!

245
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,241
Take this!

246
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:19,513
There! There! There! There!

247
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:19,547
And this and this and this!

248
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,015
What is this?! Hey, stop it!
And this and this and this!

249
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:21,415
What are you going to do
if it hits me?!
And this and this and this!

250
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,747
What are you going to do
if it hits me?!

251
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:40,968
We'll finish her now!

252
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:41,135
Okay.
We'll finish her now!

253
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,432
Okay.

254
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:45,638
Die!

255
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,349
Now!

256
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:58,319
Sailor Moon!

257
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:58,652
Yes!
Sailor Moon!

258
00:19:58,652 --> 00:19:59,550
Yes!

259
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:05,926
Tuxedo Mask, are you all right?!

260
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,757
Do not worry about me!
Use your tiara, quickly!

261
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,733
Got it!

262
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:31,941
Moon Tiara Action!

263
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,214
Sailor Moon!

264
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:00,581
Not too bad!
Sailor Moon!

265
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:01,673
Not too bad!

266
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,880
I guess it means she's
growing up a little.

267
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,844
Oh, he's not there!

268
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,819
I wonder if Tuxedo
Mask is all right?

269
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:16,629
Juban Municipal Junior High School

270
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:21,793
Rui said she doesn't remember
anything she did.

271
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,295
Well, at least she's doing fine
now, so it's good, right?

272
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,006
Yeah, that's true.

273
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:30,642
Naru, do you want to play a little?

274
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:33,780
Sure, I guess if it's just a little.

275
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,552
Go easy on me, okay?

276
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:40,315
Oh, I can't do that!

277
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:44,024
Naru, you can serve first!

278
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:47,255
Okay, then I'll give you my
lethal magic serve!

279
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,093
I'll bet it'd be fun to play tennis
with Tuxedo Mask.

280
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,531
Sorry, Usagi!

281
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,310
Usagi, please wake up!

282
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:12,942
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne
