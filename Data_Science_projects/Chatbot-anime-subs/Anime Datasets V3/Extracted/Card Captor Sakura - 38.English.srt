1
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,683
Ah, Tomoyo-chan,
isn’t that the strawberry house?

2
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:11,478
It seems so!

3
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:30,396
This entire place
is the strawberry house!

4
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,897
This is so cool!

5
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:39,070
This is where we’ll pick
our strawberries in the morning.

6
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,673
And you can eat while you pick!

7
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,651
It’d be nice if we end up
with lots of strawberries!

8
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,481
I’m sure Yukito-san can eat a lot

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,287
If he had come!

10
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,224
I’m going to bring him some as gifts.

11
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,619
Yu-ki-to-san.

12
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,829
Kinomoto-san.

13
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:02,794
He… Here!

14
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,004
If you’re so slow,
you’ll get left behind.

15
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:09,532
I’m sorry.

16
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,444
Come to think of it,

17
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,008
are there strawberry hunts
in Hong Kong too?

18
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,381
You know, about strawberry hunts…

19
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,879
Strawberries were originated
from South America.

20
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,715
In the old days,
it’s not easy to eat strawberries.

21
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:26,291
It is because

22
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,324
Strawberries used to be different

23
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,292
and had legs to run around,

24
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:33,193
so people weren’t
able to catch a lot of them.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,434
And for those people who wanted to eat
strawberries no matter what,

26
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,142
they would chase
after the strawberries,

27
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,868
which is how the name
‘strawberry hunt’…

28
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,507
Okay, okay, okay…

29
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:50,116
In order for them not to run,

30
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:51,851
strawberries were somehow
changed to what they are…

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,044
All these lies…

32
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:55,351
That was a lie?

33
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:59,817
I could tell right from the start.

34
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:05,966
[Sakura’s Merry Strawberry Hunt]

35
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,799
You will be using these containers

36
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:17,438
to pick your strawberries.

37
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:18,578
Okay!

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,745
Let’s do our best!

39
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:23,944
I promised Kero that I’ll bring

40
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,312
lots of them back as presents.

41
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,386
Oh, so this is the strawberry
park Sakura’s going’ to.

42
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,192
What?!

43
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,056
You can eat while you pick?!

44
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,199
So that means you can eat non-stop?

45
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,534
This is so good!

46
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,608
It’s no use just drooling
over these pictures…

47
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,108
The more I see,
the more the feeling of vain.

48
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,347
Sakura, hurry back!!

49
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,044
In the afternoon,

50
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,946
we will show you a video in the materials
room separated from the rest of the park.

51
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:02,680
It will focus on

52
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,591
how to make strawberry cakes
and desserts.

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,090
We will then follow some
of the examples

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,524
and put them in practice.

55
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,326
I hope you will enjoy it.

56
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,531
Yes!

57
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,368
Make cakes and desserts
with strawberries…

58
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,733
I wonder how it’s done.

59
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,238
Let us try to make some then!

60
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,343
Now this gentleman

61
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,305
will lead the way into the house.

62
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:28,481
And make sure you take
class notes afterwards, okay?

63
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:29,613
Okay!

64
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:31,850
Let’s go!

65
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,583
Oh, are you okay?

66
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:39,352
Yu… Yukito-san!

67
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:41,986
Sakura-chan?

68
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,623
Why are you here?

69
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,229
Good afternoon.

70
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,329
Good afternoon.

71
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,700
Isn’t that Sakura?

72
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:50,703
Onii-chan! What are you doing here?

73
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:51,961
Why are you in here?

74
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,342
I had it written clearly on the board,

75
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:55,802
that I have no school today

76
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,009
and I’m going to work part-time.

77
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,043
And so, I came along.

78
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,542
Yukito-san is here…

79
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,351
What’s wrong, Sakura-chan?

80
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,622
Oh yeah!

81
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,589
Do you like strawberry
cakes and desserts?

82
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,693
Yeah. I like them.

83
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,000
They’re teaching us how
to make them here!

84
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,166
I’ll do my best at it!

85
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:31,406
Umm… Would you like… to have some?

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,212
Of course!

87
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,350
I must get going!

88
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:40,618
Good-bye.

89
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,351
Sakura-chan is full of
energy today too.

90
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,027
Yeah, I guess she is.

91
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,599
I’ve gotta pick lots and
lots of strawberries!

92
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:06,139
It seems Sakura-chan

93
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,244
really loves to go on
school trips and camps.

94
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,252
But she seems especially happier
than usual today, don’t you think?

95
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,256
This is the place

96
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,360
the house supervisor mentioned before
– the materials room.

97
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,891
He said it was converted
from an old storehouse.

98
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:34,639
Let’s eat a lot.

99
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:43,416
Hey, what’s wrong, Shao Lan?

100
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,280
Let’s hurry!

101
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,681
Strawberries! Strawberries!
Strawberries!

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,077
How is it going? Did you pick a lot?

103
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,184
Yukito-san!

104
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,286
What’s wrong?

105
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,154
I want to pick tasty strawberries

106
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:26,289
but they all look

107
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:27,585
tasty to me.

108
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,625
Those tasty strawberries

109
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:35,828
First, you want to look for
very green leaves on top.

110
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,928
Then, the whole strawberry must be red,

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,367
without any white around the calyx.

112
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,672
You know a lot.

113
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,607
That’s what they told me.

114
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,107
Something you have to know
when you work here.

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,518
Oh, hold there.

116
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,247
This is what you should do
when you pick strawberries.

117
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:00,453
Hold the strawberry from underneath

118
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,557
and put your fingers
over the green calyx.

119
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:06,293
Then, break it gently on the stem.

120
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,292
I… I see…

121
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,102
What a nice shot!

122
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,136
To… Tomoyo-chan!

123
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:19,911
Li!

124
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:21,742
Are these… for me?

125
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,912
Yuki, it’s break time.

126
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,365
We picked so much!

127
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,571
It will be fun from now on too.

128
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,974
We’ll be making desserts
with these strawberries.

129
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:56,772
Maybe I’ll make some

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,643
and bring them to Mr. Terada-sensei.

131
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,246
Then I’ll make some for Yamazaki too.

132
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,819
Then I better pray again.

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,827
Why?

134
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:09,426
To make sure again
that I’ll be okay afterwards.

135
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,621
What did you say? Geez!

136
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,761
What did you mean by that?!

137
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,695
But it’s the first time I make it,

138
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,870
so I’m a little worried
how it’ll turn out.

139
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:19,000
Me too.

140
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:21,133
Here. ‘Aaaahh… ’

141
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,539
I’ll eat it myself.

142
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,175
That’s great.

143
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,513
Mei Lin, did you make
them all by yourself?

144
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,386
That’s right. I made them
the best I could

145
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,215
just for today.

146
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,454
Here. Say ‘Ahh… ’

147
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:41,992
I said I’ll eat it myself.

148
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,060
They look so good!

149
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,863
Don’t they? Wanna try some?

150
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,729
Are you sure?

151
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:48,969
Please help yourself.

152
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,099
Then, I’m eating!

153
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,875
Tastes so good!
Mei Lin, you’re really good at cooking!

154
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:02,482
I guess. No dish is ever
too hard for me!

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,421
I wish I can cook

156
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:09,645
as well as Mei Lin.

157
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,619
Then, for Yukito-san, I can…

158
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,457
Hey, have you heard?

159
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,765
They say the plans
for the afternoon have changed.

160
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,266
Why?!

161
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,970
I heard they couldn’t open the door

162
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,209
to the materials room
for this afternoon!

163
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,403
No way!

164
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:32,737
Strawberry desserts…

165
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,977
Where is the materials room?

166
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,180
Oh, it’s that storeroom along
the path we took to get here.

167
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,446
They really couldn’t open it?

168
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,520
Lem me go take a look.

169
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,786
I will go with you!

170
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:53,734
Shao Lan?

171
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:00,271
I wonder why they can’t open it.

172
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,342
It opens!

173
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,813
It seems everything is ready.

174
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,052
Then we should let the instructor know,
don’t you think?

175
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:18,590
Be careful!

176
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,926
Can’t you sense it?

177
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:26,793
It feels strange in here…

178
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,217
Sakura’s new class teacher

179
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,308
is called Mizuki-sensei, right?

180
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:51,216
You knew her before, right? Touya…

181
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,762
Or should I not ask?

182
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:58,655
I’ll tell you later.

183
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,762
Come to think of it, what are
Sakura-chan and the others
going to do this afternoon?

184
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,568
The materials room wouldn’t open, right?

185
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:13,144
Yeah. They couldn’t open the door
somehow, it seems…

186
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:18,251
Sakura-chan, she was so
looking forward to the afternoon.

187
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,887
It’s no use. It won’t open at all.

188
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:29,730
Leave it to me!

189
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,490
Don’t do it, Mei Lin!

190
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,371
It hurts…

191
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,409
Are you okay? Mei Lin-chan?

192
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,357
I can sense… a Clow Card.

193
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,020
I’m afraid, it’s the card, Lock.

194
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,960
Lock? Like a padlock?

195
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:09,499
And it has placed

196
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,370
a lock in this building.

197
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,304
What’s worse, this is a special card.

198
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,503
Even I don’t know to capture it.

199
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,836
A special card means not even

200
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,647
Windy, Watery,

201
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,539
and Firey would work…?

202
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,383
That’s right.

203
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,382
Oh no!

204
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,753
I have an idea.

205
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,349
How about asking Kero-chan
for some suggestions?

206
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,555
That’s right!

207
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:51,776
Condensed milk, condensed milk.

208
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,510
Double the sweetness!

209
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,710
Kero-chan’s not picking it up.

210
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,314
Just when we have a problem too! Geez.

211
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:04,888
We are in trouble.

212
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:06,955
This is the place!

213
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,026
This is no use.
It won’t open after all.

214
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:12,590
This is too bad.

215
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,194
Anyone over there?

216
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,197
Isn’t that Mei Lin-chan’s voice?

217
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,395
Are you in there?

218
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:22,338
Help us! The door won’t open!

219
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,511
We’re all trapped in here!

220
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:31,941
Don’t call the others.

221
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,184
But if it’s just us, we can’t get out!

222
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:36,654
But do you think

223
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,822
it’ll really open if
they try to open from the outside?

224
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:41,056
Besides,
if you call other people here,

225
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,193
we can’t use magic.

226
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:45,224
And then, she won’t be able to seal it.

227
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,804
Rika-chan and the others have left.

228
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:55,605
If we don’t hurry,

229
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,343
the teachers will get here.

230
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,275
Before that happens,

231
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,114
we must find a way to solve this.

232
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,284
But how?

233
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,618
If it’s a lock,

234
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,690
the right key should open it.

235
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,691
In order the open Lock,

236
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,898
there must be a magical key somewhere.

237
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,029
That’s possible!

238
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,009
It’s just like that time with Maze.

239
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,473
Because we’re within
the card’s domain like last time.

240
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,509
It cannot tell where it is.

241
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,317
What should we do?

242
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,487
In the meantime, we have
no other way but to look for it.

243
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,191
They were locked in?!

244
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,926
Yes.

245
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:51,896
Let’s go!

246
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:54,933
I’m going with you!

247
00:14:57,638 --> 00:14:58,605
Geez.

248
00:14:58,906 --> 00:14:59,998
What a troublemaker.

249
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,404
Have you told your teacher yet?

250
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,947
No, Mizuki-sensei isn’t around.

251
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,041
Chiharu-chan went
around looking for her

252
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,543
but couldn’t find her anywhere…

253
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:18,586
I cannot find it.

254
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:20,659
Geez,

255
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,156
where is it already?!

256
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,327
It’s not here either.

257
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,408
People are coming!

258
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,410
Watch out!

259
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,837
Mizuki-sensei?

260
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:14,346
Gimme your hand!

261
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,177
Li-kun!

262
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:20,283
Just now I saw
Mizuki-sensei outside the window.

263
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:21,382
What?!

264
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,621
It seems she was trying
to tell me something…

265
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:41,604
This is it! This!

266
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,868
If I try this on the lock…

267
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,318
They’re okay.

268
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:01,393
Kaho…

269
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,462
It’ll opens now.

270
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,920
What’s wrong?!

271
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,332
You can’t get away!

272
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,770
Before Lock hides away,

273
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,039
hurry!

274
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,504
Release!

275
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,581
Return to thy form
which thou should be!

276
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,921
Clow Card!

277
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:33,080
Hey! Sakura!

278
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,953
Onii-chan!

279
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:39,723
Are you okay?

280
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,296
Thank goodness,
Sakura-chan.

281
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:46,091
Are you okay?

282
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,631
Sorry to make you guys worry.

283
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:53,167
With this, we can probably resume
the original plans for the afternoon.

284
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,211
But…

285
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,551
This is all messed up.

286
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,760
If everyone helps clean up,
it’ll be okay.

287
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:16,860
Right?

288
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:18,860
Right!

289
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,327
Huh? Where’s Sakura-chan?

290
00:19:58,672 --> 00:19:59,639
She is outside.

291
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,203
I’m glad the materials room opened.

292
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,315
Yuki…

293
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,652
What is it?

294
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:20,892
Forget it.

295
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,129
Sakura-chan!

296
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:29,564
Hmm… These are…

297
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,496
Are you sure?

298
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:33,434
Yes!

299
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,600
Thanks, Sakura-chan.

300
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:45,977
It tastes really good.

301
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,057
In other words,

302
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,517
it was a really fun outing.

303
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:03,162
I was really happy. Yu-ki-to-san!

304
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:05,871
Oh, I’m glad for ya.

305
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:10,009
So, how about some presents for me

306
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:11,904
who stayed home and behaved so well?

307
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,880
Don’t tell me
you gave all that dessert

308
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,911
to that snow-rabbit guy…
(Yukito = snow-rabbit)

309
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:32,761
Ac… Actually that was it.

310
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,098
How dare you?!!

311
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,168
I… I didn’t forget about you.

312
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,339
But Yukito-san
was enjoying it so much,

313
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:46,112
I couldn’t ask him
to save some…

314
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,110
so…

315
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:49,579
Unforgivable!

316
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,219
You’re such a fool!

317
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,212
I’m so sorry!
