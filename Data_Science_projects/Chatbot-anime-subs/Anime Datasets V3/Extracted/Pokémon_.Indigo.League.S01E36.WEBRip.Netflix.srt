00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,174
Never felt better. Everything's fine.

184
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,761
[chomping]

185
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,847
[groans]

186
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,059
[both] Hm?

187
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,921
[Misty]<i> This place must be perfect</i>
<i>for those Pikachu.</i>

188
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,423
[Brock]<i> I think it's the best thing</i>
<i>in the world for Pikachu</i>

189
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,885
<i>to be here with its own kind.</i>

190
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,098
Here with its own kind.

191
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,315
Oh! Aw. Hmm.

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,902
-[shrieking]
-Huh?

193
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,237
[both gasp]

194
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,530
Wha..? What is that sound?

195
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,953
-Pika.
-Pi.

196
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,416
[all squeaking]

197
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,545
-They're trapped.
-Who could have done this to them?

198
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,380
Pikachu! Pikachu!

199
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,340
Pika, pi! Pikachu!

200
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,759
[Groans] Who's there?

201
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,345
[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.

202
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,013
[James] Make it double.

203
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,683
Those voices.

204
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,726
[Jessie and James laugh]

205
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,312
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation...

206
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,731
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation...

207
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,900
[Jessie]
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

208
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,735
[James]
To extend our reach to the stars above...

209
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,112
Jessie.

210
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,572
James.

211
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,700
[Jessie] Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

212
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,828
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

213
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,288
Meowth.

214
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,165
[all] Team Rocket!

215
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,207
[all] That's right!

216
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,711
We'd like to thank all of our fans
for their loyalty and support.

217
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,337
This victory is for them.

218
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,507
And now you're about to witness
Team Rocket's finest performance.

219
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,635
Cut the speeches,
and let's swipe these Pikachu. Ha!

220
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,721
You're not swiping anything.

221
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,265
Pikachu, break the ropes
with an electric shock.

222
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,518
Pi. Pikachu!

223
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,187
[gasps] Pika, pika.

224
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,231
[Meowth laughing]

225
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,651
They're no match for our new
Pikachu-insulated seizure net.

226
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,570
You might as well just give up.

227
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,031
It's made
from environmentally-safe material

228
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,449
that absorbs electricity.

229
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,411
-That's very thoughtful of you.
-Let those Pikachu go now.

230
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,371
[all] Nyah-nyah.

231
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,916
[groans] We've got to save the Pikachu.

232
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,000
-Yeah!
-Right!

233
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,253
Why don't you check out our website?

234
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,548
[all yelling]

235
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,884
Hey, let us out of this stupid thing!

236
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,595
You're not going to get away with this!
[laughs]

237
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,138
Time to make our exit.

238
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,890
-[both] Roger!
-[Ash] Wait!

239
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:09,354
[all Pikachu screaming]

240
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,314
Oh! Pikachu!

241
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,941
Pika, pi!

242
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,734
It's a Pika-palooza.

243
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,527
We're at the "pika" our powers.

244
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,571
"Chu" can say that again, Jess.

245
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,906
[all laughing]

246
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,621
[all gnawing]

247
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,915
Ah. It's good to be on top.

248
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,126
Wha... We got a pika problem down below.

249
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,586
[both] What?

250
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,296
[Jessie] Huh?

251
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,090
-[James] Quit it!
-[Jessie] Hey! Stop that!

252
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,425
-[James] Pikachus, cut it out. Stop.
-[Meowth] What are you doing? Hold it.

253
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,345
[Jessie] Quit it! Stop!

254
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,098
Pika!

255
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,101
Ah! It's coming.

256
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,103
-Ooh. Huh? Ooh!
Catch it, James!

257
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,646
There, grab it.

258
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,730
[grunting]

259
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,358
All right, we're free!

260
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,235
Watch out, Team Rocket.

261
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,239
Hey, Pikachu, jump onto this!

262
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,532
Hurry up!

263
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,993
Pika!

264
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,245
Chu!

265
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,663
All right, that's the way.

266
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,707
Come on, keep on jumping!

267
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,459
Pika! Chu!

268
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,669
Pika!

269
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,005
Chu!

270
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,631
Chu!

271
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,800
Pika!

272
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
Pika! Chu!

273
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,971
-Pikachu.
-Chu!

274
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,389
Pika!

275
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,141
Pika.

276
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,767
Pikachu.

277
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,978
[grunting] This rodent's bugging me.

278
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,938
Huh? [yells]

279
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,899
All the Pikachu have gotten away!

280
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,900
[both] Huh?

281
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,319
[all] Not again.

282
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,612
But wait.

283
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,032
There's one Pikachu left.

284
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,909
Let's grab it.

285
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,162
[all groan]

286
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,292
Pika.

287
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,544
[grunts]

288
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,920
[James gasps]

289
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,466
[all] Oh. We're blasting off again.

290
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,926
Pikachu!

291
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,927
Pika, pi!

292
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,181
[laughs] You did it, Pikachu!

293
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,891
Pika, pi!

294
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,437
[laughing]

295
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,938
Pika, pika!

296
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,232
Pika, pika! Pi?

297
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,154
Pi! Pikachu!

298
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,655
Ah! Pikachu!

299
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,909
-Pika, pika.
-Pika!

300
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,702
[all] Pika!

301
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:36,292
[all] Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!

302
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,086
[gasping]

303
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,506
[all] Pikachu! Pikachu!

304
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,719
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!

305
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,847
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!

306
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,973
Hmm.

307
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:56,187
-They all made it back safely.
-Yeah. Ash really trained Pikachu well.

308
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
You did a great job, Ash.

309
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,399
[both] Huh?

310
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,860
-[Brock] Ash?
-[Misty] Where are you going, Ash?

311
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,784
[Brock] What? You're leaving Pikachu?

312
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,035
[Ash] That's right.

313
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,539
But, Ash, what are you doing?
This is crazy.

314
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,749
[Ash] My mind's made up.

315
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,710
[grunts]

316
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,295
[all] Huh?

317
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,672
Pikachu.

318
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,715
Pika, pi. Pikachu?

319
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,721
-Pikachu, you stay here. I'm leaving.
-Pi.

320
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:35,935
I know you'll be much happier here
in the forest with the other Pikachu.

321
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,812
Pika, pi.

322
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,564
[whimpers]

323
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,316
Goodbye, Pikachu.

324
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,116
Pika, pi!

325
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,576
Please don't.

326
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,910
Pika.

327
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,247
All of these Pikachu here
in the forest need you.

328
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,709
So just... Goodbye. [grunts]

329
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,294
-[both] Huh?
-Pika, pi!

330
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,880
Goodbye! [pants]

331
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,341
Pikachu.

00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,303

-[Brock] Ash!
-[Misty] Why are you doing this?

359
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,385
I'm sure Pikachu will be better-off
staying here

360
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,970
than traveling around with me.

361
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,640
Pikachu will be happier this way.

362
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,985
