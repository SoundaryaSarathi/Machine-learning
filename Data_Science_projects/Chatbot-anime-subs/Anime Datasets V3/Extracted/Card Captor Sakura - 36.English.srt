1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,517
A dream?

2
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,405
It’s this dream again.

3
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,976
Kero-chan and I…

4
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,494
I know…

5
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:04,967
I know that person.

6
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,600
Mizuki-sensei…?

7
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:29,662
[Sakura and
A Snowy New School Term]

8
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:50,114
Kero-chan…

9
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,315
You’re finally awake.

10
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:52,719
What were you doing…

11
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,452
The alarm’s been going
off all this time,

12
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,779
and you wouldn’t get up!

13
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,185
And you call yourself
a 5th-grader today.

14
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,387
That’s right!

15
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:03,762
I’m Sakura Kinomoto.

16
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,028
I’m a 5th-grader from today on.

17
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:08,727
I still don’t like math.

18
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,502
But I love P.E. and music.

19
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:12,600
Basically, I’m an energetic girl.

20
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,575
Oh, talk about something unusual…

21
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,382
No matter what cards you’ve gathered

22
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:26,379
or how much magic you’ve gained,

23
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,744
You’re still a sleepyhead.

24
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,617
And you captured these many cards

25
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,460
during’ spring break too…

26
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,094
These are the Clow Cards

27
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,966
where I get my magical powers.

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,228
Good morning!

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,163
Yo, monster.

30
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:47,639
O-onii-chan!!

31
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,807
Your alarm’s been going off
like that and you could still oversleep so much.

32
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,245
You’re a monster all right.

33
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:53,803
I said

34
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:54,945
I’m not a monster!

35
00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:57,073
Good morning.

36
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,475
Good morning.

37
00:02:59,087 --> 00:02:59,849
Good morning, Father.

38
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,959
Good morning,

39
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,660
Let’s eat!

40
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,198
From today on, Sakura is a 5th-grader,

41
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,869
and Touya is a high school senior.

42
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:23,835
Yeah.

43
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,871
Sakura, do you guys swap classes?

44
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,415
No. The entire class stays
the way it was

45
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:29,978
and moves on to 5th grade.

46
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,682
So you’ll be in the same
class with Tomoyo-san.

47
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,218
I’m glad for you.

48
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,284
Um… What about you?

49
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:43,225
Are you and Yukito
in the same class…

50
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,225
We swap classes,

51
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:47,897
but Yuki and I are in the same class.

52
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,266
Then, are you still going to school

53
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:52,437
with Yukito in the morning?

54
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:53,407
I guess.

55
00:03:58,513 --> 00:03:59,537
Then, I’ll be leaving.

56
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,380
Okay.
Good luck on the academic presentation.

57
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:05,345
Oh, also, if anyone calls,

58
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:06,745
please ask him or her to call the hotel.

59
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:09,347
We’ll do that even if you didn’t say so.

60
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:12,018
Thanks. See you later.

61
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,293
Bye! Good luck!

62
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:22,865
O… Onii-chan?!

63
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:37,983
You’re mean! You left me behind.

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,886
Can’t be late on the first day
of a new school year, you know.

65
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:43,781
Yuki!

66
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,128
Yukito-san!

67
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:50,197
Yo!

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,863
Good morning, Touya.

69
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,533
Good morning, Sakura-chan

70
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,258
Good morning!

71
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:57,665
Huh? Where is your bicycle?

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,407
I got a flat tire yesterday

73
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:01,898
when I went to buy things.

74
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,341
You could have called me

75
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,643
and I would’ve fixed it for you.

76
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,043
I stopped by
a bike store on the way back

77
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,882
and had them look at it.

78
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,845
Touya, you’re on duty today, right?

79
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:12,009
It’s okay if you just go ahead.

80
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,585
Okay. Then, I’ll see you at school.

81
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,086
Sakura-chan, are you in a hurry too?

82
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,661
I… I’m not in any hurry at all.

83
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,494
Then, why don’t we go together?

84
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,692
Okay!

85
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,409
You’re a 5th-grader now, aren’t you?

86
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:46,386
Ye… Yes!

87
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,747
It’s a little late, but…

88
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,581
Here.

89
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,860
For your birthday

90
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,161
and having become a 5th-grader.

91
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:56,861
It’s for me?

92
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:04,833
Thank you very much!

93
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:19,616
Good morning!

94
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,086
Good morning!

95
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,982
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan!

96
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:26,552
I am so happy that
we are in the same class again.

97
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:28,358
Me too!

98
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:31,659
Oh? Could it be a present that you are holding?

99
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:34,829
Yeah. It’s from Yukito-san.

100
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,703
I see. He is still good at it.

101
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,274
Good morning.
Good morning!

102
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,769
Good morning.
Good morning!

103
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,905
Hey, I wonder who is our class teacher.

104
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,048
Oh yeah. We change teachers.

105
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,813
Mr. Terada was kind and fun.

106
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,452
He was so nice.

107
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,184
What’s wrong, Rika-chan?

108
00:06:58,493 --> 00:06:59,425
Oh… nothing.

109
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:00,919
I was just wondering
who is our new teacher.

110
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,534
We… We made it.

111
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:10,594
Good morning,

112
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,063
Li-kun, Mei Lin-chan.

113
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,041
Good morning.

114
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:15,473
Good morning.

115
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,169
Did you guys oversleep?

116
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,202
I had a nice dream,

117
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,942
so I didn’t want to get up.

118
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:22,145
What kind of dream?

119
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:24,517
I was on a date with Shao Lan!

120
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:26,478
A date?

121
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,682
The teacher’s here.

122
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:40,401
Oh! It’s Mizuki-sensei!

123
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,477
What’s with Kinomoto-san?

124
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:54,577
She seems to be in schweeeet mode.

125
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,078
What’s that?

126
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,613
Good morning.

127
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,152
Good morning!

128
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:04,217
I am your new class teacher,

129
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,994
Kaho Mizuki. Nice to see you again.

130
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:15,397
I wonder…

131
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,265
I wonder if that’s Mizuki-sensei.

132
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,772
So you will do your best
in your schoolwork too, right?

133
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,042
Yes!

134
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,417
But that…

135
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:36,985
Okay.
The first period is a free period.

136
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:38,554
How about a game?

137
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,322
What are we going to play?

138
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,088
That’s right.

139
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:47,292
Let’s go outside.

140
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,162
What do you want to play?

141
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:52,997
Dodge ball! Volleyball!

142
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:55,204
Soccer!

143
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,369
Then, we’ll play dodge ball.

144
00:08:58,813 --> 00:08:59,609
Everyone, let’s go outside.

145
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,582
Yay!

146
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,009
Something
really pretty is coming down.

147
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,550
And it’ll accumulate a lot.

148
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,130
Cherry blossom?

149
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,701
Snow?

150
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,037
It’s a little late,

151
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,537
but…
For your birthday

152
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:05,674
and having become a 5th-grader.

153
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:12,778
Yukito-san! Yukito-san!

154
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:16,756
I brought some potato chips.

155
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,085
I wonder…

156
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,919
It’s spring already,
and it still snows.

157
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,863
Sakura, do you want some chips?

158
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,966
I got a watch from Yukito-san!

159
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,305
I got a watch from Yukito-san!

160
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,402
Hey, are you listening?

161
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,733
Guess I’ll eat it all

162
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,010
while you’re in schweeeet mode.

163
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,381
I’m so happy.

164
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,925
You’re happy, but I guess
you don’t forget your chips either.

165
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,655
Anyway, the new class teacher

166
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:55,827
is that mysterious one?

167
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,626
I’m sure
I could sense special powers in her.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,126
It feels like she has something

169
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,732
real powerful around her.

170
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,803
Maybe because of that,

171
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,298
she could sense the cards.

172
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,605
Something really pretty is coming down,

173
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,878
and it’ll accumulate a lot.

174
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:21,445
Is snow in spring going to
accumulate that much?

175
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,719
What’s wrong?

176
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:27,455
It’s nothing.

177
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,523
Oh, it’s about time
to get ready for dinner.

178
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:32,931
What is it for today?

179
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,392
It’s cold today,
so we’ll have stew.

180
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:35,135
All right!!

181
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:57,386
I’m back!

182
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,588
Oh, it’s Onii-chan.

183
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:01,455
Hey, Sakura!

184
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,860
What is it?

185
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,324
Hey, get me a towel!

186
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:06,361
A towel?

187
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:11,164
Why?

188
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:19,338
So much snow!

189
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:20,737
It was really bad.

190
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:22,740
I couldn’t ride my bike at all.

191
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:24,844
It accumulated that much?

192
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:28,584
Yeah, almost meter.

193
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:57,683
Yes, it is almost like
we are surrounded by walls of snow.

194
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,720
It’s totally white around here as well.

195
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,314
This is strange for April.

196
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,023
I wonder…

197
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:07,285
Could this be…

198
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,292
It’s the act of a Clow Card!

199
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,290
Then, the Card Captor
will be in action, right?

200
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,169
This time,
I have a costume just right for you.

201
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,803
I am looking forward to film you in it!

202
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,126
There is snow on everything.

203
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,425
Everything besides
the roof is all buried.

204
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,696
With the snow this widespread,

205
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:45,922
I can’t sense anything this high up.

206
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:47,763
Let’s get down.

207
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,339
Sakura-chan!

208
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:00,270
Sakura!

209
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,074
Help!

210
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:04,578
I guess I’ll help you.

211
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:09,746
This is the act of Snow.

212
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,417
Li-kun! Mei Lin-chan!

213
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:17,053
How come you guys
are standing on top of the snow?

214
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,860
Thanks to Shao Lan’s magic.

215
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:24,433
You can use your Float card, you know.

216
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:26,671
Oh, that’s right.

217
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,938
Brat! Even if you didn’t mention it,
I was just gonna…

218
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:36,306
Snow It’s the card of the snow.

219
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,175
Yeah.
But I couldn’t sense anything at all

220
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:40,748
Even though it is so near.

221
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:42,454
Me neither.

222
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,218
Oh, but Mizuki-sensei said

223
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,492
something really pretty will
come down, and…

224
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,224
She seems to know

225
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:50,653
it’s going to accumulate this much.

226
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,691
You’re saying
she knows from the start

227
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,161
this is because of a Clow Card?

228
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,369
I couldn’t quite tell…

229
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,701
After all, that teacher
isn’t just anyone.

230
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,541
But Mizuki-sensei

231
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:06,142
is kind and pretty.

232
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,673
And she makes me feel schweeeet.

233
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:11,644
It’s coming down again!

234
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,497
Tomoyo-chan! Mei Lin-chan!

235
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:32,239
At this rate… At this rate…

236
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,636
I cannot shoot your video!

237
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,540
This way!

238
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,716
It’s after us!

239
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,177
This snow contains magical power!

240
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,523
Let’s move away from them!

241
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,524
Fly!

242
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:55,957
Get on!

243
00:15:58,232 --> 00:15:58,823
Hurry!

244
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,982
Shao Lan! Good luck!

245
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,548
It’s gonna catch up to us!

246
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:36,767
At this rate,

247
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,401
the whole town’s really
gonna get buried by the snow.

248
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,106
We can’t just run away from it!

249
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:42,967
Bu… But!

250
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,781
God of Fire, come forth!

251
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,257
You did it!

252
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:58,425
Not yet.

253
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,940
This is bad,
if we can’t use stronger fire.

254
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:17,341
It’s coming again!

255
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,317
Damn! It’s so persistent!

256
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:27,584
What should we do?

257
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,581
All right. One more time.

258
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:31,951
What’s wrong?

259
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:32,724
What is it?

260
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,093
The watch is gone!

261
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,426
Your watch,

262
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:37,593
you mean the one you got today?

263
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:41,132
The watch Yukito gave me
was so precious to me…

264
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,033
He gave you something?!

265
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,870
How could they!

266
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,781
Fire! Melt away all the snow!

267
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,591
Firey!

268
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,132
Incredible.

269
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,038
After all, girls are
scary when they get mad.

270
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,406
Sakura, that’s the true form of Snow.

271
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:07,786
Return to thy form which
thou should be! Clow Card!

272
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,878
I lost my watch.

273
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,686
The watch he gave me
was so precious to me…

274
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:41,654
He… Hey…

275
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,121
The watch Yukito-san gave me…

276
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,694
Don… Don’t cry.

277
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:07,640
In… In… In… In the meantime, I’ll
go check on Tomoyo and that girl.

278
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:08,572
He… Hey!

279
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:24,288
Don’t cry.

280
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,932
I’ll look for it
with you until we find it.

281
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:35,869
Thanks. You’re so nice.

282
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:46,415
Good evening.

283
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,285
Mizuki-sensei!

284
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:50,481
Oh, that’s a cute outfit.

285
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,153
This is… um…

286
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:55,126
You don’t need to be so alert.

287
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,428
I just came to give Kinomoto-san
to give back something she dropped.

288
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,200
This is yours, right?

289
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:10,207
Yes!

290
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,913
But how do you know it’s mine…?

291
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:16,944
I just do.

292
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,515
Thanks for everything today.

293
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,719
Now, you should go home.
Good night.

294
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:31,258
Thank you very much.
