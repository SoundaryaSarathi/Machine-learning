1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,342
In other words, you
can't protect Louise.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,982
Saito...

3
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,609
You were here?

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,420
It doesn't matter where I am.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,022
Can it be that you were crying?

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,490
Leave me alone!

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,993
You were up against the leader
of the Magic Guards.

8
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,595
He's the head of the guards that
protect the Royal Highness, right?

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,363
Even if you lost...

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:29,697
It's not like that!
Even if you lost...

11
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,764
It's not like that!

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,366
When I was looking up at the sky,

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,501
I thought that maybe I'll never be
able to get back home,

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,570
and I felt so pathetic that
I shed a couple tears.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,671
Idiot.

16
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,441
In any case, as long as
you're here in Harkeginia,

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,409
you are my familiar!

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,746
You take care of my everyday stuff,

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,010
and I need you to protect me.

20
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,742
You can have Wardes protect you.

21
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,155
See, the fact that you lost
is nagging at you after all!

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,890
It's not nagging at me.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,194
That's enough of that!
You're a man, right?

24
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,456
Shut up!

25
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,000
Saito...

26
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,635
I'm going to marry Wardes.

27
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:31,759
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

28
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:40,428
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,804
The sky where two moons
never fade away

30
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,882
That's an impossibility, right?

31
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:03,624
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

32
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:09,596
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

33
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:15,899
Even if you trip and
become depressed

34
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,499
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

35
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:30,217
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

36
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:36,557
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

37
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:42,496
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

38
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:50,995
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

39
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,470
Louise's Marriage

40
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,323
Saito!

41
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,891
What are you dilly-dallying for?

42
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,826
It's almost time to depart!

43
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,661
Oh, is that so...

44
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,526
"Is that so?" You know...

45
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,000
What is it? An earthquake?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,797
Guiche! Behind you!

47
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,776
No way... A golem?!

48
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,743
Why?

49
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,912
Fouquet?

50
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,589
Saito and...

51
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,691
Yeah, they said they
were going back now.

52
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,692
Why?

53
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,160
Actually, they wouldn't tell me why.

54
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,626
Shut up!

55
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,824
It's all right.

56
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,104
We can complete the
mission without them.

57
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,572
But...

58
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,836
Let's go! We don't have
much time before departure.

59
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,237
The pier is in sight!

60
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,930
What are you here for, Fouquet?!

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,798
I came here to thank you
for putting me in prison!

62
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,041
Not bad.

63
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,565
But...

64
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,584
I too am a mage of Earth!

65
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,250
Go!

66
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,763
Everything you do is useless!

67
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,630
Behold the powers of
Guiche de Grammont!

68
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,207
Is the situation that bad nowadays?!

69
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,744
Yes. The position of the
royal family is very bad.

70
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,013
It is known that Albion is in civil war,

71
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,716
due to the rebellion of the nobility.

72
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:20,710
In truth, the nobility has taken
over most of Albion's territory.

73
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,924
To those that side with the royal
family, forced out of the castle,

74
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,294
Prince Wales is their only
survivor of the family,

75
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,062
their only hope.

76
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,427
That can't be...

77
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,234
No need to worry, Louise.

78
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,997
I will protect you.

79
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,203
I will protect you.

80
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,710
Liar.

81
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,023
All of them defeated so easily...

82
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,927
What was that?!

83
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,045
Kirche! Tabitha!

84
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,247
Saito! Have you been well?

85
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,407
Wait!

86
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,285
It's cowardly to ambush
from the side like that!

87
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:29,323
Oh? I was wondering who it was...
If it isn't that old thief.

88
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,826
Old?! I'm only twenty-three!

89
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,123
What's this about?

90
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,992
What is that?

91
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,324
Oh, well. I was able to
stop you long enough.

92
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,974
Stop us?

93
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,205
Hey now, where's that
dandy bearded fellow?

94
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,412
What's that sound?

95
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,178
That's the sign of departure!

96
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,350
That dandy bearded fellow
has been on my mind...

97
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,793
It took an entire day to figure out
where you guys were.

98
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,762
What persistence...

99
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,858
And then I find you guys
fighting a golem.

100
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,891
The two of them departed already.

101
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,171
The two of them?!

102
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,841
Yes. They had told me that the
people accompanying them

103
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,310
would be turning back from here.

104
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,743
This can't be happening.

105
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,248
Guiche! Where is the pier?!

106
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,808
It's useless to go to the pier now.

107
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,093
That was the ship that we
were planning to board.

108
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,995
That's a ship?

109
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,430
It's flying.

110
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,898
Of course it is.

111
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,601
Albion is a flying continent.

112
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,302
Flying continent?

113
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,406
On evenings that the two moons
overlap each other, like tonight,

114
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,108
Albion gets the closest to land.

115
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,236
Oh, and Viscount Wardes and Louise...

116
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,172
Louise!

117
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,815
Saito?

118
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,546
Is something the matter?

119
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,454
Oh, just now, I thought I heard Saito.

120
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,435
So you really feel for that familiar.

121
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,337
I just thought that I heard his voice!

122
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,498
Please don't come to
a misunderstanding.

123
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,509
I'm just kidding.

124
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,602
I told you that I would
protect you, right?

125
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,877
Shut up!

126
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,255
Lord Wardes...

127
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,895
I... I...

128
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,233
I will accept your
proposal for marriage!

129
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,380
Why did Viscount Wardes
leave us behind?

130
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,982
That Fouquet...

131
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,116
Fouquet?

132
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,017
When she ran away,

133
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,187
she said that she was able
to stop us for long enough.

134
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,123
That means that Fouquet
and the Viscount...

135
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,492
I can't say that for sure.

136
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:22,553
But we can be sure that Louise
is in a lot of trouble right now.

137
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,124
Saito!

138
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,968
The next flight is going to be at dawn.

139
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,936
All we can do now is to wait.

140
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,409
Can it be... Fouquet?

141
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,970
Oh, wait, you guys... Don't desert me!

142
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,541
This is...

143
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,881
Verdande?!

144
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,553
To my future wife.

145
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,330
Now, all we have to do
is fulfill our mission.

146
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,235
Yes...

147
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,931
And, where is the location
of Prince Wales?

148
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,340
That's...

149
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,572
The Princess told me to not tell
anyone until we arrive in Albion.

150
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,475
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,520
No, no, it's all right. That is
one of your missions, after all.

152
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,390
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,059
We still have time before we arrive.

154
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,994
Rest up until then.

155
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,086
Yes...

156
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,741
This is the way it should be, Louise.

157
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,511
Lord Wardes is strong and kind.

158
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,979
He's not a familiar, nor a peasant.

159
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,606
This is the way it should be...

160
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,235
Here, huh...

161
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,380
Nobody's here.

162
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,369
No...

163
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,093
This is Miss La Vallière, on
a special mission from Tristein!

164
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,789
We would like to be
shown to Prince Wales.

165
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,365
An emissary from Tristein?

166
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,101
Why don't you try a better lie?

167
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,093
Nobody from that country
would know of this location.

168
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,272
I heard it from Princess Henrietta!

169
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,275
Henrietta?

170
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,371
I have no need for any of you.
Where is Prince Wales?!

171
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,214
That ring...

172
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,021
Now...

173
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,786
Put forth the ring.

174
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,195
Um...

175
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,526
Now...

176
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,871
What's this about?

177
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,339
This ring is the Ruby of Wind,

178
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,808
that has been handed down
the royal family of Albion.

179
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,106
And that is the Ruby of Water.

180
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,846
Water and wind together
create a rainbow,

181
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,643
a rainbow across the royal family.

182
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,153
You are...

183
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:39,388
I apologize, emissary. I am the
prince of Albion, Wales Tudor.

184
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,559
A missive from the Royal
Highness Henrietta.

185
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,598
Understood.

186
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,274
Then, take this...

187
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,426
Um, Prince!

188
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,728
What is it?

189
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,830
Lady Henrietta...

190
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,891
Did Lady Henrietta suggest
that you go into exile?

191
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,238
Miss Vallière...

192
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,174
It's stepping out of bounds
for an emissary

193
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,843
to try to know what was
written in a missive.

194
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,211
Even so!

195
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,647
This is not merely a war between
the royal family and the nobility.

196
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,654
The Reconquista?

197
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,257
Right. The group that pulls the strings

198
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,593
behind the scenes of this civil war.

199
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,163
The nobles are merely their puppets.

200
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,825
Finally, I have discovered
their existence.

201
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,390
Impossible...

202
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:02,542
As the prince of Albion,
I must protect this country.

203
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,137
Even if it costs me my life to do so.

204
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,841
Please tell Henrietta that.

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,647
Prince...

206
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,326
That is the letter in question?

207
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,855
Then the mission has been completed.

208
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,566
Yes...

209
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:31,833
Louise, I'm going to ask Prince
Wales to oversee our wedding.

210
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,640
The Prince?

211
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,509
That means we're holding the
wedding ceremony right here?

212
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,479
I'm sure the Prince will be
happy to oblige.

213
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,881
That's so sudden!

214
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,616
I can't!

215
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,278
I haven't even gone back
to Tristein yet!

216
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,921
No!

217
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,755
You are someone I...

218
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,022
Hold on... That hurts...
You are someone I...

219
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,291
Hold on... That hurts...
No. We, the Reconquista, need you.

220
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,591
No. We, the Reconquista, need you.

221
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,659
Let me go!
No. We, the Reconquista, need you.

222
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:52,892
Let me go!

223
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,260
The Reconquista!

224
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,661
That means... Wardes... You're...

225
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,799
My Louise...

226
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,869
You don't have to think about
anything. Just follow me.

227
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,304
You've got to be kidding!

228
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,238
There's no way I'd get married!

229
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,277
You cannot escape,
descendant of the Void.

230
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,345
Void?

231
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,394
Then we shall begin.

232
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,401
The groom, Viscount Jean
Jacques Francis de Wardes.

233
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,670
On the name of our founder Bremir,

234
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,873
will you vow to respect
and love this individual,

235
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,308
and take her as your wife?

236
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,943
I do.

237
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,747
The bride, the third daughter
of Duke La Vallière,

238
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,016
Louise Françoise Le Blanc
de La Vallière.

239
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,317
What? What in the world am I doing?

240
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,685
What? What in the world am I doing?

241
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,088
Will you vow to respect
and love this individual,

242
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,924
and take him as your husband?

243
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,492
A husband?

244
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,760
What am I saying?

245
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,629
What's happening to me?!

246
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,663
I d...

247
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,964
Bride?

248
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,731
I'm terribly sorry. It seems
that our bride is a bit nervous.

249
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,673
Perfectly understandable.
Then I shall ask again.

250
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,809
No! Someone is moving
my body against my will!

251
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,370
And take him as your husband?

252
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,416
I d...

253
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,618
Someone help me!

254
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,846
I d...

255
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,948
Louise!

256
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,925
Louise!

257
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,366
Saito!

258
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,468
Impossible! The binding?!

259
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,470
How did you know we were here?!

260
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,439
It's thanks to the princess's ring!

261
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,565
The ring?!

262
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,814
Did you see that?

263
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:59,410
Verdande never forgets the scent of
a gem that she's smelled even once!

264
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,458
I'll take Louise back!

265
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,527
Guards! Capture that fellow!

266
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:07,961
Yes, sir!

267
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:08,728
That's a mistake, Prince! This man is...
Yes, sir!

268
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,097
That's a mistake, Prince! This man is...

269
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,325
Out of the way!

270
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,456
Lord Wardes! What are you...

271
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,998
Damn you... Reconquista!

272
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,413
Prince!

273
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:27,580
Damn you!
Prince!

274
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,104
Damn you!

275
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,741
Prince!

276
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,828
No!

277
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,830
I won't forgive you for that!

278
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,495
And how are you not
going to forgive me?

279
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,042
I told her to take your life.

280
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,374
That wench cut corners, didn't she?

281
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,453
So Fouquet was on your side after all!

282
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,691
Louise, come here.

283
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,659
Let us take the world
in our hands together.

284
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,827
No!

285
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,764
You're not the Lord Wardes
that I know!

286
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,567
I am myself. Time changes people.

287
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,504
Someday you'll understand that too.

288
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,562
How dare you...

289
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,675
How dare you play with
Louise's feelings...

290
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,438
Saito...

291
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,838
A love that cannot be?

292
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:39,252
A peasant like you, falling for
a noble girl... Such a fool.

293
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,651
Like I care!

294
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,487
I don't have the concept
of peasant or noble.

295
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,226
I don't have a family,
or a home to go back to.

296
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,194
All I have...

297
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,559
What is that?!

298
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,554
All I have...

299
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,002
It's coming, partner!

300
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,703
More, more!

301
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,831
All I have is the fact that
I am Louise's familiar!

302
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,972
Damn you!

303
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,951
He absorbed the magic?!

304
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,543
Wardes!

305
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,790
That's right! I'm not
the one that fights!

306
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,860
Your heart is shaking to wield me!

307
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,487
How about this?!

308
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,530
I won't ever forgive
anyone who hurts Louise!

309
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,077
You lose!

310
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,044
Saito!

311
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:46,786
Oh, well... Two of the three
objectives have been met.

312
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,054
Objectives?

313
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:52,047
One was the death of Wales,
who was in hiding.

314
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,594
The second

315
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,562
was to acquire this.

316
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,897
When did you...

317
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,593
The last objective, Louise...

318
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,532
Was you!

319
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,816
If I can't take you, I have no choice!

320
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,579
I'll have you disappear here.

321
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,779
Wait!

322
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,657
No!

323
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,193
If we hang around, it'll get us too!

324
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,218
But the Princess's letter!

325
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,258
Saito!

326
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,930
Levitation!

327
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,709
Hey, are you all right?

328
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,661
There's no way they'd
survive that one.

329
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,898
Louise...

330
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,049
My Louise...

331
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,386
It's all right.

332
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,944
I'm with you.

333
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:11,622
As if I were under a real magic spell

334
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:22,698
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

335
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:34,387
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

336
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:45,457
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

337
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:57,438
My true feelings, the
shards of loneliness

338
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:08,309
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

339
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:14,721
For the day to start from zero

340
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,840
Oh, that stupid dog!

341
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,832
He goes running off with Siesta
just because we have a tiny fight!

342
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,845
Treasure-hunting?

343
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,880
The treasure is...

344
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,415
What is this?!

00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:36,515
