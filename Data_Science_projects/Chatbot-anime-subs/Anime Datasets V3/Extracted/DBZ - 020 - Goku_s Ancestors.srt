00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,299
I did it!

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,497
I did it! I did it!
I did it! I did it!

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,479
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, what should I do next?

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:26,484
What should you do? Let's see...
You'll polish off whatever I give you, right?

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,485
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,749
Even apple-polishing?

7
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,253
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, I have to train fast,
before the Saiyans arrive...

8
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:43,101
Take it easy.

9
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,437
There are still 135 days left.

10
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,428
That ain't hardly time enough
to catch my breath.

11
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:05,050
W- what are you doing?

12
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,460
It's about time for it to come back.

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,325
Come back?

14
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:16,525
Here it comes.

15
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,874
It takes quite a while
to catch one's breath, huh?

16
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,150
That's great, that's great!

17
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,319
Are you sure you're all that strong?

18
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,913
How rude!

19
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,253
W- what was that?

20
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:54,105
It looks like a cricket.

21
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,774
C- cricket?

22
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,605
That's " crickediculous!"

23
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,780
--Oh, nice one!
--You are so disrespectful!

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,774
I am Gregory, the one
who looks after Kaio-<i>sama</i>.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,856
You dare face the man
who stands at the head of all

26
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:14,723
the gods throughout
the universe, Kaio-<i>sama</i>...

27
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,122
" That's crickediculous!"

28
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,269
Ahem... You dare face
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, and ask him,

29
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,805
" Are you sure you're all that strong" !?

30
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,808
I can only put up with so much
shamelessness from such a whippersnapper!

31
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,799
But I ain't even carrying a whip.

32
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,380
Son Goku, you got off
a pretty good one, there!

33
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,541
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, this is no time
for you to be laughing.

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,222
This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

35
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:47,350
After Bubbles-<i>kun</i>, your next
opponent will be Gregory.

36
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,723
This guy?

37
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,097
What is that look on your
face supposed to mean?

38
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:56,434
But I wanted to get my training
directly from you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>.

39
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:59,437
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, I am absolutely infuriated!

40
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,272
If it's okay with you,

41
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,776
I would like to take this disparager
down a peg. What do you say?

42
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,243
Very well.

43
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:10,448
What's that?

44
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:14,452
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>, isn't that a little big?

45
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:17,080
Son Goku, here...

46
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,448
What do you think?
Heavy, right?

47
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,467
Your next training exercise will be
to take that hammer and swat Gregory with it.

48
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,559
With this?

49
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:37,742
Once you manage to do that,
I will begin training you personally.

50
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:39,077
All right, I'll give it a try!

51
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:43,673
Hmph! You think a pipsqueak like you
is going to be able to catch me?

52
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,928
He's fast!

53
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:13,941
Dammit!

54
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,957
Looks like this is
going to take a while.

55
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,292
Yow-ow-ow-ow... All right,
I'll get you this time for sure!

56
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,562
That jerk!

57
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,070
Wait up!

58
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,741
He didn't!

59
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,025
It's a good thing I'm so cheerful...

60
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:54,010
Get up, now!

61
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,121
Don't get too full of yourself,

62
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,089
just because you managed
to dodge me once or twice.

63
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,556
You're still too soft!

64
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,864
Help me!

65
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,213
Come back up here on your own!

66
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:38,049
" Squirrel!" " Watermelon!"
"Sea gull!" " Killifish!" " Monster!"

67
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:46,724
" Cow!" " White shark!" " Quince!"
"Apple!" " Gorilla!" " Lion!"

68
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,624
You say the next one!

69
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:03,738
Both Ten-<i>san</i> and Yamucha-<i>san</i>
have gotten even better!

70
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:25,089
Yajirobe! Take this seriously!

71
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:35,095
Eeyow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

72
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,320
T- time out!

73
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:57,128
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

74
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,392
It's time for supper!

75
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,288
Yahoo!

76
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,325
You're really something!

77
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:34,165
Goku, how are you coming along?

78
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:38,770
Whew! He's so fast! I've never
seen anyone like this dude before!

79
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,438
" T- this dude" ?

80
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:45,307
You may have conquered the gravity on this
planet, but now the problem is your speed.

81
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:52,610
The Saiyans that you have to fight
are unbelievably strong.

82
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,453
Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

83
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,114
Do you know about the Saiyans!?

84
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:00,291
L- listen, you! Kaio-<i>sama</i>
stands at the head of all

85
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,126
the gods throughout the universe-

86
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,128
Gregory, it's all right.

87
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:08,121
Son Goku, as I recall, you said something
about yourself being a Saiyan too, right?

88
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,904
Yeah. But I don't know
anything about Saiyans.

89
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,807
Apparently, I came to
Earth when I was a baby.

90
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,775
So that's how it is, huh?

91
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,812
In that case, let me tell you
about the history of the Saiyans.

92
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:21,972
Really?

93
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,485
Oh, my, thank you.

94
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,680
I'll just plop down here...

95
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:35,691
Once upon a time...

96
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:41,432
There were two races of people
who lived on a world named Planet Vegeta.

97
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,436
The Saiyans, who are your
forebears, and the Tsufruians.

98
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
Saiyans and Tsufruians?

99
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:53,110
Planet Vegeta, like my own planet here,
had an extremely strong gravity.

100
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,146
As a result, the Tsufruians,

101
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,448
who controlled the larger
half of Planet Vegeta,

102
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,118
were a race whose bodies were only
about half the size of the Saiyans.

103
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,120
However, they had a remarkable,

104
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,123
comparatively advanced
level of civilization.

105
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,127
On the other hand, the Saiyans were
a race that was very few in numbers,

106
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,231
but their bodies were bigger,
not to mention stronger,

107
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,461
and they were an aggressive,
primitive race.

108
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,137
The tails the Saiyans had were their
greatest distinguishing characteristic.

109
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,629
They were all warrior-like
people, as it were.

110
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,320
At one point, these warriors
bared their fangs,

111
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,812
and started to overrun the Tsufruians.

112
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:52,434
The Tsufruians greeted them with
advanced weaponry of their own making.

113
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:06,784
The Saiyans, who should have been utterly
outnumbered, were incredibly strong,

114
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:10,311
and gradually, they brought
the Tsufruians under their control.

115
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,027
The decisive factor was the full moon,

116
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,798
which only appeared on Planet
Vegeta once every eight years.

117
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:25,803
That's because when Saiyans see
the full moon, they transform into monsters.

118
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:29,774
For the Tsufruians,
this was their greatest threat,

119
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:33,904
and they suffered
the most damage this way.

120
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,925
And so, little by little, as the
Tsufruian civilization pulled back,

121
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:51,762
the Saiyans quickly
increased their numbers.

122
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:56,859
In time, they completely
took over Planet Vegeta.

123
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,263
Then, the Saiyans took off into space,
seeking to fight even more.

124
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,780
However, since the Tsufruians
had been exterminated,

125
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,682
further development of their
civilization was slow to occur.

126
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,822
They realized that even though
they wanted to fight,

127
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:22,460
they could not go out
any farther into space.

128
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,964
So the Saiyans joined forces with rich,
advanced alien civilizations,

129
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,133
and in exchange for furnishing
planets to these aliens

130
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,302
for use in developing vacation estates,

131
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,794
they were able to obtain
technology and money.

132
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:42,079
For the battle-hungry Saiyans,
this was killing two birds with one stone.

133
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,783
The Saiyans' activities escalated swiftly,

134
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,422
and they even started sending babies
to many other worlds, as was your case.

135
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:55,659
They had come up with long-term plans,
whereby once the baby grew up,

136
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:01,791
it would exterminate
the planet's population.

137
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,770
That's awfully overbearing!

138
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,967
But Planet Vegeta had its own Kami.

139
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,843
He could not bear
the Saiyans' evil deeds,

140
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:15,780
and using his own powers,
he pulled close some giant meteors,

141
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,082
which then collided with Planet
Vegeta, causing it to explode.

142
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:43,407
Including yourself, there were only
four Saiyans that survived.

143
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:44,775
No!

144
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,078
I ain't the same as those guys!

145
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:48,636
Yes, well...

146
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,750
One has died, and the
other two mightiest,

147
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,413
most wicked Saiyans now heading
to Earth are the only survivors.

148
00:14:57,421 --> 00:15:00,117
<i>l'm going to protect the earth!</i>

149
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:04,428
Gregory! We've got training!
Help me out, please!

150
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:07,761
My, my, these are the first respectful
words I've heard out of you.

151
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,770
All right, I'll get you this time!

152
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,431
We'll see about that.

153
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,939
<i>l won't let the Saiyans have their way!</i>

154
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:23,344
Damn!

155
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:28,285
You have all far surpassed me.

156
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:32,790
There is no longer anything that
either I or Mister Popo can teach you.

157
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,460
From now until
the time of battle arrives,

158
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,396
you should go down to the surface
and polish your techniques.

159
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,398
I leave the future to you.

160
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,733
Right!

161
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,070
So, can I take off
this heavy shirt, now?

162
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,404
Do as you wish.

163
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,407
Guys, let's go down to the
surface and get to work!

164
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,743
We should still be able
to power ourselves up, after all.

165
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,574
Everyone, get better!

166
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,973
<i>Goku, I can't wait to see you again!</i>

167
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,084
<i>Hammer in hand,</i>
<i>two weeks went by...</i>

168
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,436
<i>Almost there!</i>

169
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,601
He's persistent!

170
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:28,942
All right!

171
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,728
Oh, no!

172
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,736
Brace yourself, Gregory!

173
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,473
I did it!

174
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,416
It'd hurt if I hit you
as hard as I could, after all.

175
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,820
You sure are benign.
My body is harder than a rock.

176
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,423
You won't be able to beat
the Saiyans like that.

177
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:16,086
Is that right? Maybe so, but you've
still got a bump growing there.

178
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:27,071
<i>There are still 118 days remaining.</i>
<i>He just might be able to master it!</i>

179
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:28,902
<i>The Kaio-ken technique!</i>

180
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:35,379
<i>Kaio-ken, the technique</i>
<i>that I could picture in my dreams,</i>

181
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,381
<i>but was ultimately unable</i>
<i>to perform myself...</i>

182
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:40,050
<i>As well as that finishing move...</i>

183
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,052
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, like you promised-

184
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:46,624
I know you're ready for this, but my
training is harder than you can imagine!

185
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:47,725
Can you handle it!?

186
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,022
Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

187
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:52,963
You will be striving to be the best
in the universe, the greatest in all the world,

188
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:56,399
both physically and mentally. Got that!?

189
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,068
I got it!

190
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:03,233
All right, before we start...
um, care to have some tea?

191
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:12,416
Sis, I'd like you to tell
the earth's future.

192
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,419
W- what? The earth's future?

193
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,979
I want to know what's
going to happen next year.

194
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,986
All right, I'll try to read it.

195
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:37,430
It's no use! Not even I
can tell the future this time!

196
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,773
All right, that's it!
You're starting to control your <i>Ki</i>!

197
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:46,439
Weak!

198
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:52,122
<i>What kind of technique is this Kaio-ken?</i>

199
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,421
<i>And what is this finishing move?</i>

200
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:02,956
<i>The time of battle</i>
<i>pitilessly drew ever nearer.</i>
