Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.55,0:04:09.19,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,So that's why you fell in love with Lucy at first sight, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.81,0:04:13.42,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,You can never understand a person's situation until you hear about it, you know?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.05,0:04:27.16,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I would whisper of love to her and ask her hand in marriage nearly every day,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.72,0:04:30.94,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,but it seems she was frightened by how happy that made her.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.75,0:04:35.59,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm sure she thought, "I'm not worthy of Dan-san's love."
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.20,0:04:38.67,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I was charmed by that modesty, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.95,0:04:45.56,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,She obviously didn't like him.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.33,0:04:50.85,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Ultimately, she refused marriage, and I shed tears for three days and nights.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.37,0:04:55.35,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Then, to assuage my sorrow, I embarked on a sentimental journey.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.55,0:05:00.90,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,During my wanderings, I happened across various women.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.71,0:05:08.64,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,You weren't chasing the image of the first girl you fell in love with?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.00,0:05:11.33,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,No, that wasn't it at all!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.67,0:05:15.04,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,To be honest, I'd be happy with any woman in the vicinity who caught my eye.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.95,0:05:17.48,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,That offends me for some reason...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.46,0:05:21.50,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,And yet, no matter who she was, there was a compelling reason
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.01,0:05:23.76,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,why we couldn't be together.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.82,0:05:26.51,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Love and peace aren't permitted.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.45,0:05:29.96,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,That's the fate of a knight who lives to fight.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.87,0:05:32.79,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Again, the story and pictures don't match up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.37,0:05:35.34,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I bet they all turned him down.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.76,0:05:39.56,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,That makes me think, who drew these pictures?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.24,0:05:45.61,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Hughes and Sugar Boy drew them based on my diary and photos.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.22,0:05:50.26,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,They relied on guesswork to fill in the blanks, so the truth is mixed in with something else.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.86,0:05:53.54,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm positive the drawings are a better representative of what really happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.33,0:05:57.28,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,And somewhere along the line, I became a Legionnaire.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.82,0:06:02.14,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Right now, I'm following Byro-sama's instructions to gather the parts of the clock.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.00,0:06:06.57,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,The end! I explained who I am and what I'm after!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.20,0:06:08.64,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,And they all lived happily ever after!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.96,0:06:11.48,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Um... What we want to know
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.72,0:06:14.21,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,is what Legion is and what {\i1}Legion{\i0} is after!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.04,0:06:17.61,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,I can't talk about Legion's secrets!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.07,0:06:20.91,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,If I did that, Byro-sama would punish me!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.42,0:06:23.60,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Then what was that story of yours?!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.02,0:06:26.59,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,And on top of that, it turned out he has a humdrum past...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.86,0:06:31.16,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Of course, I was talking about myself so you would get to know me better!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.72,0:06:34.12,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Now let's get married, Lu-nyan!

Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.92,0:06:43.99,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,What should we do, Natsu-nii? There's no point in hanging out with the likes of him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.10,0:06:43.61,Main Dialog,,0000,0000,0000,,Lu-nyan!
