1
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:07,943
I'm still calling your name, Nana.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,373
No matter how much it hurts...

3
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:14,483
until you answer me.

4
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,143
I'm sorry I couldn't keep
my promise.

5
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,923
You may not remember this,

6
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:30,953
but I was serious about building
that nice house with a big yard.

7
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,723
It would be on a hill where
we could see the ocean,

8
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,563
complete with a state-of-the-art
system kitchen and basement studio.

9
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:42,443
In your closet would be

10
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,003
a whole line of clothes
of the latest fashion,

11
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:50,343
so that you'd have a smile on
your face every time you came home,

12
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:53,013
even with your tendency to
have your heart broken by men.

13
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:09,773
Blinking eyes call the wind

14
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:17,413
A smile clears all the noise away

15
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:23,973
The angel in your eyes whispers

16
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:29,153
"Everything begins now"

17
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:31,393
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

18
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:35,193
It's like being caught in a wave

19
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,363
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

20
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,833
Breath held, arms reaching out

21
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:48,073
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

22
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:52,713
You're the only one I can see

23
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,643
Baby my wish on a wing

24
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,623
This sky is torn

25
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:05,023
By a single overflowing word

26
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,893
One way ticket to Tokyo.

27
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,223
The trains are running late
because of the snow.

28
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:45,623
Anything will do
as long as it gets me there.

29
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:10,353
You didn't hafta
come see me off.

30
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,093
I called in sick and took the day off
to come see you off,

31
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,593
so you could be nicer.

32
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,493
You come alone?
What about Nobu?

33
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,233
He's probably home crying
about now.

34
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:29,103
After all, you only told him yesterday.

35
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,203
Put yourself in the position
of those who are left behind.

36
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,743
Sorry. I struggled to find
the right time to tell you guys.

37
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:42,383
Although we knew that this day
would come eventually.

38
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:45,953
What is it?

39
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,623
Your birthday present.

40
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:49,583
This piece of paper?

41
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,003
REN

42
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:01,543
Don't get me wrong!
I'm not going to Tokyo to see him!

43
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:05,473
I know. That has nothing to do
with this.

44
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,103
You don't understand.

45
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,653
You don't understand anything.

46
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,723
The train on platform one for Tokyo, .,

47
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,553
- If you understand my feelings...
- will be departing momentarily.

48
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,293
- then come with me...
- All passengers not aboard are asked, .,

49
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,983
- Yasu!
- to please board the train now.

50
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,963
Why can't I say these few words?

51
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,993
Because... you've chosen
your path in life.

52
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,863
And Nobu has a great future
ahead of him.

53
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,433
I can't say it.

54
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,203
So you hafta wish for it yourself.

55
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,473
Nana.

56
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:49,983
Don't go.

57
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,753
It'll be lonely without you.

58
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,963
Stop messing with me!
Then you come with me!

59
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,563
I guess negotiations break off there.
Oh well, good luck.

60
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,233
Yasu! There are law firms in Tokyo, too!

61
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,113
You can sing in this town, too.

62
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,923
But there is no big stage like
the Tokyo Dome or Budokan here.

63
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,403
Think of it as a foolish dream
if you want.

64
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:45,243
But one day, I will definitely perform
on a big stage.

65
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,883
I'll perform before
an incredible number of spotlights

66
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,143
and amount of cheering,

67
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,543
and earn so much money
I won't know how to spend it.

68
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,283
I'm not some princess
who is satisfied just singing.

69
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,423
Singing is my means to live.

70
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:03,223
So one day, I'll definitely...

71
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,463
What? Who?

72
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:12,333
And, how long does she intend
to stay on top of me?

73
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,303
Are you all right?

74
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,973
I'm fine. Sorry!

75
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,143
I'll never forget that day.
March 5th, 2001.

76
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:25,683
My twentieth birthday.

77
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,343
That's the day I met you.

78
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:35,183
That stupid Demon Lord!

79
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:37,223
It's nothing to cry about.

80
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,763
But I was really looking forward
to the fireworks!

81
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:42,993
I even withdrew cash from
my savings to buy a yukata to wear!

82
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,173
So you finally dipped
into Natsuko's 300,000 yen.

83
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:51,203
We met on the train to Tokyo,

84
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:53,643
I ended up moving in together
with Nana Komatsu.

85
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,043
Nickname Hachi, or Hachiko.

86
00:06:56,553 --> 00:07:00,713
Hachiko is selfish,
overly dependent and cries easily.

87
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,573
She is completely boy crazy

88
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,143
and she's quick to switch over.

89
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,323
She's only been in Tokyo
for six months

90
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,193
and she's already dating a third guy.

91
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,493
Nobu...

92
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:14,263
But she would remain uncorrupted.
She was a strange woman.

93
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,563
Typhoon Eleven, which has made
its way onto land in the Kanto region,

94
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,873
is getting stronger as it continues north
and is expected to reach, .,

95
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,203
- Are you that jealous of our happiness?
- the Tohoku area later tonight, .,

96
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,773
- Well, I do understand how you feel.
- and Hokkaido tomorrow morning.

97
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,143
- Are you talking to the Demon Lord again?
- Total rain accumulation is estimated, .,

98
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,653
- I worry about you, Nobu.
- at 200 ml. in the Kanto region,

99
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,273
- But I'll let it go since Hachi's cute.
- 150 ml. in the Tohoku region,

100
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,293
- Wrong. I'm talking to the weather girl.
- and 100 to 150 ml. in Hokkaido.

101
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:39,923
- Now I'm even more worried.
- Now, tomorrow's weather.

102
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,423
First, the Kyushu and Okinawa regions, .,

103
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,353
- Na...
- Nobuo! What are you doing?

104
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,523
Come here right now!

105
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,723
You promised to pick up Hachiko
at seven o'clock, right?!

106
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:50,263
But we can't go anywhere
with this typhoon.

107
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,433
The fireworks will obviously
be canceled anyway.

108
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:56,003
Don't you wanna see Hachiko
in her yukata?

109
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,273
It's bound to give you a nosebleed.

110
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:02,313
Why are you coming along, Shin?!

111
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,573
I wanna see Hachi in a kimono, too!

112
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,443
It's not a kimono, it's a yukata!

113
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:07,683
What's the difference?!

114
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,393
- She's so cute!
- She's so cute!

115
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,823
We bought fireworks.

116
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,253
Let's go to the river and light them
after the storm passes.

117
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,663
Really? Thanks!

118
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,833
Hachi was like a pet that belonged
to our band.

119
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,213
Well, a better term would be
our Madonna.

120
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:37,703
Just having Hachi there
smiling brightened the place up.

121
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,643
It gave everyone added energy
in the studio,

122
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:41,243
as well as during live performances.

123
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,723
I felt it had more meaning to the band
than getting another member,

124
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,583
no matter how skilled
that band member may be.

125
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:57,073
That's a lot of water from the rain.
The riverbeds have disappeared.

126
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:58,963
Thank goodness
the barriers didn't collapse.

127
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,863
The fireworks won't light up!

128
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,373
Damn! They're damp because of the rain.

129
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,643
- Ow!
- Are you all right?!

130
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,613
Oh, it's better you don't touch it.

131
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,233
Wanna go to
the convenience store again?

132
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,443
I got one lit, Nana.

133
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,313
Here.

134
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,873
Thank you!

135
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:17,483
Very impressive, Yasu.

136
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,243
Light one up for me, too.

137
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,983
You want one too, Misato?

138
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:21,853
Yes!

139
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,783
Hey, what about me?

140
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:25,993
Here, Nobu. I'll lend you my fire.

141
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,093
Thank you.

142
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,133
Here.

143
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,563
Is it innocence or deceit?

144
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:47,583
Nana!

145
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,553
You probably don't realize it, do you?

146
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,823
Every move you make...

147
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:04,203
stirs my heart around
at the strength of a typhoon.

148
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:13,233
I feel like a teenage boy
falling in love for the first time.

149
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,843
It feels like my heart
is about to burst.

150
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,183
Do you wanna do it with Hachiko?

151
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:25,183
It's not like that!

152
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:27,823
That head of yours really does
only think about doing it!

153
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:30,863
But a young man in love for
the first time

154
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,793
is totally battling against
his sexual desire.

155
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,023
Yes, it is a battle.
But it's not about sexual desire.

156
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:37,463
Then more like an appetite?

157
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,893
Yeah, she does look delicious.
Like rice cake.

158
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,103
Rice cake?

159
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,513
AND CUTE
When I talk with you,

160
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,913
AND CUTE
I feel like a total idiot for seriously
worrying about stuff.

161
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,533
I'm glad about that.

162
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,983
Because you've always had the tendency

163
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,313
to take things too negatively
and seriously.

164
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,693
Hachi seems to be really
affectionate with you,

165
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:01,053
so you should be glad that
someone cares about you so much.

166
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,523
Treat her as well as your heart desires.

167
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,553
There's nothing wrong with that.

168
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:08,793
Yeah, but...

169
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:10,403
Chamame!

170
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,033
Well, now that you mention it,
that does make sense.

171
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,303
But I hate feeling persuaded
like that!

172
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,873
Why am I always influenced
by what Ren says or does?

173
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,143
I can understand that
being the case in the past,

174
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,703
but why is it still like that?

175
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,373
I haven't matured a bit.

176
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,943
First of all, I had no intention
of getting back together with him.

177
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:32,423
So why am I seeing him like
a part-time wife?

178
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:37,653
Why am I making miso soup?!
And at this time of the night?

179
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,493
Because it's my favorite, right?

180
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,423
Well, yeah but...

181
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,353
Hey, where's your switch?

182
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:07,323
I don't have one.

183
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:14,553
If there is one, install it in me.

184
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:17,433
Someone...

185
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,303
please adjust me.

186
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:29,703
Why does my heart
still burn so hot?

187
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:43,953
Hello?

188
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:47,163
Oh, Take. Good morning.

189
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:51,893
No, it's okay. I'll take my car.

190
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,973
I'll leave in thirty minutes.

191
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,033
He's hardly had any sleep.

192
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,183
He's gonna make himself sick.

193
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,343
But...

194
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,883
I do envy him
for having so much work.

195
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,843
In fact, it's frustrating.

196
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,993
You could stay in bed longer.

197
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,953
If you try living like me,
you'll die young.

198
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,883
But I hafta go to work.

199
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:22,463
The moving company Nobu works at
is short of staff,

200
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,833
so he introduced me and
got me a job there.

201
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,473
A moving company?
That's a manly job.

202
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:32,203
I can no longer work in the evenings
with our band practicing every night,

203
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,783
so I need to make my earnings
during the day.

204
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,643
What's going on with your debut?
Any progress?

205
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,143
Not really.

206
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:49,283
Back then, I stayed at Ren's place
for about half of the week,

207
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,123
but we missed each other often,

208
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,723
and would only see each other
for short periods.

209
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,233
When we were together,

210
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,603
we couldn't control our passion
for each other,

211
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:04,013
so we hardly spent any time
talking about ourselves.

212
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:10,643
But I thought it was better that way.

213
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:14,223
Because that way we could
avoid unnecessary subjects

214
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,773
that would only make us
feel awkward.

215
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:33,963
What? Still there?

216
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:35,573
So annoying, aren't they?

217
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,213
Maybe I should move.

218
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,543
But maybe that won't make
any difference.

219
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:40,343
Huh? What? Those papa-rakkyos?

220
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,573
Not the rakkyos!

221
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,743
I'm talking about that woman!

222
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,283
I told you to have her go home!

223
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:48,043
Rakkyo makes me wanna
eat curry and rice.

224
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:51,093
Yeah? I prefer like Fukujinzuke
on my curry rice.

225
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:55,123
What? Curry rice wouldn't be complete
without a raw egg. Right, Takumi?

226
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,753
I don't eat the common folk's food!

227
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,853
BEEF CURRY

228
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,863
Open a pack of curry,
and heat it in a pot.

229
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:05,093
When you find you're running short,
add a pack at a time.

230
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,203
Be careful so that it doesn't burn
and stick to the pot.

231
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,933
The rice is already cooked,

232
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,213
so place a little on each plate...

233
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:19,913
Miss Komatsu?

234
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:26,953
I'm very sorry.

235
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:30,613
It can't be helped.
You're not feeling well.

236
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,263
Thank goodness it happened
before we let the customers in.

237
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:34,893
I am really sorry.

238
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,303
You mustn't take
summer heat fatigue lightly.

239
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,363
You'd better go see a doctor.

240
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:42,833
Yes.

241
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:29,073
PHARMACY

242
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:48,133
You're eating it.
And at an employees' cafeteria.

243
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,203
THE COMMON FOLK'S CURRY RICE

244
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,543
These things are usually
the furthest from my mind,

245
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,513
so why is it that when
I suddenly remember it,

246
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,103
I suddenly have
a strong craving for it?

247
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,683
Bottom line is,
you love the stuff?

248
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,263
I wish it would end already.

249
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:20,863
What?

250
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,603
Summer vacation.

251
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:29,033
Only three more days.

252
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,843
Summer vacation seems like
a long break, but it goes by so fast.

253
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,423
If at least discussions about
your debut were more concrete,

254
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,483
I could go home feeling relieved.

255
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,293
It's been a month already since
you signed that contract,

256
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,993
but you don't even
have an agency yet.

257
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,723
It's only a temporary contract,
after all.

258
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:51,563
I'm not quite clear on the meaning
of that temporary contract.

259
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,993
How is it different from
the official contract?

260
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:57,233
I'd say it's something like
an engagement before a wedding?

261
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:02,213
Mr. Kawano is presently working hard
to collect funds and personnel

262
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:06,153
to organize a big reception for us.

263
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:11,153
The contract is there
so we remain faithful to them,

264
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:13,283
even if others approach us.

265
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:18,133
In turn, we're free to use
Gaia's music studios as much as we want,

266
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:20,363
while we prepare to be
beautiful brides.

267
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,293
I get it!

268
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:25,363
I finally understand now.
Thank you.

269
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,273
Hey, Misato.
You're older than me,

270
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,263
so why do you talk
so politely to me?

271
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,583
Well, you're younger than me, Shin,

272
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,413
so how come you're able to
help me with my 12th grade homework?

273
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,353
I can only help you with
your English.

274
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,743
Have Yasu or someone help you
with the other stuff.

275
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:44,823
I knew it!

276
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,253
You knew it?

277
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,323
You have that pretty and luminous face,
because you're only half Japanese, right?

278
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:51,053
Pretty and luminous?

279
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,283
You can hide it all you want,
but I can tell.

280
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:55,463
That's why your English
is so good, right?

281
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,603
My English is good
because I was raised abroad.

282
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,563
My parents are both Japanese.

283
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,073
What? Raised abroad? Where?

284
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,773
I mean, so you're not half Japanese
with that face?

285
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,543
Don't you believe me?

286
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,243
I don't.

287
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,453
I don't either.

288
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,813
They shouldn't have given birth to me.

289
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:48,513
SPEEDY RESULTS INSTRUCTIONS

290
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,833
All right! All right! Okay, stop!

291
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:11,773
Wow, such a huge mansion!

292
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,203
It's small! Too small!

293
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,813
It's nothing compared to the future house
of Nana from BLAST.

294
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,743
I'll show you, Demon Lord!

295
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,723
I see you've also become
a believer of the Demon Lord.

296
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,323
No way!
The Demon Lord is my underling.

297
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,253
Back then, I had a dream
that I couldn't give up.

298
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,453
Thanks to that,
I was able to obtain so much,

299
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,093
and at the same time lose
something so precious.

300
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:46,943
But I lived life to the fullest,
so I have no regrets.

301
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,843
Just...

302
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,813
there's one thing that
weighs heavy on my heart.

303
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:54,983
Hey, Hachi...

304
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:58,883
Right now... Are you smiling?

305
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:13,673
I can't count
how many nights

306
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:18,433
I wished tomorrow
would never come

307
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:25,213
To live as I am
without being fake

308
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,813
What do I need

309
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:36,953
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

310
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:42,123
The answer is
too close to see

311
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:48,363
Black tears are
falling down

312
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:55,313
I have nothing,
only sadness

313
00:21:55,383 --> 00:22:00,403
I can't put it
into words

314
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:06,483
My whole body
starts to ache

315
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:11,893
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
