1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,330
Hey, what do you think of Akira?

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,300
She's the most levelheaded
of the Three Great Water Fairies.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,570
She's organized, dependable, and takes charge.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,600
What's the matter?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,540
Did something happen to Akira?

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,780
Well, it's more like nothing...

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,880
What do you mean by "nothing"?

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,410
You're really not making any sense.
What do you mean by "nothing"?

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,340
You're really not making any sense.

10
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,950
I guess so. It's not something
you two would understand.

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,410
Huh?
Huh?

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,820
"Dear Ai, it's been so warm here in Neo-Venezia
lately that I find myself breaking into a sweat."

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,890
"And also!"

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,120
"Today, we changed uniforms!"

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,190
"That's right! We switched
into our summer clothes!"

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,730
Oh yeah, Akari.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,900
I heard you worked on a traghetto recently?

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,840
Yes, it was really fun.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,300
After it was over, it motivated
me to work even harder.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,180
I can't afford to lose to you!

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,940
You're both really motivated.

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,220
Now that we've changed into our summer
uniforms, let's give it all we've got during practice!

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,260
Okay!

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,280
Roger.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,500
"I wish I could see you and the others
in your summer uniforms again."

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,470
"I'm sure they'll be a breath of fresh air
as Neo-Venezia changes seasons."

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,480
Oh my, Akari. Is that your summer uniform?

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,010
Yes! We switched our uniforms today!

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,190
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,440
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,720
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,490
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:19,030
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,470
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,840
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:37,250
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:47,360
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,370
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

39
00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:01,140
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

40
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:09,980
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,720
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,590
That Keepsake Clover...

43
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,030
I heard a really good bakery
opened around here somewhere...

44
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,470
Oh?

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh?
Oh?

46
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,110
I'll go ask that shopkeeper over there.

47
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,820
Excuse me!

48
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,020
Welcome! Our tomatoes are on sale today.

49
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,820
Ah, no. That's not...

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,320
That voice!

51
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,950
Her voice is wonderful, no matter
how many times you hear it.

52
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,310
It sure is.
Her voice is wonderful, no matter
how many times you hear it.

53
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,340
It sure is.

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,210
Now, back to work, back to work!

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,150
Her voice truly is heavenly, isn't it?

56
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,490
Th-That's right. Athena's singing voice is the
one thing about her that's really amazing.

57
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,720
Wait!

58
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,540
That's...

59
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,240
Alicia!

60
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,890
Such graceful...

61
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,650
Oar control...

62
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,880
Wow, amazing!

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
Bravo!

64
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,810
Here you go.

65
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,920
Thank you, Miss.

66
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,010
Of course. You're very welcome.

67
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,360
Alicia is so wonderful!
Alicia is so wonderful!

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,990
Back to work, back to work...

69
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,070
You know, no matter how
many times I see her sculling...

70
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,710
She always has such wonderful, graceful,
masterly oar control, doesn't she?

71
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,730
She sure does.

72
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,910
Thank you very much.

73
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,110
Athena and Alicia were both amazing
just now, weren't they?

74
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,020
I really agree.

75
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,360
You're right. If only we had
their incredible talents,

76
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,100
we'd be promoted to Primas in no time.

77
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,460
Yeah.

78
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,870
But I don't think Alicia's graceful
demeanor and Athena's singing voice...

79
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,170
...are things you can get
by just wishing for them.

80
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,050
Those two were bestowed with natural talent.
They're actually geniuses, don't you think?

81
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,720
True, Athena's voice is one in a hundred...

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,730
No, one in a thousand.

83
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,660
Well, you could say her clumsiness
is one in a thousand, too.

84
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,260
Is something wrong, Aika?

85
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,140
Being so close to two such
extraordinary Undines the whole time...

86
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,510
I wonder how Akira felt?

87
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,950
But Akira's really, really amazing, too.

88
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:45,380
That's right. She's the most levelheaded and
hardworking of the three, don't you think?

89
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah, I guess you're right.

90
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,250
We're going right back to practice
once we're done eating, okay?

91
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,580
Right!

92
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,310
Right!
Right!

93
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,700
You're amazing, Alice!

94
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,820
Akari, you look lovely in your summer uniform.

95
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,860
Thank you very much!

96
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,200
Ah, Akari, you look nice and cool in that uniform!

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,030
Yes, it's very cool and comfortable.

98
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,300
Oh, you already switched
to your summer uniform?

99
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes!

100
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,070
As always, she's a genius at making friends.
It looks nice on you, Akari!

101
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,040
As always, she's a genius at making friends.
Yes, thank you very much!

102
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,870
She really looks happier than usual, too.

103
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,470
I am, because everyone could feel the
coming of summer by seeing my uniform.

104
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,590
It feels as though I've become a part
of Neo-Venezia's wonderful summer.

105
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:18,750
Enough! No sappy lines al...
It feels as though I've become a part
of Neo-Venezia's wonderful summer.

106
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,720
Enough! No sappy lines al...

107
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,110
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to scold her today?

108
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,810
No sappy lines... allowed...

109
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:06,030
Those two were bestowed with natural talent.
They're actually geniuses, don't you think?

110
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,870
See you, Aika!

111
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,880
Good work today!

112
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,410
I see...

113
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,020
Those two haven't realized.

114
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,860
You can be levelheaded...

115
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,470
...or a hard worker.

116
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,670
But compared to being
gifted with natural talent...

117
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,080
...it's not the same.

118
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,080
Oh! Welcome back, Aika!

119
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,520
Are you still cleaning?! How many days
has it been since you started?!

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,540
It can't be helped. I'm doing it
a bit at a time, in between work.

121
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,740
Besides, your stuff is blocking the hallway!

122
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,280
It can't be helped. I'm cleaning, after all.

123
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,640
You're blocking traffic!

124
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,370
You're feisty today.
Did something happen?

125
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,150
Excuse me...

126
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,260
I cordially decline...

127
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,230
I'm... not... going to... help...

128
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,260
You understand, don't you?

129
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Cleaning your room is like cleaning your heart.

130
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,420
It feels great when it's clean, doesn't it?

131
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,110
We're not done yet.

132
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,930
Wow, you look young!

133
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,870
Oh, you found some nostalgic stuff there.

134
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,240
Akira's the only Single...

135
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,240
This photo is back from when
Athena was promoted to a Prima.

136
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,420
Between the three of us, I was promoted last.

137
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,280
Pathetic, right?

138
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,330
How can you...

139
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,940
...say that with a smile?

140
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,610
It was difficult, wasn't it?
It was painful, wasn't it?!

141
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,910
I know you hate to lose...

142
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,850
So it definitely must have... hurt...

143
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,420
Unlike those two...

144
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,090
...I didn't have any special
talent that made me stand out.

145
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,270
Working hard wasn't enough
to make me a Prima.

146
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,840
That's why I ended up
taking longer than those two.

147
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,240
That's all.

148
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,380
Wasn't it hard for you?

149
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,280
It sure was!

150
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,150
After getting left behind as the
only Single, I was really depressed.

151
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,530
But you know what?

152
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,670
They're both great people...

153
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,630
...and they're also my friends.

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,640
Their rank and mine were two separate issues.

155
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,800
How can you be so strong?

156
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,550
What is it that gives you the strength...

157
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,890
...to be like that?

158
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,470
Can I tell you an old story?

159
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:49,140
It was when Athena got
promoted to Prima after Alicia.

160
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,680
Yeah, it was right after we took this photo.

161
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,380
Congratulations, Athena!

162
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,060
Thank you.

163
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,090
To think the day would come when
Athena would become a Prima...

164
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,530
Ehh?
My, my.

165
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,120
Just kidding!

166
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,430
Congratulations, Athena!

167
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
Thank you.

168
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,110
Now it's your turn, Akira.

169
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,370
Yup! Leave it to me!

170
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,580
They always say, "Save the best for last!"

171
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,610
Another beautiful day...

172
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,550
I wonder when it started?

173
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,190
My heart sinks when I smile in their presence.

174
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:14,260
This anxious feeling that I might
get left behind... it refuses to leave me...

175
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,940
Those two really are amazing.

176
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,280
They were born with extraordinary
gifts that I don't possess.

177
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,460
The sky is so blue...

178
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,490
...and so high...

179
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,060
Clover?

180
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,810
Just ordinary, three-leaf clovers...

181
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,320
I wonder if there's a four-leaf?

182
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,720
None.

183
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,020
I always tried not to think about it.

184
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,400
None.

185
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,170
Am I really one of the unblessed?

186
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,930
None, none!

187
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,740
There are blessed, special people
who can become Primas...

188
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,340
...and ordinary people who can't...

189
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,340
None, none, none!

190
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,950
I have no heavenly gift...

191
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,990
...so what can I do?

192
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,740
Hey lady, are you looking
for a four-leaf clover?

193
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,670
Ah, yeah...

194
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,410
If I recall correctly, she's the
daughter of Himeya's owner...

195
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,420
Is there something on my face?

196
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,350
Ah, no...

197
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,490
Of course she wouldn't know who I am.

198
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,730
An ordinary Single Undine like me...

199
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,900
Hmm... Nope, none here.

200
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,100
You can tell there aren't any four-leaf clovers
here because it's such a small flowerbed.

201
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,470
Why don't you give up?

202
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,070
You don't have what you don't have.
It can't be helped.

203
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,980
Miss?

204
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
You don't have... what you don't have...

205
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,760
It's all right!

206
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,740
If you don't have something,
all you need to do is make it!

207
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,680
See? A cute four-leaf clover, done!

208
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,080
I like this kind a lot better!

209
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,620
Look, this red rose petal is your heart.

210
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,990
Now you'll be okay, right, Miss?

211
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:47,100
At that moment, a girl much younger than I
taught me something very precious.

212
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,420
If a genius is someone who's been
bestowed with a gift from the heavens...

213
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,450
...and if my two rivals are geniuses...

214
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,190
...then I just need to create a talent
that excels through hard work.

215
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,600
Yes... I'll become a prodigy!

216
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,980
What a great story!

217
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,550
I guess she doesn't remember.
Makes sense, though.

218
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,030
Aika, you can have that bookmark if you want.

219
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,640
Eh? B-But isn't this your precious treasure?

220
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
Yup, and it's also an effective
good luck charm for aspiring Primas.

221
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,880
I'll treasure it!

222
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,920
Ah, Akira, this red petal is from a rose, right?

223
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,960
Yeah.

224
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:11,730
Could this be where you got your
alias "Crimson Rose" from?

225
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,130
Well, well, I wonder about that one!

226
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,150
Hey, Akari! Stop daydreaming!

227
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,750
Ah, sorry.

228
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,390
Junior, your face looks scary!

229
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,960
You need to smile more!

230
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,090
I-I know...

231
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,620
Geez, I'll do it, so just watch.

232
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,460
Okay, here we go!

233
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,700
Ah, sorry.

234
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,440
No one knows what their talents may be.

235
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,270
But I have something that no one can beat.

236
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,060
I have the best person in the world,
the person I'm most proud of, by my side.

237
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,430
That's a wonderful miracle
that Neo-Venezia itself created...

238
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,840
Ahh! I just said a sappy line!

239
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,340
No, I thought it! I was thinking it!
I'm so embarrassed!

240
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,310
Not allowed! Not allowed! Not allowed, Aika!

241
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,540
No sappy lines allowed! No sappy
lines allowed! Not allowed, Aika!

242
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,680
Calm down, Aika.
No sappy lines allowed! No sappy
lines allowed! Not allowed, Aika!

243
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,810
You're really not making any sense...
No sappy lines allowed! No sappy
lines allowed! Not allowed, Aika!

244
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,940
No sappy lines allowed!!

245
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,890
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

246
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,550
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

247
00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:00,470
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

248
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:09,350
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

249
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:22,830
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

250
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:31,900
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

251
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:45,150
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

252
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,620
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

253
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:56,960
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

254
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,290
And my day begins
Hajimaru
