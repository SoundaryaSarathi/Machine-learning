"A Super-Huge Genki Dama
- I'm Playing My Last Card!! "

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,210
It's no good. Not even with
Goku's 20x Kaio-ken.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,950
How can it be? That didn't have
much effect on him at all!

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,720
He wasn't bluffing this time either!

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,230
H- He really hasn't been using
any more than half of his power!

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,740
Ow, ow ow! Where am I?

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:53,080
Let's see... I was a frog, and
the frog was me, and Kuririn was there...

8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,090
Um, and Son-kun might have been there...

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,260
Enough! What's taking Son-kun so long?
Just take care of those aliens, already!

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,590
This planet really is the worst!

11
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,210
I've found you! This is your fault!
You won't get away with it!

12
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,570
Unbelievable! Goku's Kamehame-Ha
just now had incredible power!

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,230
Y- Yeah...

14
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,140
Why, then?

15
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,740
Why is it that Freeza has barely
taken any damage, then?

16
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,750
Father's Ki has dropped considerably!

17
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,980
To think that a guy like that
could exist in this world!

18
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,980
It's utterly lost.

19
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,200
It's just as Kaio said. No matter what,
we should have kept our hands off of Freeza.

20
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,540
T- That was a close one!

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,950
How!? How does that lower life
form Saiyan have such awesome power?

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,220
This is the first time anyone has
done this much harm to my body!

23
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,230
You damn Saiyan!

24
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,120
That one... hurt.

25
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,930
It hurt!!

26
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Father!

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,570
Monkey!

28
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,210
What happened to all that energy
you had a moment ago?

29
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,230
K- Kaio-sama, what is happening?

30
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,900
He's being beaten! Goku is taking
a one-sided beating!

31
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,920
- H- He's what!?
- H- He can't be!

32
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,180
F- Freeza is frighteningly strong.

33
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,190
That twenty-power Kaio-ken was
beyond Goku's limits after all.

34
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,200
What's wrong? Have you finally
used up the last of your power?

35
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,210
How dull. And here I thought I'd found an opponent
I could get somewhat serious over.

36
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:59,220
I really have lost a great deal of power. Looks as though
that 20x Kaio-ken had its price, all right.

37
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,400
Indeed, the Saiyans are a lower
life form, whose only talent is in fighting.

38
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,910
Every last one of you are fools.
Killing you off was the right decision.

39
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,900
It's... all over...

40
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:23,610
Kakarrot, you disappoint me!
Is that the extent of your power?
Where has your Saiyan pride gone?

41
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:32,920
- I ain't no Saiyan!
- Are you still saying that!? You're
a Saiyan unlike any other!

42
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,920
Vegeta, none of that matters now.
Team up with me...

43
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,950
You are a Saiyan! You have the fighting Saiyan
people's blood flowing through you!

44
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,390
Do you not feel the anguish?
The man who destroyed Planet Vegeta,

45
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,000
the world where you and I were
both born, is this same Freeza!

46
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,240
Does it not wound your pride as
a Saiyan to be battered about by him!?

47
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Saiyan... pride?

48
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:32,250
Your father, Burdock... as well as
my father, King Vegeta...

49
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,260
Kakarrot, you are the last
remaining Saiyan!

50
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,010
He wants to kill every last Saiyan.

51
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,270
This is because he fears the birth

52
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,780
of what is said to be the strongest
warrior in the universe,

53
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,850
the legendary Super Saiyan!

54
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:13,390
If I could have, I would have killed him by my own hand.
And then I get killed like a rag doll!

55
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,730
If you understand my anguish,

56
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,960
then be sure to kill him by your hand!

57
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,980
I... don't understand what
it is you're thinking.

58
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,590
I hate that sort of thing!

59
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,260
But I won't let you die easily.

60
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,400
I still want to have some fun, you see.

61
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,940
Vegeta, I was raised on Earth, so I don't
know anything about being Saiyan.

62
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,560
But I can at least understand your grief!

63
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,220
You're talking nonsense again.

64
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,570
I must not lose. I must not lose,
not to the likes of Freeza!

65
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,230
Stop messing with me!

66
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,860
What!?

67
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,280
Don't fool...

68
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,880
...with me!

69
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,290
Why, you!

70
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,900
That was kind of close just now! Looks like
you've got a bit of fight back in you.

71
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,840
But you Saiyans are
still lower life forms.

72
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,250
I can read what you're going to
do next as you attack.

73
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,860
You will forever be unable to beat me!

74
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,890
F- Father!

75
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,520
Looks like this is it.

76
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,540
You'll be wanting to die
pretty soon, right?

77
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,870
I'll put you out of your
misery right now!

78
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,890
What's that? What's the matter?

79
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,490
It's Bubbles-kun! It sounds like
it came from the house!

80
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,840
- What's the matter, Bubbles?
- Gregory!

81
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,250
It looks like there's someone in there!

82
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,250
...Ah, yum! Yum!
- Look at all this food!

83
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,250
Yummy, yummy!

84
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,030
Who are you guys!?

85
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,270
ReaCoom!

86
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,870
Butta!

87
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,540
Jheese!

88
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,280
Ghurd!

89
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,390
Together we are...

90
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,490
The Ginyu Special Corps!

91
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,990
It's missing something, huh?

92
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
Maybe because the
Commander isn't here.

93
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
We haven't done this in a while, either.

94
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,010
No, it has to be the gravity!

95
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,340
Okay, let's try it again!

96
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,680
Together we are...

97
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,840
The Ginyu Special Corps!

98
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,020
All right! That one went well!

99
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,520
We nailed it!

100
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay, from now on,
that's how we'll do it.

101
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,860
W- What's the deal...
with these guys?

102
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,720
I can't take it any more! I'm going!

103
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,870
W- Wait!

104
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,220
- How come? Father will be killed!
- Goku is about to do something!

105
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,220
But what? What can he hope
to do with such little remaining power?

106
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,230
What's this? What are you trying to do?

107
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,020
Ah! A Genki Dama!

108
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,520
What? A Genki Dama?

109
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,520
T- That's right. The Genki Dama, a last-ditch
technique he learned
from Kaio-sama.

110
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:20,270
The foliage and animals on this planet, as well
as ourselves, and even microorganisms...

111
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,040
He takes a fraction of the Genki,
the basic energy of life, from every
living thing, and apportions it to himself.

112
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,310
And then... and then he creates
a ball of energy, and attacks with it!

113
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
What!?

114
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,490
Damn, Kaio. You kept that
back from us, didn't you?

115
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:46,230
B- But will it work against Freeza?
There's a far smaller number of living
things here than on Earth!

116
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,500
What choice is there!? Goku
has to realize that too! Are you
saying there's another option left!?

117
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,200
All we can do is gamble that this works!

118
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,470
I can't beat Freeza with just
the energy from this planet.

119
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,980
Those planets in Namek, I only
need a little from each of you...

120
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,480
Share some of your Genki with me!

121
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,370
T- This Genki Dama is the
last thing I wanted to use.

122
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,530
There'll probably be too much force to it!
It will be hard not to squash the planet itself!

123
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:47,040
But if I don't wipe out Freeza here and now,
the universe itself could be torn apart!

124
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,550
I don't know if this is going to
go right or not, but it's all I can do now!

125
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,390
What's this you're doing?

126
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,560
You're still thinking of trying some
kind of nonsense, are you?

127
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
What can you possibly do, as
worn out as you are?

128
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,570
G- Goku...

129
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,310
Can you really beat Freeza
with a Genki Dama?

130
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,310
W- What's this I'm sensing?

131
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,850
l- It's...

132
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,520
G- Genki Dama...

133
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,870
l- It can't be... !

134
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,730
A Genki Dama, loaded with
the hopes of the universe.

135
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,300
Will this turn out to be
Goku's very last card?
