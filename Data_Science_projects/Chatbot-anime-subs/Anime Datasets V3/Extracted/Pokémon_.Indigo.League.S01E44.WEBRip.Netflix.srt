-Ash. Come on, wake up, Ash.
-[grunts]

-What is it, Misty?
-Something’s wrong with Pikachu.

-Huh?
-Ash.

-Pikachu.
-[Pikachu squawks]

18
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,137
[Brock] There’s something wrong
with Pikachu’s voice.

What’s the matter, Pikachu?
Are you in pain?

[Pikachu squeaks]

21
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,227
Maybe there’s something stuck
in Pikachu’s throat.

22
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,981
Ah! Hold on.
I'll get it out for you, Pikachu.

You’re making it worse.

-We should get Pikachu to a doctor.
-You’re right.

26
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,327
We've got to get Pikachu to the nearest

Please help us, doctor.

Well, how could I turn down
such a pretty face?

your problem, little lady?

This is a hospital for people.

Why don’t you take your Pokémon
to Joy at the Pokémon Center?

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,272
It's too far to the Pokémon Center.
We might not make it.

-Hang in there, Pikachu.

Good.

64
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,873
A Pikachu would need about 10 000 volts.

-Okay.

-If you had waited any longer,

irresponsible of you as a trainer

to let your Pikachu eat this thing whole.

-I didn’t let Pikachu do it.
-[Proctor] Huh.

In any case, the treatment's over,
so go on home.

Well, he may have had
a soft spot for Misty,

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,483
but he sure seemed
pretty hard on you, Ash.

Well, he's not the only one who has
a soft spot for pretty girls, is he?

get these Pokémon to the hospital.

00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,912
This Raticate's teeth are broken.

171
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,914
It couldn’t bite anything if it tried.

172
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,250
Just glue its teeth back
in with superglue.

173
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,501
-Chansey.
-Thanks.

174
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,421
-Who are you?
-I'm Dr. Proctor.

175
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,425
How about a pizza with me
after I finish treating these Pokémon?

176
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,344
I'll bet you’re quite a doctor.

177
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,013
Well, yes, I am.

178
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,598
We'll talk more over the pepperoni,

179
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,017
but right now,
you’ve just got to help my Arbok.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,852
Okay, let's see.

181
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,646
Its own poison
is circulating through its body.

182
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,190
I'll have to remove it in a hurry.

183
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,986
-[grunts] You!
-Ah. It's the twerp.

184
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,362
The twerp's an MD?

185
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,657
What dumb plan are you two
working on this time?

186
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,867
Later.

187
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,288
Doctor, I'll be so grateful
if you help my Arbok.

188
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,125
Don’t trust them, doctor.
Those two are from Team Rocket.

189
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,838
-So what? Arbok is injured.
-We're bad, not insensitive.

190
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,382
Chansey, bring me
a hypodermic of anesthetic.

191
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,968
-Chansey.
-Doctor!

192
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,808
[yells]

193
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,227
I wanted you to cure it, not kill it.

194
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,354
It's just sleeping.

195
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,232
-Now I can perform the procedure.
-Huh?

196
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,946
Why help them?
They’re from Team Rocket.

197
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,948
To a doctor, a patient is a patient.

198
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,826
There’s no such thing
as good guys or bad guys.

199
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:22,247
-Uh...
-A doctor's job is to heal, not to judge.

200
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,749
Sorry.

201
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,585
Chansey. Chansey.

202
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,963
Looks like more are on the way.

203
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,257
I’ve still got to work on Arbok,

204
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,344
but maybe I could convince this beautiful
young woman to lend us a hand.

205
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,180
Huh?
I presume you are referring to me?

206
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,143
-Why, yes.
-I'll do my best.

207
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,602
And me, too.

208
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,522
What happened to my charm?

209
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,317
Somebody help me find my charm.
I'll pay any price.

210
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,236
[Chansey] Chansey?

211
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,656
Oh, thanks. I said price, not rice.

212
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,659
-Chansey.
-I don’t want to play.

213
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,746
-Find my charm, please!
-Chansey!

214
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,707
Did someone call the police?

215
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,501
My charm. My charm. My charm.

216
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,878
Venonat.

217
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,297
-Will you get off of me?
-Chansey!

218
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,717
-Chansey!
-[Meowth] Ah!

219
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,721
-Chansey! Chansey! Chansey!
-[Meowth groans]

220
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,393
Squirtle!

221
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,271
Bulbasaur.

222
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,317
[monitors bleeping]

223
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,652
[Brock] Keep it from moving around.

224
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,030
I'm trying.

225
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,073
All right, this one looks okay.

226
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,577
Uh, try not to move around too much
until the glue hardens, okay?

227
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,412
[grunting]

228
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,997
Hey, there, take it easy.

229
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,500
[laughs]
It's just trying to say thank you, James.

230
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,841
We have to do this carefully.

231
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,511
I don’t need you to tell me
how to do things, thank you.

232
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,013
Easy. Easy does it.

233
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,516
-Voltorb, Voltorb.
-[both yelling]

234
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,935
I told you.

235
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,228
Watch what you’re doing
over there, ladies.

236
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,272
Voltorb can self-destruct, you know.

237
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,275
This thing can self-destruct?

238
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:18,196
-Uh, I forgot, I have to find Meowth.
-But, Jessie.

239
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,532
-Chansey, take over.
-Chansey!

240
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,618
-Voltorb, Voltorb.
-Chansey.

241
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,455
-Don’t you self-destruct, Voltorb.
-Chansey. Chansey.

242
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,458
Chansey. Chansey.

243
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,377
Hang in there, Weepinbell.

244
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,380
-[grunts]
-Nice work.

245
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,923
Chansey.

246
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
How you feeling, Weepinbell?

247
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,302
Weepinbell.

248
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,808
[squawking]

249
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,518
Hey, settle down.

250
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
We can’t get near it.

251
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,815
-That’s a knotty problem.
-Chansey.

252
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,776
Dr. Proctor, what do we do?

253
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,821
Dodrio, a triple bird Pokémon.

254
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,241
Its three heads represent
joy, sorrow and anger.

255
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,744
[Ash] Uh, all three heads
look pretty angry to me.

256
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,081
If we don’t get it untangled,
it could suffocate.

257
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,916
Chansey, prepare the anesthetic.

258
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,918
Chansey.

259
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,338
Okay. Now, don’t move.

260
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,590
[squawks]

261
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,510
[Proctor yells]

262
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,303
[Brock and Ash gasp]

263
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,346
Chansey.

264
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,557
Oh, boy, that's not good.

265
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,183
-Ah.
-Are you okay, doc?

266
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,352
-Does this look okay?
-Huh?

267
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,774
I'd say this’ll put me out
for at least six hours.

268
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,776
Doctor, you can't go to sleep.

269
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,281
You guys take over. Good night.

270
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,449
-Doc!
-Doctor!

271
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,658
Pika.

272
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,369
Uh, wake up, doc. Come on, wake up.

273
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,246
Uh, he's out.

274
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,790
Chansey.

275
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,293
-So, what now?
-Beats me.

276
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,796
[squawking]

277
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,299
-Pika, pika.
-Chansey!

278
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,802
Hmm. All right, then.
Let's give it a try.

279
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,305
We'll just do our best
to help these Pokémon.

280
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,187
<i>I’m going to be the world's</i>
<i>best Pokémon master someday.</i>

281
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,814
<i>I can't let this scare me.</i>

282
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,859
-Go, Squirtle.
-Squirtle!

283
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,821
-Weaken Dodrio with Water Gun.
-Squirtle!

284
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,703
Dodrio should be weak
against electric attacks.

285
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:36,000
-Pikachu, Thunder Bolt now.
-Pikachu!

286
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,754
Yeah! I knew that would do it.

287
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,257
-Now I'll just capture it and--
-Ash!

288
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,510
Oh, yeah.
I'm not supposed to capture it.

289
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,430
Just take it easy.
We'll have you better in no time.

290
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,353
[Proctor snoring]

291
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,022
Bulbasaur.

292
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,148
[Misty] You'll be fine.

293
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,526
-[Ash] It's okay.
-Huh?

294
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,945
Weezing.

295
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,114
Mm.

296
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,868
Where’s my charm? I want my charm.

297
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,872
Parasect. Parasect.

298
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,335
Well, James, so much for charity work.

299
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,754
Now it's time for Team Rocket
to take over.

300
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,964
Exactly.

301
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,509
Now that they’re weak, we should be
able to capture those Pokémon

302
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,885
with no trouble at all.

303
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,387
Ah!

304
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,306
To protect the world from devastation.

305
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,059
To unite all peoples within our nation.

306
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,603
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

307
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,148
To extend our reach to the stars above.

308
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,984
-Jessie.
-James. Come on.

309
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,070
Team Rocket
blast off at the speed of light.

310
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,906
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

311
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,911
-I want my charm! [sobs]
-[Jessie and James jibber]

312
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,706
[all groaning]

313
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,837
Quit it. We need help around here.

314
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,798
We're through with the goody-goody act.

315
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,925
From now on,
we're bad old Team Rocket.

316
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,428
All of the Pokémon
in this hospital are ours.

317
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,056
-You can't have them.
-The doctor treated your Pokémon too.

318
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,267
Is that how you act
when somebody does you a favor?

319
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,020
-Exactly how.
-And that’s because...

320
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,440
[both] We're Team Rotten.

321
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,442
They got that right.

322
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,446
Our first attack
will be the stretcher catcher.

323
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,530
[both grunt]

324
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,867
The stretcher catcher?

325
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,038
[Ash grunts and groans]

326
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,165
[mumbles]

327
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,126
-I can't move.
-We're all trapped.

328
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,295
-Pikachu.
-Excellent.

329
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,674
We concocted these while you were busy
tending to all those poor little Pokémon.

330
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,717
Comfortable?

331
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,093
Let us go!

332
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,888
There are still lots of Pokémon
waiting for us to treat them.

333
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,097
Don’t worry.

334
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,518
We'll treat them just as soon as
we capture every single one of them.

335
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,811
Right. We're finally going to win.

336
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,649
So get ready.
It's payback time for Team Rocket.

337
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,901
Oh, no, wait. Don’t do it!

338
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,902
Chansey!

339
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,905
-What’s with this one?
-Get out of the way.

340
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,657
Chansey!

341
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,577
So, you won’t move?
Arbok, deal with this.

342
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,080
Arbok!

343
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,999
Eliminate this Chansey immediately.

344
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,878
-Chansey!
-Arbok.

345
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,090
Chansey!

346
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,178
What are you waiting for?
Attack it, Arbok.

347
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,764
-Arbok.
-You won’t do it?

348
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,851
-All right, Weezing, Gas attack!
-Weezing.

349
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,110
Don’t just float there.
I said Gas attack.

350
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,946
Weezing.

351
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,119
-What’s going on around here?
-My charm.

352
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,537
[Proctor laughs and all gasp]

353
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,831
You shouldn’t be surprised.

354
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,251
-Good morning, everyone.
-[all] Huh?

355
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,753
You see, Team Rockets
Pokémon haven’t forgotten

356
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,215
that Chansey cared for them when
they were injured and needed treatment.

357
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,676
This isn’t any of your business.

358
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
[grunting]

359
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,973
-[Brock] Nice slice.
-He's fast.

360
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,934
You see, miss Team Rocket

361
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,980
before you start playing rough,
you better take a look at my ammunition.

362
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,069
-Ooh, quite an arsenal.
-We shouldn’t mess with him.

363
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,823
-No way.
-Now, who wants to be my next patient?

364
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,325
-Yeah!
-Chansey!

365
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,659
Chansey!

366
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,952
We're free again.

367
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,330
-Thanks a lot, Chansey.
-[Chansey] Chansey.

368
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,498
Oh, and thanks for the break,
Team Rocket.

369
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,751
You can have these back.

370
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:51,213
[all yelling and gasping]

371
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,262
-Ha-ha.
-See you again soon.

372
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,183
[all panting]

373
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,353
We came away empty-handed again,
James.

374
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,813
Well, I did manage to get this one.

375
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,440
-Ah. But that’s a--
-It's a Voltorb!

376
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,486
Voltorb! Voltorb! Voltorb!

377
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,780
[all yell]

378
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,283
[all]
Team Rocket's blasting off again.

379
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,952
[all screaming]

380
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,749
I got my charm back.

381
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,668
[James and Jessie] That’s charming.

382
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,343
All of you could become
outstanding doctors.

383
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,304
Why don’t you stay here and train
in my hospital with me?

384
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,139
Now, thanks anyway.

385
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,226
I have to follow my dream
of becoming a Pokémon Master.

386
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,854
Yeah and my dream of becoming
a Pokémon breeder.

387
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,315
I really think I might like
being a doctor someday,

388
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,235
but first I have a lot more to learn
about Water Pokémon.

389
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,613
Hm, I’m sure you’ll become
whatever you want.

390
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,281
-See you.
-Goodbye.

391
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,158
-And thanks again.
-Pikachu.

392
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,077
-Good luck to you.
-Chansey!

393
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,204
-Chansey!
-Chansey!
