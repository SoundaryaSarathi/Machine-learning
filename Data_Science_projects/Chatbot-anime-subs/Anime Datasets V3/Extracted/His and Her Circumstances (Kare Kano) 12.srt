1045
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:04,946
What's happened so far!

1046
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,583
Our sister, the masked honor student
Miyazawa Yukino...

1047
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,682
...is the ultimate. Queen of Vanity.

1048
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:14,086
She lived only to show off in
front of others, no matter what.

1049
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:15,358
She successfully played
the perfect model student...

1050
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:18,053
...seemingly elegant and graceful,
blessed with both beauty and intelligence.

1051
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,724
A really amazing girl.

1052
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:22,764
But because of a certain error on her part,
that mask was finally stripped away.

1053
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,966
The one lucky, or perhaps unlucky,
enough to first find out her true identity...

1054
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,901
...was an unusual person named
Arima Souichirou.

1055
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,036
He was also a real model student.

1056
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,036
He gets excellent grades,
is good at every sport...

1057
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:35,210
...and is generally a sociable guy
who would never make any enemies.

1058
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:36,275
Although their pasts differed...

1059
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:37,907
...these two came to share
a secret as model students

1060
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,217
with dual personalities.

1061
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,380
After passing through phases as:
partners in the Student Assembly...

1064
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:48,991
...good friends, and being more
than friends but not quite lovers...

1065
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:50,091
...they finally became a couple.

1066
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,692
And these two,

1067
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,393
being affected by each others lives...

1068
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,030
...decided to live for their own real happiness.

1069
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,602
We're so happy for you, Sis.

1070
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:01,461
But the world isn't

1071
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,670
that simple or generous.

1072
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,939
That's right. The world is a cruel place.

1073
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:12,043
The menace of the athletic festival
which forced them to be super
busy and not see each other...

1077
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,817
...as if to challenge their relationship.

1079
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,312
In order to carry his ambition
of the Asaba Mary-Land Project...

1080
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:22,056
...a guy attempted to demoralize Sis
and possibly break them up.

1082
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,862
This delinquent, perverted
hunk, is Asaba Hideaki.

1086
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,390
The final exam grades...
...which resulted from their yielding
to their love-power and goofing off.

1087
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,423
Sis's one-sided feeling of
estrangement occured because of this.

1088
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,529
"And on top of it all, "

1089
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,197
the interference and pressure

1090
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,367
towards them from...

1091
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:36,205
"...the teachers at school, "

1092
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:37,270
who tried to stop their grades from dropping.

1093
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,166
"Then, the incident where Sis was ignored "

1094
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:41,101
by all the girls in the class...

1095
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:42,978
...led by lsawa Maho who had independently
analyzed Sis and figured out her true nature.

1096
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:46,212
She was attacked by Shibahime Tsubasa, 

1097
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,519
who was seething with envy...

1098
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:50,844
...because she had liked Arima since middle school.

1099
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:52,054
The temporary separation

1100
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:53,719
with Arima due to

1101
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,787
summer club activities.

1102
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,455
And the blazing summer sun

1103
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,022
beat down on the girls !

1104
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,453
And so forth,

1105
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:02,661
Sis faced up to this series of challenges,

1106
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:03,966
made friends instead...

1107
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,462
...and steadily stepped up the stage at

1108
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:06,802
which her relationship with Arima stands.

1109
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,403
She doesn't get discouraged easily.

1110
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,838
So anyway, after a lot of stuff happened,

1111
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,801
it's finally the first summer in high school.

1112
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,441
Sis went off to have fun with the friends

1113
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,643
she made for the first time!

1114
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,345
They manage the standard menu of tea,

1115
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:20,548
karaoke, and window shopping.

1116
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:22,983
It was finally Sis's debut into the world of friends,

1117
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,184
but as it turned out...

1118
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:25,751
...before we knew it, 

1119
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:26,988
she was mixed up in

1120
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,951
another family's private problems.

1121
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:33,554
And what did Shibahime
Tsubasa have to say at that point...?!

1122
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,230
I won't accept remarriage.

1123
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,367
I'll do whatever it takes to get
Daddy back from that woman.

1125
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,397
So, that's the deal.

1126
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,202
Can she stay here for a while?

1127
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,675
I thought so.

1128
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,138
I figured she might do something like that.

1129
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:53,114
Damn. That little monkey...

1130
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,609
I'm glad I called. I'll be right over.

1131
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,021
Thank you!

1132
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,249
Yes!  Comiiing!

1133
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:04,691
Hi. I'm sorry that idiot caused such a problem.

1134
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:06,361
Tsubasa, we're leaving!

1135
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:07,426
No way!

1136
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:08,763
I'm not going back there!

1137
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,768
Until Daddy breaks up with that woman,
I'm not going home!

1139
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,737
Quit being so friggin' unreasonable,
you're in someone else's house!

1141
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,470
Get your ass ready to go
right now, you damn monkey!

1142
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,870
Shut the hell up.

1143
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,869
I said no, didn't I?

1144
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:21,634
Who do you think you are, you nympho?!

1146
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,648
Besides, I have no further use for you.

1147
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,347
Could you stop being so familiar with me?

1148
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,153
What the HELL are you crying for?!

1149
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:36,222
You make me wanna puke!

1150
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,425
No!  No!

1151
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,359
Quit talking bullshit and wasting
my goddamn time!  We're LEAVING!

1153
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,357
I don't wanna!

1154
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,563
Move your ass already!
I said I don't wanna!

1155
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:47,004
Scary...we can't get a word in edgewise...

1156
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:51,167
Things have now changed from
a deadlock to something worse.

1157
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,374
Now now...

1158
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:54,275
You don't have to force her home if she doesn't want to go.

1159
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:57,341
One or two more girls won't
make much difference.

1160
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,614
It's summer vacation,

1161
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,809
so we wouldn't really mind.

1162
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,452
Don't spoil her like that!

1163
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:04,947
This is her trick!

1164
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:06,654
She knows she's cute.

1165
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:08,821
If you begin to indulge her,
she'll take you for all she can!

1166
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,790
Just shut up and go home already.

1167
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,233
I want to go home.

1168
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,762
By the way,
I told your dad about this.

1170
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,000
He said he would come straight over after work.

1171
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:22,871
Huh!

1172
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,469
You can't sulk forever.

1173
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:27,074
Solve your problems yourself.

1174
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,584
Sorry you came all the way out here for nothing.

1175
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:36,917
She's such a pain!

1177
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,953
She makes me want to hang her upside
down and fix her attitude with a whip!

1179
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,721
S & M...not a world I know.

1180
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,132
Well, I can see why she's like that though.

1181
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,295
Tsubasa's family circumstances
are pretty complicated.

1182
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:57,038
Her mother died giving birth to her.

1184
00:04:57,676 --> 00:05:01,043
So her father cherishes Tsubasa,

1185
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,402
but he's busy with work...

1186
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:05,349
So he had to often leave
her for others to look after.

1188
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:07,845
Because she grew up in that kind of environment...

1189
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,010
...when I first met her in kindergarten...

1190
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:14,315
...she wouldn't open up to anyone
and was silently crouching in a corner.

1192
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,528
Her most basic emotional needs weren't being met.

1193
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,989
Still, 

1194
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:20,763
she was doing okay with her father...

1195
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,065
...but then he said he was
marrying another woman.

1197
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,703
I could see how she'd hate it.

1199
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,334
I don't think her needs have
been met for a long, long time.

1200
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,100
My family's still all together,

1201
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,977
so I can only

1202
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,403
imagine these things.

1204
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:40,142
But someone who was born without the things
that all of us take for granted...

1206
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:44,112
...has to fulfill them by herself somehow.

1208
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,523
That's the fight she has.

1209
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,290
That's really kinda tough.

1210
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:52,127
You don't know

1211
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,395
anything about Arima!

1212
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:03,897
Arima knew how she felt.

1213
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,938
That's why he thought of Tsubasa like a sister.

1215
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:09,045
In those days, 

1216
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,176
Arima couldn't spare time to love somebody.

1217
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:17,748
He had his hands full staying perfect and
burying his past in the depths of his memory.

1220
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,551
While no one could enter Arima's field of vision,

1221
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,616
Tsubasa alone was special.

1222
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,128
Because he knew,

1223
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,625
somewhere in his heart, that they were the same kind. 

1224
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,692
Those two make a pretty picture together...

1225
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:33,065
A really pretty picture...

1226
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,601
But somehow, it feels sad.

1228
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:48,745
I don't think I've ever seen Tsubasa
really smile from her heart.

1230
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:50,780
Things are a mess now...

1231
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,378
...but someday,

1232
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,054
I hope that everything goes right,

1233
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,294
and she can become happy.

1235
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:01,556
I bet she'd be really cute
when she smiles from her heart.

1237
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,194
Thanks for seeing me off,

1238
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:06,830
and sorry for all the trouble.

1239
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:07,932
Take good care of that monkey.

1240
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,872
Right.

1241
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:19,306
You don't know anything about Arima!

1243
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:25,050
Maybe Arima's deeper and
more chaotic inside than I thought.

1245
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:31,559
Maybe I still know
only a small part of him.

1247
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,123
Let's eat!

1248
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,459
Dinner!  Dinner!

1249
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,466
Please have as much as you want, okay?

1250
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,907
It's summer, so you won't last if you don't eat.

1251
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,476
This isn't anything special, but...

1252
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,004
Oh, please, don't mind us.

1253
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,677
I guess that's easier said that done.

1254
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,514
Gee, um...

1255
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:01,850
...this is the first time
Yukino's brought friends over.
I'm so nervous...

1258
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,817
Dad, why are you blushing ?

1259
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:05,956
Eww, what are you thinking?

1260
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:11,693
He's such a perv!  Riiight?

1261
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,697
I can't believe this family...

1262
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:20,006
This is it!

1263
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,335
Yay! Blue 1.

1264
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:23,247
Blue 8.

1265
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:24,138
Blue 3!

1266
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:25,106
Blue 2.

1267
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,041
Blue 0.

1268
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,181
I'm sorry, dear...Draw Four!

1269
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,315
Right off the bat?!
Fine, fine, I'll just

1270
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,081
take my four cards.

1272
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,023
Will this be the greatest
crisis in the marital relationship?!

1273
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:38,852
Okay, Green 5.

1274
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,889
Heh heh heh heh...Skip!

1275
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,266
Tsukino, that's mean!

1276
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:43,225
Green 1.

1277
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:44,431
Okay, wild to Yellow!

1278
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:46,129
Nice, dear!

1279
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,504
Leave the yellow to me!
I have lots of yellow cards!

1281
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:52,175
The marital relationship is restored already!

1282
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:52,976
Well then, Yellow 4.

1283
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,175
Skip skip, tra-la-la !

1284
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:56,411
Not again!

1285
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,248
Sorry. Reverse.

1286
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,310
All right!  Sorry, Tsukino...Skip!

1287
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,645
What?!I can't beleive this!

1288
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:03,846
Then here's Yellow 2.

1289
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:04,848
Yellow 8.

1290
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,252
Draw Two!

1291
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,952
Uno.

1292
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,426
What?!

1293
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:09,290
This really sucks!

1294
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,686
I swear by my family name,
that I'll stop her at all costs!

1295
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,796
Oh no!  I can't do it!

1296
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,431
Wait, wait, why do I have so many cards ?

1297
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,766
No problemo!

1298
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:24,837
I have a big hand, too, so I have
all sorts of cards in here! Here, Reverse!
*Alright!*

1300
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:27,904
You saved us, Dad!

1301
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:35,048
I wonder if this is what
a normal family is like.

1304
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:42,551
I wonder if Arima was attracted
to that about her, too.

1305
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,452
A happy family that seems
to know nothing about suffering.

1306
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:49,424
I can't take this now.

1307
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,865
I can't help but feel annoyed by them.

1308
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:03,013
Isn't it painful for Arima
when he's around this family...?

1310
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:11,580
Comiiing!

1311
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:16,551
Forgive me for visiting at this late hour.

1313
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:19,395
What a HOT father!

1314
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,598
I guess I'd expect that from Tsubasa's father.

1315
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,500
What a finely structured face.

1316
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,301
I don't know what to say...

1317
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:29,570
...it seems my daughter
has caused you some trouble...

1318
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,066
Now now, I'm sure
you have a lot to talk about.

1319
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:34,740
Please come in and we can discuss it at length.

1321
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,077
Well, excuse me...

1322
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:40,481
Mr. Shibahime!

1323
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,512
Excuse me...

1324
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:45,216
But kind of a klutz.

1325
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:51,050
It appears there was
some emotional disagreement...

1327
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:53,929
...between my daughter and
I regarding the matter of my remarriage.

1329
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,660
That the matter has come to trouble you here...

1330
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,701
...embarasses me deeply.

1331
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,928
I totally understand that feeling.

1332
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:02,939
How daughters don't want their

1333
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,032
dad to be taken by someone else!

1334
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,206
Dad, shut up.

1335
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:07,645
Don't butt in.

1336
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:13,612
My wife passed away shortly
after giving birth to my daughter.

1338
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,719
We've been managing by
ourselves somehow since then...

1339
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,852
But recently, my daughter
had a skateboarding accident

1340
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:21,120
in which she hit a brick wall...

1341
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:25,159
...and laid undiscovered under the rubble
all night, and was subsequently hospitalized.

1343
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,863
I became extremely anxious
about our current life...

1344
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:32,162
...just the two of us while
I'm busy holding my job.

1346
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:36,038
Then I was greatly encouraged
by this woman here,

1347
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,404
who was working as a nurse in the ward.

1348
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:43,270
Upon talking to her,  I found out that her husband
had passed away leaving her with a son...

1350
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:47,142
So we had a lot in common.

1353
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:51,517
I had been thinking that
she was such a cool professional woman.

1355
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,922
But then I started to
get self-conscious around her...

1356
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:57,988
When Tsubasa was released from the hospital...

1357
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:00,055
...I got up my courage
and asked her out to a movie.

1358
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:02,992
The "Nemuri Kyoushirou" series was playing...

1359
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,796
...and we talked about
how cool the late Ichikawa Raizou was.

1360
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,330
And the "Tange Sazen" series is good, too.

1361
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,942
This is beside the point...

1363
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,808
...but the director's anti-heroism,
or rather his realistic portrayal...

1364
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:18,942
...in the movie "The Pot Worth a
Million Ryo" (1935) is just excellent.

1365
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,079
And then on TV we like epic sagas...

1366
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,350
...and shows about the Shinsen-gumi

1367
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,813
and the last days of the shogunate...

1368
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:26,087
...but our favorites had to be

1369
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:27,323
"The Edo Untouchables" and "The Fang Edo."

1370
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,427
We had the exact same tastes,

1371
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:31,627
and so we hit it off...

1373
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:35,590
Who asked you to start babbling about

1374
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,831
how you started dating?!

1375
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:38,593
True!

1376
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:42,563
So I thought it might not be a bad idea
to consider remarriage.

1378
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,834
I thought that everyone
would be happier that way.

1379
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:50,873
But why do you keep rebelling
without even considering it?

1381
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:53,911
Because I don't need a new family.

1383
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,319
Don't just assume you know
what makes me happy.

1384
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:58,683
I don't want strangers
coming into our house.

1385
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,316
I don't want them messing
around in our kitchen.

1386
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,819
I don't want to see you
laughing with some other woman!

1387
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:06,356
I can't think of her as my mother!

1388
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,388
I like things the way they are!

1390
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,599
Tsubasa, do you hate me?

1391
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:22,071
Yeah. You suck up and play mother...

1392
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,480
You're obviously just trying
to win points for yourself.

1393
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:25,471
Tsubasa!

1394
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:27,717
It's okay. Tsubasa, that's not true.

1395
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:29,842
I only have a son,

1396
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:31,946
so it makes me happy to
be able to care for a girl.

1397
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:35,057
I wish you were my real daughter.

1399
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:36,794
True...

1400
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:40,731
I'd want to be the mother of
a girl that cute just once, too...

1402
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:43,029
Just what do you mean by that?!

1403
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,860
Don't make me sick.

1404
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:47,636
You're just trying to make him marry you.

1405
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,739
There aren't many handsome,
rich guys like him around.

1407
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,008
Tsubasa, that's enough!

1408
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,139
Apologize to Ikeda!

1409
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:55,801
Why?!

1410
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,475
Why're you always taking her side?!

1411
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,919
Why don't you listen to me at all?!

1413
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,751
I just want it to be the two of us!

1414
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:07,785
For ever and ever, just the two of us!

1415
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,718
Why do you yell at me as if I'm
the only one being selfish?!

1417
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,498
Why won't you understand 
my feelings at all?!

1419
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,100
Tsubasa...

1420
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,965
Don't touch me, bitch.

1421
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,979
He...he hit me...

1422
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:44,823
He's never ever hit me before.

1424
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,224
T...this is bad.

1425
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,960
Um, things being the way they are,
shall we take care of your daughter tonight?

1427
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:56,334
But, well...

1428
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:59,576
It's better to leave her
alone at a time like this.

1430
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:07,341
All right...Tsubasa, it's not that
I don't love you anymore.

1432
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,180
When I found out you were in an accident,

1433
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:12,122
I thought I'd go mad.

1434
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,054
Having lost your mother,

1435
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,793
I felt like I couldn't go on
if I were to lose you, too.

1437
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:21,654
It was really hard, carrying on alone
with that burden of fear on my shoulders.

1440
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,492
I'm only human. Imperfect...

1441
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,436
I wanted someone for support.

1442
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:29,771
To keep living from now on.

1443
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,836
I'm not getting married
right this minute or anything.

1444
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,872
But I want you to think about it with me.

1445
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,106
Because if we all think together...

1446
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,613
...we might find somewhere
that is happier than where we are now.

1448
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,594
I'm dreadfully sorry, causing
one imposition after another...

1450
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:53,487
Not at all!

1451
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,159
We weren't very good hosts ourselves.

1452
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,893
Life can be tough, but hang in there!

1453
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:01,999
Goodbye.

1454
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,965
Goodbye.

1455
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,204
Goodbye.

1456
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:16,677
Hey, you two even if your mother dies,
I'll never get remarried, okay?

1460
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:18,883
Hey, don't bury me just yet!

1461
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,088
That's right!
There's a watermelon in the fridge!

1462
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,723
Daddy, your face reminded us!

1463
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,564
Thanks!  Let's chow down!
Everyone loves watermelon...

1464
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:35,337
Having a sad dream.
Why am I here, too?

1465
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,831
Tsubasa. Tsubasa, you're my treasure.

1466
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,404
I love you more than
anything in the world.

1467
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,209
I love you more than anyone.

1468
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,246
That's what he said before,

1469
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:24,982
but now that woman's more important

1470
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,048
to him than I am.

1471
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:32,794
Maybe it's become a burden to raise me.

1473
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:36,230
Maybe he wants to get away from me.

1474
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:37,990
Of course not.

1475
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,458
You do understand, don't you?

1477
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,799
They all care about you.

1478
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,569
Men...I hate them all.

1479
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,738
They're nice to you,

1480
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,813
but they always end up
choosing some other woman.

1482
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,747
I wish someone would appear someday

1483
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,177
and fulfill Tsubasa's needs.

1485
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,190
Good job.

1486
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,023
Nice work.

1487
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,627
Okay!

1488
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,393
Kazuma, man, you're not bad!

1489
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:40,661
We can't just waste you as a temp !

1490
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:41,997
We'll give you stage
time so you should sing more.

1491
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,200
Wow, can I?  Awesome!

1492
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,932
Damn, swell headed already!

1493
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,395
Just started high school, too!

1494
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,896
This ain't funny!  Kiss 'im already!

1495
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,133
Hey, cut it out!

1496
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,077
You guys are all sweaty!

1497
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:57,444
Say, I heard that your mom
might be getting remarried?

1499
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,143
What, for real?

1500
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:00,375
That's complex.

1501
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,884
Yeah, well, it ain't my business.

1502
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,915
If it makes Mom happy,

1503
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,416
I'm all for it.

1504
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:09,320
I see.

1505
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,818
You're such a good son.

1506
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,695
That's big of you, Zumappie. Want a kiss?

1507
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:15,657
They're nice guys,

1508
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,130
but just a bit on the beastly side.

1509
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,461
No way I can tell 'em that

1510
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:22,932
the guy has a daughter my age.

1511
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:47,462
If we all think together...

1512
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,597
...we might find somewhere
happier than where we are now...

1513
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,213
What'll happen next !

1514
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,280
Sis can't do anything about

1515
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,624
another's family problems !

1516
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,924
And after accusing others and
running away from her problems...

1517
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,057
...Shibahime Tsubasa gives
herself up to despair !

1518
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,956
What will the arrival of
Ikeda Kazuma bring for her ?!

1520
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:06,833
Next time on KareKano:
"The Subjectivity of Happiness."

1521
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,667
I want a boyfriend, too.
