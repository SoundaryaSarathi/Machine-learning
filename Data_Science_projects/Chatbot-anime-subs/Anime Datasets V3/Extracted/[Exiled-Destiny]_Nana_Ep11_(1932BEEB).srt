1
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,371
A month after I moved to Tokyo,

2
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:24,651
my incredible luck...

3
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,121
came to an end.

4
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,921
When I was darkness at that time

5
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,751
With trembling lips

6
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,851
In a corner of a room I cry

7
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,931
The more I struggle

8
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,761
The more this wound deepens

9
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,931
The broken promise hurt me

10
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:18,661
Nobody can save me

11
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,841
God, I have only one request

12
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,471
Stop tearing apart my love

13
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,811
I need your love

14
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,051
I'm a broken rose

15
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:34,991
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

16
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,161
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

17
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,931
I need your love

18
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,231
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,171
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

20
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,121
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

21
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:53,101
I wanna need your love

22
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:56,331
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:58,671
I wanna need your love

24
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,151
I'm broke!

25
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,781
Naturally.

26
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,771
But why? I worked so hard
and saved up before coming here,

27
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,001
yet I only have 2,228 yen left.

28
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,471
If you spend your money,
it runs out.

29
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:30,571
You went on this crazy spending splurge
of clothes and furniture.

30
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,411
But Mr. Mizukoshi gave me a good deal
on everything I got from there.

31
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,211
On top of that, rather than cash,

32
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,381
he offered to deduct the amount for
the clothes I got from my salary.

33
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,751
That's why you didn't have much of
a salary to bring home last month.

34
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:42,321
That's right! Isn't it horrible?!

35
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,791
- Was I tricked, you think?!
- You did it to yourself!

36
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,261
What about you? Do you have
enough money to get by, Nana?

37
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:50,351
You don't have a full-time job,
just temporary stuff from time to time.

38
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:53,791
Unlike you,
I don't waste my money.

39
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:56,131
- Thank goodness.
- Don't rely on someone else's money!

40
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,691
I have no intention of doing so.

41
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,291
Then what did you mean?

42
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,871
You see, if we both didn't have money,
that leads to anxiety, don't you think?

43
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:04,201
You are relying on my money!
Don't count on it!

44
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:08,211
We agreed to split the rent
for this place, exactly half-half.

45
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,621
If you can't make arrangements
for funds by the end of the month,

46
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:12,021
I'm kicking you out.

47
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:14,781
- You devil!
- Huh?!

48
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,451
It wouldn't bother you if I lay
in the streets dying, would it, Nana?!

49
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,881
Dying once may do you good!

50
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,051
Please, don't abandon me!

51
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,861
Let go of me!
I'll be late for work.

52
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:23,691
Work?

53
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,701
What kinda work are you doing
at this hour of the night?

54
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:26,961
Is it an S&M club?

55
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,561
What do you care?

56
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,031
Have a good night with
the ghosts.

57
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,531
No way...

58
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,401
No. This is no time to be
afraid of ghosts.

59
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,041
My problem is money.

60
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,811
There's over half a month
until my next payday.

61
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,781
Will I survive on 2,000 yen?

62
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,191
What am I to do?
This is getting scary.

63
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,591
Having no money is scary!

64
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:58,091
I didn't come to Tokyo
to experience this!

65
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,791
Then why did you come?

66
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,901
To make it on my own?

67
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,801
Then solve this on your own.

68
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:10,101
But how?

69
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,571
That's for you to figure out!

70
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,801
But I don't know how
to be a dominatrix!

71
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:14,811
A dominatrix?

72
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:18,211
Talk to Shoji and have him feed you
until the end of the month.

73
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,351
I can't do that.

74
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,021
If I talk to Shoji about this
he'll hate me,

75
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,651
and no longer wanna be
with me, for sure.

76
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,331
Also he's very busy with work
and his studies at university,

77
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:29,761
so I'd only be a nuisance
bothering him at this late hour.

78
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,231
You got that right!

79
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,421
I get it, Nana. So don't cry.

80
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,691
Use this to hold you over
until the end of the month.

81
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,371
Kyosuke!

82
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,301
We cannot afford that!

83
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,881
I'm not giving it to her.
It's just a loan.

84
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:46,751
No way.

85
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:50,511
Give Nana cash, and you're certain
it'll be all gone in a day.

86
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,451
That's a cruel thing to say,
Jun-chan.

87
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,051
- What?
- Rice.

88
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,881
My parents sent me some.
I'll share it with you.

89
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,421
You can feast on this
until the end of the month.

90
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,301
No way! No way! No way!

91
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,431
Hey, what about meat and
vegetable dishes?

92
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,031
It's all right.
Calm down and think.

93
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,771
My next payday is on the 26th.

94
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,281
If I don't buy anything from the store,
I'll receive at least 70,000 yen.

95
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:27,051
But I'll be debited for my cell phone,

96
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,021
so I should deposit 10,000
in my bank account.

97
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,021
That leaves me with 60,000.

98
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,431
I only need to pay half the rent
and utility bills,

99
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,981
so 60,000 should be
more than enough.

100
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,261
Hey, not a problem.

101
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,961
But I'll only have a little left over.

102
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,561
And I'll hafta survive another
full month with that little amount.

103
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,531
Now I've gone past being scared.
I'm beginning to feel depressed.

104
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:50,141
Nana-chan.

105
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,641
You can go on your lunch break.

106
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,471
Oh, it's okay. I'll be skipping
my lunches for a while.

107
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:56,981
Huh? Why's that?

108
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,321
Well...

109
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,841
I've decided to go on a diet.

110
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,591
So that's why you're looking
under the weather today.

111
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,191
Brighten up, Hachi.
But that's unfortunate.

112
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,191
It wouldn't be proper to invite you
out at such a time.

113
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:15,091
I wanted to take you to dinner.

114
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,331
Yay! Food!

115
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:26,881
All right. We'll close early today.

116
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,101
Think about what you wanna eat.

117
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:30,341
Darn it.

118
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:32,891
But it's okay, I guess.

119
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,721
There's no big deal about
having a meal together.

120
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,151
After all, it's not as if
Mr. Mizukoshi has the hots for me.

121
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,621
So this doesn't qualify
as cheating on my boyfriend.

122
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,131
I was waiting for you
that whole time.

123
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,431
I'm really sorry about that.

124
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:51,041
So, how about next Sunday?

125
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,531
I think I can make it.

126
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,571
That's great!

127
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,301
Oh, right.
About yesterday...

128
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,701
Huh? What?

129
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,141
What are you saying?! That's crazy!

130
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,841
But it's the truth!

131
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,921
I really think you should pick
your friends more carefully.

132
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,321
But like I said,
she's usually a really good girl.

133
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,651
I don't believe that.

134
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:12,681
Ow!

135
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:14,821
Yo!

136
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,631
I get it.

137
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,431
Well, I was just as surprised.

138
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:27,671
You have the same employer,
go to the same university,

139
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:29,161
and enroll at the same faculty.

140
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,611
Guess you pretty well
hafta get along.

141
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,081
Yes, but Sachiko was accepted
on her first try,

142
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,271
so she's two years younger.

143
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:36,071
Sachiko?

144
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,681
I can't help it. She asked me
to call her that.

145
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,081
There was no reason to refuse.

146
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:45,421
She's clearly your type.
Petite and fair-skinned.

147
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:46,711
You can't help it.

148
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,221
But I'm telling you,
it's not like that!

149
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,491
I'm proud that you're holding back.

150
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,431
She's back.

151
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,691
Here, Shoji. Is coffee okay?

152
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:59,001
Yeah. Thanks.

153
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,371
Mr. Kyosuke,
which would you prefer?

154
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,471
Just call me Kyosuke, Sa-chan.

155
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,471
That's gonna be trouble.

156
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,511
Huh?

157
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:19,481
Well, I'm more for the dark-skinned
big girls like you, but...

158
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:20,391
Huh?!

159
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,121
Well, excuse me for
my dark skin.

160
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,991
But even I find her cute.

161
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,121
This is definitely bad.

162
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,821
So cool!

163
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,251
Shin, I didn't notice you there.

164
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,461
Awesome.

165
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,121
I never knew you could play
the drums too, Nana.

166
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,351
I can't.

167
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,651
But you were!

168
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,591
This is all I know.

169
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,491
But you're good.
When did you learn?

170
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,771
Back home while I was in a band,
I learned it for fun.

171
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,561
From Yasu?

172
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:41,271
Why do you know about Yasu?

173
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,671
Because when Nobu gets drunk
he always talks about Yasu.

174
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,241
Last night too, he kept saying
how he wished that Yasu was here.

175
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,841
You stayed over at Nobu's place again?

176
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:52,481
Those are Nobu's clothes,
aren't they?

177
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,711
Nobu's at work right now,
and said he may be a bit late.

178
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,951
Shin, you should return home
once in a while.

179
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,581
I'll bet your parents are worried.

180
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,391
They're not.

181
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,031
Really? Then it's fine, I guess.

182
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,401
You're unusual, Nana.

183
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,011
Usually, everyone says,

184
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,911
"You're mistaken.
Of course they're worried."

185
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:24,251
But it's a fact that there are parents
who abandon their children.

186
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,321
A junior high student?

187
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:34,491
That guy who came by the store
about the bassist ad, right?

188
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,451
Didn't he say he was eighteen?

189
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,321
Actually he's fifteen.

190
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,001
Nana cornered him with
a few questions, and he confessed.

191
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,771
He told us he thought they wouldn't
take him seriously

192
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,531
if he said he was
a junior high student.

193
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:47,241
Oh, but it's April,
so maybe he's in tenth grade now.

194
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:49,131
Although he doesn't seem to
be going to high school.

195
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:51,671
Oh? Maybe he didn't bother
taking the entrance exams.

196
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:54,711
Hmm... I really don't know.

197
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,251
He doesn't go into detail
about such things.

198
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,451
There seems to be more to it
under the surface.

199
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,481
Mhm.

200
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:05,691
Anyway, he doesn't go home much,
so I'm somewhat concerned.

201
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,291
I'm sure his parents
are totally worried.

202
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,291
I guess so.

203
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,901
And we still haven't found
a drummer.

204
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,031
It's like our luck's running out.

205
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,571
But didn't you say there was
a guy who tried out?

206
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,301
Nana turned him down,
saying she didn't like him.

207
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,241
Although the others said
he was pretty good.

208
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:28,271
Really. She must have high standards.

209
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:32,181
Or rather,
I think she's in love with Yasu

210
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,351
and therefore refuses to accept
a different drummer.

211
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,681
Who is Yasu?

212
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,851
He was her band's leader back
in her hometown.

213
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,751
He's a skinhead,
and he and Nana look so great together.

214
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,761
I can just imagine.

215
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,361
Hey, Mr. Mizukoshi, is it okay
if I order the meat and potato dish, too?

216
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,461
Go ahead.

217
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,601
I'm so full!

218
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,101
Happiness!

219
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:57,501
That's great. But was the tavern
really okay with you?

220
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,741
Yup! I love taverns.

221
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,171
Thank you for the meal.

222
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,141
Nana!

223
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:06,581
Are you all right?

224
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:09,411
I think I might've had
a little too much to drink.

225
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:10,751
How embarrassing.

226
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:18,191
Oops!

227
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,171
Well, I should be going now.

228
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,131
Wait, Nana!

229
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,671
To be honest,
I asked you out today

230
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,471
because I wanted to talk to you
about something important.

231
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,811
Huh? Wait a minute.

232
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,881
I've been waiting for the right time,

233
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:38,841
but I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

234
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,491
This could come as a surprise to you.

235
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,191
This is too sudden.

236
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:50,251
I'm well aware what I'm about
to say will trouble you, Nana.

237
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,791
I'm not ready for this.

238
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:55,261
Mr. Mizukoshi...

239
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,901
You see... I...

240
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:12,181
I've been waiting for
the right time,

241
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,081
but I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

242
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:18,081
This could come as
a surprise to you.

243
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,681
This is too sudden.

244
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:24,991
I'm well aware what I'm about
to say will trouble you, Nana.

245
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,561
I'm not ready for this.

246
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,091
Mr. Mizukoshi...

247
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,631
You see, I plan on closing shop.

248
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:41,181
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,151
Business isn't going well.

250
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,581
This is real trouble!

251
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,161
Oh! My shoe!

252
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:07,631
Shoji!

253
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,231
Huh?!

254
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,671
Sorry, Shoji. Go on ahead.
You'll miss the last train!

255
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,441
Hey!

256
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:40,041
You knew you would hafta run
for the last train.

257
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,271
So why did you hafta wear
those shoes?

258
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:57,821
I did it on purpose.

259
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,631
Nana

260
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:17,401
Hello?

261
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:19,971
Shoji!

262
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,741
Help me!

263
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,291
This is for the taxi.

264
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,531
Never mind.
It's on my way home, anyway.

265
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,771
But It was my fault
we missed the last train.

266
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,201
It really is okay.

267
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,451
Shoji, that call earlier.

268
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,741
It was from your girlfriend, right?

269
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:04,751
It's my policy not to accept such money
from a guy who has a girlfriend.

270
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,191
Good night.

271
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:38,311
It appears that this is
all the money I have right now.

272
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:42,991
Why? You're always working
so hard.

273
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,061
You really are spending it all
on Sachiko!

274
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,801
You're wrong!
In fact, I bought that!

275
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,571
A computer. And it's a Mac.

276
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:57,571
Nice, isn't it? I'm studying
computer graphic design, after all.

277
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,131
I wonder if we can get
a good price for it.

278
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,141
Cut it out!

279
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:03,071
But how else am I gonna get
proper food from tomorrow!

280
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,111
All right!

281
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:05,401
I'll share this with you.

282
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:07,341
Pickled plums my grandma
made herself.

283
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,181
Shoji, you idiot!

284
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,351
You're of no use!

285
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:19,031
So, now that I was unemployed,
I was lost,

286
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:23,561
seriously contemplating the possibility
of starving to death in the streets.

287
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,831
300,000 yen?!

288
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,441
That's right!

289
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,771
Mr. Mizukoshi deposited
300,000 yen for severance pay!

290
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,841
Are you sure you that's not 30,000?

291
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,741
Your remaining salary would've
amounted to around that much.

292
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:40,011
Then do you think this 300,000 yen
is to sever his relationship with me?

293
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,041
Did you sleep with Mizukoshi?

294
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,951
- No way!
- You're lying!

295
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:46,121
Why would he give you
that much if you didn't?!

296
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,491
It's not a lie!

297
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,591
Mr. Mizukoshi is returning
to his hometown

298
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:50,691
and will be getting married.

299
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,061
I feel that I've been deceived.

300
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,491
- You idiot.
- Huh?

301
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:57,931
The one who deposited
the 300,000 yen wasn't Mizukoshi.

302
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,771
Take a closer look.

303
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,471
Natsuko Komatsu.
That's my mom!

304
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,481
You're a long way from independence

305
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,241
if you're crying to your parents
for money.

306
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:11,011
Huh? But I didn't tell
I was having money problems!

307
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:14,011
I thought, if I told them
they would make me go back home.

308
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,151
How did she know?

309
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,861
Could it be maternal instinct?

310
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:29,461
Oh, right.

311
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:33,431
Hey, Nana. Now I've got all this money,
let's celebrate with sukiyaki tonight.

312
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,001
Huh?

313
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,271
Back home, my mom would
make sukiyaki

314
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,711
when we had something
to celebrate.

315
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,711
Let's go back to the supermarket
to buy what we need.

316
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:40,711
You...

317
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,001
You're unemployed!
What is there to celebrate about?!

318
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,671
The fact that I got money...

319
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:45,481
Don't celebrate!

320
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,041
Be remorseful for the money
you've wasted!

321
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:50,121
We're having natto soybeans
tonight as planned.

322
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,211
You're not eating any meat
until you find a job.

323
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:54,991
No way!

324
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:04,701
Say, shouldn't you call Natsuko
and thank her?

325
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,261
I'll do it later.

326
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,741
Oh, I see. If you call now,
you'd be embarrassed

327
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,511
because you'll cry the moment
you hear mommy's voice.

328
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,281
Well, sure.

329
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,341
You get homesick too, sometimes,
don't you Nana?

330
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:20,411
No. Since I don't have a home.

331
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,391
There you go, trying to be cool again.

332
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,681
Tonight calls for sukiyaki, after all!

333
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:12,791
Yasu, Blast is the band you started.

334
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,901
Yeah. I was so worried
I couldn't sleep at night.

335
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:22,741
Besides, there are law firms
in Tokyo too.

336
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:47,201
Hey, Nana...

337
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,211
Do you still think that
you don't have a home anywhere?

338
00:20:56,851 --> 00:21:00,151
This dinner table by the window,
and the chairs.

339
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,351
They're still there,
just as they were back then.

340
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:12,851
I reached into the sky

341
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:19,371
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

342
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:24,741
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

343
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:30,741
Like colorful balloons

344
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,851
I'm alone

345
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:36,581
My hand had no place to go

346
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:43,221
And gently you took it

347
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,401
Starless night

348
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:48,591
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:54,401
I want to feel your warmth

350
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:56,271
Tears are falling down

351
00:21:56,271 --> 00:22:00,411
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

352
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:06,871
Of your hand holding mine
