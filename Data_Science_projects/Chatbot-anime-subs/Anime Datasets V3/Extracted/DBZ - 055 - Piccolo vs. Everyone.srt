00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,796
This 50-times gravity
is as tough as you'd expect.

2
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,539
<i>Yamucha and the others</i>
<i>must be going at it.</i>

3
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,871
<i>l wonder if it's the same</i>
<i>training that I did.</i>

4
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:55,502
<i>No, I can't afford to be doing that.</i>

5
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,522
Damn...

6
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,724
Mock me, will you?

7
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,487
O- one more time!

8
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,374
And he was so close, too?

9
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:31,516
M- my body is so heavy...

10
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,519
You almost had him, huh?

11
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,714
All right, now me.

12
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,193
Here goes!

13
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,863
Ten-<i>san</i>, good luck!

14
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:48,355
Don't rush, now. Take your time.

15
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,205
What?

16
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,606
I have no intention of doing
the same training as those guys.

17
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,815
Teach me your techniques now.

18
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:10,155
I can't do that. There is an order
to these things, you know... huh?

19
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:17,162
Anyhow, when you try to jump straight
to the end, things are apt to turn out badly.

20
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:21,155
By the way, if you're not doing anything,
would you like to pull weeds with me?

21
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:37,144
Why are you in such
a hurry to grow stronger?

22
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:44,352
You promised me that you had given up
on defeating Freeza, didn't you?

23
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:50,862
For shame. Liars have to swallow
a thousand needles, you know.

24
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:56,868
For that matter, you should be enjoying
your life here in the Next World more.

25
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,871
This can be quite fun to do.

26
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,208
Hmph! You're just playing the fool.

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,699
Huh? Are you leaving?

28
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,151
D- damn...

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,315
Hey! Let's eat!

30
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:35,507
Son Goku was something else,
but you guys eat a lot too, huh?

31
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,175
We can't be outdone by Goku!

32
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,837
If he ate 10 bowls,
then I'll eat 20!

33
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,516
Hey, come on now! If you don't stop now,
you'll eat my portion, too...

34
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,850
Besides,

35
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,852
it's pretty good.

36
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,155
Oh, it is, it is, huh?

37
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:54,192
I know I may not look it, but when I was
a youngster, I went to this cooking class,

38
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:59,197
and I was so good the teacher there told me
I would make a good husband someday,

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,535
so I'm somewhat confident of my
ability to- huh? Hey, you guys!

40
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,766
Ah, all full, all full...

41
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:13,274
Good grief. The dead these days
have no sense of moderation.

42
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,428
Okay, now that my belly
is full, I'll be fine.

43
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,995
I'll catch you this time for sure.

44
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:43,268
You won't be able to
do that to me any longer.

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,134
Got you!

46
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,431
He did it!

47
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,370
I did it!

48
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:23,042
I'm surprised you can
get by on just water.

49
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:38,830
I did it!

50
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,498
You did it, Tenshinhan!

51
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,363
Ten-<i>san</i>, incredible!

52
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,103
Those guys are something else.

53
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:48,606
Once they've gotten a handle on
this, they'll make rapid progress.

54
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,842
Don't you think so?

55
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,003
I have no interest in those small fry.

56
00:05:54,846 --> 00:06:00,648
I will not allow the existence of anyone
stronger than me. That's all there is to it.

57
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,245
I did it! I did it!

58
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,223
I caught him! Look!

59
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:15,323
Oh? Oh, my! Even Chaozu
has mastered this, has he?

60
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:23,474
I see. All right, I'll give you
your next training lesson.

61
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,965
Hey, Gregory!

62
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:43,453
Hi! Hello, everybody!
I am Gregory!

63
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,499
This guy is your next opponent.

64
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:51,603
Please knock me down as hard
as you can with this hammer.

65
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,504
You don't need to hold back.

66
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,173
However...

67
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,843
That assumes that you can
keep up with my speed.

68
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,277
All right, I'll do it.

69
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,010
Here.

70
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,453
W- what's with this weight!?

71
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:11,650
Ready? Here we go!

72
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,126
B- bring it on!

73
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,115
Okay...

74
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,133
Too slow, too slow!

75
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,135
D- damn!

76
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,803
Yamucha, hang in there!

77
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,033
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, fight!

78
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:34,479
Hey, Piccolo, aren't you
going to do this?

79
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,143
It's a waste of time.
I'll train by myself.

80
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:41,846
Piccolo...

81
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,063
Chaozu...

82
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,114
What's the matter?
Are you giving up already?

83
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,450
D- dammit!

84
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,046
Hey! We're going to take a nap now!

85
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:24,128
Piccolo is sleeping comfortably out back.
Don't push yourselves too hard.

86
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,861
I- I'm not about to be lumped in
with that guy! I'm up next!

87
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,136
My, my...

88
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,661
Oh, dear...

89
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,809
<i>There's someone even</i>
<i>stronger than that Saiyan.</i>

90
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,169
How is he?

91
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,507
His condition is fairly serious.
His life signs are extremely faint.

92
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,845
Even if he does pull through, I'm not sure
whether or not he will regain consciousness.

93
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,947
Make sure he recovers,
no matter what it takes!

94
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,849
Use whatever methods
you have to, understand!?

95
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,851
Y- yes, sir.

96
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,685
<i>Otherwise, it will mean</i> my <i>life.</i>

97
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,512
All right...

98
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:24,515
Hey, hey! You can do it,
you can do it!

99
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:28,853
Chaozu, go easy on him! Easy!

100
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:33,858
--Okay, this is it, the bottom
of the 9th, 2 outs, bases loaded!
--All right, Chaozu, go!

101
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:38,196
--The count is 3-2. If he runs away,
the walk scores a run, and it's goodbye!
--Knock it out of here!

102
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:42,860
M- me, run away!? You're
trying to make a fool of me!

103
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:49,874
V- very well, I'll show you!
It's not going to be that easy!

104
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:52,543
Any time you're ready.

105
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,206
W- why, you!
Hit this one, if you can!

106
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,878
<i>Not so fast! Forkball!</i>

107
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,559
" Crack!"

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,668
W- w- what was that!?

109
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:22,173
When you go <i>out</i>, call <i>out</i> to someone first,
and lock everyone else <i>out</i>!

110
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:27,178
That was a come-from-behind,
bases-loaded, say-goodbye home run.

111
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:30,514
Oh my, Gregory, what are you doing?

112
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,850
With Chaozu's hit just now,
we've all cleared him.

113
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,518
That's right.

114
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:38,522
What's that? Is this true, Gregory?

115
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:43,721
T- these guys didn't hold back at all.

116
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,463
Wow, that was fast, huh?

117
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:54,872
Oh, my, just over an hour? Are you
sure you're not going too fast?

118
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,898
Okay, Kaio-<i>sama</i>, please
give us our next training.

119
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,713
Next, we will spar.

120
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:05,383
Nothing is better than
sparring to learn each other's

121
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,818
strengths and weaknesses, after all.

122
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,154
As a matter of fact,
we've been waiting for this.

123
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,489
Ready to go at it?

124
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:15,493
Oh, hold on, hold on,
I'll determine the match-ups.

125
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,163
Let's see, who should I put you with?

126
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:20,790
I'll do this!

127
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:28,172
Oh ho, you've woken up, have you?
All right then, Piccolo and-

128
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,174
--All the rest of them.
--Wha-?

129
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:31,008
What!?

130
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,678
You think I can fight
decently against someone

131
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,513
who had trouble with
a monkey, or some batter?

132
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:39,183
At your level, even if there were
ten of you, you'd still be a pushover.

133
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,186
You bastard, now you've said it!

134
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:48,318
My, my, what a humorless conversation
this is. Did you come here to fight?

135
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,863
Well, there is some truth
to what Piccolo says.

136
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,864
Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

137
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:59,203
To be honest, at your current ability,
a one-on-one fight would be absurd.

138
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,205
But with all three of you, perhaps-

139
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:03,207
Don't be ridiculous!

140
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,937
They don't even have a 1
in 10,000 chance of winning.

141
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,815
What's the matter?
You want to go at it?

142
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:11,873
All right!

143
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:22,159
<i>Watch this. l'll put you</i>
<i>away in five seconds.</i>

144
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,889
Ready? Begin!

145
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,178
What!?

146
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:42,304
What the-!?

147
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:53,190
They're surprisingly tough, aren't they?

148
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,860
Whooee! That smarts!

149
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,259
W- why, you!

150
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,403
W- why, you!

151
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,471
Chaozu!

152
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,155
Are you okay, Chaozu!?

153
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,824
Hey, don't panic.

154
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:31,495
--You guys are already dead. You don't
need to worry yourself pointlessly.
--But...

155
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,898
The pain of the body is just a remnant
of when you were alive. It will soon be gone.

156
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,135
3... 2... 1... there.

157
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,852
Huh?

158
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,183
See?

159
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,693
<i>How? Up until a little while ago,</i>
<i>their movements were so slow,</i>

160
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,462
<i>and suddenly,</i>
<i>l barely recognize them.</i>

161
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:07,131
<i>ls this because of Kaio's</i>
<i>training? lt couldn't be...</i>

162
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,031
Resume sparring!

163
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,327
Piccolo...

164
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:46,837
Take off your weights.

165
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:49,965
Yeah, and then we'll fight you again.

166
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:58,849
That same trick isn't
going to work anymore.

167
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,851
All right!

168
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:04,121
Okay, that's enough.

169
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:09,320
That's all for sparring. We're moving on
to the next training. Everyone come with me.

170
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:26,636
Oh, right...

171
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:32,149
A vegetable you eat in the morning ("<i>asa</i>" )
that makes you fart is called <i>asa</i>-para-gas...

172
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,312
<i>...asa</i>paragas... <i>asa</i>paragas!

173
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,822
That was a great one!

174
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:41,154
R- right...

175
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:11,789
There's quite a bit of damage
here. There may be no hope.

176
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,459
I'm counting on you. If you
don't regain consciousness,

177
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,797
<i>l'm</i> the one who Freeza-<i>sama</i>
is going to take it out on, after all.

178
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:22,132
Then again, even if you do
come back to life here,

179
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:26,432
you'll be on your way to hell again
by Freeza-<i>sama</i>'s hand soon enough anyhow.

180
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,473
That should do it.

181
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:33,143
Well, all there is to do now
is wait for you to wake up.

182
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:35,813
Don't give us any more trouble, okay?

183
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:38,509
Vegeta-<i>chan</i>?

184
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,497
How is Vegeta?

185
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,834
He should regain
consciousness shortly.

186
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:59,169
That is good, huh?

187
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,160
Y- yes, sir.

188
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:07,444
W- what was that explosion just now!?

189
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,911
It cannot be!

190
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:21,185
Looks like you've underestimated
my powers of recovery, huh?

191
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,154
Now, then...

192
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:32,803
Dammit, it's coming from
the treatment chamber, all right!

193
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,566
Zarbon-<i>san</i>, hurry!

194
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:43,547
Oh, no! He escaped outside!

195
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:44,815
He did what!?

196
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,818
<i>Terrific, Freeza is with him!</i>

197
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,487
Hurry! Hurry and go after him!

198
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,216
Why, you!

199
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:58,056
Hurry! You must find him at all costs!
He could not have gotten far yet!

200
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,322
<i>Fools! You fell for it all too easily.</i>

201
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,850
<i>Dear Freeza-sama,</i>

202
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,188
<i>Allow me to take this current opportunity</i>
<i>to inform you that your era is at an end.</i>

203
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:27,555
-<i>Your loving Vegeta</i>

204
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,531
I have won!

205
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:39,203
<i>Vegeta, the miracle man who</i>
<i>returned from the brink of death...</i>

206
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:44,732
<i>Will he be able to outwit Freeza</i>
<i>and collect the Dragon Balls?</i>

207
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:55,732
