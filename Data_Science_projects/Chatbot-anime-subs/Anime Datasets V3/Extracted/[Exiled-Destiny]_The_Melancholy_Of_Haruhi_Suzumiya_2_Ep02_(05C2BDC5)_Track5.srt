00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:09,397
They need him to do his best,
don't they, Mr. Kiru?

2
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:11,027
They need him to do his best,
don't they, Mr. Kiru?
It was a lazy, but normal day after
Obon at the height of summer.

3
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:15,297
That's true. You never know
how a match is going to turn out.
It was a lazy, but normal day after
Obon at the height of summer.

4
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:17,067
Next, stepping up to the batter's
box we have number four,

5
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,167
Next, stepping up to the batter's
box we have number four,
I had absolutely no interest in
the prefectural game on the TV,

6
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,637
Kashima, a senior. After last year's
summer tournament,
I had absolutely no interest in
the prefectural game on the TV,

7
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:22,037
he was chosen to be part of
the team that went to Cuba.
I had absolutely no interest in
the prefectural game on the TV,

8
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:23,937
he was chosen to be part of
the team that went to Cuba.
But because of my
sympathetic personality,

9
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:23,977
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

10
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,977
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.
I ended up kind of rooting for
the losing side.

11
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:27,277
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

12
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:28,277
Once I did, my cell phone
began ringing.

13
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,677
And there's Suzuki with
a big windup...
Once I did, my cell phone
began ringing.

14
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:31,987
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

15
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:32,487
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

16
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,017
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya
Haruhi, huh?

17
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:33,687
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
Haruhi, huh?

18
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:34,587
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

19
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:35,557
That was a good pitch.
You're not doing
anything today, right?

20
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:36,117
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
You're not doing
anything today, right?

21
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:38,887
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

22
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:39,157
Perhaps he feels like he's
got nothing left to lose.
We're all meeting at exactly
two o'clock in front of the station.

23
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,857
Perhaps he feels like he's
got nothing left to lose.

24
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:44,157
Perhaps he feels like he's
got nothing left to lose.
And just like that,
she hangs up.

25
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:44,257
Perhaps he feels like he's
got nothing left to lose.
How does she know I'm not
doing anything today?

26
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:46,797
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
How does she know I'm not
doing anything today?

27
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,267
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...
I mean, I'm...

28
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:50,337
Well, okay, I don't have
any plans at all, but...

29
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:51,667
It's a hit!
Well, okay, I don't have
any plans at all, but...

30
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,407
Well, okay, I don't have
any plans at all, but...

31
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:57,967
It's a big one! Kashima's sent it
headed for left field. It's in!

32
00:00:58,647 --> 00:00:59,177
What?

33
00:00:59,177 --> 00:00:59,447
It's a solo home run!
What?

34
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:00,477
It's a solo home run!
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and come on your bike.

35
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,347
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and come on your bike.

36
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,987
And be sure to bring plenty of money.
That's all, over and out!

37
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:06,917
This gives them
yet another point.
And be sure to bring plenty of money.
That's all, over and out!

38
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:07,517
This gives them
yet another point.

39
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,087
Ugh, no.

40
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:08,687
And with this, Jyonan's
gotten their eighth run!
Ugh, no.

41
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:09,787
And with this, Jyonan's
gotten their eighth run!

42
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,687
And with this, Jyonan's
gotten their eighth run!
What in the world
is going on?

43
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:12,327
And with this, Jyonan's
gotten their eighth run!

44
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,357
Kashima is slowly rounding
third base.

45
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,457
Suzuki is on the mound,
looking dejected.

46
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,927
It's a hard thing
to watch.

47
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,367
It's so sad...

48
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,737
it looks like the last of his
will to fight has crumbled.

49
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:25,237
It looks like the last of his
will to fight has crumbled.
Oh well.

50
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:26,307
The team's supporters seem to have
lost their voices as well.
Oh well.

51
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,977
The team's supporters seem to have
lost their voices as well.

52
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:30,807
There aren't even any jeers
for Suzuki.

53
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,947
And with this, the score
is now 8 to 0.

54
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:36,007
The Kumamoto team has their
work cut out for them now.

55
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:52,327
DAY BY DAY unzari dayone dakara
Day by day, everything's just so dull

75
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,277
You're late, Kyon!

76
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,287
Show some more motivation!

77
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,587
Who do you think you are,
making the brigade leader wait?

78
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:24,387
There'll be a penalty
for this.

79
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:29,757
I came fifteen minutes early,
and I'm still the last one to arrive?

80
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:33,887
Okay, we're all here,
so let's go.

81
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:37,467
Koizumi, let Mikuru ride
on your bike.

82
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,607
Yuki and I will ride on
the back of Kyon's bike.

83
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,307
Well, let me ask,
where are we going?

84
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:48,217
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

85
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:52,417
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

86
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:56,087
We can never get back
the time that we've lost!

87
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,527
And so we're going to do
them now, during this,

88
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:01,187
our one and only summer
as tenth graders.

89
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:03,817
The time that we've lost, eh?

90
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:18,397
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

91
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,007
Here I go!

92
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,247
Here we go!

93
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,577
No diving
It's dangerous

94
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:32,727
Hurry up and get in!
The water's warm so it feels fine!

95
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:37,057
Can't she read the "no diving" signs
posted everywhere?

96
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,497
This makes me smile, though.

97
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,197
Miss Suzumiya has some
rather normal ways

98
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,367
of enjoying her time,
don't you think?

99
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,237
Suddenly calling us up
out of the blue,

100
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:50,537
and only giving us a general idea
of what's going to happen...

101
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,237
That's not all that
normal to me.

102
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:57,147
Well, at least Miss Suzumiya,
laughing and having a good time,

103
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,517
isn't likely to shake up
the world.

104
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,877
I hope that's the case...

105
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,087
There's no need
to worry.

106
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,887
We haven't noticed any problems
since the outing a while back.

107
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:13,727
Right now, to Miss Suzumiya,
and to us as well,

108
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,067
the world is at peace.

109
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:24,007
Let's have lunch.

110
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,447
Surprise! Today Mikuru
made us sandwiches!

111
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,707
Wow!

112
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,747
This is delicious.

113
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,317
Thank you very much.

114
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:34,217
I'm having more
fried chicken!

115
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:35,887
Mikuru, get the tea,
would you?

116
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,317
Okay!

117
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:40,087
Things certainly do seem
to be peaceful.

118
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,897
Sorry!

119
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,457
Okay, here I go!

120
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:44,127
Okay, here I go!
I think it'd be better to call this a
communal pool than a public pool.

121
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:48,427
I think it'd be better to call this a
communal pool than a public pool.

122
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,567
Come on, Mikuru,
what are you doing?

123
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:59,277
This isn't a bad way to spend
my summer vacation.

124
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:02,907
Kyon!

125
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,687
These are my
brigade members.

126
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,787
They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!

127
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,977
Okay!

128
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,197
I've been thinking about how we should
spend our summer vacation.

129
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:17,927
What do you think?

130
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:18,327
Club schedule: Summer outing,
bug catching, pool, test of courage...

131
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,667
Club schedule: Summer outing,
bug catching, pool, test of courage...
What is this?

132
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,097
What is this?

133
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:24,137
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

134
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:25,667
For the SOS Brigade?

135
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,607
Yup. There're only two weeks of
summer vacation left, right?

136
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,807
And yet it feels like there are
a lot of things we've yet to do!

137
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,797
We're going to pick up
the pace!

138
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:39,187
Things that we have to do during
the summer vacation, you say?

139
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,887
Summer outing,
go to the pool,

140
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,817
go to a Bon festival,
go to a fireworks show,

141
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:47,087
have a part-time job, stargazing...
There's a lot here, isn't there?

142
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:51,187
So we have to do all of this
in just two weeks?

143
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,027
Is there anything else
you want to do?

144
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:57,367
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

145
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,127
Okay! Goldfish scooping...

146
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,807
We start the plan tomorrow!

147
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:06,247
Is there a place nearby
having a Bon festival?

148
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,517
A fireworks show
would work, too.

149
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:11,117
At least try to find
this stuff out first.

150
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:14,447
I'll check around. I'll contact
you when I find out.

151
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:19,187
Don't forget about the goldfish scooping!
It's Mikuru's sole request, after all.

152
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:20,417
Right.

153
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:26,557
Why am I always the one that
has to pick up the check?

154
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,897
Isn't it obvious?
It's because you were late.

155
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,997
Don't make us wait tomorrow!

156
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,837
All right, then,
we're done for today!

157
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:39,237
Good grief. So we're going to
be playing around every day?

158
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,817
The next morning,
it was a call from Haruhi

159
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,477
that awoke me
from my slumber.

160
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,797
They found a place that was
holding a Bon festival.

161
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:58,917
Time: Tonight.
Place: A public park.

162
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:02,367
Convenient how they found one
so quickly.

163
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,307
Just as I was being impressed
by that, Haruhi said,

164
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,937
"We're all going to go
buy yukata!"

165
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:11,407
Both Mikuru and Yuki said
that they don't own one.

166
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,307
There's a place selling them
in sets for cheap, so let's go!

167
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,117
Haruhi just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

168
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,107
then headed straight for
the changing rooms.

169
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,877
This ended up taking
quite a bit of time.

170
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:28,927
We waited for about an hour,
while the other women ignored us,

171
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,417
and finally the three of
them came out at once.

172
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:32,897
Kyon!

173
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,967
You all look wonderful.

174
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,637
Of course! I chose these yukata,
after all.

175
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,067
Especially Mikuru.

176
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:45,807
Just what you would expect from
my choice, it's so cute on you!

177
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,507
There's nothing wrong
with my fashion sense!

178
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,787
This certainly was the
cream of the crop

179
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:54,047
Yuki is pretty too, don't you think?
This certainly was the
cream of the crop

180
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:55,557
Yuki is pretty too, don't you think?
Of all of the costumes that
Haruhi has forced on her.

181
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:56,157
Of all of the costumes that
Haruhi has forced on her.

182
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:57,587
Rather, it really looks great
on her!

183
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,457
This is a definite yes!

184
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,227
So this is the kind
of clothing

185
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,427
that the people of this country
wore in historical times.

186
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,897
It's a little tight around the chest,
but it's beautiful.

187
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:07,567
Okay, we're ready
to go now.

188
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,657
Let's go to the festival,
everyone!

189
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,207
Wow!

190
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,667
A Bon festival, huh? It's been
a while since I've been to one.

191
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,517
Mikuru, they even have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

192
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:27,247
Be sure to catch
a bunch!

193
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,357
Black Demekins are worth
200 points, you know!

194
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:34,357
Shall we play, too? How about
seeing who can catch more?

195
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:38,367
I'll pass. I'm more interested
in the food.

196
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,657
What about you, Nagato?
Want to eat something?

197
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,967
You're interested
in that stuff?

198
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,607
This one.

199
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:56,837
Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.

200
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,317
Thirteen!

201
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:06,387
I caught a lot, but I don't need
so many, so I just kept one.

202
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:09,227
I didn't catch
any at all.

203
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:12,067
Scooping goldfish is difficult,
isn't it?

204
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,467
Oh no, it's not normal
to catch so many.

205
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,627
If you can figure out the trick,
it's easy!

206
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:21,167
Huh? What's with
the mask, Yuki?

207
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,107
I bought it.

208
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:24,577
I see.
But why that one?

209
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,617
Maybe it appeals to a
particular wavelength.

210
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,047
One only aliens
would get.

211
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,317
Okay, then.

212
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:35,417
There are things over there we
haven't seen yet, so let's go!

213
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,557
You're still going
to mess around?

214
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:38,957
Of course!
Come on!

215
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,547
Here.

216
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,377
You can have one,
but only one.

217
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:11,477
Oh, thanks.

218
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:14,487
Is it tasty?

219
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,297
Good.

220
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:19,427
Now, we've pretty much seen
all of the Bon festival.

221
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,497
Now let's launch
some fireworks!

222
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,537
Fireworks?

223
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:25,937
We've gone through the trouble
of getting all dressed up,

224
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,137
so let's do that to
finish off the day!

225
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:31,137
Why not? There was a store
over there selling them,

226
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,977
so let's head over
to the riverside.

227
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:34,207
This looks like
it will be fun.

228
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,697
Okay, here we go!

229
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,717
Kakizaki!

230
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:05,967
Oh, they're so beautiful.

231
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:10,617
Bon festival, fireworks...
okay, done.

232
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,047
Okay, tomorrow we'll
be catching bugs!

233
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:15,317
Haruhi, it's fine to
want to play around,

234
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,317
but are you finished with
your summer homework?

235
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:19,987
Not that I've any right to talk,
since I'm nowhere near done.

236
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:24,457
What, you can finish all of that
in just three days.

237
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:25,427
Three days?!

238
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:28,127
I finished it all
in July.

239
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,727
I took care of all of that
bothersome stuff

240
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,097
so I could have fun without
having to worry about it.

241
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,977
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation.

242
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:38,547
Why is she so smart?

243
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,647
It seems like the guys up in heaven
that were divvying up our stats

244
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,117
were being pretty lax
about it.

245
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,677
In any case, we're going to
go bug catching tomorrow!

246
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:47,417
Whoever catches
the most bugs...

247
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,157
That's right. They'll get to be
the brigade leader for a day!

248
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:52,557
Ugh, no thanks.

249
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:55,757
That sounds interesting.
Are any bugs okay?

250
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:59,027
Hmm... Only cicadas!

251
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,697
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

252
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,097
Whoever catches
the most wins!

253
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,907
The next day, I wanted
it to rain so much

254
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,077
that I drove a nail
through a teruteru bouzu.

255
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:17,647
But despite that, it was an incredibly
beautiful and clear day.

256
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,887
It felt like the warmest day
of the summer,

257
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,677
and it seemed like it was making
all of the cicadas happy.

258
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:26,287
I wonder if you
can eat cicadas.

259
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,487
No idea.

260
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,427
They might be delicious if
you fried them in tempura.

261
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:31,057
Fine. Try it out yourself.

262
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:34,527
You know, sometimes, I wonder...
When it comes to tempura,

263
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,267
maybe it's just the outside
that's delicious.

264
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,507
If that's the case, maybe it's
the same with cicadas.

265
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:42,237
Apologize! Apologize to the tempura
restaurants across Japan!

266
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,247
So what's with making
all of us, at our age,

267
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:52,017
walk here carrying bug-catching
nets and cages?

268
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,487
What are you talking about?

269
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,817
If we didn't have
bug-catching nets,

270
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,647
we wouldn't be able to catch
any cicadas, would we?

271
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:59,227
That's not what I'm
talking about.

272
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:00,557
Okay, we're going
to start!

273
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,057
The winner is the brigade
leader for a day!

274
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,097
Ready... start!

275
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:06,497
She's not listening.

276
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,127
Umm...

277
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,337
It looks like she really
wants to win.

278
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,267
I think that's a good thing,
don't you?

279
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,567
Sheesh. I haven't caught cicadas
since I was in elementary school.

280
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:19,837
Same here.
Let's do our best.

281
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,247
Have you already
caught one?

282
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,817
That's not a cicada.

283
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:33,847
Oh.

284
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:37,547
That's a Hercules beetle!

285
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,227
And now, the results!

286
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:16,867
Mikuru caught one.

287
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,297
Yuki caught four.

288
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,907
Koizumi caught seven.

289
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,367
Kyon caught nine.

290
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,177
And the top record is...

291
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,837
We already know.
You don't have to say.

292
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,107
Me, with twelve!

293
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:30,477
I guess I can't give up the brigade
leader position, even for a day.

294
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,247
Sorry, everyone!

295
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,917
Now, you're not actually going to
make these into tempura, are you?

296
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,917
What? Do you want
to eat them?

297
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,327
Why does it come back
to me?

298
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:43,827
I'm kidding. A catch-and-release
attitude is important, right?

299
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:47,357
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

300
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:52,187
There you go! Go back to the mountains!
Don't get caught again!

301
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,407
Hold on a second. That may
be a good deed and all,

302
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,937
but all you did was catch them
and then let them go.

303
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:08,617
The next day...

304
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:13,617
Haruhi found us part-time jobs
somewhere that was glad to have us.

305
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:16,327
Our job was to bring
in customers...

306
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:16,397
Brigade Leader
Our job was to bring
in customers...

307
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:16,627
Brigade Leader

308
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,697
Brigade Leader
Do your best!

309
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:18,297
Do your best!

310
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,457
...for the local supermarket's
anniversary sale.

311
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,437
Thank you...

312
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,267
Here you go.

313
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:31,367
Here.

314
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:38,907
Why do I have to
wear this outfit?

315
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,087
If you want to work
a part-time job,

316
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,417
there are more appropriate ones
for the summer, you know?

317
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:47,087
And to top it all off,
Haruhi is still nice and cool!

318
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:50,427
If we end up getting the same amount
of pay, I'm going to riot!

319
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:55,627
I really understand how a snake
that's shed its skin feels.

320
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:57,967
That's a good analogy.

321
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:02,507
Good work, everyone.
The manager is thankful.

322
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,407
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

323
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,277
This is it.

324
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,277
Huh?

325
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,477
This costume is our pay.

326
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:13,617
I've wanted this
for a while.

327
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:17,587
The owner said that he'd give it to us
for Mikuru's sake.

328
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,627
We'll hang this frog up in
the clubroom as a memento!

329
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:25,357
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

330
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,027
Ribbit.

331
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:32,307
We went to the pool,
to a Bon festival,

332
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,107
caught bugs, and worked
a part-time job.

333
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:37,197
Next up, Haruhi had us scheduled
to go stargazing.

334
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:42,107
Wow, so this is a telescope
from this era.

335
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,917
It doesn't seem that different from
the ones from Kepler's time.

336
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,977
No, I think it's pretty different.

337
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,517
Did you buy this
for tonight?

338
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:53,657
No, this was my hobby
when I was younger.

339
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,987
I was pretty moved when I caught
a glimpse of the moons of Jupiter.

340
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,727
I've spotted Mars.

341
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,237
I wonder if they exist.

342
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:07,567
If who exists?

343
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,907
Martians.

344
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,637
I kind of don't want them to.

345
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:13,047
If there were octopus-like monsters
wriggling around,

346
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,247
planning on conquering
the Earth,

347
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,247
there's just no way I could
say that sounded like "fun".

348
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:21,517
Why not? They might be
a very friendly people.

349
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,627
I'm sure they're a reserved people,
secretly living in underground caverns.

350
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:30,097
I'm sure they're just trying not
to surprise us Earthlings.

351
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:33,617
Exactly how reserved are the
Martians you're imagining?

352
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,797
I've had enough of Mars.
Let's look for UFOs!

353
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:42,737
Their scouting fleets should
be standing by in orbit.

354
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,467
Come on, Mikuru,
help out!

355
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:49,037
U-F-Os, U-F-Os!

356
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:01,257
Our summer vacation continued.
The next thing Haruhi said was:

357
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,627
We're going to a
batting center!

358
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:04,857
Why there?

359
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,827
It came to me this morning while
watching the news from Koshien.

360
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:11,337
We can't be satisfied by a
mere sandlot baseball game.

361
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:15,967
I think that the SOS Brigade needs to
form its own national-level team.

362
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,537
Chuka soba!

363
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:30,417
She sure is something.
Where does she get her energy from?

364
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:35,827
She may have a different amount of
mitochondria packed into her cells.

365
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,727
She should use her gifts for the
sake of the world some more.

366
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,067
All right!

367
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:40,597
Home Run
All right!

368
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:45,257
Home Run

369
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:47,237
After that,

370
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,537
in an attempt to run through the
schedule that she had set for us,

371
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,937
we kept going,
day after day,

372
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:54,437
too fast for anyone to
hit the pause button.

373
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,277
We went to a real
fireworks show.

374
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,817
The fireworks burst into bloom
in the sky, one after another,

375
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,717
leaving us with a grand feeling
in our hearts.

376
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,127
That one was awesome!
Leaving us with a grand feeling
in our hearts.

377
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,527
Goby Fishing Tournament

378
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:07,687
Goby Fishing Tournament
On yet another day, she also
made us take part

379
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,727
On yet another day, she also
made us take part

380
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,657
in a goby fishing tournament
at the prefectural river.

381
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,837
Ah! Mikuru, your fishing pole!

382
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,237
Leave it to me,
I'll get it back.

383
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:27,907
It continued on.

384
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,647
While it's admittedly a staple
of the summer,

385
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:33,207
there probably aren't many people
who do tests of courage.

386
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,417
We went to see a movie that was
hyped so much it was overblown,

387
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,547
but it was just your usual
"summer blockbuster".

388
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,787
We went to the beach when the jellyfish
were closest to the shore.

389
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,237
We went bowling, but we couldn't
leave until we all got a strike,

390
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:55,797
as if were playing some
kind of penalty game.

391
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:00,377
We went to karaoke,
singing for a long time,

392
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,777
as if we were trying to challenge
the limits of our voices.

393
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:11,787
In short, it felt like there were
non-summer things in there as well,

394
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:16,787
but we ended up enjoying ourselves
to the fullest these two weeks.

395
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:26,707
As of today, August 30th, we have
pretty much completed our list.

396
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,967
Good grief,
we're finally done.

397
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,607
I wonder if this was
good enough.

398
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:36,547
But, hmm, well...
I guess this works.

399
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,747
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

400
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,017
Not particularly.

401
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,647
We've done enough,
haven't we?

402
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,947
I'd like to sleep
for a while.

403
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,417
What about you,
Yuki?

404
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:47,387
I see.

405
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:52,357
That's fine, then. We were able
to do a lot this summer.

406
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:56,357
We went all over the place, we wore
yukata, and caught a lot of cicadas.

407
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,497
Yeah, that works.

408
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,697
Is there something that she
would regret not doing?

409
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,477
Okay, we're done
for today.

410
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:10,377
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

411
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:14,717
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

412
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:33,027
Man, I haven't done any
of my homework at all.

413
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:44,547
August 31 st, the last day
of our summer vacation.

414
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:49,087
No matter how hard I tried, there was no way
I'd be able to finish all of my homework.

415
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:53,327
I couldn't recover from all of the
running around we did, either,

416
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:56,057
so in the end I just spent
the day slacking off.

417
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:00,967
What the heck're you
talkin' about?

418
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,397
Boring.

419
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,997
Whatever.
It'll work out.

420
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,687
I guess I'll go to sleep...
School's starting back up, after all...

421
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:32,887
Beep.

422
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:45,677
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

423
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:48,377
Subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

424
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:52,937
Hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

425
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:56,217
Yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

426
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,857
Kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

427
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:03,057
Tashika ni oboeteru tte
ieruno kai?
Can I say that I
remember you clearly?

428
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,597
Tomare!
Stop!

429
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:08,397
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs to me

430
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:12,967
Touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

431
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,307
Nazenara
That's because

432
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:19,547
Basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

433
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:22,307
Deai ga umareta toki ni
We could see the first dream

434
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,747
Hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had
when we were born

435
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:29,617
Doushiyouka tte
nayanda koto mo
Worrying about
"what do I do?"

436
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:33,527
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo
datta yo ne
Is laughable when I
think about it now

437
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:36,227
Mou wasureteta
I've already forgotten it

438
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,317
Kimi wo sagasou
Let's search for you
