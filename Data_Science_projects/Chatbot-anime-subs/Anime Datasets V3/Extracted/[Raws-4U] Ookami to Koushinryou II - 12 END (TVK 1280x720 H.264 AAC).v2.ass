Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.57,0:11:02.59,main,,0000,0000,0000,,And then you made a cunning proposal to the bishop:

Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.78,0:11:24.84,main,,0000,0000,0000,,That being the case,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.84,0:11:29.83,main,,0000,0000,0000,,simple logic leads me to conclude that you were using a plan that you had already put into motion.

Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.44,0:12:40.32,main,,0000,0000,0000,,That's probably the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.32,0:12:45.49,main,,0000,0000,0000,,But you just couldn't let a plan you so carefully constructed go to waste.
