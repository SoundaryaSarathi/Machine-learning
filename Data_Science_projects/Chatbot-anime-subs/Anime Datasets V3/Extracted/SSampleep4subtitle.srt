Which melt in my mouth</font></font>

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,350
Pulse in my heart</font></font>

Sweet and puzzling</font></font>

I Odrsk every day</font></font>

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,680

Oh, you understand, you hide Khgelk, huh?</font></font>

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,270
Such as the kind of love Confect</font></font>

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,190
Which melt in my mouth</font></font>

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,950
Pulse in my heart</font></font>

17
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,780
Sweet and puzzling</font></font>

18
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,580
I am ready to go</font></font>

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,250
Here's my love of</font></font>

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,080

I will give you all the feelings of my heart</font></font>

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,680

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,720
! </font>Accordingly, I hereby declare the establishment of the club commoner</font></font>

26
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,220
. </font>There may be some negligence on our part</font></font>

27
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,470
. </font>Rather, I want you to be activated</font></font>

28
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,890
Huh? </font>For what-Tvdilna about Arzogaoa Rico?</font></font>

29
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,350
. </font>We Amyin use the word "Atsuo" with our friends</font></font>

30
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,480
. </font>Easy to use for this slipped me</font></font>

31
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,770
. </font>It seems that ye are talking together in harmony</font></font>

32
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,150
! </font>My party plan to be the most popular girl in the classroom</font></font>

33
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,030
! </font>I am now quite strong</font></font>

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,470
Episode 4 Incident Tea Party</font></font>

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,050
Tea Party?</font></font>

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,260
right Now ?</font></font>

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,430
... Yes, if you wish</font></font>

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,560
. </font>This is not a very large order</font></font>

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,900
. </font>Just to be together for some time in my room</font></font>

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,270
! </font>Oh no, I did not mean anything when I said in my room</font></font>

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,530
. </font>That's just ... something we do all the time</font></font>

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,820
. Therefore, there is no deep significance in my call</font></font>

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,280
. </font>Yeah, well, I think this is shameful</font></font>

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,620
.. Maybe at other times</font></font>

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,250
. </font>Yes, for this is something we do all the time</font></font>

46
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,550
- But Kemeto-sama, invite you today a special request</font></font>

47
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,170
. </font>M-Please, do not expose her Bala</font></font>

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,840
. </font>Oh Nations</font></font>

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,010
What you said? </font>Do you have any plans after this?</font></font>

50
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,220
. </font>No, nothing specific</font></font>

51
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,930
.. In this case, please</font></font>

52
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,480
. </font>Well, I will accept your offer gentle</font></font>

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
T-tarried What do you think yourself active?</font></font>

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,820
. </font>You have plans, right? </font>With me</font></font>

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,120
Aika-sama Was this not something you should not say for Kemeto-sama?</font></font>

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,290
... A-Llano</font></font>

57
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,670
! </font>vvah</font></font>

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,880
For-our club activities, is not it?</font></font>

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,630
Huh?</font></font>

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,010
Not less huh me Forgot my plan?</font></font>

61
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,970
! </font>No time you have to do a concert tea</font></font>

62
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,560
What do you mean by "doing"?</font></font>

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,770
So what you do, right?</font></font>

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,440
. </font>I do not do this, in addition to that your plans are not very urgent</font></font>

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,690
M-What? </font>I want to go to Arzogaoa Rico room for this class?</font></font>

66
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,030
. </font>For-no, not so</font></font>

67
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,320
! </font>In any case, I'm urgent Let us go from here, we do Boukttti off</font></font>

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,910
. </font>H-Well</font></font>

69
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,250
! </font>Sorry, Arzogaoa-sama I have prior arrangements with Atsuo</font></font>

70
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,620
... festival</font></font>

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,250
I am really sorry</font></font>

72
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,960
. </font>Please do not worry about this</font></font>

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,510
. </font>I hope to accomplish with your business Aika-sama without incident</font></font>

74
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,890
.Thank you</font></font>

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,600
! </font>Wait</font></font>

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,730
Kemeto-sama will not come today, is not it?</font></font>

77
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,190
It is busy, not an opportunity for us in this</font></font>

78
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,190
What made him busy exactly?</font></font>

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,580
. </font>In addition to the only one that seems to open with Kemeto-sama-sama is Laika</font></font>

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,120
. </font>I'm sure that Aika-sama was asking Kemeto-sama tips</font></font>

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,540
Tips ?</font></font>

82
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,250
. </font>Yes, it is desperate because of the circumstances surrounding us</font></font>

83
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,880
. </font>For this reason, it is hoped to help him</font></font>

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,930
. </font>Kimio-sama arrived here since shortly</font></font>

85
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,260
. </font>And he distinguished man</font></font>

86
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,560
. </font>There is no one better than him to ask him Nashah</font></font>

87
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,020
. </font>Certainly</font></font>

88
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,270
.. for-but I think that spend every day with him in the room Kemeto-sama</font></font>

89
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,730
. </font>Not very Malov</font></font>

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,740
. </font>One day, I wish to visit Kemeto-sama Room</font></font>

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
. </font>And arrived at the door</font></font>

92
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,740
... but I heard the voice of that girl enjoy herself so much</font></font>

93
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
. </font>This made me think twice about entering</font></font>

94
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,250
. </font>Most of this recently she was left with him until late</font></font>

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,710
Oh. Are you sure?</font></font>

96
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,290
"Commoner club"</font></font>

97
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,920
. </font>Listen</font></font>

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,340
. </font>I want there to be some food in the common folk concert</font></font>

99
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,460
. </font>Some candy or something</font></font>

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,760
 Well, what about some cheap crackers, such as the "Aumialo"?</font></font>

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,470
Oumialo?</font></font>

102
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,760
It is found in places called shops</font></font>

103
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,600
. </font>Girls buy these sweets and eat in the classroom after school</font></font>

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
! </font>Oh, this sounds good, Flanvolh</font></font>

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,610
Experts concert at the grassroots after school</font></font>

106
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,940
! </font>This will be the name of the party</font></font>

107
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,280
It looks great, huh</font></font>

108
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,320
! </font>I know, it is true that it will be very interesting</font></font>

109
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,290
. </font>I wonder if everyone will be happy with this wish to be happy</font></font>

110
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,580
. </font>Thinking about this, from a recent change in their room</font></font>

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,540
. </font>Show callers together very well</font></font>

112
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,500
-Traiqa pulling his arm, and how they talk - Llano, INSAT does not wish any one of you more tea?</font></font>

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,800
... privacy away from us and the way Kemeto-sama</font></font>

114
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,430
In the hunt Aika-sama, you could be a disturbing relationship between them?</font></font>

115
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,640
.. Could it be and offers advice</font></font>

116
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,100
.Klihama becomes more friendly</font></font>

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,470
And become already Habib and Habiba?</font></font>

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,730
. </font>There is no doubt this day in his room, according to the two are</font></font>

119
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,310
- e-Do you think it is right now ... they're so</font></font>

120
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,110
! </font>that is enough</font></font>

121
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,780
Rico-sama</font></font>

122
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,310
Huh? </font>What speeches?</font></font>

123
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,040
. </font>Arzogaoa-san, I Kajorzaka</font></font>

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,550
. </font>I'm here</font></font>

125
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,920
What happened ?</font></font>

126
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,050
. </font>I can not talk to you in this regard, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

127
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,260
Is this by chance it comes to me?</font></font>

128
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,480
! </font>Nothing like this</font></font>

129
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,190
! </font>Â-sorry</font></font>

130
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,070
. </font>And then screamed at Kai-sama</font></font>

131
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,780
. </font>I left the room without the ability to say any other word</font></font>

132
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,790
. </font>This is the first time I</font></font>

133
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,120
What do I do?</font></font>

134
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,130
.. this is</font></font>

135
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,210
! </font>Important commoner</font></font>

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
. </font>welcome back</font></font>

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,850
you are here ?</font></font>

138
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,470
So how is Arzogaoa Rico?</font></font>

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,430
Huh?</font></font>

140
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,770
I went to her room is not it?</font></font>

141
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,440
How do you know that?</font></font>

142
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,860
! </font>I became curious when I left for this Tbatk</font></font>

143
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,280
. </font>Too late</font></font>

144
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,570
E-this does not really matter, is not it?</font></font>

145
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,110
So how delightful it?</font></font>

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
. </font>It's very frustrating</font></font>

147
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,950
I bet you're thinking of a way to help her, right?</font></font>

148
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,410
How do you know this?</font></font>

149
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,040
. </font>You are the kind of men</font></font>

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,210
So you thought about anything?</font></font>

151
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,170
... Hmmm, well the easiest way would be to apply someone</font></font>

152
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,470
. </font>To calm things down.</font></font>

153
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,390
. </font>But in this case Valammer includes every chapter</font></font>

154
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,720
. </font>According to the case Arzogaoa-san</font></font>

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,770
. </font>I think we need an event or something like that</font></font>

156
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,060
.He different would raise the morale Arzogaoa-san in a way it</font></font>

157
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,650
"To give them the courage to say" in this case, things will succeed</font></font>

158
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,980
! </font>Which makes it related Bama</font></font>

159
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,990
. </font>Something you do not know anyone yet</font></font>

160
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,280
