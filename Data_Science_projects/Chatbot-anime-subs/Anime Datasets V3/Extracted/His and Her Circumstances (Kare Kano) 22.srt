1
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,086
I've been thinking, and well,

4
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:17,489
I thought maybe I could
do the play after all...

5
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:21,568
Really? You'll do it?

6
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:23,027
Yeah, I thought, if I was going
to keep thinking...

7
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,269
...about it and be indecisive,
I might as well do it...

8
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:26,939
Uh-huh! I'm so glad!

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,801
It'll be my debut as an actress.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,201
Yay, it's going to be on stage!

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,418
No! I don't want to be involved in
such an "after school special" thing!

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,951
Maho-san!

15
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,263
Maho, you thought that screenplay
was good too, didn't you?

16
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:00,639
The characters were originally inspired...

17
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,369
...by the three of us,
so each of our roles fits.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,000
No matter what we always say about her,
Aya-chan really observes us well.

20
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:09,012
Ever since I read it,

21
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,183
the Professor's been
inside my head, and talks.

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,685
This must mean that the role is
starting to come alive inside you.

24
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,387
It's wonderful.

25
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,130
I can do a task that is given to me,

27
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:23,894
but I've never created something myself,

28
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,359
...so I'm really excited.

29
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,268
So come on, let's do it.

30
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,239
If you would be there,
I'd feel much braver.

31
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,399
I'm not doing it.

32
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,000
What's your problem?

33
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,242
If I say we do it, then ya betta do it.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,237
That's my stomach...

35
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,812
You're the one who got the
whole class to ignore me!

36
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,520
I act bright and cheerful,

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,253
but I've been afraid of people since then.
Just a little distrust of humanity...

39
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:50,758
No fair!

40
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,654
Once your heart is wounded
it never goes away.

42
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,691
You're lying! Lying! Goddammit!

43
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,861
Maho-san said she'd do it too.
(Text:"She realized that
resistance was futile")

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,492
A play put on by interested students?

46
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:29,194
Yes. Do you know what
we'd need to do?

47
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:30,657
Do you know?

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,392
No...

49
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,330
I hear our school's theater club
ceased to exist a long time ago.

50
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,366
But this might be difficult.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,099
A play would use a stage
for a couple hours, right?

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,502
Something like a food stand
would be a different story,

53
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:46,110
but the brass band and the music
ensembles wouldn't like that at all.

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,083
You can't just say you want to do it,
there are things that are physically
impossible to do in a play.

57
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,645
Even for you, Miyazawa-san.

58
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:56,617
And you're all beginners right?
Are you sure you can pull it off?

59
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,895
I wonder if this was too sudden after all.

60
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:17,173
No, just leave this to me!
Negotiating is my area of expertise.

62
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:18,645
I'll work something out.

63
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,182
Ooh?You're so reliable!

64
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,013
They told you it wouldn't work,

65
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,044
...so you should just give up.

66
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,651
I'm not going to do anything to help.

67
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,313
All I'm going to do is
say my lines, got it?

68
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:28,680
Ooh, scary.

69
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,689
Maho-san's reverting to her old punk ways.

70
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:42,967
Wow, so you're really going to do it.

71
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,800
Yeah, but it's hard to be aggressive to
the Student Council President by myself.

73
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:49,536
I hate to ask when you're busy,

74
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,743
...but could you help me with that?

75
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,913
I'd do anything for you.

76
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,246
Do you think the PTA would like the story?

77
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,550
Yeah, theme-wise?

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,179
In that case, you should get
the teachers on your side.

79
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,048
Getting teachers with power to recommend
that it's appropriate to be performed at...

81
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:05,459
...the Culture Fair would
be the most effective.

82
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:08,229
Oh yeah!
I knew I could count on you.

83
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,393
Arima, you're so good to have around.

84
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,001
What?

85
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,028
Just call on me whenever you're busy.
I'll help out.

86
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,249
Oh yeah Miyazawa, I got my hands on
a bit of inside information about
the Asaba Hideaki Dinner Show.

89
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:33,049
Say what?! 1-F has
totally hardened their...

90
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:34,489
...defenses and won't let anything
out about their plans!

91
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,385
What kind of seductive stage are
they planning?

92
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,260
Come on baby! Ole!

93
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,893
Mitchie?!
(Text:Welcome to Prince Land)

94
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,569
Come on baby!

95
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,564
Takarazuka?!

96
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,340
Come on!

97
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:55,869
What?! Julie?!

98
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:58,877
Casablanca!

99
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,574
Character goods!

100
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,178
Notebooks, pencil boards, pencil cases,
telephone cards,

101
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,110
celphone straps, watches, ballpoint pens,
laminated cards, posters,

102
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,087
handkerchiefs, charms, keychains,
diaries, 1/6 scale figures!

103
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,214
A specially made picture book
and fanzines.

104
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,482
Oh boy, that'll sell.

105
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,626
Asapin Official Guidebook!

106
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:16,391
Asapin Calendar?!

107
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,462
Asapin Illustrated

108
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:22,394
Asapin Poetry Collection?

109
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,330
Arima-kun!

110
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,602
Going to practice?

111
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,604
No, the reference room.

112
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,911
Arima-kun, I heard you
won the Interhigh!

114
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,145
You really are amazing!

115
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,147
Can I come watch you practice
some time?

116
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,319
It's not worth seeing.

117
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:34,319
Perhaps he's in a bad mood.

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,580
What do you think?

119
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,679
Sawada wrote this?

120
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,518
My specialty is math so I'm not
...an expert at literature,

121
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,087
...but I was surprised. I
didn't know you had such talent.

122
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:29,555
Nope,

123
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,330
I just wrote down whatever popped in
my head and dressed it up as I saw fit.

124
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,002
It's just a bunch of lies.

125
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,900
It's a work into which Sawada-san
gave her all to express the themes
she wanted to entreat!

127
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,168
So you're saying you'd like
to do this at the Culture Fair?

128
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:42,540
I think it's good.

129
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,979
This is the sort of thing appropriate
for the Culture Fair.

130
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,843
I'll give it my recommendation.

131
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,080
Thank you very much.

132
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,420
And about the procedures in going
about actually making it work...

134
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,820
we don't really know what to do,
so we would like your guidance.

136
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,623
It would be best to get
a teacher to be an advisor.

137
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,696
You have such a fine work here.

138
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,961
You could get this qualified
as a temporary club.

139
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,899
Oh yeah! So we have to find a teacher
who would be willing to be our advisor.

141
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,800
But who?

142
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,872
Shouldn't it be one of the literature teachers?

143
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,897
I don't know if there's someone we could ask.

144
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,867
I don't know any of them that well...

146
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,143
And we definitely want someone
who has influence in the Student
Council and among the faculty.

147
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,946
When I was a student
I did a small amount of acting...

148
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,452
That is, only if you think I'd be suitable...

149
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,749
That's it!

151
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,128
Yay! We're so lucky that we got
Mr. Kawashima!

152
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,260
He is the Dean of our class!
(Text:Power)

153
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,397
Power! He has power!

154
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:48,976
Hee hee hee...Just leave it to me...
Now I can get us whatever budget we want!

156
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,842
We think Yukinon's more
helpful than anyone else...

158
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,710
I always thought that Mr. Kawashima was scary.

160
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,584
But he's a really nice teacher when you talk to him.

161
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,253
Attention, all students.

162
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:14,861
The application deadline for
groups .participating in the
Culture Fair is today at 3 o'clock.

163
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,264
Any group who has not submitted
it should come...

164
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,235
...to the Student Council Room
without delay.

165
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:26,337
Attention, all students.

166
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:29,240
The application deadline for groups

167
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,377
participating in the Culture Fair
is today at 3 o'clock.

169
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:39,583
Any group who has not submitted
it should come to...

170
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,629
Here! I brought the application.

171
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,255
I also have Mr. Kawashima's
recommendation letter.

172
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,590
Our members are Sawada Aya, Shibahime Tsubasa,

174
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,028
Isawa Maho, and Miyazawa Yukino.

175
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:52,899
We're going to put on a play.

176
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:14,189
Hey hey, have you heard?

177
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,893
Miyazawa-san and Shibahime-chan
...are going to do a play.

179
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:18,056
Yeah, I heard!

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,228
I wonder what it'll be about?

181
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:20,261
I want to see it.

182
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,827
I want to see it!

183
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:23,961
Miyazawa-san!

184
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,362
We'll definitely go see it.

185
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,773
Ok, but don't worry, I'll help out
on the class event too.

186
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,606
Maho, you're going to play a guy?!

187
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:32,410
I bet you'd look studly!

188
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,143
Tsubasa-chan! You're so cute!!

189
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,477
We'll go see you!

190
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,117
Too noisy!

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,118
So scary! But cute!

192
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,576
What?! Sis is going to be in a play!?

193
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,322
Fantasizing

194
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:17,122
Yaay! Let's go see! Let's go see!

195
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,255
No, you don't have to come.

196
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,655
I'm surprised you decided to do it.

198
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,760
One of my friends is a writer and
when I read it, it was interesting, so...

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,461
Really? What's her name?

202
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:30,497
Oh, I borrowed one of her books.

203
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,900
She's called Sawai Ayaki,

204
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,340
but that's her penname.

205
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:36,669
Sawai Ayaki?!?

206
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,082
Wh-what's the matter, Kano?

207
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:47,722
Sawai Ayaki's the person who wrote that
story you were sobbing over the other day!

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,651
No way, she's your friend?!

211
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,461
I'm definitely going to see it!

212
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,699
Introduce me to her!
Let me see the script!

214
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,291
O-okay, okay.

215
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,533
Dear! Let's go to Akihabara tomorrow!

216
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,532
We-we have to buy an
appliance like a camcorder!

218
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,075
What about your colleagues?

219
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,210
Will see Ayaki-sama...

220
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,115
Aya-chan must be amazing.

221
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,944
Guess I'll do my best too.

222
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,729
Yo, everyone's talking about how
you're doing a play.

223
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,226
Is that really?

224
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:06,090
That's right.

225
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:07,333
You sure you can handle it?

226
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,567
I bet you're going to forget your lines
the moment it starts.

227
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:11,829
Don't jinx me!

228
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:12,932
I'll be fine.

229
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,572
I'm used to talking in public from
Student Council.

230
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:20,112
I'd think the Student Council and
a play are totally different things.
Hee hee hee...

232
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:21,071
Meanie.

233
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,847
Anyways, what I do doesn't matter.

234
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,512
What about you and your revenge?

235
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,019
Are you doing something about it?

236
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,986
Changing the subject, eh.

237
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:32,250
I'm not in any hurry, so it's all right.
I'll do it gradually?

238
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:33,486
True.

239
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,257
There are no aesthetics in carrying out
your revenge simply.

240
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,265
You have to take your time and do it slowly.

241
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,166
That makes it feel so good.

242
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:41,428
Well,

243
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:45,262
The time spent elaborating the scheme for
revenge so beautiful it's a work of art.

245
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,937
The feeling of satisfaction in...

246
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:50,845
...steadily driving them into a trap,

247
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,141
like putting pieces of a
puzzle together, one by one...

248
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,980
That heightens the exultation felt...

249
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,909
...in the moment when you
reach the catastrophe!

250
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,145
Right!

251
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,349
Oh, at times I scare myself.

252
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,791
If I hadn't fallen in love with Arima,

253
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm sure I would be devising...

254
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,017
...a scheme like this on him right now.

255
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,153
What?!

256
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,328
We seem to be wholesome at first glance

257
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,031
yet we are secretly vindictive and
insidious within...

258
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:18,065
I don't like you or anything, but we
are definitely close. I understand you.

260
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,341
Yeah. I don't like you or anything either,

261
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,538
but I feel some kind of kinship with you.

262
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:35,474
Okay,

263
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:37,613
We're going to come up with specific
divisions of labor!

264
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,651
Actually, what are the divisions of labor for a play?

265
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,121
Rika-chan's doing the costumes...

266
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,353
Stuff like the set, props,
sound, and lighting?

267
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know either

269
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:50,661
Yeah, it would be hard to
do everything by ourselves.

270
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,088
That's what stagehands are for.

271
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,530
Maho-san and Tsubasa don't
look like they'll be any help...

273
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,475
In that case, I'll call on the girls on the
volleyball team who have some free time.

275
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,409
We have lots of people, and they're strong.

276
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,306
Really?

277
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,212
Thanks. You're a big help.

278
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:10,416
No problem.

279
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,083
We can bring things from home for props.

280
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,486
And then the BGM, where
should we play what music...

281
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,190
I really want to be particular.

282
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:17,950
Sounds like fun!

283
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,328
And what might all these lovely maidens
gathered here be talking about?

284
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:27,564
Asapin!

285
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,261
Tell me what's troubling you.

286
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,904
I'll grant whatever you desire...

287
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,470
Quit spewing pheromones near me!

288
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,638
Miyazawa, you're so square.

289
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,748
You just get ready for your dinner show.

291
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,187
The folks in my class are doing that,

292
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:47,852
...so I'm free.

293
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,690
I see, prepararing for the play.

294
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:53,717
You're doing the set too?

295
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,854
Well in that case, I'll do that.

296
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,924
What, you, Asapin??
(Text:Suspicion)

298
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,967
How could you?! I always get an A in Art!

299
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:03,901
Oh, but I've seen Asaba-kun's sketches.

300
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,601
They're detailed and really good.

301
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,339
Well, all right.

302
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,882
So, what should we do?

303
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,855
Don't take charge when you just barged in.

304
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:24,616
Don't you think our group is
getting weirder and weirder?

307
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,789
I bet you just wanted to join a group of girls.

308
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:28,888
But of course!

309
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,326
Is that what it is!

310
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,180
Miyazawa.

311
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,984
Arima!

312
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,126
Here are the printouts.

313
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,887
Hideaki, what are you doing?

314
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,395
You ask me?

315
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,129
I'm going to help Miyazawa's gang.

316
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:06,928
That sounds nice.

317
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:08,767
I want to help too.

318
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,434
You want to join a group of girls?

319
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,772
I'm not you.

320
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,799
You're helping us enough
already by giving advice.

322
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:56,746
Arima.

323
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:24,938
Are you all right?

324
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,024
What'll happen next!

325
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,984
The preparations for the play
are going steadily,

326
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,789
and Sis shows off her
lovey-doveyness with Arima.

327
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:59,255
But unrelated to that, Tonami Takefumi...

328
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,858
...finally admits to Tsubaki that
he hates her!

329
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,424
And the tremendously busy days...

330
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,961
...were about to begin again!

331
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,427
Please see next Act, Bye.
