1
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,590
Hey, Aiko!

2
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,530
Don't open it!

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,420
Eh?

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,560
Why not?

5
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,170
Hey!

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,270
I'm opening now!

7
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,890
Still preparing?

8
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,900
Yeah.

9
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,070
I hurried cleaning up my house in order to see Ai-chan.

10
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,700
You don't need to force yourself to come...

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,060
Why do you say that?

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Just be honest about how happy you are!

13
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,240
Here's something for ya.

14
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,920
Hey! Isn't that...

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,650
My sweater?

16
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,810
Y- Yeah...

17
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,220
Then let's check the size!

18
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,490
Come on, put it up against my shoulders,

19
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,420
I'm really looking forward to this.

20
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,140
Why must you act so spoiled?

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,080
I'm really busy!

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,430
I need to open up the store,

23
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,250
and you guys are keeping me!

24
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,450
Did you do something to make her angry?

25
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,210
I have no idea...

26
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,780
Hey, what were you doing during school breaks?

27
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,950
Huh?

28
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,000
I had to go pick out a sweater with her in your place,

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,540
it was a real pain.

30
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,200
Well, make sure you properly pay attention to her.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
S- Sure.

32
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,710
Nothing but the sweets I like...

33
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,940
Why...

34
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,490
For someone like me...

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,850
My friend here is a really great guy!

36
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,700
Yo!

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Welcome!

38
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,120
If you're Shinichirou's friend, then you're my friend, too!

39
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,450
Please go out with me!

40
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,530
Ai-chan, Miyokichi is a nice guy,

41
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,790
I guarantee it!

42
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,050
I know.

43
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,940
He's a good guy, right?

44
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,720
Sure.

45
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,620
Eh?

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,930
Awesome!

47
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,930
You did it!

48
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,750
A- Are you crying?!

49
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,270
I'm... such an idiot...

50
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,750
Huh?

51
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,620
Mom!

52
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,310
Oh, Shin-chan, you're back.

53
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,260
Have you seen the photo album in my room?

54
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,560
Oh, you mean that? I've thrown it away.

55
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,300
Eh? Why?

56
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,360
There's no point in keeping that.

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,130
That picture...

58
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,420
Did you call Ai-chan?

59
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,450
Nah, I leave her alone on days like that.

60
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,840
Ain't girls troublesome?

61
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,360
I like it even when they're being troublesome,

62
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,620
"I'm sorry, for being this selfish."

63
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,270
"Don't worry about it! Since you're so cute!"

64
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,620
Like that, after the storm, your love will grow!

65
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,670
Well!

66
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,590
You'll get it when you get yourself a girlfriend as well.

67
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,340
Girlfriend, eh?

68
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,630
So how's it going with Yuasa Hiromi?

69
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,050
Why that old story all of a sudden?

70
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,730
Haven't the two of you been getting along well recently?

71
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,470
Won't happen.

72
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,820
Why?

73
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,410
There's someone else she likes.

74
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,320
Eh?

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,300
And I've told him to go out with Hiromi.

76
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,530
Why did you do that?

77
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,670
Just going with the flow.

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Is he retarded?

79
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,820
Hiromi, over there!

80
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,750
Hiromi, at the entrance...

81
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,120
Hey!

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,230
I came to see you.

83
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,220
I shall wait for you at the park after school.

84
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,350
Geez...

85
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,500
Incredible, Hiromi!

86
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,130
But that No. 4 seems like a delinquent!

87
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,590
He looks so cool, doesn't he?

88
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,280
Right?

89
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,600
Lay off, Hiromi's troubled.

90
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,450
Hey, is that fine with you?

91
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,720
If it's okay or not doesn't matter, does it?

92
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,170
Shinichirou?

93
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,880
Toilet.

94
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
Is that guy serious?

95
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,140
It's not like he really likes her.

96
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,690
My... all of my feelings until now...

97
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,740
But... Hiromi's feelings...

98
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:51,070
If I really think about it... this way should be best for Hiromi.

99
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,310
Shinichirou!

100
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,830
I... and her...

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,850
Shinichi... rou...?

102
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh... did you want anything?

103
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,720
Here!

104
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,190
You should look happier when you eat something delicious!

105
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,170
Right now, I feel like a chicken in a cage.

106
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,570
Like, I can do nothing but just accept what's in front of me.

107
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,720
That's not it!

108
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,350
Like Raigou-maru, you are a special chicken aiming for the sky!

109
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,310
With a will of your own... a special chicken!

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,340
A will of my own?

111
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,870
That's right...

112
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,020
Then I'll be honest.

113
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,310
Right now, just looking at your face makes me feel anxious,

114
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,120
so could you leave me alone for a while?

115
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,560
For how long?

116
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,260
Shinichirou!

117
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,020
I met Nakagami Shinichirou the other day.

118
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,910
So, you like me?

119
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,970
Did Nakagami-kun say something?

120
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,370
Well, that's about it.

121
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,930
Want to go out with me?

122
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,290
Sunday at one o' clock, in front of the station's square.

123
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,630
Think about where you want to go.

124
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,000
Umm... please wait a second!

125
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,480
What is it?

126
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,650
It's nothing...

127
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,980
Seems like it's gonna snow.

128
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,020
Do you hate snow?

129
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,450
I won't be able to ride my bike.

130
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,060
What about you?

131
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,370
I once liked it, but now I hate it.

132
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,160
To start hating something you like... is hard, isn't it?

133
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,150
Eh?

134
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,530
Let me give you a lift.

135
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,390
You really ended up in this house.

136
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,990
Should I tell you...?

137
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,920
Ever since that day, I've hated snow.

138
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm home.

139
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,950
Did something happen?

140
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,400
What did you say to No. 4?

141
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,700
Are you two going out?

142
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,110
For the time being, we have a date on Sunday.

143
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,510
I see, so he asked you out.

144
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,890
I see.

145
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,960
Well, isn't that great?

146
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,970
You nosy...{Freaking annoying.}

147
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,810
Shin-chan, you're back.

148
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,560
That girl came back with a boy.

149
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,370
I don't need you to tell me about that.

150
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,300
Granny,

151
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,280
Shinichirou told me not to bother him for a while.

152
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,040
Somehow I think it's just too boring.

153
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,430
What's with that belt?

154
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,650
It's Shinichirou's.

155
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,090
You... didn't...

156
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,060
I just borrowed it.

157
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,910
Did that guy say something to you?

158
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,690
Nope, why do you ask?

159
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,810
Nah, it's nothing.

160
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,110
You going out?

161
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,800
It's a date.

162
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,910
Really?!

163
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,580
You look cool, onii-chan!

164
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,540
Well, I'm leaving.

165
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,870
Hey, what kind of girl is she?

166
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,880
She's cute, right? Is she from your school?

167
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,280
She's from your school.

168
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,940
It's Yuasa Hiromi.

169
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,360
Remember I told you my dad gave me some money for helping out with the crops?

170
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm gonna get you a sweater today, as a present.

171
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,060
Huh?

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,900
Is something wrong?

173
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,680
Well... it's my first time at the movies with a guy.

174
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,890
I've always just been here with Noe.

175
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,030
You two are really close, huh?

176
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,180
Our father and grandmother died,

177
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,170
and our mother goes out for work.

178
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,110
It's always just the two of us.

179
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,050
I understand her feelings as if I hold them in my hand.

180
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,110
Things she hasn't even realized herself.

181
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,090
It's fine... I'll feel bad...

182
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,160
It's just I want to buy one for ya.

183
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,400
7500 yen, please.

184
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,640
Alright, 7500 yen, eh?

185
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,710
There's no need.

186
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,740
We'll just get it next time.

187
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,600
Ai-chan?

188
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,190
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,470
Sorry about that.

190
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,090
You don't have to apologize.

191
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,850
I thought brighter colors would fit Ai-chan.

192
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,190
Since the one that Shinichirou picked is so plain.

193
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,540
You knew that we went shopping together?

194
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,200
That doesn't matter.

195
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,840
Just shopping...

196
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,530
That's not it...

197
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,880
Shinichirou didn't pick that sweater for me.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,490
I decided to buy it after Shinichirou picked it up and looked at it.

199
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:38,570
Shinichirou liked that sweater... So, I...

200
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,690
What do you mean by that?

201
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,220
It's fine here.

202
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,410
Right.

203
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,600
Umm... As I thought, I...

204
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,350
Hey, I want you to pass a word onto Nakagami Shinichirou.

205
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,580
Tell him to be more serious about Noe.

206
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,880
The two of them are dating.

207
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,790
I- I gotta go.

208
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,490
Welcome home.

209
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,890
Is something wrong?

210
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,990
It- It's nothing.

211
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,700
But...

212
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,720
There's nothing wrong.

213
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,640
Oh, you're here?

214
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,410
I will be done soon.

215
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,200
Did you come back with another guy?

216
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,780
Eh?

217
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,800
People are watching, you need to be more careful.

218
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,020
And here, there is Shinichirou...

219
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,380
What do you think people would say about him living with such an easy girl?

220
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,160
Why...

221
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,290
Eh?

222
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,780
Why are you talking about this?

223
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,960
Just because I am mom's child...

224
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,930
Just because that happened...

225
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,790
Is that why you are calling me easy!?

226
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,710
You... still remember that story?

227
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,000
I've never forgotten about it.

228
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,800
Not for a single moment...

229
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,630
Anyway, be careful.

230
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
What the hell are you doing?

231
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,870
Shin-chan...

232
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,260
What the hell is "that story"?

233
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,570
It has nothing to do with Shin-chan.

234
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,040
I have always been wondering...

235
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,110
Mom, aren't you acting too strict towards Hiromi?!

236
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,450
Shinichirou-kun, stop it!

237
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,140
It's fine already!

238
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,840
It's not!

239
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,880
I said it's fine! Leave me alone!

240
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,620
Hiromi!

241
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,600
Mom, please! Take it easy!

242
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,470
What did mom say to you?

243
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,940
What is "that story"?

244
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,870
Want me to tell you a big secret?

245
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,560
My birthday is latter,

246
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,620
So Shinichirou-kun is my older brother.

247
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,520
Is that... some kind of joke?

248
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,780
Seriously... doesn't it seem like a joke?

249
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:43,290
Oba-san said that Shinichirou-kun's father might be my real father.

250
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,690
I said it...

251
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,710
What... should I do...?

252
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
"Left behind by the girl..."

253
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,090
"There, a small pond had formed."

254
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,730
"A pond formed from the girl's tears."

255
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,040
"For some reason..."

256
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,250
"It was really deep."

257
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,580
"Infinitely deep."

258
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,830
"I..."

259
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,650
"felt like I was dragged down into it."

260
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:12,950
Shinichirou has a cockroach on his head~♪

261
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,010
Shinichirou has a cockroach on his back~♪

262
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,140
Should I give up on Hiromi?

263
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,100
Apologize to Shinichirou.

264
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,110
Who's that girl?

265
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,110
Tell me properly, write it down here.
