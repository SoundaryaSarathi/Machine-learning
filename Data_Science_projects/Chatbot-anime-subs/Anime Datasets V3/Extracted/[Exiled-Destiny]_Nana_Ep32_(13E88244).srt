1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,789
"Trapnest" means a nest box
with a trap.

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,209
Once you enter, you cannot
get out on your own.

3
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,919
I figured it was a name
a possessive man would think of.

4
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,919
Blinking eyes call the wind

5
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:44,559
A smile clears all the noise away

6
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,119
The angel in your eyes whispers

7
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:56,299
"Everything begins now"

8
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,539
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

9
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,339
It's like being caught in a wave

10
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,509
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

11
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,979
Breath held, arms reaching out

12
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,219
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

13
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:19,859
You're the only one I can see

14
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,799
Baby my wish on a wing

15
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:26,769
This sky is torn

16
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:32,169
By a single overflowing word

17
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:07,499
NANA
BECAUSE HACHIKO'S NOT
FEELING WELL, I WON'T BE
DROPPING BY FOR A WHILE.
BUT YOU BEGIN RECORDING
TOMORROW, SO YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE STUDIO
ANYWAY, RIGHT?
WELL, DO YOUR BEST.

18
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:18,479
Mr. Honjo.

19
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,219
Mr. Honjo.

20
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,389
Excuse me.

21
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,429
We've arrived at your place.

22
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,919
How do you open the garage door?

23
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,329
Oh, well, you insert the key there...

24
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:33,389
Key?

25
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:38,529
The card key. First you insert it...
Oh, such a drag.

26
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,069
Say, Kinoshita. How do you plan
to get home at this hour?

27
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:45,869
I'll take a taxi.

28
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,949
Why not use this to go home?

29
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,769
What?! Are you sure?!

30
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,149
You know, I would be happy

31
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,519
if you could come pick me up
in that tomorrow.

32
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,449
Not a problem at all!

33
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,079
If you'd like,
I could use the company car

34
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,679
to pick you up and drop you off
every day!

35
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,529
With the tough schedule you keep,
it would be dangerous driving every day.

36
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,559
Imagine if you got in an accident
and this car is totaled.

37
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,499
You're more worried about
the car than about me.

38
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,759
But you're driving
a super rare 1965 Mustang Shelby!

39
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:16,039
I didn't care what car I drive
so long as it moves,

40
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,099
but Takumi went through the trouble
of finding it for me.

41
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,549
Something about our image.

42
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,409
You know, Mr. Honjo,
you've got all this money and ability,

43
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,779
but you don't desire for much, do you?

44
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,389
Even your songs.

45
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,119
You write them according
to Takumi's instructions.

46
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:34,989
I believe your true talents shine
through when you play punk.

47
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,789
As long as I get to play guitar,
anything will do.

48
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,469
Well, I for one wanna hear
Ren Honjo's soul shout!

49
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:45,739
You wanna hear my soul shout?

50
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,499
Ah, well...
But doing as Takumi says

51
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,979
is not something limited to you
and the other band members.

52
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,439
Don't tell anyone I told you,
but everyone's saying,

53
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,979
"we're all soldiers serving
under Takumi."

54
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,949
Who's everyone?

55
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,319
Um... But Takumi does have the talents
and decision-making skills

56
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,759
to back his actions.

57
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,719
He's able to come through
on what he says.

58
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,859
I respect him for that.

59
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,459
Then tell this to "everyone."

60
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,029
If anyone's not satisfied with
how Takumi does things,

61
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,069
they're free to quit.

62
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:19,959
We don't need any soldiers
who are unwilling to fight with us.

63
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:31,339
THE PAPARAZZI ARE SO ANNOYING.
I'LL BE HIDING IN THE USUAL ROOM
AT THE USUAL HOTEL.
COME IF YOU FEEL UP TO IT.

64
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,009
I can't come up with the lyrics.

65
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,219
The theme is a love ballad
that'll make people cry.

66
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,819
Don't come to me about it.

67
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,819
Why do they always hafta
be love songs,

68
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,449
just because they're more popular?

69
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,699
Why do Japanese people like
love stories so much?

70
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,769
Can't I write a song
about world peace?

71
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,499
Well, not that I could write
a song about that.

72
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,599
What'll I do?
We begin recording tomorrow.

73
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,569
Technically, you begin today.

74
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,079
Shin, why are you being
so cold today?

75
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,649
Am I? Maybe it's because
I'm tired of being a good boy.

76
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,189
A good boy?

77
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:11,589
When are you good?

78
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:14,689
For this past month, I haven't
skipped a day of practice.

79
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,849
I've been respecting the studio's
no smoking policy,

80
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:19,489
and I'm playing music like
the director wants me to.

81
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,389
But this is getting real boring.

82
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,439
What? You're not allowed to smoke
in Gaia's rehearsal studios?

83
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,329
Usually, we're allowed to smoke
even in the recording studios.

84
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,939
What musician would
use such a place?

85
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:32,899
It's a teaching studio.

86
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,779
There's a professional
training school next door,

87
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,649
and students from there
use the studio.

88
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:41,819
Wow. There's a school there.
Gaia's pretty impressive.

89
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:45,279
Are the top students able
to debut as pros?

90
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,649
I wonder.
Doesn't interest me.

91
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,429
To be honest,
I don't care about the debut.

92
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,929
If I could have fun playing in a band,
that's good enough for me.

93
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,139
You're right! Music is something
that should be enjoyed!

94
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:05,749
Let's go out and dance all night like crazy
to release some of that tension! Okay?!

95
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:10,649
What are you saying?
This is your job, Reira.

96
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,809
You're getting paid for this,
so you've gotta take it seriously.

97
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,049
Come on, concentrate.

98
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,759
You can release all your frustrations

99
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,729
by writing down whatever's
on your mind.

100
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,719
You're right. Maybe I'll write
about getting rid of them "mosquitoes."

101
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,659
But you're writing a love ballad, right?

102
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,029
Aren't you hungry?
Can I call room service?

103
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:28,189
Reira was in love with Takumi.

104
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:50,869
What a pretty song.

105
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,419
Ren is a genius indeed.

106
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,729
It'll be ruined by
my shallow love story...

107
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,859
You're wrong about that.

108
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:11,269
A love story written by someone
who can shed tears like that

109
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,969
isn't gonna be shallow.

110
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,169
The reason Trapnest has the support
of so many female fans

111
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,839
is because they can relate
to your love stories.

112
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,009
I'm impressed.
You're really good with words.

113
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,079
For me, this is my job.
I make money from this.

114
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:31,889
I'm dead serious.

115
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,879
FROM: NAOKI
DATE AND TIME SENT:
AUGUST 31, 2001, 16:37
TO: YASU
SUBJECT: SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
YOUR PLACE. WE BEGIN RECORDING
OUR SINGLE TOMORROW. AND SO,
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GO
ANYWHERE FOR A WEEK. SO LET'S
DRINK ALL NIGHT TONIGHT!!

116
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,069
If I do that, it'll cause a scandal.

117
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,849
You're too self conscious.

118
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:58,879
Ren and Takumi are doing whatever
they want, and it hasn't been a problem.

119
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,509
It has been a problem.
A real problem.

120
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,349
The papa-rakkyo just won't go away.

121
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,479
I hear that female vocal from your band
has been staying at Ren's place.

122
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,959
Would you please give her a lecture?

123
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,119
Huh? What are papa-rakkyo?

124
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,519
Paparazzi.

125
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,589
Really?

126
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,799
Yeah. They're targeting
all the band members,

127
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,629
but I'm the only one
being careful about it.

128
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:22,539
The company put Reira in a hotel
to protect her.

129
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,509
But I'm pretty sure Takumi went
to see Hachiko today.

130
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,339
He was looking restless all day, and
rushed home the moment we were done.

131
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,539
By Hachiko, do you mean?

132
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:30,919
Nana.

133
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,449
I've never met her,

134
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,819
but from what I hear,
she knows how to control a man.

135
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,249
She's really something.

136
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,059
One day, she says she wants
to see you,

137
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,419
the next day she blocks your calls.

138
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,989
She's a great strategist, not to mention
a great cook and great in bed.

139
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,099
Even if not Takumi, any guy would
fall for a woman like that.

140
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,789
Impressive, I'd say.
Who is she?

141
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,759
Naoki, you've got it wrong.

142
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,669
Besides, I thought those two broke up.

143
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,339
No, I doubt that'll happen.

144
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,999
Takumi would never let a girl
he's infatuated with

145
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,409
run away so easily.

146
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,049
He's such a fool, not realizing that
he's playing into Hachiko's hands.

147
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,519
Put an end to things first,
and then come to me.

148
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,719
But I did.
That's why I came.

149
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,389
Why aren't you saying anything?

150
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,159
Say something!

151
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,039
Are you gonna step up
or just walk away?

152
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,329
The baby's growing even as we speak!

153
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,049
What's the matter?

154
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,419
Hello, Hachiko?

155
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,309
Oh, Nana, you're there, too?

156
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:44,219
Takumi?

157
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:48,019
Perfect timing.
I wanted to talk to you as well.

158
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,489
Can you and Nobu come here now?

159
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,249
I'm not getting anywhere
over the phone.

160
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,069
Come where?!

161
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,999
And why are you calling
from Hachiko's cell phone?!

162
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,999
I'm just borrowing it for a bit.
I'm at your place right now.

163
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,169
What are you doing at our place?!

164
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,209
How dare you fool around
with someone else's woman!

165
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,209
Hachi's dating Nobu now!

166
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,509
I know that, but...

167
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,609
He's the one who fooled around
with someone else's woman.

168
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:13,749
Is Hachi there?

169
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:14,709
Yeah, she's here.

170
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,619
Let me talk to her.
It's useless talking with you.

171
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:23,429
Nana, Nana wants to talk to you.

172
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,139
Looks like she's in no condition
to talk to you.

173
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,939
What did you do to her?!

174
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,069
No, I didn't do anything.

175
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,699
Anyway, we'll be there right away!

176
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,139
We're in the neighborhood!

177
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,709
Really? Then can you buy
some grapefruits

178
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,839
and a bottle of sparkling water
on your way?

179
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:48,679
Huh?!

180
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,809
I'll squeeze the fruit
and have her drink it.

181
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:52,349
She seems to be having a really
bad case of morning sickness.

182
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,889
She's in pain.
I'm counting on you, okay?

183
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,909
Morning sickness?

184
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,079
Morning sickness?

185
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,879
Yeah. I'll have the grapefruit juice.

186
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,979
Oh, but it's just the summer heat.
I'm all right.

187
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,919
I can't really explain it.
Like, maternal instinct?

188
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,999
Nobu... you...

189
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,669
When you do it with Hachi,
do you use a condom?

190
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,659
Answer me!

191
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:39,859
Of course I do.

192
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,069
Every time?

193
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:41,829
Yeah.

194
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,129
From before you insert?!

195
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,099
Yeah.

196
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,979
You liar! You must've done it at least
a bit without any protection!

197
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,279
Never without protection!

198
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,379
Why are you so damn serious
all the time?

199
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,319
What are you saying?

200
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,589
Is being serious a bad thing?!

201
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,089
If she gets pregnant, I don't have
the money to raise a kid!

202
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,169
So, of course!

203
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,569
Then it's Takumi's child?

204
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,329
What are you crying for?
I'm the one who wants to cry.

205
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,679
If it's not your child, then say so!

206
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,939
Then I'm sure Hachi won't have it!

207
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,649
I can't say that!
I'll sound like I'm irresponsible.

208
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:28,419
I did it with her too,

209
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,249
so the possibility of it being
my child is not zero percent.

210
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,389
Besides, Hachi probably already knows
that it's Takumi's child.

211
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:38,449
Isn't that why she told him?

212
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,329
Otherwise, she wouldn't be seeing him.

213
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:44,999
I mean, there's no other reason.

214
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,159
He's the one who fooled around
with someone else's woman.

215
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,339
Then you should become the father.

216
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,259
What are you saying?
Don't make it sound so simple.

217
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,059
If it's about money,
I'm sure we can work it out!

218
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,819
We've got our debut coming up
for one thing.

219
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,229
And I can't imagine Takumi
becoming the guardian

220
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,739
of the child he had by accident!

221
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,429
He said he would.

222
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,569
Even if it were my child.

223
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,509
He's just saying that
so he can keep Hachi to himself!

224
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:30,149
That man wants to take advantage
of the child to get her for himself!

225
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,809
Aren't you doing the same?!

226
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,849
You're taking advantage of me
to get Hachi for yourself, right?!

227
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:42,349
Cut it out already.
That's definitely screwed up.

228
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:46,289
If you're gonna insist,
why don't you become the father?

229
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,129
Although, I can't imagine you feeling
any love for Takumi's child.

230
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,109
There's no way I could.

231
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,289
No!

232
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,989
Don't keep it!

233
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,799
Those two are sure
taking their time.

234
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:33,109
Don't get so stressed.
Right now, you need to lie down.

235
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,139
You wouldn't want a miscarriage,
would you?

236
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,579
You know, I think you've
gained a little weight.

237
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,249
I thought women usually lose weight

238
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,719
during the days of morning sickness.

239
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,489
My older sister had a bad case
of morning sickness, too.

240
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,119
I was in eleventh grade
and she was twenty.

241
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,529
She got married as a result.

242
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,659
Her husband is a hard-working
office worker,

243
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,719
a very reliable man, unlike me.

244
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,159
But I got so pissed off when
I found out,

245
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,209
and I beat him up pretty badly.

246
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,029
My sister cried and Reira laughed at me
for being so possessive.

247
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:05,639
It was horrible.

248
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,409
Come to think of it,
you're also twenty years old.

249
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,279
Though, you're not very mature
for your age.

250
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,709
You don't have a full-time job

251
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,809
and when you get lonely
you're quick to sleep with some guy.

252
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,319
And as luck would have it,
now you're pregnant.

253
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:22,419
You're hopeless.

254
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,719
Your parents are gonna cry.

255
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:26,959
But who am I to tell you this, right?

256
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:33,409
Regardless who the kid's father is,

257
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,769
there's no mistake that
you are the mother.

258
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,609
So pull yourself together.

259
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,089
They're finally here.

260
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,019
You're late.
I thought you ran away.

261
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,089
Huh? You're alone?
What about Nana?

262
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,449
I dunno.

263
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:29,479
Geez, she hasn't gone off
to Ren's place again, has she?

264
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,259
Oh, did you find grapefruits?

265
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:33,389
Huh?

266
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,369
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE

267
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:41,099
You're not very thoughtful, are you?

268
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,869
Never mind. I'll go buy some.

269
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,699
It's not really something the three of us
can have a friendly chat about anyway.

270
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,869
The choice is Nana's.

271
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:51,109
The child doesn't need
two fathers, right?

272
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,439
Nana... Is it true that you're pregnant?

273
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,179
Hey, I wanna hear it
directly from you.

274
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,749
It could be my child.
There's no need to hide it from me.

275
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:29,209
And I knew that you had
just broken up with Takumi.

276
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,779
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,539
Why... are you apologizing?

278
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,099
Didn't you break up with him?!

279
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:10,659
Please make up an excuse.

280
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,089
I don't care if it's a lie.
I'll believe you.

281
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,969
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:34,909
A ring of oath

283
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:38,819
Our red string
We can't see it now

284
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,349
No promises either
Don't let go of this hand you've held

285
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,989
It's embarrassing,
so don't read it out loud!

286
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,359
Even I find it bad.
I should hire a ghostwriter to write it.

287
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,199
Say, what's the meaning
of this red string?

288
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:57,929
Huh? Don't you know?

289
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,899
No.

290
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,479
It's an invisible string of fate
that's tied onto the little fingers

291
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,909
of two lovers who are
meant to be together.

292
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,379
Wow. I bet girls fall for
that sort of stuff.

293
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,019
But I'm not interested
in such theories of fate.

294
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:13,419
It doesn't matter what the relationship.

295
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,229
I believe people are bound by trust.

296
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:19,919
Is that what you mean by
"this hand you've held"?

297
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:22,829
Maybe it's sour grapes because
I haven't found that someone to love.

298
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,059
It's a nice song.

299
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,109
Thank you.
You made me feel better, Shin.

300
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,979
I've gotta do my best
to go platinum again.

301
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,249
You know, Hachi...

302
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,789
I wanted to keep you
by my side,

303
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,159
even if it meant putting
a collar around your neck.

304
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:51,159
I was afraid of myself
for thinking that,

305
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,929
so I always kept a little distance
between us.

306
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,699
Even now, I can't make friends easily.

307
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,729
I'm still...

308
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,769
afraid.

309
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,389
I can't count
how many nights

310
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:19,149
I wished tomorrow
would never come

311
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:25,929
To live as I am
without being fake

312
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,529
What do I need

313
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:37,669
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

314
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:42,839
The answer is
too close to see

315
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,079
Black tears are
falling down

316
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:56,029
I have nothing,
only sadness

317
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:01,119
I can't put it
into words

318
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:07,199
My whole body
starts to ache

319
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,609
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
