1
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,688
Look! Look! That’s so cute!

2
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,560
Oh! That one is cute too!

3
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:16,297
So nice!

4
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:20,637
Mei Lin-chan is having so much fun.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,842
I’m really glad she asked us
to go shopping together!

6
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,441
Yes.

7
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,377
Really,
that girl’s totally enjoying’ herself.

8
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:30,747
Kero-chan!

9
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:35,453
But girls really do like to go shopping.

10
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:38,487
I have to hide myself
everywhere you guys go!

11
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,324
It’s real tough, ya know?
Why don’t you consider how I feel?

12
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,554
I am really exhausted.

13
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:44,086
That’s why I told you to stay home.

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:48,925
But if you stay home, you might miss out
on the delicious food, right, Kero-chan?

15
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:49,933
That’s right!

16
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:53,337
I’m always where food is!

17
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:57,374
Geez, you love to snack
way too much, Kero-chan!

18
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,604
Hey! You guys!

19
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,173
Don’t just stand there!
Come on! Hurry up!

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,145
Now, let’s go!

21
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:26,162

Where should we go next?

55
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,689
Movie! Movie!

56
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,121
There’s a movie I want to see!

57
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:04,394
Kero-chan!

58
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,188
That game!

59
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,804
I’ve wanted to play
that game at least once!

60
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,070
But…

61
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:16,805
I wanna play! Wanna play! Wanna play!

62
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,337
You can’t! What if someone sees you!

63
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:24,708
In that case,
why don’t you play and lemme watch?

64
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,816
What? Me?

65
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:33,759
Good luck, Sakura!

66
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,551
Show me what you have!

67
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,898
You’ve been filming all this time.

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
Yes,
I must not let any of Sakura’s actions

69
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,903
slip through my camera!

70
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,118
Come on!

71
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,659
But!

72
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:10,629
What are you gonna do?!

73
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,767
Mei Lin-chan!

74
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:18,927
Don’t take your eyes off them!

75
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,607
I’ll take care of this side!

76
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,405
You do the other side!

77
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:35,883
Go! Sakura!

78
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,928
Sakura-chan and Mei Lin-chan
are working together so well.

79
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:08,021
Tomoyo-chan!

80
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,359
Tomoyo-chan!

81
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,062
Tomoyo-chan!

82
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,761
Tomoyo-chan!

83
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:31,906
This is so sweet!

84
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,661
We won! We won!

85
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:57,493
What are you doing?!

86
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,053
You’ve waited for me.

87
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:20,958
I’ve returned from the navigation.

88
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:22,488
This is the last ring.

89
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,694
From now on, it is for our future.

90
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,342
It must be wonderful

91
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:39,472
to be able to stay
with the one you love forever.

92
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,808
Is that so?
It’s just gloomy to me.

93
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,978
Geez, Kero-chan,
you’re not romantic at all.

94
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,292
Mei Lin-chan,
don’t you think so too?

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,650
O… Of course!

96
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:57,755
Shao Lan, you think so too,
don’t you?

97
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,372
I’m going to buy something to drink!

98
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:09,099
Hey, Shao Lan!

99
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:28,292
Huh?

100
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,417
These…

101
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,243
are the Clow Cards I have.

102
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,322
Wh… What am I doing?!

103
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,516
Li-kun!

104
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:37,390
I am so touched!

105
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:40,933
Hey, Li-kun, Mei Lin-chan,
where should we go next?

106
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,134
There’s one place I’ve wanted to go

107
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,133
since I first came to Japan.

108
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,170
Wow! This is awesome!

109
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,414
It’s the first time I’ve done this!

110
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,180
You’ve never taken the train before?

111
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,918
I’ve never taken this train before.

112
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:00,515
Oh, I see.

113
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,158
Is something bothering you?

114
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,556
You’ve been staring…

115
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,094
Nothing’s really bothering me…

116
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,768
But I’ve been having a dream…

117
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:16,531
A dream?

118
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,089
Kero and I were
standing on top of this one building,

119
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,118
and we could see the
Tokyo Tower from there.

120
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,893
Do you dream about that every day?

121
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,095
No, only sometimes.

122
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,032
But maybe more often these days…

123
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,166
Oh, I dreamed about it

124
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:49,097
the day you came here.

125
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,632
A dream in which you appeared.

126
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:56,873
And then also… 
the day I met Miss Mizuki.

127
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:00,777
A dream

128
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,207
which has that teacher in it?

129
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:10,382
We arrived!
We arrived! What’s wrong?

130
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,523
No, it’s nothing.

131
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:14,760
I’m sorry. Let’s go.

132
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,441
It’s huge!

133
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,513
Because it’s 333 meters after all!

134
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,354
It is really huge!

135
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:52,228
Have you been here before?

136
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,832
No, this is my first time.

137
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:56,993
But…

138
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,797
It’s the same as in the dream.

139
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,405
But what?

140
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,811
No, it’s nothing. Let’s go!

141
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:22,861
What’s wrong?

142
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:28,696
I thought I felt something weird…

143
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,363
There is nothing.

144
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,335
I wanna go to the observatory!

145
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,906
Li-kun!

146
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,501
Do you feel anything strange?

147
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,076
Not really.

148
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,543
Am I worrying too much?

149
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,277
Kinomoto-san!

150
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,245
Hurry up!

151
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,894
It seems Mei Lin-chan
keeps hurrying me today.

152
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,133
Because you look occupied.

153
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:04,268
She looks more like daydreaming.

154
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:06,935
She’s not occupied nor daydreaming.

155
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:09,334
She’s just worried.

156
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,341
No, she just needs to clear her mind.

157
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:20,215
This is it!

158
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,883
Hey, hey, it’s gonna close!

159
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:32,129
This is really high!

160
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,839
That’s the place I stood in my dream.

161
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:46,442
Did you see something cool?

162
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:47,643
Kero-chan!

163
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,144
What if someone sees you?!

164
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:51,812
There’s no one around!

165
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:59,189
So, what’s with
that confused look all day?

166
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:07,056
It’s the same as in the dream.

167
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,472
I haven’t been here before,

168
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,135
but it’s the same.

169
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,436
Well, that’s what
everyone called a dream.

170
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:22,146
But…

171
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:26,475
Would you like to join us
to buy something to drink?

172
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,345
I want an orange juice!

173
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,490
Kero-chan,
do you want a melon soda…

174
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,188
Huh?

175
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,285
What’s wrong?

176
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:35,490
Kero-chan…

177
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:36,860
Everyone’s waiting.

178
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:38,496
Oh! Wait, Li-kun!

179
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,291
May I take your order, please?

180
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,171
Onii-chan!!

181
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,070
Why are you here?!

182
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:49,471
Part-time.

183
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,572
But you said

184
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,143
there’s a soccer match today…

185
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,448
Yukito-san!

186
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:58,907
I’m doing part-time too.

187
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,308
But you told me

188
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,622
you’re helping out
with today’s soccer match…

189
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:03,880
Yukito also

190
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,080
Attend as a reserve player.

191
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:08,327
Because I want to be near you,
Sakura-chan.

192
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,131
Here’s the juice.

193
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:16,901
I want one too!

194
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,601
Kero-chan!

195
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:21,603
Yo!

196
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:22,771
Hello.

197
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:29,676
Hey, you guys, don’t try to
get Sakura into trouble!

198
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,083
Got it!

199
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:35,345
Wh… What’s going on?!

200
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,316
Because,

201
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,016
This is a dream!

202
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:09,619
This is…

203
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:11,924
… that dream?

204
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:23,467
Who is that person…?

205
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,230
Who is it?!

206
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:27,735
Who is it?!

207
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,993
Mizuki-sensei…?!

208
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,766
What in the world is this?

209
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:57,795
What’s going on?

210
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:00,471
I…

211
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,239
don’t get it!

212
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:11,883
No problem

213
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:19,917
It’ll be okay for sure.

214
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:48,712
It’ll be okay for sure.

215
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:59,385
Gather yourself, Sakura!

216
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:02,326
Li-kun!

217
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,758
Under your left foot…

218
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:09,331
What is this?!

219
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:10,627
That’s a Clow Card!

220
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,429
Hurry up and seal it!

221
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:17,440
My magic can’t stop
time for much longer.

222
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,545
Key which hides
the forces of darkness,

223
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:23,845
reveal thy true form before me.

224
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,586
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

225
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,557
Release!

226
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,764
Return to thy
form which thou should be!

227
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,563
Clow Card!

228
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,889
Li-kun!

229
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,688
Shao Lan!

230
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:18,402
I’m sorry,

231
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,030
if only
I’d noticed the card earlier,

232
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:23,934
none of this would have happened…

233
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:25,476
Don’t worry about it.

234
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:28,171
This is nothing for me.

235
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:29,979
This isn’t nothing!

236
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:31,847
Li-kun…

237
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,249
But just now, it was quite something.

238
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,326
Hey! What’s wrong?!

239
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,195
Kinomoto-san!

240
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,330
Sakura-chan!

241
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,262
Sakura’s totally unconscious,

242
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,262
and yet we could sense the card.

243
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:55,838
So I thought

244
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,937
this must be the act of a Clow Card.

245
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,179
But the card could not
be found anywhere…

246
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,380
Then Shao Lan noticed the card

247
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,310
was underneath your foot.

248
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,888
So, thanks for this!
It belongs to Shao Lan!

249
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:13,955
I’m sorry.

250
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:19,294
Dream …

251
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:20,455
So everything I’ve seen

252
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,290
after I entered the door was a dream.

253
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:25,969
Dreams created by ‘Dream’

254
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,171
What Dream shows a person
is not simply any dream.

255
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:29,939
It’s a prophetic dream!

256
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,542
Prophetic dream?

257
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,079
It’ll be okay for sure.
