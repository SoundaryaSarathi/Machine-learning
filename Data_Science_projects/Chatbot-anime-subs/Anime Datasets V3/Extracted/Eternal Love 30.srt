<i>[Episode 30]</i>

3
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:06,497
Why does this wine
taste different from usual?

4
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:33,456
<i>Where did this young man come from?</i>

5
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,037
Su Su.

6
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:39,357
Su Su.

7
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:43,997
Su Su.

8
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,297
Su Su!

9
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:51,297
Su Su!

10
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,057
Su Su!

11
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:05,656
Su Su!

12
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:33,456
<i>I must have walked into
High God's confusion shield.</i>

13
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:37,976
<i>I'll come visit again after
the Eastern Sea banquet.</i>

14
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,656
Why am I here?

15
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:35,737
What an amusing dream.

16
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,656
What dream has you smiling so cheerfully?

17
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,656
A dream of romance.

18
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:47,297
In my dream, I seem to have
cast an enchanting spell

19
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:50,081
to harass an innocent young man.

20
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,336
What an interesting dream.
Do you remember what he looked like?

21
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:59,177
Your wine was too strong.

22
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:03,737
I couldn't even see the moon clearly.
How could I remember his face?

23
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:10,257
He seemed to have been
wearing dark-colored robes.

24
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:13,976
Even I can't break out of the
Nine-tailed Fox Clan's enchanting spells.

25
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,896
Go on. Don't be late.

26
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,697
I'm leaving now.

27
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:27,456
Oh, yes.

28
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,257
Your Fourth Brother has been gone
for quite a while now.

29
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:34,617
When you deliver the wine to him,
tell him to come back when he has time.

30
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,550
It's time for those two fields in front
of the mountains to be tended to.

31
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,456
You're the one who angered him.
You get him to come back.

32
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,817
I don't want to be scolded in your place.

33
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,175
I hereby--

34
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,896
I'm afraid of being struck by lightning.

35
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,377
Sister.

36
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,297
Why did you call out to me?

37
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,069
I see you are brimming
with immortal energy.

38
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:16,505
You must be an immortal heading to
the Eastern Sea banquet.

39
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:18,865
Can you lead the way for me?

40
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,386
Follow me.

41
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:34,466
Thank you for leading the way, Sister.

42
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,826
May I ask where you are from?

43
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:42,025
I have been living in High God Zhe Yan's
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

44
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:45,666
Then do you know
the Crown Prince of the Nine Heavens?

45
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,265
I do not.

46
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,426
Don't worry, Princess.

47
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:32,745
With your looks, the Crown Prince
surely has not forgotten you

48
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:34,586
and must be thinking of you every day.

49
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,381
Yes, although the position of
Heavenly Empress has already been taken

50
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:41,426
how is it possible that Lord Ye Hua will
fall for that old woman from Qing Qiu?

51
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,546
Old woman?

52
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:52,625
How strange.

53
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,250
Why are there so many water lily leaves
covering the crystal lights?

54
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,985
Honorable guest,
have you brought the invitation?

55
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,385
This way please.

56
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:37,145
Even if you cannot accept it,
I am the Lord of the Ghost Realm.

57
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,666
Even if your father,
the Water King of West Sea, were here

58
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,985
he would still need to bow to me.

59
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,466
The Ghost Lord?

60
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,145
In my mind, you are just the rascal

61
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:49,586
who hung around the base of
Kunlun Mountain 70,000 years ago

62
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,225
and only knew how to drink and be merry!

63
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,865
You shut your mouth.

64
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:56,186
My three guests, I'm afraid
your tempers are flaring.

65
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,225
Please hold your comments.

66
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,066
Ghost Lord, please calm down.

67
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:09,546
The two of you were
disciples of High God Mo Yuan.

68
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,145
Please calm down.

69
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,785
In recent years, we have been on
good terms with the Ghost Realm.

70
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:17,346
We shouldn't destroy a friendship
that took many years to build

71
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,265
just because of a personal feud.

72
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:22,625
Do this for my sake today.
Please don't be angry.

73
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,666
Ghost Lord, please don't be angry.

74
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:41,907
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

75
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:45,025
We looked everywhere.
We just can't find the young prince.

76
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,870
A-Li has never been
to the Crystal Palace.

77
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,586
I'm guessing he has gone off
to play out of curiosity.

78
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,426
Keep looking.
I'll search in the back gardens.

79
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,785
- Yes.
- Yes.

80
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,546
Little Riceball,
what are you digging for?

81
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,865
I'm pulling out the grass.

82
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:19,706
Father said the coral
buried under the weeds

83
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,586
is the most beautiful thing
on the Eastern Sea seafloor.

84
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:26,546
I've never seen it,
so I want to dig it out so I can see it.

85
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,505
Father?

86
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:31,505
- You are from the Celestial Tribe?
- Yes.

87
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,706
Use this fan.

88
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:46,505
With a light sweep of this fan,
this grass will all blow away.

89
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:50,865
This fan is so pretty. It looks like
it could belong to my family.

90
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,785
<i>The Cloud Clearing Fan?</i>

91
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,666
Please enter.

92
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,186
Make a quick inspection.

93
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,306
The Aunt from Qing Qiu
will be arriving soon.

94
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,505
There must not be any
bright lights shining through.

95
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,706
- Yes.
- Yes.

96
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:41,145
Am I in trouble now?

97
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:45,946
You're not the only one in trouble.
I'm the one who gave you the fan.

98
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,145
Mother!

99
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,946
Mother!

100
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,025
- Mother?
- Mother, Mother!

101
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,785
Why did you leave me and Father?

102
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,105
Young child, you must have
the wrong person.

103
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,265
Su Su.

104
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,625
Father.

105
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,826
<i>Master?</i>

106
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:35,785
<i>No, he isn't Master. He isn't.</i>

107
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,666
Presumptuous!

108
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,346
I am mistaken.

109
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,666
She would not speak so harshly.

110
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,145
My apologies for offending you.

111
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:13,025
You are too courteous.

112
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:17,505
Is Mother angry?

113
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:18,625
A-Li.

114
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:20,706
Let's go.

115
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:25,505
- Mother.
- A-Li.

116
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:36,785
Farewell.

117
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:51,306
Father, she looks very much like
the painting of Mother in Xiwu Palace.

118
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,346
<i>Xiwu Palace?</i>

119
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:58,265
<i>Could he be the Celestial Tribe's
Crown Prince, Lord Ye Hua?</i>

120
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:06,586
Aunt.

121
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,225
Shao Xing?

122
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:16,905
Aunt.

123
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,546
You and I are not mistress and servant.
There's no need to bow to me.

124
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:24,546
Aunt.

125
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,785
For the past 300 years, I have waited
at the valley entrance every day

126
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:30,145
but I never received your summons.

127
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:32,505
Do you still blame me?

128
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,546
You waited for me at the cave entrance?

129
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,625
Mi Gu has never mentioned it.

130
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:47,745
I haven't seen you for 300 years,
how did you let yourself get so fat?

131
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,546
I heard Zhe Yan mention

132
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,225
that you are already
carrying your fourth baby.

133
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,586
It seems you and the Water King
are quite affectionate.

134
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,066
The Water King has treated me very well.

135
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,385
However, I still cannot forget
what happened 300 years ago.

136
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:14,506
Shao Xing, you should know,
I am most unwilling to see you.

137
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:19,185
Although you have done wrong by me

138
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:21,306
we were once
mistress and servant after all.

139
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,266
Go ahead and tell me what you want.
I will grant you one wish.

140
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,306
I do not want anything.

141
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:32,306
In these 300 years, I have only
sought your forgiveness.

142
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:36,066
No matter how much time passes,
I still belong with the Fox Den.

143
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:37,945
Don't.

144
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:41,425
You are no longer part of Qing Qiu.

145
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:47,306
This wish is a gift for your marriage.

146
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:50,865
Tell me. I will grant you
anything you wish.

147
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:56,346
After you are done, our relationship as
mistress and servant will come to an end.

148
00:17:56,346 --> 00:18:02,066
I had expected you would be mad.
But why won't you give me a chance?

149
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,465
Do you truly not understand?

150
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:11,385
You had never met Sang Ji
and you said you wouldn't like him.

151
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:14,546
If you had married Sang Ji,
you would not have been happy.

152
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:18,346
And after losing Sang Ji,
you can have someone even better.

153
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:30,865
Lord Ye Hua is a very good man.
He is the future Heavenly Lord.

154
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:35,425
However, if I lost Sang Ji,
I would truly be left with nothing.

155
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:40,026
You are right.

156
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:42,266
I had thought

157
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,105
you were mad at me
for not saying anything

158
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,586
before leaving Qing Qiu
without your permission

159
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:50,786
but that you would never be
mad at me for marrying Sang Ji.

160
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,746
Because in my heart

161
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:55,625
you have always been
a highly principled immortal.

162
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,546
It seems you really don't understand.

163
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,705
Shao Xing.

164
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:09,105
Do you remember your clan members
who once bullied you in Qing Qiu?

165
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:22,986
I remember.

166
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:26,185
You should also know
there were some among them

167
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:28,266
who did not truly want to bully you.

168
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:33,506
It's just that if they defended you,
they would be bullied in turn.

169
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,425
That's why they could only follow
the strongest and bully you, the weakest.

170
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,986
Can you forgive them?

171
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,346
No.

172
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:48,346
So put yourself in my shoes.

173
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:51,266
It is only reasonable and fair
that I do not want to see you.

174
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,066
You saw how I, a high goddess,
cultivated myself

175
00:19:56,066 --> 00:20:00,746
for hundreds of millennia
to reach the level that I am at now.

176
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:04,226
How low can my moral character
and comprehension be?

177
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,185
I truly am not
a highly principled high god.

178
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,346
You flatter me.

179
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:14,625
You still don't understand?

180
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,865
Although you did not intend
for it to happen

181
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,865
you caused me to be ridiculed
by the entire world.

182
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:31,986
Mother, why do you say you are
not a highly principled immortal?

183
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:36,586
You're the most highly principled
immortal of heaven and earth.

184
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,026
Did you pop out of the ground?

185
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:42,066
No, I didn't come here using my powers.

186
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:45,826
I walked here with Father
to find you, Mother.

187
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,306
Ye Hua did not know

188
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:05,105
that you are High Goddess Bai Qian
of Qing Qiu.

189
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,905
I am unbiased.

190
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:13,826
I am exactly 90,000 years older
than you, Lord Ye Hua.

191
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:18,346
It would be best for you to call me Aunt
to show your respect.

192
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:25,105
A-Li calls you Mother.
Yet, I am to call you Aunt?

193
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:28,826
Qian Qian, what kind of
reasoning is that?

194
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:34,665
Speaking of reason,
while I was speaking to this lady

195
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:37,026
you two were eavesdropping
for a long time.

196
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:38,746
What is the reasoning for that?

197
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,905
Father and I did not
intentionally eavesdrop.

198
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,586
Father said you were chasing us

199
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,306
so that's why we turned around
and came back.

200
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:54,026
When we came near,
we saw this lady speaking with you

201
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:55,786
and we could only step back.

202
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:59,986
Were you chasing us because
you can't bear to part with me

203
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,009
and want to return to
the Celestial Palace with me and Father?

204
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,506
Can't bear to part with you?
I had just lost my way.

205
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,026
A-Li is right.

206
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:16,425
Your mother indeed
can't bear to part with us.

207
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,586
Mother is the best.

208
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:23,665
Mother, when will we return
to the Celestial Palace?

209
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:25,425
Return to the Celestial Palace?

210
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,346
Let's return tomorrow.

211
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:34,226
This is wonderful! Mother is coming home!

212
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:38,026
You have been gone for so long!
Aren't you excited?

213
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,705
Excited?

214
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:45,546
Mother, since you two
are done talking, let's leave.

215
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,625
Hold on.

216
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,026
I still have something to say
to this lady.

217
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,905
Go back and think about
what you want to ask of me.

218
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:08,066
When you've decided,
come find me in Qing Qiu.

219
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,586
Thank you, Aunt.

220
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:18,625
I want it too.

221
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,546
Why would a young child
want a harmful weapon?

222
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:23,306
Mother.

223
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,185
Be good.

224
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,346
I suddenly remembered I have
some things to take care of.

225
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:46,425
I'll meet you two again
tomorrow. Farewell.

226
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,445
Qian Qian, could it be that you're afraid

227
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,465
that by entering the banquet
with me and my son

228
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:53,105
we will attract gossip?

229
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,905
Lord Ye Hua, you are worrying too much.

230
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:03,665
So you do know you and I
have a marriage arrangement.

231
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:05,705
There's no need to worry about
arousing suspicion.

232
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:06,986
A marriage arrangement?

233
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,945
Speaking of which

234
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,625
when the Heavenly Lord
made the engagement

235
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,000
between me and your second uncle

236
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,905
you had yet to be born.

237
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:22,786
In the blink of an eye,
you've already grown so much.

238
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:25,786
Time truly does not wait for anyone.

239
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:27,465
Farewell.

240
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,226
Fellow immortal, please halt.

241
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,865
Crown Prince, Young Prince.

242
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:40,425
Fellow immortal, may I ask
how I have offended you

243
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,425
for you to go so far
as to take out your anger

244
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:44,569
on my garden on my festive day?

245
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,826
Water King, might you be mistaken?

246
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:51,075
Don't think of denying it.

247
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,298
The coral spirit in my garden
saw it with its own eyes.

248
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:56,185
The strong wind just now was the doing
of an immortal dressed in turquoise.

249
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,266
How can you deny it?

250
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:03,705
<i>I can't make the child take the blame.</i>

251
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,665
Water King, you are right.

252
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:16,066
I had always lived in
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

253
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:20,266
This is my first time venturing out
and I've caused this trouble.

254
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,546
I've spoiled your mood
and disgraced my high god.

255
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:27,546
Please punish me, Water King.

256
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:31,986
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods?
You are from Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods?

257
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,986
Yes.

258
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:37,465
Isn't the high god of
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods...

259
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,826
My high god has indeed

260
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:44,625
not been in contact with
his fellow immortals for many millennia.

261
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,665
I came today at the request of
High Goddess Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

262
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:51,546
That is how I had the fortune
to see this Crystal Palace.

263
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,826
High Goddess Bai Qian?

264
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,465
Did Aunt come with you, Emissary?

265
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:59,385
Aunt did not come.

266
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:03,786
Aunt unfortunately fell ill while
she was visiting the Peach Tree Woods.

267
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:08,786
However, she had received your invitation
and did not want to disappoint you

268
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:12,306
so she sent me to deliver
these congratulatory gifts.

269
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:19,625
This is a gift from my high goddess,
Bai Qian, a luminous pearl.

270
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,786
On the side is the peach blossom wine
that my lord brews himself.

271
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:27,746
I came just to deliver these gifts.

272
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:31,945
However, I did not expect that
I would cause such trouble.

273
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:34,465
Please punish me as you will, Water King.

274
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:35,705
You have journeyed a long way.

275
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:38,026
It is my negligence to have
failed to welcome you.

276
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:39,546
Do not feel guilty any longer.

277
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:42,425
Please follow me inside to
the front hall for food and wine.

278
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:43,826
That is not necessary.

279
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:47,346
After all, my lord does not like me
drawing attention everywhere I go.

280
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:49,625
You are too courteous.

281
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,546
You are most kind, Water King.
I shall take my leave now.

282
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:00,586
It is just a drink of wine.
You need not be so polite, Emissary.

283
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,625
<i>I only told a little lie.</i>

284
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,945
<i>The lie was mostly
to protect his Little Riceball.</i>

285
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:22,026
<i>He could have looked the other way.
Yet, he just has to cross me.</i>

286
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:23,385
<i>How vexing.</i>

287
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:29,145
<i>Su Su, have you truly forgotten me,
or are you acting in front of me?</i>

288
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:40,746
Crown Prince, Emissary,
the Grand Hall is up ahead.

289
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,945
Please come.

290
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:01,185
The Crown Prince has arrived!

291
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:07,066
- Greetings to Crown Prince.
- Greetings to Crown Prince.

292
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:29,145
Your Highness, please take
a seat up there.

293
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,506
Water King, please.

294
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,586
It's her?

295
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:51,546
You recognize this princess?

296
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:55,786
I do, but I am not close with her.

297
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:14,425
Could it be the Crown Prince has
dragged me here to ward off women?

298
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:17,786
Ward off women?

299
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:07,826
Crown Prince.

300
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:12,226
May I be so bold as to ask for a meeting
on behalf of my younger sister?

301
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:15,026
See? The women are coming.

302
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:18,705
Take care of A-Li. I'll be back soon.

303
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:27,705
<i>He won't really drag me
to the Celestial Palace, will he?</i>

304
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:35,266
Mother, where are you going?

305
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:40,865
I am going to look for your father
to return you to him.

306
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:48,385
Do you not trust Father? Are you afraid
he's having a tryst with a beautiful lady

307
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:51,786
so you're using me as an excuse?

308
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:55,066
What goes through
your little mind every day?

309
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:59,905
Your father is so upstanding.
Why would he be having a tryst?

310
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:00,986
Come.

311
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:05,625
It truly is a shame that
we have not seen Aunt today.

312
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,665
Has Aunt not come today
because she knew the Crown Prince

313
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,905
and the Water King of North Sea
would both be here at the banquet

314
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:14,625
and she was afraid the situation
would become too awkward

315
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,609
running into both
former and current fiances?

316
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,586
<i>Awkward? As if!</i>

317
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:27,986
<i>Senior Disciple?</i>

318
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,105
<i>This is not a good time to run into him.</i>

319
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,425
Let's go.

320
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:40,026
It has been a long time, High Immortals.

321
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:42,266
It is a great pleasure
to see the two of you today.

322
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,266
Come inside, please.

323
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,553
Mother, how come your eyes are red?

324
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:57,425
I haven't been to
the Crystal Palace in a long time.

325
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:59,425
I am not accustomed to the dampness.

326
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,369
Let's go find Father.

327
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,546
<i>Lord Ye Hua is having
a secret meeting with a lady.</i>

328
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:07,226
<i>It would be untactful of me
to just barge in.</i>

329
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:09,945
Mother, come quickly.

330
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:18,266
Perhaps your father does not
want to be disturbed.

331
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:21,145
If you don't go to break them up

332
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:24,865
Father will be stolen away
by that Princess Miao Qing.

333
00:33:24,865 --> 00:33:27,865
Look, your father is a healthy young man

334
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:31,185
and Miao Qing seems to be
a lady in bloom.

335
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:35,026
It is quite normal for young men
and women to desire each other.

336
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:40,986
Since they have come together,
why should we break them apart?

337
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,306
Ruining other people's relationships
is not a good deed.

338
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:48,986
What deep grudge do you have against
Miao Qing for you to ruin her happiness?

339
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:52,385
Are you scolding me right now?

340
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,905
All right, all right.

341
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:59,185
Although she saved me once,
I have already properly thanked her.

342
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:03,385
Yet, she thought she would now
be different in Father's eyes

343
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:06,546
and has refused to leave Mount Junji.

344
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,706
She has foolishly stayed by Father.
She is most annoying.

345
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:12,585
Saving your life is a serious matter.

346
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:17,385
How can it be enough for you
to just say your thanks?

347
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:18,786
She does not know her place.

348
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,786
She clearly knows Father
already has a wife

349
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,626
but she still came to bother Father

350
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:25,706
live in Mother's house,
use Mother's cookware

351
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:28,346
and steal Mother's husband.

352
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:32,465
Does Mount Junji of the Far East that
you just mentioned belong to Su Jin?

353
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:37,065
No, no, it isn't Su Jin's.
It is yours, Mother.

354
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:40,626
Father said you were a mortal back then

355
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:44,706
and met him at
Mount Junji of the Far East.

356
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,706
Your mother is a mortal?
She isn't Su Jin?

357
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:53,226
How come you're confused again, Mother?
You gave birth to me.

358
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:58,065
<i>How unexpected that the Crown Prince's
only son was born to a mortal.</i>

359
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:02,025
But you've never met me before.
How come you recognize me as your mother?

360
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:06,146
Father drew two paintings and
hung them in his chambers and in the hut.

361
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,405
They show a woman dressed in turquoise with
a piece of white silk covering her face.

362
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:11,706
You looked like her
in the garden earlier.

363
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:12,905
No wonder.

364
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:19,266
Later on, Father said Mother jumped off
Zhuxian Terrace after giving birth to me

365
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:23,186
and he said Mother went to
the mortal realm and will one day return.

366
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,626
Zhuxian Terrace?

367
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,905
<i>So his mother abandoned him
and jumped off Zhuxian Terrace.</i>

368
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,505
<i>Then in all likelihood,
her corpse can't even be found.</i>

369
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,985
<i>This child is so pitiful.</i>

370
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,826
Mother, you look like you
aren't concerned in the least!

371
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:43,666
Is it because you already love another
and no longer want me and Father?

372
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:49,985
Look here. I am indeed engaged
to your father.

373
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:55,106
But I only met him today.
I really can't say I am concerned.

374
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:58,425
Excuses! Father will marry a stepmother
and Mother will marry a stepfather!

375
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,425
I surely have lived up to my name!

376
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,346
I don't deserve to have
a full happy family!

377
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:03,985
I have to be all alone!

378
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:07,065
Nobody wants me! I'll just be by myself!

379
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,985
All right, all right. Don't cry.

380
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,346
Oh, don't cry.

381
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:20,585
My dear, since I am your mother,
why would I not want you? Huh?

382
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,505
Everything's all right.

383
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,226
Don't cry anymore.

384
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:26,585
But you don't want Father.

385
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:30,146
If you don't want Father,
he will marry Miao Qing.

386
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,306
After Father marries Miao Qing,
he will have another baby

387
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:35,585
and he won't want me anymore.

388
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:38,746
Stop crying.

389
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:42,425
I... I... Since I am your mother

390
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:45,106
why would I not want your father?

391
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:50,385
Your father is my sweetheart,
my darling, my precious honey.

392
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,065
Right?

393
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:53,706
Really?

394
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,065
More real than real gold.

395
00:36:57,065 --> 00:36:59,985
Then come follow me.

396
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:09,905
Mother, it's time for you
to make your appearance.

397
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:15,025
Let me think about
how I'm going to walk in.

398
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:27,865
Greetings, Father.

399
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,865
Riceball.

400
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,465
Sister, you are...

401
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:55,146
This child calls me Mother.

402
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,786
With this scene in front of me

403
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,865
I can't help but be in the mood
to compose a poem.

404
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,025
Don't you agree, Sister?

405
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:21,465
Among the vast sky
and the boundless earth

406
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,945
a branch of a red apricot tree

407
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:25,746
is on the verge of straying past
its bounds. (Have an illicit affair.)

408
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:30,186
Sister, do you find it fitting?

409
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,865
Please do not be angry, Your Highness!
I did not know Your Highness had arrived.

410
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:37,385
I would never dare to be
Your Highness's sister.

411
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,306
I only have respect for His Highness.

412
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:42,186
I do not ask that His Highness
promise me anything.

413
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,786
My brother is marrying me off
to the West Sea.

414
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:49,346
The Second Prince of the West Sea
is a hedonistic man.

415
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:53,865
I truly had no other choice but to dance
to request a meeting with His Highness.

416
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:58,945
I only wish to follow His Highness
for all eternity and serve him as a maid.

417
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:01,945
I wish for nothing more.
Please grant me my wish, Your Highness!

418
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:07,425
Is Die Feng
the Second Prince of the West Sea?

419
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,106
He is.

420
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,065
How is he hedonistic? Tell me.

421
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,266
He...

422
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:25,025
When he was at Kunlun Mountain,
he was indeed a man of honor.

423
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:28,106
But ever since
High God Mo Yuan passed away

424
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:30,985
he returned to the West Sea
and has been in low spirits.

425
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:34,786
He spends his days drinking
and taking pleasure in women.

426
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:36,746
Is that so?

427
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,226
Every word I speak is the truth.

428
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:41,746
<i>I guess the Water King of the Eastern Sea</i>

429
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,764
<i>was eager to have his sister
connected to Ye Hua</i>

430
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:45,186
<i>so he taught her to say this.</i>

431
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:48,065
<i>It looks as if she has
deep feelings for Ye Hua.</i>

432
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:50,646
<i>It wouldn't be in Senior Disciple's favor
to marry her either.</i>

433
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:54,764
Little Riceball.

434
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:59,905
This lady seems to have
genuine affection for your father

435
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,945
as clear as the sun and moon.

436
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,945
I truly cannot bring myself
to tear them apart.

437
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:07,945
I should be going.

438
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,545
Don't leave.

439
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:15,146
You just said Father is your sweetheart,
your darling, your precious honey.

440
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,985
Someone has come to steal Father
and you're just going to let her?

441
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:21,025
Your words are lies!

442
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:26,985
You said...

443
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:33,746
I am your sweetheart,
your darling, your precious...

444
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,905
Your honey?

445
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:52,666
Su Su.

446
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:57,945
Are you pretending to be ignorant
or have you truly forgotten about me?

447
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:00,266
<i>Oh no.</i>

448
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:01,545
<i>Could it be the Crown Prince</i>

449
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,465
<i>cannot stand to hear
sappy words of affection?</i>

450
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,646
<i>Has he confused me for his wife again?</i>

451
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:11,425
You... You clearly already know. You're
still trying to trick me into saying it?

452
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,865
You're terrible.

453
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:30,786
Father, aren't you going
to chase after Mother?

454
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:34,065
No need to. I know where she went.

455
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:37,746
Are we still staying here tonight?

456
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,706
No.

457
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,505
We're going to Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

458
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:45,666
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods?
You're taking me there, Father?

459
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:48,905
There are some things I need
to ask High God Zhe Yan.

460
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:57,347
