1
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,797
Carve your answer to me
into the roof over there.

2
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:12,898
I'm going to kill Huey Laforet.

3
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:15,244
I'm sure that you will find happiness!

4
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,347
All done!

5
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:18,580
We're finished!

6
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:21,640
You know the boss?

7
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,752
Well, that's because
I'm the one who dropped him.

8
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,358
It's becoming as though that dreadful incident

9
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,898
aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i> never happened.

10
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:02,608
Mouths are being kept shut
among a number of the passengers,

11
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:05,002
together with a large sum of hush money.

12
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:14,578
The money appears to be coming
from Senator Beriam and Nebula.

13
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:19,588
So what you're saying is that they helped
to facilitate this incident to some degree?

14
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:22,798
Probably. This is unconfirmed information,

15
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:27,691
but there is word that Senator Beriam
had a meeting with Huey Laforet.

16
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,222
Senator Beriam seems to
have some sort of sense of rivalry

17
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:34,507
toward Huey Laforet.

18
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:38,452
Which is to say, this incident
may have been an experiment.

19
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:41,232
It was an experiment
with quite a few victims, then.

20
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:44,818
What do you think
their objective was, Nicholas-<i>kun</i>?

21
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,713
Search me. Isn't that something
that you two would know better?

22
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,788
Please refrain from being catty, Nicholas-<i>kun.</i>

23
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:58,878
Since you share this secret,
you will also be exposed to danger.

24
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,142
You learned your lesson well
enough over the Vino affair, right?

25
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,062
Nicholas-<i>kun</i>, Elean-<i>kun,</i>

26
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,882
let us dedicate ourselves
to dispassionately carrying out

27
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,997
our duties as information brokers.

28
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:12,928
All you need to do is gather the information.

29
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,155
Rid yourselves of your inquisitiveness
and sense of curiosity.

30
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:16,490
--Yes, sir.
--Yes, sir.

31
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,188
All right then,

32
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:22,496
please continue with the peripheral information
concerning the <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

33
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,166
Right. As for Ladd Russo, of the Russo Family,

34
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,278
he is cooperating well
enough with the investigation,

35
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:33,673
but he insists that all of the killing
he did was done in self-defense.

36
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:39,168
Say, do you know who Huey Laforet is?

37
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah, well, he's well-known, after all.

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,852
What prison is he going to?

39
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,218
Hmm, it hasn't been decided yet,

40
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:53,098
but I'd guess the military prison
at Alcatraz, probably.

41
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,154
Yeah? You don't say...

42
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,326
Thanks.

43
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:06,331
As for the group led by
the delinquent from Chicago, Jacuzzi Splot,

44
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,072
they were introduced to the
Genoard family by the head cook

45
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,242
aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot,</i>
and taken on as their employees.

46
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:16,967
Currently, they are staying
at a cottage on Millionaire Row.

47
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,582
Their leader, Jacuzzi,
was on his way to recovery,

48
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,708
when his injuries were exacerbated in a quarrel

49
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,642
with Graham Specter,
and he is still in the hospital.

50
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,508
What has become of Eve Genoard?

51
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:33,650
Let's ask Sugarcube to report on that.

52
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:44,828
Can't we at least let her see her brother?

53
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:48,358
Since when were you
interested in helping others?

54
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,572
I don't see how it would be
especially detrimental to us.

55
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:54,738
The dissemination of information
is plenty detrimental.

56
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:57,328
If the sister is willing to spend
the rest of her life closed up

57
00:04:57,328 --> 00:05:00,802
with her brother in the research facility,
then that's another matter.

58
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,643
I see. Good work, Sugarcube-<i>kun.</i>

59
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,815
Want one?

60
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,230
No thanks.

61
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:13,940
Want one?

62
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,151
Don't mind if I do.

63
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,202
Help yourself.

64
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,118
Sugarcube-<i>kun</i>, please continue to keep
an eye on the movements of Miss Eve.

65
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:39,257
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,224
By the way, how is Rachel-<i>kun</i>?

67
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:53,758
S-She apparently went to see that boy
who was aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

68
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,552
I see.

69
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,734
Oh, there's also this...

70
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,155
Miss Rachel!

71
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,661
Thank you very much, Miss Rachel!

72
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,498
There's no need, really.

73
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,658
I truly don't know
how I can express my gratitude.

74
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:18,171
No matter how much I thank you,
it wouldn't be enough.

75
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:22,008
Really, don't worry about it, please.

76
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,178
My husband, Manfred.

77
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,224
Go on ahead.

78
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:33,422
Right. Okay then, Rachel-<i>san</i>, take care.

79
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,063
Come along, Mary.

80
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,607
Bye-bye, miss.

81
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,195
Goodbye.

82
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,576
Please accept that.

83
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,792
Hey, you...

84
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,793
I see.

85
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:12,338
It sounds like Rachel-<i>kun</i>
has had an unpleasant time of it.

86
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,758
She can get by without hopping
free rides for a while, right?

87
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:20,066
Nicholas-<i>kun</i>, I told you,
Rachel-<i>kun</i> has her own personal reasons.

88
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:27,518
You remember that Rachel-<i>kun</i>'s
father was a railroad engineer, yes?

89
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:28,366
Yes.

90
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,688
When Rachel-<i>kun</i> was very little,

91
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:33,358
there was a train that was in
an accident, due to a part failure,

92
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,358
and the railroad company
passed the responsibility for it entirely

93
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,448
onto Rachel-<i>kun</i>'s father.

94
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:44,118
Seeing her father not give up
his love for railroads, even in his despair,

95
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:47,412
Rachel-<i>kun</i> must have caught
his bitterness for the railroad company,

96
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:50,498
at the same time as his love for railroads.

97
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:53,628
You mean, she stowed away out of resentment,

98
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,672
and saved the passengers out of love?

99
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,428
That is correct.

100
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,607
This is getting quite complicated.

101
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:05,111
So please, stop teasing her
about riding for free. Understood?

102
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,948
I shall watch myself.

103
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,745
Give me as many tickets as this will buy.

104
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,858
W-Where to?

105
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:21,252
I don't care where.
This is for everything up to now.

106
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,317
Um, why...

107
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:25,952
Don't ask me anything!

108
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,452
But...

109
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:29,135
It would take too long to explain!

110
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,142
Now, concerning what
happened to the all-important Vino...

111
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,338
I-I don't know anything!

112
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,008
But still, Nicholas-<i>kun...</i>

113
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:43,650
I can't take any more of Vino!

114
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,023
Mister, who are you?

115
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:50,573
Who am I? How mean!

116
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,728
Sure, right now, my clothes are changed,

117
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,661
and I'm not covered in blood spatter,

118
00:08:55,328 --> 00:09:00,166
but wouldn't you usually remember
the voice of someone who tried to kill you?

119
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:11,328
Aw, take it easy.
The train arrived safely and all,

120
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:15,128
so I'll let you off, and not keep killing you.

121
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,668
Also, the freeloading woman there,

122
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,645
I understand you went and
bought yourself a ticket afterward.

123
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,565
That was big of you.

124
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:27,277
Then again, it's what
you're ordinarily supposed to do.

125
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,572
Ticket, please.

126
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,582
I told him to take it easy.

127
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,918
You're a conductor?

128
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,368
Whoa, I'm not a conductor anymore.

129
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:51,828
Including everything that goes with it.
Want to get something to eat?

130
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:55,082
See, there's something
I need to discuss with a woman,

131
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:56,431
someone I know.

132
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,435
It's about this lady,
who just might be marrying me.

133
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,232
Well? Are you coming?

134
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,246
Go! Go! Go!

135
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,207
Go! Go!

136
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,738
--Oh, there they go!
--You turned out being the one
most excited about it, didn't you?

137
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:28,713
Maiza-<i>san</i>, don't be so hard on me!

138
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,248
Just a little more...

139
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:36,429
Go, go, go...

140
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,882
Firo, as of today, you are a dominist!

141
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:48,274
A maximum-grade domina!

142
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,319
Dominist!

143
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,324
Sure, whatever. Yahoo!

144
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,448
So there it is. There's a girl that I like.

145
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,578
What do you think is the best way
for me to declare my love for her?

146
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,802
Oh, and it isn't you, so don't worry about that.

147
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,848
Well? How am I supposed to know
if you don't say anything?

148
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,517
Why don't you at least tell me your name?

149
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:29,592
Oh, me? Up until a little while ago,
I went by the name Claire Stanfield.

150
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:32,308
I was just thinking
that I ought to give that up,

151
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:35,432
so I don't have a clear-cut name yet.

152
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:38,908
If I had to say, I guess I'm the Rail Tracer.

153
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:39,993
And you?

154
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,495
I'm Rachel.

155
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,330
Rachel!

156
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:48,738
What do you think, Rachel?
What's the best way to confess love?

157
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:51,658
I'm not exactly a normal girl,

158
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:54,368
so I don't know whether or not
I can offer you any advice.

159
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,509
If that's all, don't worry about it.

160
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:01,681
This girl is even less normal than you are.

161
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,962
The first thing I think you should consider

162
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:06,853
is doing something about your insensitivity.

163
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,802
So then, is this girl
you like an acquaintance of yours?

164
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:17,018
Y-Yeah. I met her for the first time
aboard the train the other day.

165
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:20,366
It was sort of ad hoc at the time,
and we split up.

166
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,869
But she left me a note.

167
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:29,703
Oh. I can't say for sure, but there's
plenty of hope for you, isn't there?

168
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,085
Yeah, well, see,

169
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:37,248
is she trying to kill me, or
does she like me and want to see me again?

170
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,503
That's the part I don't know.

171
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:42,998
Supposing that she is trying to kill me,

172
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:47,685
I don't necessarily think
it would mean that she doesn't love me.

173
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,758
You don't necessarily think?

174
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:55,888
Look, maybe she loves me
so much she wants to kill me,

175
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:59,098
or maybe it's the pattern where
she really does love me, but has to

176
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,908
kill me for the sake of something
even more important, you know?

177
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:08,358
Well, putting that aside, to be honest,

178
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:12,112
I've fallen in love with
girls before, proposed to them,

179
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:15,908
been turned down, and
gone out looking for the next girl,

180
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,748
but seeing the note she left,
and remembering the way

181
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:21,162
she was fighting to the
death with that white suit,

182
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,248
and her expressionless
face, never saying a word,

183
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:26,975
I just keep falling more in love with her,
every time I remember it.

184
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:31,229
Could it be that when I first said
that I would help her, too...

185
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,302
Thinking back on it now,
maybe it wasn't out of sympathy,

186
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,901
but some sort of fateful love at first sight.

187
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:41,114
This is the first time I've been
able to think of you as human.

188
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,492
You didn't think I was human before now?

189
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:48,204
I'm a fine one to talk.
Honestly, I'm a little confused myself.

190
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:51,573
Well, I'm convinced that
I'll definitely be successful.

191
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:55,100
Maybe it will take some time,
but I'm sure it will work out.

192
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,118
If she says that she doesn't
think anything at all of me,

193
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:02,677
I'll make her fall in love with me,
even if it takes years to do it.

194
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,753
Have you been able to locate this girl yet?

195
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:06,514
Yep.

196
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,810
In fact, I already know where she is.

197
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:36,169
Are you Nicholas, the information broker?

198
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,672
Yes, but, um...

199
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,662
I'm the former Claire Stanfield,
the former Vino,

200
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:46,208
the former transcontinental railroad conductor,

201
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,390
call me whatever you like,
but that's who I used to be.

202
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,218
I hear you took advantage of
a delicate young lady,

203
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:57,065
placing her in a very dangerous situation,
didn't you?

204
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,733
You're a bad fellow.

205
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,695
I-I wouldn't... You must be mistaken...

206
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:06,407
You must be punished.
I have much that I'd like to ask you, too.

207
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,158
If you want me to spare your life, then talk!

208
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,368
Where is the woman named Chane,

209
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,883
who was aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>?

210
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:29,597
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!
I'll tell you, just spare me!

211
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,355
In that case, it's pretty certain.

212
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:36,687
Yeah. All that's left is
how I'm going to verify how she feels.

213
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,607
What if you sent her a present with a letter?

214
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,401
I get you. A present, huh?

215
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,865
That bastard...

216
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,148
Go get the boss, right away!

217
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:55,039
I'm going to head over to Jacuzzi ahead of you.

218
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:02,421
Well, she put on the dress I sent her.

219
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,788
Who would have thought
she'd put it on so soon?

220
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:11,097
It makes me, you know, terribly happy.

221
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,128
Who do you suppose that
worker dressed in blue was

222
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:18,062
that came out of the car?
Should I go after them?

223
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:23,985
I could leave Chane alone, and
she'd dispose of that guy, and everything...

224
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:28,739
But should I go after them anyway?

225
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,159
I will!

226
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:58,311
It is impossible for you to beat me,
no matter what you're thinking.

227
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,788
It looks like you weren't lying to me.

228
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,158
Ah, how sad. Let me tell you a very sad story.

229
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:31,708
As loathsome a foe as I have,
right in front of me,

230
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,347
I am unable to engage him anymore.

231
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:38,309
I mean, am I right? You see, this man...

232
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,314
...is going to be killed by
Boss Ladd himself, in due time.

233
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,638
I will happily acknowledge your warning.

234
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,987
It's not a warning. It's a death sentence!

235
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:55,701
Let's go.

236
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,998
I like you.

237
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:05,753
Feel free to use this warehouse
whenever you like. It belongs to me.

238
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,158
Bye, now! I'll see you later!

239
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:12,551
Sometime when that
confounded redhead isn't around.

240
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,673
So, is he a good guy, or a bad guy?

241
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,502
It doesn't matter either way, does it?

242
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:22,258
Everyone here is safe, after all.

243
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:24,689
Then again, who is that man?

244
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:29,603
I don't know for sure, but
maybe we'd better let them be.

245
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:33,906
Besides, Chane seems to be
just a little bit happier.

246
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:53,134
You're just going to leave,
without even saying hello?

247
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,389
Elmer-<i>san...</i>

248
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,267
Hey, Sylvie. It's been a long time.

249
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,508
I'm surprised you recognized me.

250
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:10,138
Sure I did! If I just picture the Sylvie
in my memory grown up a little,

251
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,111
this is exactly how you would look.

252
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,113
When did you drink?

253
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,978
I thought that if I was going to stop time,

254
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:20,328
I might as well wait until
I had refined myself a little.

255
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,330
It was several years afterward.

256
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,751
So this is the twenty-something
version of Sylvie. Quite pretty.

257
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,738
Szilard has been eaten.

258
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:30,796
You knew?

259
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:37,208
That boy... reminded me a little of Gretto.

260
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,513
Sylvie, don't go getting any strange ideas.

261
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,144
Smile! Smile, Sylvie!

262
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,064
It's all right, Elmer-<i>san.</i>

263
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,888
It's true, up until I came here,

264
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:55,029
I wanted to become one with Gretto,

265
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:59,325
but when I saw that boy smiling,
those feelings left me.

266
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:05,664
I thought that maybe Gretto
was happy inside there, too.

267
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,625
Sylvie...

268
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,461
I have to go, okay?

269
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:14,673
After not seeing you for 200 years,
that was a bit brief, wasn't it?

270
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,412
I make my living singing these days.

271
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,679
Wow, that's incredible, huh?

272
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,418
So if you come to one of the clubs,
in one of the burgs around here,

273
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:28,354
I'm sure we'll see each other again.
Goodbye, Elmer-<i>san.</i>

274
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,359
Yeah. See you later, Sylvie.

275
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,413
Yo! Long time no see.

276
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,528
Even in that getup,
I knew right away it was you.

277
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:51,877
That vibe that you give off
is quite singular, after all.

278
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,882
Thanks for keeping your promise
to me from back then.

279
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,386
<i>Almost like an Arabian genie.</i>

280
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:05,850
<i>Yes, but you only get one wish, not three.</i>

281
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:09,445
<i>All right, I've decided, devil.</i>

282
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:14,900
<i>Would you look after Maiza for me?</i>
<i>His brother has died.</i>

283
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,808
<i>It must be an incredible shock to him.</i>
<i>Stay by his side,</i>

284
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:24,978
<i>not as a devil, but as a person,</i>
<i>and help him out with things for me.</i>

285
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:29,915
<i>Until someday, when he can</i>
<i>raise his voice, and laugh heartily.</i>

286
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,948
<i>I'm sure that will make you smile, too.</i>

287
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,198
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>you want to see me smile, too?</i>

288
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:42,288
<i>Of course I do</i>! <i>I'm sure</i>
<i>your smile will give me strength.</i>

289
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:48,017
<i>You astound me. Very well. I will help him.</i>

290
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:53,882
I'd like to see you smiling,
and then be gone from this place,

291
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:57,443
but I still have a whole lot of people
that I have to make smile.

292
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:02,142
I've lived for 200 years now,
but there's probably no meaning to life.

293
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:05,978
So isn't it that much better for everyone
to smile and enjoy themselves,

294
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:09,330
and be freed from their sorrow and hatred?

295
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,336
See you later, devil.
You keep looking after Maiza.

296
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,952
It's not that I was
keeping a promise to you,

297
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,302
so much as I was just deeply curious.

298
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,138
Oh well...

299
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,143
Such an arbitrary fellow.

300
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,485
Mr. Vice President...

301
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,526
What, Carol?

302
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:42,696
Ultimately, where does this story begin,
and when does it end?

303
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,938
That's a foolish question, Carol. By any chance,

304
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:51,622
are you still searching for
the main character to this story?

305
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:52,831
Yes.

306
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,612
Carol, free yourself from such fantasies.

307
00:22:56,612 --> 00:23:01,480
Rid yourself of the illusion that
stories have beginnings and endings.

308
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,788
Stories have no beginnings.
Nor have they endings.

309
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:09,958
All they have are the facts of
life of people making connections,

310
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,553
interacting, influencing
each other, and spreading out.

311
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:17,648
Stories must not have endings, Carol.

312
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,026
Mr. Vice President, this is too hard for me.

313
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,808
Oh, my apologies.

314
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:28,273
But there are some things that
can only be told in a certain way.

315
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,608
Then, Mr. Vice President,
why can't stories have an ending?

316
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,374
Why do you think, Carol?

317
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,328
Because allowing the possibility
for the story to go on is appealing?

318
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:42,742
Three points.

319
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:45,765
That isn't enough points, is it?

320
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:50,248
You could probably provide
countless answers to that question.

321
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:52,918
But suppose I were to give you an answer

322
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,962
that was easy to understand, for your sake.

323
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:56,048
Yes?

324
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,092
Because they are enjoyable.

325
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,428
Because they are enjoyable?

326
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:02,302
That's right, because they are enjoyable.

327
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:06,238
Won't some people be unhappy
with stories not having endings?

328
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,908
That's something else
that makes it enjoyable, Carol.

329
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,662
Carol, don't look away.

330
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:28,817
But Mr. Vice President...

331
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:31,847
Don't you recognize that mouse?

332
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:48,432
How do you think that mouse
has spent its time up to now?

333
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:52,618
And what sort of experiences
do you think it will have from here on?

334
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,788
Visualize, Carol. Imagine.

335
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,488
Mr. Vice President, I'm starting to enjoy this!

336
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,798
And there you have it, Carol.

337
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,523
Say, if it's all right with you,

338
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,274
we can start off as friends.

339
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,277
Would you fall in love with me?

340
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:58,911
Freeze!

341
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,456
Hold it!

342
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,959
Merry Christmas!

343
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:09,868
It's too early!

344
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,466
--Merry Christmas!
--It's a whole month too early!

345
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,848
Going through this much has to wipe out

346
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:33,598
at least 50 robberies' worth, huh?!

347
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,518
Mm-hmm! We've given it out to everyone,

348
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:38,688
and I'm sure that Genoard-<i>san</i>
up in heaven is thrilled, too!

349
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:41,568
Yeah! There won't be
any fighting over the inheritance,

350
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:45,068
and I'll bet Eve and her brother are happy, too!

351
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,750
Everyone is happy!

352
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,738
Now then, where should we run away to, Miria?

353
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,238
Just keep going!

354
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:54,038
Oh, how about we go
dig for gold in California?

355
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,498
Like the gold rush!

356
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:58,832
Let's swipe a great big
chunk of it from the earth!

357
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:01,098
Incredible!!

358
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:19,647
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

359
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:33,911
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

360
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:45,462
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

361
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:52,508
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

362
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:59,598
<i>I believe so</i>

363
00:28:59,598 --> 00:29:06,608
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

364
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:14,118
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

365
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:20,828
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

366
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:30,885
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>
