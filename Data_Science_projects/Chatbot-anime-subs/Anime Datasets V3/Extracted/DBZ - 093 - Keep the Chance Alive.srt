00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,360
"Keep the Chance Alive!! Piccolo's
Suicide Support Strike"

2
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,710
What is it? What is he doing?

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,680
Why is he just standing there like that,
not showing any movement?

4
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:49,050
Grass, trees, and animals of Namek, as well as all
living things in the universe, share your Genki...

5
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,130
just a little bit each is fine... share your
Genki with me, please...

6
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,980
You guys don't know how strong
Son-kun is!

7
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,390
From the time he was little, he endured
ri-igorous training under the Turtle Hermit!

8
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,220
He also won the Tenkaichi
Tournament, and such.

9
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,730
He takes care of the bad guys in the
blink of an eye!

10
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,870
Get it!?

11
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,040
If Son-kun goes all-out, that strange
alien would be finished with one blow!

12
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,710
You're friends with that alien, aren't you?

13
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,460
If you are friends, then it's in that alien's best interest
for you to stop him before Son-kun gets serious!

14
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,830
How about you go persuade him?

15
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,670
Make that clear to him! Make it clear!

16
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,530
l- It's huge! Man, is that huge!

17
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,530
Is it really all that huge?

18
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,340
The one on Earth was about this big.

19
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,050
This one's about fifty meters in diameter!

20
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,890
No matter what he's done, he couldn't have
made that large a Genki Dama with just the
energy of this planet.

21
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,490
Goku must be gathering Ki from planets
all over the place!

22
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,500
Freeza still doesn't seem to have realized it.

23
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,130
Why doesn't he attack with that
ball right now?

24
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,840
Unless he gathers more Ki, he won't be able to defeat Freeza.
That must be what Goku's thinking.

25
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,310
F- Father, hurry! Hurry!

26
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,180
Planets of the universe, lend me your Genki!

27
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,870
What's wrong? You're planning to do
something, aren't you? So do it!

28
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,870
That is unless, are you supposed to be
raising your hands in surrender?

29
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,150
All the time it takes to gather the Ki required is
this technique's greatest weak spot!

30
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,620
Don't let him find out about this for a
little while more, please!

31
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,170
ReaCoom!

32
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,180
Butta!

33
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,860
Jheese!

34
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,190
Ghurd!

35
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,870
Together we are...

36
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,530
The Ginyu Special Corps!

37
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,540
That's it! That's it!

38
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,210
Yeah, no matter how many times we
do it, our Special Fighting Pose is terrific!

39
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,890
It's a small planet, but still quite a nice
place, isn't it? How about we make this
our secret hideout for the time being?

40
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,890
That's a Good Idea,

41
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,130
We, the Ginyu Special Corps, will control
the Next World as well!

42
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,900
These jerks are warped!

43
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,570
These are the guys that were able to toss
even Vegeta around like child's play, the
Ginyu Special Corps!

44
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,910
Vegeta!?

45
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,240
Are you folks colleagues of
Vegeta-chan, then?

46
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,080
Then this won't take long. We are the Ginyu Special Corps,
who collect nebulae for ourselves.

47
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,920
We're not at all like Vegeta!

48
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,930
That's right! If my luck hadn't turned on me, I would
have taken that monkey scum out with one shot!

49
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,930
Well, we don't need to dwell on the past.

50
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,880
In any case, we've come to like this
planet. You're going to let us stay here.

51
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,870
You guys are an annoyance!
You'll have to leave!

52
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,310
Don't you ask such a selfish thing!
You guys get out of here!

53
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,550
Yeah, yeah!

54
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,890
These young men here want to
have a go at us!

55
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:33,390
Interesting! And just as we're here
wanting to get rowdy on someone!

56
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,560
Whoa, before we do,

57
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,730
hasn't the Commander always said that
once we get to a new planet, we
should try out our techniques first?

58
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,900
That there are techniques whose
effectiveness depend on the place?

59
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,900
That's right! Okay then...

60
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,240
Dammit! How dare you destroy someone else's things!

61
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,180
So, now it's my turn.

62
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,210
- Nicely done!
- Ghurd's telekinesis is as good as ever!

63
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,210
Well then, last comes me!

64
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,220
ReaCoom Eraser Gun!!

65
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,830
That he should have that kind of force
on this planet, with its tenfold gravity... !

66
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,180
Looks as though we can use all our
techniques on this planet too!

67
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,180
- What's all this commotion!?
- Kaio-sama!

68
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,220
I will not admit those of you who
disrupt this planet!

69
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,850
I will have you leave immediately.

70
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,190
Huh? Some strange old man has come out!

71
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,300
Old man, does this mean you want
to play around with us?

72
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,540
You guys wouldn't be able to lay one hand on me.

73
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,880
You seem to enjoy your jokes.

74
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,480
Why don't you test me to see if
I'm joking or not?

75
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,820
Okay, then!

76
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,890
Goku's Genki Dama... !

77
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,850
Cut it out already! How long do you
intend to just stand there like that?

78
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,850
Good question. How long indeed?

79
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,020
Damn you!!

80
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,030
H- He's found out!

81
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,870
No! Not yet!

82
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,490
So, what's the matter? You were going
to attack me somehow, right?

83
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,500
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

84
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,870
A little more...

85
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,870
So, what are you going to do?

86
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,490
- G- Goku!
- Father!

87
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,490
Gohan, Kuririn, give over what remaining
Ki you have to me!

88
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,490
Give it to me, now!

89
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,500
Right!

90
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,190
Hey, don't be in such a rush!

91
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,130
Don't toy with me, you monkey scum!

92
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,480
Don't think about anything else!
Concentrate your Ki!

93
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,490
Right!

94
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:15,510
I can't tell what Saiyans are thinking.
It's the same as it was back then.
You're a most unpleasant group.

95
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,190
I have no intention of continuing this
uninteresting battle any further.

96
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,460
I'm going to finish both you and this
planet off at once.

97
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:35,130
Just another runt will have died, and the Saiyans
will be completely eliminated from this world!

98
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,470
The Super Saiyan was nothing more
than a bedtime story after all.

99
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,820
That's not the sun! What is it!?

100
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,660
He found it!

101
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,830
W- What is that!?

102
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,840
It couldn't be... a mass of energy?

103
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,500
Y- You did that!?

104
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,120
All right, that's enough. Save a little Ki
for yourselves.

105
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,450
Looks as if he's finally found it out.

106
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,790
Gohan, Kuririn, you two stay here!
No matter what happens, stay back!

107
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,800
H- He's been forming that up in the sky!?
Where did he find that much remaining power!?

108
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,470
It's no use! Even if I use the Genki Dama now, he will avoid it!

109
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,810
Besides which, that ball still ain't enough to defeat Freeza, dammit!

110
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,480
You were planning to take me by surprise with that?
You're so pathetic!

111
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,820
However, even this desperate measure
has become worthless!

112
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,170
Too bad!

113
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,000
Damn!

114
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,850
Be gone!

115
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,530
- Piccolo!
- Goku, hurry up and complete this Genki Dama of yours!

116
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,530
I owe you one!

117
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,560
Make it fast, Goku! With the power I have,
it was all I could do just to blindside him!

118
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,890
Gotcha!

119
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,840
Are you still lurking about, you miserable Namekian!?

120
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,850
So, let's stop the chatter and blow all these guys away!

121
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,200
Ah, wait! I'm leaving this up to you guys!

122
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,190
Y- You wouldn't!

123
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,550
Our opponents are awfully tough!

124
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,220
Ten-san!

125
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,390
Piccolo accomplishes a flawless support strike.

126
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:27,160
Goku, now is the time! Make that
super-giant Genki Dama full!

127
