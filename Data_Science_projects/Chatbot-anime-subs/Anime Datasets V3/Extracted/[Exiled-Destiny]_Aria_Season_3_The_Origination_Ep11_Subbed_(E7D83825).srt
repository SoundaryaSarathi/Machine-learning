1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,930
Ah... I can't come up with anything good.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,940
What's the matter? It's unusual
to see you lost in thought.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,700
Ah, well, I just...

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,940
Sounds like you're doing well.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,140
Yes! I'm in super-motivated mode right now!
Sounds like you're doing well.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,600
Yes! I'm in super-motivated mode right now!

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,550
Super-motivated?

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,480
Princess Motivated?!

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,850
What's that?
Princess Motivated?!

10
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,970
What's that?

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,960
Little Miss Princess...

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,370
Queen Selfish...

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,300
Little Princess Predictable...

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,000
Princess Not Allowed...

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,130
Crybaby Serenade...

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,050
In her case, it's not just about becoming a Prima.

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,550
This is quite difficult.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,380
Hey, did you hear about Alice Carroll?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,330
Ah, I did!

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,500
Two weeks ago, she was promoted to Prima
even though she was a Pair, right?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,340
No way! That's amazing!

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,470
She's the first one to ever do that!

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,000
And yet, Aika doesn't seem like she's
fazed by it at all, does she?

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,370
Do you think her cheerfulness is just a front?

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,710
Well, Alice is the up-and-coming top Undine
at our rival company, after all.

26
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,380
As Himeya's heir, I'm sure she's
feeling a lot of pressure.

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:00,240
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,520
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,640
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,410
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,950
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,280
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,720
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:50,190
As the days begin to swirl in brilliant colors
Azayaka ni mawaridashita hibi

35
00:02:51,630 --> 00:03:00,280
Always and forever, they're filled with love
Itsumo itsudemo ai ga michiteita

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,180
Surely, it's a spiral
Kitto supiraare

37
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:14,160
The days passed by, each one filled with warmth
Atataka na mainichi o kasanetara

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:23,200
And before I knew it, off in the distance...
Itsunomanika tooku ni

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,160
...there you were
Kiteita no ne

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,470
Those Ever-Changing Days...

41
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,250
Please take my hand.

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,680
Ah, thank you.

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,740
Please be careful.

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,520
There we go.

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,760
Of all the many water guide companies,
thank you for choosing Himeya today.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
It was a lot of fun.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,530
Yeah. Gondolas are the best!
It was a lot of fun.

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,570
Yeah. Gondolas are the best!

49
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,230
Thank you very much!

50
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,070
From the bottom of my heart, I hope that
your vacation will be a memorable one.

51
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,640
I hope you become a Prima soon!

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,280
We'll be rooting for you.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,710
Thank you very much! I'll do my best!

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Both Himeya and I look forward to
seeing you again during your next visit!

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,050
Now then...

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,330
Wha-?!

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,230
Is something wrong, Akira?

58
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,860
Ah, no...

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,310
By any chance, did I give them
wrong information during the tour?

60
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,100
Ah, no...

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,880
Then, was I going over
the speed limit somewhere?

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,970
Ah, no...

63
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,790
Aika!

64
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,810
Yes?!
Aika!

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,320
Flap
Flap
Flap

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,450
Umm...

67
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,370
After this, all I have left today is a night cruise.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,270
Yeah, that's right. And I'll be joining you
as your assistant, remember?

69
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,330
All right.

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,680
I found a really good gelato shop
the other day. Let's go there.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,410
Huh? Okay...

72
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,880
Here's your limone.

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,370
Thank you!

74
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,090
It looks delicious!

75
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,620
Aren't you going to have one, Akira?

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,730
Huh? No, I'm fine.

77
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,590
But you're the one who
asked me to come with you.

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,830
It's fine. Be thankful and just eat it.

79
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,830
Okay, snack time!

80
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,440
Yum!

81
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,590
It really is delicious.

82
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,080
You should have gotten one too, Akira.

83
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,950
You seem pretty cheerful.

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,530
Yes! I'm super-cheerful!

85
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,230
Oh, that's right!

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,400
You heard about it too, right?

87
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,200
About Junior skipping a rank
and getting promoted to Prima.

88
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,040
I got to see the very moment
it happened, together with Akari.

89
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,280
I was really lucky!

90
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,250
You were there, too?

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,780
Yes! In fact, we had front row seats.

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,160
One of her gloves was removed,
and then off came her other glove.

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,270
I can't tell you how surprised I was!
As expected of Alice!

94
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,530
Girl geniuses sure do things differently.

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,930
I've got a lot of catching up to do!

96
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,310
Aika...

97
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,940
To tomorrow and beyond! Let's go!

98
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,160
It's all right.

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,210
It's all right, Aika.

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
It's not all right!

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,190
Akira!

102
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,370
I, Aika S. Granzchesta
of Himeya, am all fired up!

103
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,610
You know that feeling you get when someone's
running just a bit ahead of you, pulling you along?

104
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,810
It's like that!

105
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,610
It's how you feel when you know
you're running faster than usual.

106
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,780
This is my chance to excel
further as an Undine, Akira!

107
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm grateful to Junior...

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,720
...for letting me experience
what I'm feeling right now.

109
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,570
So please train me hard, okay, Akira?

110
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,900
Right now, I'll be able to handle
even the harshest criticisms!

111
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,460
I see.

112
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,260
Sorry about that.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,270
Aika, do you have anything planned
for next month's holiday?

114
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,560
I'm completely free that day,
so I'm going shopping with Al.

115
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,440
I see.

116
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,600
All right, cancel it.

117
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,140
That's the only day I have off.
You'll be spending the entire day with me.

118
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,310
T-That's too cruel...

119
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,020
What happened to that spirit
you had a moment ago?

120
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,320
Here.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,140
"Little Princess Predictable."

122
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,970
What is this?

123
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,980
"Queen Selfish."

124
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,610
"Little Miss Princess."

125
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,600
"Crybaby Serenade."

126
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,210
"Rosen..."

127
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,920
Is this?

128
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,760
Which one do you like?

129
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,380
I figured I should get your opinion, as well.

130
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,430
Akira...

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,060
I won't forgive you if you fail.

132
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,330
My future Queen.

133
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,430
Right!

134
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,580
But really, you shouldn't have
crumpled up this paper.

135
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,670
Enough! Be quiet!

136
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,540
Everything is for the sake
of my beloved Rosen Queen.

137
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,670
Orange Princess!

138
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,530
Orange Princess!

139
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,510
Orange Princess?

140
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,620
Orange Princess!

141
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,890
Alice Carroll!

142
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes?

143
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,200
Please get used to being called by your alias.

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
Your customers are waiting for you.

145
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,690
I'm sorry!

146
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,410
Since I became a Prima,
every day has been frantic.

147
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,040
The days go by like a hectic whirlwind.

148
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:31,240
If I have time to think, I just start to worry,
so I suppose it's better this way.

149
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Please take my hand.

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,120
Thank you.

151
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,650
This is the Bridge of Sighs.

152
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,450
It looks as though it's made of stone,
but surprisingly, the inside is made of wood.

153
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,020
Oh.

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,090
Let's go see it later.

155
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,420
Yes, we should.

156
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,830
If you prefer, I can put in a tour reservation
for you. Would you like me to do that?

157
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, that'd be helpful.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,040
Could you do that for us, please?

159
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,660
I'd be happy to.

160
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,600
It's Akari and Aika.

161
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,640
They're practicing hard together.

162
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,240
Since the moon-gazing party, it's been...

163
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,250
Excuse me...

164
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,490
Yes?

165
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,260
What's the name of that
island over there, Miss Undine?

166
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,200
That's San Giorgio Maggiore.

167
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,470
If you climb the bell tower there,
you can see a sweeping view of the coastline.

168
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,340
In that case, why don't we go there
after we visit the Bridge of Sighs?

169
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,740
Yes!

170
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,140
Until recently, we used to
spend every day together, too.

171
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,980
I haven't been able to see them
for quite a while now.

172
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,080
Good work.

173
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,190
Good work to you, too.

174
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,160
It's that late already?

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,260
It's always like this, lately.

176
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,840
I shouldn't go see them
unannounced. I'll call first.

177
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,150
I'm sure it'd be a bother if I said
I wanted to come visit this late at night.

178
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,210
Besides, I don't have a reason.

179
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,890
I don't have an excuse.

180
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,540
Athena, you're going to be late.

181
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,510
Eh? Ah, okay...

182
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,800
Off I go.

183
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,050
See you later.

184
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,530
Anything would be fine. Do I not have any?

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,940
Any excuse...

186
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,310
This building, which is currently being restored,
was built in the seventeenth century.

187
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,510
It's the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute.

188
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,830
Marco Polo was a famous Venetian merchant
and author, and this is a replica of his home.

189
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:07,460
Currently, it's open to the public as a memorial hall,
so perhaps you'd like to visit if you're in the area?

190
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:18,340
The Palazzo Pisani Moretta is famous for its
masquerade ball, and its beautiful Gothic interior.

191
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,160
Ah.

192
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,490
My.

193
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,600
Yummy!

194
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,540
Here we go!

195
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,070
Campanile!
Campanile!

196
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,720
That was fun!

197
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,150
Yeah, it was fun!
That was fun!

198
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,250
Yeah, it was fun!

199
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,520
Yeah, it was fun!
I never knew gondola rides were so comfortable!

200
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,890
I never knew gondola rides were so comfortable!

201
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,430
Next time we come to Aqua, we'll be
sure to ride with you again, Alice.

202
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,190
Thank you very much!

203
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,530
See you then.

204
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,730
Goodbye.

205
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,060
Bye-bye!

206
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,540
Thank you again.

207
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,550
It's for you!

208
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,030
Thank you.

209
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,430
Bye!

210
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,840
How'd it go?

211
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,740
What did she say?

212
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,110
She said, "Thank you!"

213
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,240
I see, that's great.

214
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,260
Yeah!

215
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,510
Hey, what should we do for dinner?

216
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,950
Hmm... What do you want to eat?

217
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,470
Umm...

218
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,680
Something yummy!

219
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Oh! I wasn't expecting that!

220
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,220
Good work.

221
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,650
Thank you for the towel.

222
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,520
Sure, just leave it here when you come back.

223
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,170
Every day is hectic.

224
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,750
But there are a lot of fun things, too.

225
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,950
I have so many things I want to tell them.

226
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,190
All I want is to see them.

227
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,760
But it's so hard.

228
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,290
Will I ever be able to see them again?

229
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,270
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap

230
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,870
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap-slap, slap-slap!

231
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,710
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap
What a really ominous thing to say!

232
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,180
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap
And after all those times Aika told me
"No negative thinking allowed!"

233
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,310
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap
Slap-slap.

234
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,580
Slap-slap.

235
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,100
Slap
Slap...

236
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,650
I'm so lonely...

237
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,880
Yes?

238
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,620
I just got back.

239
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,930
No fading out allowed!

240
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,840
What are you doing here at this time of night?

241
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,970
What's with that tone of yours?

242
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,270
After we came all this way to see you, too.

243
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,800
You know that pizza shop we always go to?

244
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,050
This is their newest pizza!

245
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,290
I heard it's really delicious,
so I thought we should all try it together.

246
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,260
Come on, let's eat while it's still hot.

247
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,720
Okay, let's eat!

248
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,870
Ah! I'm so hungry!

249
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,100
Me too!

250
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,670
You just ate all those bananas.
You're really a glutton.

251
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,570
Wha-?!

252
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,880
The usual three...

253
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,850
The usual conversations...

254
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,590
The usual times...

255
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,140
The usual atmosphere...

256
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,330
Just a few moments ago, I was fretting about
what I would do if I never saw them again, too.

257
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,700
That even if I want to see them,
I don't have the time or an excuse to do so.

258
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,990
Just when I was thinking all that...

259
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,910
There you go again! You were worried about
something like that? That's a bad habit, Junior.

260
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,240
Eh?! Was I thinking out loud?

261
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,270
Yeah, you were.

262
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,910
If you don't have the time, you just
make it, like we're doing now.

263
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,270
But...

264
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,720
But... I don't have an excuse...

265
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,800
I haven't been able to do much of anything lately.

266
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,630
I don't have an excuse like this pizza to see you.

267
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,230
I don't have anything...

268
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,410
You do, though.

269
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,180
You're the excuse, Alice.

270
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,660
We don't need an excuse or
a special reason to see you.

271
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,090
You're reason enough.

272
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,260
Hey! No sappy lines allowed!

273
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,290
Huh?

274
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm going to do my best
to catch up to you, Junior.

275
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,430
Me, too.

276
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,140
With these friends, I'll really be just fine!

277
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,290
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

278
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,920
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

279
00:22:49,760 --> 00:23:00,870
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

280
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:09,680
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

281
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:23,230
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

282
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:32,230
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

283
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:45,550
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

284
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,060
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

285
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,120
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

286
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,530
And my day begins
Hajimaru
