" Pond of Blood"

2
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,116
You are one incredible bastard
to try to take the fruit of the <i>Enseiju</i>,

3
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,380
the Tree of Circular Life <i>oni</i>!

4
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:37,062
You mean I can't eat those?

5
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,397
Of course not <i>oni</i>.

6
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:44,425
Those are precious fruit that only
the Great King Yama-<i>sama</i> may eat <i>oni</i>.

7
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:48,006
I'm just so hungry, you see...

8
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,008
You're hungry?

9
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,536
You say the most ridiculous
things <i>oni</i>. Who are you <i>oni</i>?

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,046
What have you come here for <i>oni</i>?

11
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:05,456
I'm Goku. Son Goku. I came here to train.
Which one of you is Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

12
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,361
Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

13
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,696
Then you guys ain't Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

14
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,826
Of course not <i>oni</i>. Where do
you think you are <i>oni</i>?

15
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:23,041
This is the third street of
the first district of Hell <i>oni</i>.

16
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,839
We are the watch-keeper
ogres of this area <i>oni</i>.

17
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:32,377
This is Hell!? Then I've fallen
down from the Serpentine Road!

18
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:47,666
Damn it, man, how am I supposed to climb
up this thing, for crying out loud?

19
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,932
Hey, Tenshinhan!
Don't you leave me behind!

20
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:12,924
<i>Goku, I will travel the</i>
<i>same road that you have!</i>

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,257
<i>But I will become even stronger,</i>
<i>just you watch!</i>

22
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:21,366
Ten-<i>san</i>, how do you suppose
Kami-<i>sama</i> will train us?

23
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:26,471
I don't know. But this
is Kami-<i>sama</i>, after all.

24
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:30,375
It will probably be something
we couldn't even imagine.

25
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,469
Chaozu, no matter what the training is,
don't become disheartened!

26
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,778
Mm-hmm!

27
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,989
This sure is one hard-up house...

28
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,001
What are you doing?

29
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,839
Oh, you know. If there was an
airplane capsule or something in here,

30
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,363
I was going to borrow it.

31
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:08,346
There is nothing like that in there.
You should leave here at once.

32
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,348
You <i>do</i> have money in here.

33
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,475
If I do not have it, it's not in there.

34
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,688
Just do as I tell you
and give me an airplane!

35
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:19,023
What is the matter, Noble Father!?

36
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:19,921
Upa!

37
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,362
It's nothing, Upa.

38
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,364
What are you doing to Noble Father!?

39
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,025
Don't come any closer!

40
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,199
Why, you-!

41
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:48,975
Huh?

42
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,511
We can kill some time
with him for a while <i>oni</i>!

43
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,348
It's been 1500 years since we had
a flesh-and-blood dead person here <i>oni</i>!

44
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,683
He seems to be pretty lively, too.

45
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:21,345
It's been so long since we had
someone to make us move about <i>oni</i>.

46
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:26,691
You can't <i>oni</i>! You've got a mountain
of paperwork stacked up <i>oni</i>!

47
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:30,092
It doesn't matter <i>oni</i>! We have
equal responsibility for that <i>oni</i>!

48
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:35,366
--Then it's no use <i>oni</i>!
--You wanna go at it?

49
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,035
--Rock, scissors, paper!
--Rock, scissors, paper!

50
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,593
Look that way now!

51
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,374
Work hard, now <i>oni</i>!

52
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:46,104
Be sure to leave some for me <i>oni</i>!

53
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,109
First come, first served <i>oni</i>!

54
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:57,322
Maybe this is impossible after all...

55
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,658
What are you doing <i>oni</i>?

56
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,228
You can tell just by watching, can't you?

57
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,890
I want to hurry and get back
to the Serpentine Road.

58
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,524
You want to get back
that badly, do you <i>oni</i>?

59
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,340
What are you doing!?

60
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,207
I'll send you back <i>oni</i>!

61
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:21,676
" River Sanzu Branch Office"

62
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:30,021
Oh? That Gozu bastard is finishing
everything so easily again <i>oni</i>! I knew it!

63
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,216
What a simple-minded, foolish ogre <i>oni</i>!

64
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,665
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

65
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,712
That guy!

66
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,653
Pops, you ain't got any power, huh?
I didn't even make it there!

67
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,988
What!?

68
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm the second strongest ogre next to
Great King Yama-<i>sama</i> in all of Hell <i>oni</i>!

69
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,129
I heard that Great King Yama
was incredibly strong,

70
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,063
but maybe he's not all that great.

71
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,001
You want to try taking me on then <i>oni</i>!?

72
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,004
I ain't got that kind of spare time.

73
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,172
If you can beat me in a contest,

74
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,008
I'll give you a chance to get back
to the Serpentine Road <i>oni</i>!

75
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,010
It's the jump device
we keep just in case <i>oni</i>.

76
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,345
Really?

77
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,714
We don't lie <i>oni</i>.

78
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,351
If we lie, then we get our tongues
pulled out by Great King Yama-<i>sama oni</i>.

79
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,019
I'll do it! I'm going to do it!

80
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,690
In exchange, if you lose,
you forfeit your soul <i>oni</i>.

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,359
You won't be able to keep your body
while you're dead <i>oni</i>!

82
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,919
That's fine. I'm going to win, after all.

83
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,315
If you go outside of this line,
you lose <i>oni</i>. You got that?

84
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:07,011
Whatever is fine,
let's just do this quickly!

85
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,879
You're one bothersome guy, huh <i>oni</i>?

86
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:17,553
It takes some preparation...
to get ready for this <i>oni</i>...

87
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:22,333
All right, let's go <i>oni</i>!

88
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,334
You got it!

89
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,670
Take your marks...

90
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,535
...begin <i>oni</i>!

91
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,681
You're better than I thought, Pops.

92
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,376
Wha- <i>oni</i>?

93
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:44,022
U- unbelievable power <i>oni</i>!

94
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,990
Here I go, Pops!

95
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,904
Yow!

96
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,314
This is the jump device, is it?

97
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:14,719
That's right <i>oni</i>! I'm going to jump up
as hard as I can and land up here,

98
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,988
and when I do, you jump <i>oni</i>.

99
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,388
Fine, just hurry up and do it.

100
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:26,425
All right, here goes!

101
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,329
It's working, it's working!

102
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,111
A little farther...

103
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:50,780
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

104
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,017
<i>...Ha!!</i>

105
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,183
That did it!

106
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,604
What's with those clouds?
They're terribly hard!

107
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,726
" To the summit. Please do not litter."

108
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:33,931
" To the summit. Please do not litter."
Number 34,265...

109
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,236
number 34,266...

110
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,937
" The Original Needle Bean Jam Buns"
number 34,267...

111
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:43,407
number 34,267...

112
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:48,412
number 34,268...

113
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,575
number 34,269...

114
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:56,020
No one is absent, then.

115
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,222
Today, as I'm sure everyone
is looking forward to,

116
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,024
we will be having an outing
on the Mountain of Needles <i>oni</i>.

117
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,584
Stay sharp as you ascend
and come back down <i>oni</i>.

118
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,327
Hurry up and get going <i>oni</i>.
Come on, come on, step on it-

119
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:17,197
Geez, is he still playing all by
himself <i>oni</i>? That's not fair <i>oni</i>!

120
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,721
How long are you going to
keep goofing around <i>oni</i>?

121
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,724
It's my turn now <i>oni</i>.

122
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:36,694
It's no use. No matter
how many times I try,

123
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,062
I can't break through those clouds.

124
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:41,399
Your head is just too soft <i>oni</i>.

125
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,402
But then, has there ever been
anyone who has broken through there?

126
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,070
Not yet <i>oni</i>.

127
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,005
What? Have you tricked me!?

128
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,007
Hey, you!

129
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:53,244
So, in a nutshell, you just want to return
to the Serpentine Road, is that right <i>oni</i>?

130
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:55,680
If so, there's a very
good way to do so <i>oni</i>.

131
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,015
Really? Tell me!

132
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:00,685
There's a secret path that
nobody else knows about <i>oni</i>.

133
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:03,354
Mezu, you can't show him that <i>oni</i>!

134
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,879
Tell me about it! I'm begging you!

135
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,029
There is one condition <i>oni</i>.

136
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,189
Condition?

137
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,037
I'm going to start running
around through Hell here <i>oni</i>.

138
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,073
If you are good enough
to be able to catch me,

139
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:25,710
I'll tell you where
the secret path is <i>oni</i>.

140
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,712
I'm supposed to chase you?

141
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:33,150
That's right <i>oni</i>! In this game, you really
will have to run like the devil <i>oni</i>!

142
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,496
Over here, over here!

143
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,378
I think this should be enough for today.

144
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,254
Over here, over here!

145
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,811
Hurry, hurry!

146
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,481
Over here, over here!

147
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,663
Are you ready <i>oni</i>?

148
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,332
Any time is fine by me.

149
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:59,670
I'll just warn you that they say my speed
is second only to Great King Yama-<i>sama oni</i>.

150
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,339
If you lose...

151
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,933
I know! Come on, let's hurry and do this.

152
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:12,138
All right then,
let's begin <i>oni</i>. Ready!

153
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,690
He is fast!

154
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:37,003
Wait up! Wait up, wait up!

155
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:43,609
Now he'll just run around
until he's all worn out <i>oni</i>.

156
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:50,146
What a waste. And flesh-and-blood
dead people are so rare...

157
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:57,995
You're pretty fast, aren't you <i>oni</i>?

158
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,330
Yeah, I suppose so.

159
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,855
If you weren't, then this
wouldn't be any fun <i>oni</i>!

160
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:21,310
I was so close! And he even
dropped his guard, too!

161
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,158
That's awesome!
All right, then!

162
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,704
No matter how tough he may be,
he can't come all the way up here <i>oni</i>.

163
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,809
W- what <i>oni</i>!?

164
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,013
Hold it!

165
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,136
Hold it!

166
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:29,520
This is fun <i>oni</i>! How about
you live here with us <i>oni</i>?

167
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,023
If you do that, we can
play tag every day <i>oni</i>!

168
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:36,322
You're right! But I can't...
let that happen!

169
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:43,033
What's the matter <i>oni</i>? You'll never get
to where Kaio-<i>sama</i> is like this <i>oni</i>!

170
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,127
Damn, I was so close, too.

171
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,978
He's something else <i>oni</i>.

172
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:57,709
Hold on a minute, would you?
I'm all tired out!

173
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,817
You're just a wuss <i>oni</i>...

174
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:08,254
Say, let me eat some
of the fruit on that tree.

175
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:13,497
No way <i>oni</i>! If you eat one
of those precious fruits,

176
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,766
they say that you will avoid
hunger for a hundred days,

177
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,996
and your power will be bolstered <i>oni</i>.

178
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,338
They're that valuable, are they?

179
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,498
That's right.

180
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:28,012
Hey, you! Hold it!
If one of those gets eaten,

181
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,173
I'll get chewed out by
Great King Yama-<i>sama oni</i>!

182
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:36,020
Come on! Come on, come on!
Hold it <i>oni</i>! Come on! Come on!

183
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,649
Before you know it, the game
of chase got switched around <i>oni</i>.

184
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:45,029
Here goes! Gotcha! I did it!

185
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,964
You idiot <i>oni</i>!

186
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,633
Okay, you promised.
Show me the way out.

187
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:54,638
I was off my guard <i>oni</i>.
L- let's do it again <i>oni</i>?

188
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,707
Are you thinking of
breaking your promise?

189
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,971
Great King Yama will
yank your tongue out!

190
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,905
It's over there <i>oni</i>!

191
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,996
If you climb the stairs inside here,

192
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,333
you'll return to the Serpentine Road <i>oni</i>.

193
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,334
See you later, then!

194
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,669
Get out of here now <i>oni</i>!

195
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,694
Sorry about this,
but I took one of them.

196
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,869
Because of you, I'm famished!

197
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,682
See you!

198
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,685
You dumb bastard <i>oni</i>!

199
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,688
Don't come here again <i>oni</i>!

200
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,357
He's gone <i>oni</i>.

201
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,626
There's absolutely nothing
to be done about him <i>oni</i>.

202
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,628
Eh, oh well <i>oni</i>.

203
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,963
That was fun <i>oni</i>...

204
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:56,967
Okay then, to work, to work! There's
a mountain of paperwork piled up <i>oni</i>.

205
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,197
Let's go at it as best we can <i>oni</i>.

206
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,540
These stairs sure are long!

207
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,504
Is that the exit?

208
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:25,655
Huh? It won't move.
All right, then!

209
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,362
I made it!

210
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:34,202
What are you doing in there?

211
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:38,676
G- Great King Yama-<i>sama</i>!?

212
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:42,346
Did you see Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

213
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:46,684
Um, by any chance,
is this-? Goodbye!

214
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,353
W- what's with him?

215
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:52,623
What's this!? I have to start
at the beginning again!?

216
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,692
You've got to be kidding!

217
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:57,160
I really have to hurry now,
or I ain't going to have enough time!

218
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,931
That's strange. It's a lot
easier to run now than before.

219
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,796
I wonder if that's because of that fruit.

220
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:08,839
<i>Goku has unexpectedly returned</i>
<i>to the starting point.</i>

221
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,376
<i>The road to Kaio-sama's place</i>
<i>is incredibly long.</i>

222
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:18,906
<i>Hurry, Goku! The Saiyans are</i>
<i>getting closer every minute!</i>

223
