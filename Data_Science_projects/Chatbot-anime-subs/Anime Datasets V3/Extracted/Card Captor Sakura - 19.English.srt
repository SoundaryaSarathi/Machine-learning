1
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:08,933
We went on a camping trip to the sea.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,737
I swam a lot and it was very fun.

3
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:21,481
At night we did kimodameshi in the cave.

4
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:28,816
Are you writing a diary?

5
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:29,746
Yeah.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,550
Let me see.

7
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:33,559
So this is when you went to the sea?

8
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,685
I wanted to go too.

9
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:40,656
What is this? July ,today is…

10
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:42,828
July?

11
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:44,795
Today is August, isn’t it?

12
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:46,165
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:48,868
You are writing about
previous months now?

14
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:49,901
Yeah.

15
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:53,605
Isn’t a diary something
that you write in every day?

16
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,880
I was busy with other things.

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,175
I finished my free research.

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,050
So then your homework is finished?

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,053
It isn’t finished?

20
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:04,817
Still a bit left.

21
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,419
What is left?

22
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:12,294
Umm… the math drills,
picture diary,

23
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,835
construction project,
and the book report.

24
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:17,392
You have that much left?

25
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,905
We have too much homework.

26
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,374
Hey, hey…

27
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:24,535
But I wrote this much in thirty minutes.

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,488
You don’t have the weather written.

29
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:43,897
That’s fine, it is all written
in old newspapers.

30
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,430
Hmm, you seem experienced.

31
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,232
Sorta.

32
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,633
Is that something to be proud of?

33
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:58,042
[Sakura and the summer vacation homework]

34
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,637
We’re now visiting Mt. Kumaya.

35
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:05,377
Hello sir, as we speak of Kumaya,
their specialty of sweet 
bean jelly comes to mind.

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,053
This looks very good.

37
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:12,725
All right, now I just have
the weather left to do.

38
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,226
Newspaper. Newspaper.

39
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,359
Eh!

40
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,971
Dad, do you know where
the old newspapers are?

41
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,036
I got rid of them this morning.

42
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,705
What should I do?

43
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:37,213
What did you want to see?

44
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,183
The weather over summer vacation.

45
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:42,554
Will this do?

46
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,886
Eh?

47
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:48,722
I need it for my research.
I have couple months worth.

48
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:49,857
Here.

49
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,790
I don’t have the pressure readings,
so I wonder if it will do?

50
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:56,969
Yeah! Thanks Dad.

51
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:08,046
August 30th, clear.

52
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,016
Next is the math drills.

53
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,853
Huh? Where are my drills?

54
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:20,188
What?

55
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,858
Fourth graders are doing
such easy problems?

56
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,522
They are pretty hard.

57
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,327
Well then I can do them for you.

58
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:29,494
Eh?

59
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:31,627
Well, if my conditions are met.

60
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,869
What? What?

61
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,868
Sweet bean jelly from Kumaya he says.

62
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:41,537
Kero-chan really does like sweets.

63
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,513
It’s not my fault if he gets fat.

64
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:44,407
What are you doing?

65
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:47,984
Yukito-san!

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,852
The annual summer
tradition of our house.

67
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,360
Tradition?

68
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,828
She always is running
around on the 31st

69
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,734
because she hasn’t finished
her summer homework.

70
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:02,798
Big brother!

71
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:04,762
Is this a construction project?

72
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:08,502
Yes.

73
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,035
Last year was a paper made
savings box wasn’t it?

74
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:13,943
In the shape of a penguin.

75
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:17,945
But unusable.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,909
Why couldn’t you use it?

77
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,652
There was no place to put in the money.

78
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,529
What is it this year?

79
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:36,391
A bird house, right?

80
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,598
Yes.

81
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:38,801
I bet this time
there is no entrance.

82
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:43,810
There is none!

83
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:45,770
You really forgot it?

84
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,740
I’m not good at these sort of things.

85
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,080
Shall I do it for you?

86
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:52,076
What?

87
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,518
Five of my chores.

88
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:00,717
Did you finish the homework?

89
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,627
Not quite yet.

90
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,552
I haven’t yet either.

91
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:06,595
You haven’t.

92
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,661
Yes, I have the math drills left,
what about you?

93
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,100
I haven’t decided on a
book for the book report.

94
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,699
Then do you want to go
to the library together?

95
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:16,903
Sure.

96
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,474
Well then, let’s meet at the bridge
in the penguin park.

97
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:25,575
OK.

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,652
Tomoyo-chan!

99
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:38,092
Let’s go.

100
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,290
The pool is closing today.

101
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,495
Summer is just about over.

102
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,404
Do you want to go play now?

103
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:50,637
No!

104
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,675
Tomoyo-chan, let’s hurry.

105
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,694
There are so many.

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,328
It wasn’t only our class
that had a lot of homework.

107
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,101
How about over here?

108
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,984
Forget it.

109
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,492
Today is an unlucky day.

110
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,293
But this is the only place open.

111
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:43,023
In this morning’s fortune it said that

112
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,364
dealing with females will bring chaos.

113
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:48,234
Chaos?

114
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:07,747
Done.

115
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:08,883
I am finished too.

116
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,523
I did half

117
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:12,756
of Sakura’s drills.

118
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:13,951
Thank you.

119
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:15,859
Which means the bean jam.

120
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,521
I’ll buy it tomorrow.

121
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:19,426
Shall we check our answers
off each other?

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,489
Yeah.

123
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:25,964
There is no need to check
the first half that I did.

124
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:27,634
It is perfect.

125
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,302
The answer to the first question is…

126
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:32,769
One thousand yen
Three hundred fifty yen.

127
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,178
Tomoyo, you can’t get

128
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,509
such an easy question wrong.

129
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:42,913
Let’s see, you purchase
5 pencils at 70 yen,

130
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,253
this is 350 yen isn’t it?

131
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,625
That’s why you pay 1000 yen
and get change.

132
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,957
I don’t know.

133
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,065
How ya doin? I like modayaki.

134
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,666
What is this?

135
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,001
What’s wrong?

136
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:00,831
No bean jam.

137
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,003
Why?!

138
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,138
The appointed book

139
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:10,141
The thinnest book of the ones we could
read was Little Pig Story, right?

140
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:12,879
Did you also read Little Pig Story?

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,720
No, I chose a different book.

142
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,154
Was it interesting?

143
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:18,520
Yes, very much.

144
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:22,119
Maybe I will do that one.
What was the title?

145
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:28,759
This one.

146
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:30,633
T… This one?

147
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,073
I guess I will read the
Little Pig after all.

148
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:46,344
Eh?

149
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,688
Oh, four copies are taken out right now.

150
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:56,920
Eh!

151
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,297
But there is one copy left.

152
00:08:58,765 --> 00:08:59,288
Where is it?

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,958
It should be in the building.

154
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,727
There wasn’t any copy on the shelf.

155
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,835
In order to read it in the building
it doesn’t have to go past here.

156
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,102
So somebody in here is reading it?

157
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:14,309
Either that or somebody put
it back in the wrong place.

158
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:15,875
Let’s go look for it.

159
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:17,111
Yeah.

160
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,716
I bet it is delicious.
That bean jam.

161
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:31,924
That reporter on TV
really seemed to enjoy it.

162
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,258
Geeze, Sakura didn’t
have to get that angry.

163
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:52,774
What is it brat?

164
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,846
Don’t you understand this character?

165
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:58,250
The kanji are used differently
in Hong Kong and Japan.

166
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:35,492
Don’t get in the way.

167
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,463
I was heading this way too.

168
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:39,656
It is distracting.

169
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,795
Doesn’t it just mean you don’t have
enough power of concentration?

170
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,128
What an irritable guy.

171
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:46,397
Well you are studying,

172
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:48,104
so I will let you off for today.

173
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,774
Huh? I am sure I left it here.

174
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:12,989
Little Pig… Little Pig…

175
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,568
Sakura, what are you looking for?

176
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,196
Above you. Above.

177
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,938
I can’t find the book for the homework.

178
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,172
What is it called?

179
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,273
Little Pig Story.

180
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,407
Little Pig…

181
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:29,577
Ah, the brat had that one.

182
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,177
Li-kun did?

183
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,169
It was there.

184
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:07,985
Huh?

185
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,922
Where did he go?

186
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:33,467
Let me see that for a moment.

187
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:35,943
Did you find it?

188
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,283
I was told Li-kun has it.

189
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,916
Oh? I found it once.

190
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:43,650
Eh? I wonder if there are two.

191
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,024
It is strange.

192
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,960
Hey, don’t cry.

193
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,335
There it is.

194
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:06,804
Kero-chan.

195
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:08,845
It’s a Clow Card.

196
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:11,413
It is still close by.

197
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:14,380
This is…

198
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,223
Again.

199
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:26,797
There it is.

200
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:32,600
Is something wrong?

201
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:33,595
No.

202
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,367
In a place like this?

203
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:23,747
Li-kun!

204
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,036
Li-kun.

205
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,515
We are probably facing the Move card.

206
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,846
Move?

207
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:58,780
A card that exists to move things.

208
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,657
Sounds like a convenient card.

209
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,622
It is totally useless.

210
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,795
It can’t move very far.

211
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,663
It can’t move living things
or large things.

212
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:10,429
It really just likes pranks.

213
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,435
What a troublesome card.

214
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,870
If you don’t hurry and seal it,

215
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,242
then it will move again for fun.

216
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,577
Then I won’t be able to write
my book report either.

217
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:21,811
But I wonder where it went.

218
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:23,808
Ah!

219
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:24,976
Did you find it?

220
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,216
No, it’s just…

221
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:27,444
Just?

222
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,650
Just what?

223
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:31,290
I should have brought my video camera.

224
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:34,991
There it is.

225
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,893
Just a little bit further.

226
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,389
You can’t chase it with your eyes.

227
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:12,923
Chase the aura.

228
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,026
Eh?

229
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,232
Read the next place it will appear.

230
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,863
I can’t do that.

231
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:18,826
Sakura,

232
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,399
aren’t you able to sense
the card’s aura now?

233
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:22,499
But…

234
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:24,002
You can do it. Concentrate.

235
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,636
Good luck, Sakura-chan.

236
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,036
OK.

237
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,500
My first date with you…

238
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,837
Wait!

239
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,254
I love you…

240
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,034
Return to your rightful form,

241
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,733
Clow Card!

242
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,451
All right, now I can do my homework.

243
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,770
So this was what the fortune was about?

244
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:48,310
You’ll catch a cold like this.

245
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,585
Do you want to go to my place to change?

246
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:50,480
Eh?

247
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,151
The chaos has already happened.

248
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,583
You need this book too, right?

249
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,992
I am almost done reading it.

250
00:18:59,131 --> 00:18:59,995
Thank you.

251
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:22,250
Delicious.

252
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:23,622
Thank you.

253
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:28,052
Is it just you and Li-kun living here?

254
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:29,555
Yes,

255
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,420
his mother has entrusted
Shao Ran-sama to me.

256
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,196
His mother?

257
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,598
His father passed away
while he was young.

258
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,205
The rest of his family is in Hong Kong.

259
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:42,898
I see.

260
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:49,676
I finished reading it.

261
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:53,649
Thank you.

262
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,579
It seems you will be able
to finish your homework.

263
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,284
That T-shirt…

264
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,158
Wei lent it to me.

265
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,757
It is a cute T-shirt.

266
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,664
Did you buy it yourself?

267
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,327
No, that is…

268
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,121
Ni hao!

269
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:41,191
Shao Ran, I missed you!

270
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:45,460
Mei-Lin. Hey, Mei-Lin.

271
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,666
Why are you here?

272
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,073
Oh, a guest?

273
00:20:58,284 --> 00:21:01,014
Isn’t this the T-shirt
I gave to Shao Ran?

274
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,119
Why are you wearing it?

275
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,088
This is, umm…

276
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:08,723
What is the meaning of this?

277
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:10,955
Why is another girl wearing it?

278
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,130
You’re wrong, this is…

279
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,091
Shao Ran, you’re terrible!

280
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:17,334
I said listen!

281
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,236
I can’t stand it! Just
when I am gone for a bit.

282
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:21,403
I wonder who she is.

283
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,638
I don’t know.

284
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:27,869
Listen to the reason, Mei-Lin!
