The Final Feather:
"The Sekirei of Fate"
Musubi-chan! Musubi-chan! Musubi-chan!

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,430
Musubi-chan! Musubi-chan! Musubi-chan!

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,760
Musubi-chan...

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Musubi-chan, wake-up.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,250
Wake-up, Musubi-chan! Musubi-chan!

26
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,770
The last remaining Sekirei can stay
with its most beloved person forever.

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,780
Until that day, I will never lose.

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,800
Musubi-chan...

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,120
Uh, hey...

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,450
You'd better just give up already.

31
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,790
The Sekirei Symbol's gone, you know?

32
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,130
Sahashi!

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,460
Is this the time to be
worrying about others?

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,220
Run, Kuno!

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,470
Haruka-sama!

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,800
The Sekirei Plan?

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,860
You can't just say something like
that out of the blue and expect me to...

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,810
A girl is crying and asking a favor,

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,820
so if I refuse,
that'll make me less of a man...

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
All right.

41
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,490
I'll become your Ashikabi.

42
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,320
Haruka-sama! Haruka-sama!

43
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,160
Haruka-sama...

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Shit!

45
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,230
I'll use my incantation.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,800
Haruka-sama, I love you.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,340
Song of my pact,
illuminate my Ashikabi's path!

48
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,200
What... is this voice?

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,870
I'm losing my strength...

50
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,630
A song?

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,880
What a beautiful voice...

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,880
But this... really saps my strength...

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Now you see it! This is Kuno's final weapon:

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,550
The Song of Mellow-Mellow!

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,890
Please don't give it a wacky title, Haruka-sama!

56
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,890
Ah... this comfortable
feeling of powerlessness...

57
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,900
I don't care about discipline or whatever...

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Don't fall asleep!

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,230
Hey, Haihane!

60
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,030
Damn! I can't keep my strength.
What's with this song?

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,140
Crap!

62
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,580
Kuno! Hey, Kuno!

63
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,590
Haruka-sama... I was useful...

64
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,930
No, you're incompetent after all.

65
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,930
But you are the best incompetent for me.

66
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,930
Haruka-sama, that's not even real Japanese.

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,270
You're so stupid!
Now there's no point to what you did.

68
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,610
That's not true.

69
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,610
She... tried to protect him with all her might.

70
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,280
Do you understand the present situation?

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,610
A mere monkey like you...

72
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,920
...couldn't defy us in a million years!

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,300
Ye Sekireis who are like MBI's wild dogs...

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,640
Ye shall be the ones punished!

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Tsukiumi... you came here for us!

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,870
Is she one of them?

77
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,650
Musubi!

78
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,240
Musubi-chan's Sekirei Symbol is...

79
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,330
Musubi, our shopping race...
I shan't forgive thee winning and leaving...

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,990
Rise! Rise now, Musubi!

81
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,660
Who the hell are you? You're annoying,
popping up out of nowhere like that.

82
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,000
How darest thee...

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,300
How darest thee do this to my friend!

84
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,340
Number 09, Tsukiumi! Here I come!

85
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,680
Crap! She's a single number!

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,370
Water Arrows!

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
Blue!

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Bitch!

89
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,020
Tsukiumi!

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,690
You don't think you
can defeat two of us, do you?

91
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,030
Next time I'll hurt more than your clothes.

92
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,370
Thou art a claw user, huh?

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,370
The soul sword given to me
by the Landlady... my Water Blade...

94
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,360
I shall not hesitate to use it!

95
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,250
The Discipline Squad is out there...
the situation is dire for them.

96
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,050
I'm going.

97
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,390
It's even better
to watch in the arena, isn't it?

98
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,060
See ya!

99
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,690
Minato Sahashi...

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,400
Forgive me, Musubi.

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,600
If only I hadn't lost out
to my worthless pride...

102
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,740
Forgive me!

103
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,580
Gotcha!

104
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,790
What's... this?

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,430
That Ashikabi... he even
scored a high-level Sekirei like this?

106
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,100
In the end, I can't do anything...

107
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,440
All I did was mix up everyone in a battle...

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Sahashi!

109
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,110
You seem like you'll be an obstacle
for Natsuo someday if I leave you alive.

110
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,120
Minato!

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Your opponent is... me!

112
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,380
Get away from Minato!

113
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,220
Tsukiumi!

114
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,140
I shall... never let thee touch Minato!

115
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,810
This is it, number 09.

116
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,570
Bad news!

117
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,480
Big Sis?!

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,820
Not yet.

119
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
But at this rate, everyone will!

120
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I haven't been shown, yet.

121
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,160
What's this?

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,720
No doubt about it.
The only one who can do this is Ku.

123
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,840
Soon I won't be able to stop the satellites...

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Let's contact Mina-tan.

125
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,410
What?

126
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,570
I feel it.

127
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,840
Mina-tan...

128
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,020
Reunite with her in the underworld.

129
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,030
No.

130
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,860
Huh?

131
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,390
No!

132
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,210
Something's going wrong
with Mina-tan and the others!

133
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,880
Kusano-tan, anything wrong?

134
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,210
No...

135
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,010
We'll hurry to the railway bridge.

136
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,880
Ku!

137
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,880
Ku!

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,820
Who are you?!

139
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,230
Hey, what are you touching, bastard!

140
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,900
You're reacting so passionately,
and yet you leave him un-emerged?

141
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,060
Huh?

142
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,250
The one who chased Shiina before...

143
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,080
Why don't you be mine?

144
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,920
What's this?

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,930
This can't be happening!

146
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,600
A-A monkey... hit me...

147
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,270
Benitsubasa, you're so lame.

148
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,890
Bastard!

149
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,270
Sahashi, you idiot, run!

150
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,610
Minato, what art thou doing?!

151
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,610
I won't run away.

152
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,280
Musubi-chan, Tsukiumi...

153
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,950
I can't run away and leave
people who are precious to me behind!

154
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,950
Minato...

155
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,290
Oh, yeah?

156
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,290
Then die now!

157
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,290
Sahashi!

158
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,090
Minato!

159
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,430
It's love.

160
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,650
Musubi-chan?

161
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,800
Just now... I heard a voice!

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
A voice?

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,670
Mutsu!

164
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,670
I'm sorry but... you've gotta go.

165
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,010
Watch out!

166
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,010
Yukari-san.

167
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,680
Shiina?

168
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,580
I love you.

169
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,170
Me, too...

170
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,690
You know, this is my first kiss...

171
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,030
Hey, Mutsu! He's emerging!

172
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,370
Corpse of my pact, decay my Ashikabi's cross!

173
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,370
It's coming!

174
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,860
The World's End Garden!

175
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
What a terrible day!

176
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,670
Akitsu!

177
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,060
Wh-What... is this?

178
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,720
Love...

179
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,390
Please teach love to the little birds.

180
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,490
That is your...

181
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,890
Wait...

182
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,740
W-Why?

183
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,680
She stood up...

184
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,750
Mu-Musubi-chan?

185
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,090
It's love!

186
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,760
If you stand in the way of love,

187
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,660
I, number 08, Sekirei of Fate,
Yume will be your opponent!

188
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,430
Who?

189
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,440
You been hit too much and gone mad?

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Silence!

191
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,780
Since when have the
Discipline Squad sunk to bullying the weak?

192
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,780
As your senior, I must discipline you!

193
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,120
You're pissing me off!
You don't make any sense!

194
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,310
Haihane!

195
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,970
What the?

196
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,440
Mu-chan!

197
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,140
What was that laser beam?

198
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,820
What? What's with this?!

199
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Who are you?

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,500
MBI affiliate, protector of the S Plan,
Chief of the Discipline Squad,

201
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,840
Sekirei of Fate, number 08, Yume!

202
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,170
The... S Plan?

203
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,170
That's the old name for the Sekirei Plan.

204
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,840
Matsu-san!

205
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,180
Ku-chan, too!

206
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,140
Chief? The head of the
Discipline Squad is Karasuba!

207
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,190
You don't seem to have enough love yet.

208
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,780
You still have lots to learn as
members of the Discipline Squad!

209
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,560
Try again!

210
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,870
She threw them?!

211
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,870
She effortlessly threw away the
opponents that gave us such a hard time...

212
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,600
That was over so fast...

213
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Ah... there is plenty of love here...

214
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,550
The strong, selfless care for each other...

215
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,890
The warm care for friends and masters...

216
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,560
And...

217
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,230
Your feelings for Musubi...
that very warm heart...

218
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,570
That heart of yours woke me up.

219
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,570
How dare thee take
advantage of this confusion!

220
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,910
Get away, Minato! I said, get away!

221
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,580
It's pouring into me... your very kind heart...

222
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,920
Musubi tied the knot with a good person.

223
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
How shameless! That's enough!

224
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,110
Tsukiumi-tan! Down, girl! Down!

225
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,590
That is...

226
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,260
The Black... Sekirei!

227
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,590
You appeared, as I thought you would.

228
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,270
You look fine, Karasuba.

229
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:49,210
I'm really... really glad
to be able to see you again.

230
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Yume!

231
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Karasuba, I am not the one you should fight.

232
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,290
The one who will stand
in your way someday is...

233
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,160
Definitely...

234
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,640
Huh? Karasuba-sama?

235
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:22,700
Um... all I remember is I was downed by the
people from the Discipline Squad and then...

236
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,320
If you've been downed by
Benitsubasa, you still need to train more.

237
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,650
Everybody is really strong!

238
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,660
Musubi-chan... Is that you, Musubi-chan?

239
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,390
Minato-san!

240
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,920
Musubi-chan!

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,330
Mi-Minato-san?

242
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,340
The Black Sekirei!

243
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,670
If thou tryest to stop us as well...

244
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,110
Isn't there something you
need to worry about more than me?

245
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
What is that sound?

246
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,770
The satellites have resumed operation!

247
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,030
Minato! Musubi! Hurry up and run away!

248
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,190
Yes!

249
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,160
Shigi-kun!

250
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,410
What?

251
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,720
Shigi-kun!

252
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,120
Kuno-san!

253
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,060
C-Clothes wrapped around us...

254
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,400
Then, suddenly the wind blew, and we're here.

255
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Wind?

256
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,890
Clothes?

257
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Yukari-san.

258
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,080
We'll be together from now on.

259
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes. Many years to come...

260
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,760
Plants grew like crazy all of the sudden...

261
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,590
...then died all at once?

262
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,430
Sahashi, aren't you coming with us?

263
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,440
I... feel like I still have
something I have to do here.

264
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Something to do?

265
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,770
Love...

266
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,780
Please teach love to the little birds.

267
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,110
I don't know what it is, yet.

268
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,450
But I think there's something only I can do.

269
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,450
I see.

270
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,450
Let's go, Kuno.

271
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,450
Yes!

272
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,460
Sahashi, do your best!

273
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,130
See you again!

274
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,290
I'll work harder, so someday...

275
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:59,030
Yes, somewhere, let's meet again!

276
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,470
A young couple running
toward the morning sun...

277
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,480
How romantic!

278
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,150
I guess.

279
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,350
It's still not enough to
forget about my old passion,

280
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,840
but now I've seen the
man you are, Minato-kun!

281
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,590
Get strong quickly, Musubi...

282
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,170
We saw them off safely.

283
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,840
Shall we go home before MBI shows up?

284
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,180
Kusano-tan, time to withdraw.

285
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,510
Everyone, I'm sorry.

286
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,850
I underestimated things...
I couldn't do anything. I only relied on you...

287
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,860
In the end, I put you all in such danger.

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,190
Minato-san.

289
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,190
Because of you, we can all do our very best.

290
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,530
As long as you are you, it's enough.

291
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,870
Musubi-chan...

292
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,540
How shall I put this... Musubi is...

293
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,870
...always stealing the best part of the show.

294
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,880
Mm-hmm!

295
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,210
Whoa! Wait! This isn't the place!

296
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm telling you, we have to get out of here!

297
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,570
Hey! Are you guys listening?!

298
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,690
MBI officially announced that the
large-scale growth of giant vegetation

299
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,020
MBI officially announced that the
large-scale growth of giant vegetation
"Giant plants appeared in the capital.
Gone in one night."

300
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,560
And the mysterious collapse of the
rail bridge before dawn the other day
"Giant plants appeared in the capital.
Gone in one night."

301
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,060
Were completely unrelated...
"Giant plants appeared in the capital.
Gone in one night."

302
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,560
Were completely unrelated...

303
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,220
Shii-chan...

304
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,560
We're sorry! We're sorry!
We're very sorry he always does this!

305
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,520
It's okay, even though this
is the third consecutive day...

306
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,910
Taking care of a recuperating
husband is the real wife's job!

307
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,580
I am his real wife, too!

308
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,250
Hey, little brat!

309
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,910
An epic battle for Mina-tan!

310
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,930
And for now,
the curtain closes on this story...

311
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,260
However...

312
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,930
Number 88 was reactivated?
That can't happen!

313
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,370
This requires a detailed investigation.

314
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,940
I can't believe he emerged
right before my eyes!

315
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,940
I wonder if there are some
new Sekireis left around.

316
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,280
Don't be so greedy.

317
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,750
How many do you think you have at home?

318
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,950
Ouch! I will never forgive
that huge-boobed woman!

319
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,290
Unforgivably huge breasts...
Even in a padded bra, you're only a B cup.

320
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,290
So what?!

321
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,430
Natsuo hates big breasts anyway.

322
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,630
You look cheerful these days.

323
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,300
You can tell?

324
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,970
Did something good happen to you?

325
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,310
Well... I'm looking forward to what is coming.

326
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,310
It's been so noisy lately, and...

327
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,980
She assisted number 95's escape?

328
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,190
Yes, this is an obvious act
of betrayal against you, Higa-sama.

329
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,280
No, she still has her uses.

330
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,990
Too strong...

331
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,650
Who are you guys?!

332
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,330
Hey, you?

333
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,670
What?

334
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,230
Do you know where the number 108 Sekirei is?

335
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,770
Shit!

336
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Both of our bodies are honest, huh?

337
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
What are you talking about?

338
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,020
See you later!

339
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,690
Must thou go to this "prep school"
even though thou art so injured?

340
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,860
Yeah, I've played hooky so much lately.

341
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,690
Have a nice day, Minato-san!

342
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,360
Have a nice day!

343
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,370
Sending a husband off is the real
wife's duty, as I've said a thousand times!

344
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,970
I'm his real wife, too!

345
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,540
- Both of ye, stay out of this!
- I'm begging you, don't fight...

346
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:03,570
When we Sekireis meet our destined partners,
we react whether we like it or not, you know?

347
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,270
Damn!

348
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
That's right! The story is not over.

349
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,060
No, the story weaved by
the little birds begins now!

350
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,430
Ladies and gentlemen, wait and see!
