00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,010
Wait! Please just listen to me for now.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,600
Not on your life!

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,510
Ku-chan!

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,380
No! Don't bully my big brother!

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,810
Wait, Ku-chan!

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,290
I must make her our companion at any cost.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,590
That's why...

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,200
That's why I must do it.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,670
What is this little girl?

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,040
No, it can't be...

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,380
You got your claws into such a little child?!

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,370
Claws?!

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,180
Filthy! Thou art a filthy man!

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,880
Water Celebration!

35
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,490
I didn't use even one-hundredth
of my power for the last attack.

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,360
What does such a weak
monkey want to say to me?

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,500
I want you to be my... my Sekirei.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,440
W-What?

39
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,510
Didst thou just tell me to be thy Sekirei?

40
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,850
That's right!
L... we need your power.

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,850
How couldst thou be
so shameless in public?!

42
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,850
Shameless?

43
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,390
I thought to spare thy life but...

44
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,200
I shall obliterate thee after all!

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,890
That's bad! She's dead serious!

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,540
Big brother!

47
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,750
I was so angry, I missed my aim.

48
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,420
I'll eliminate thee next time!

49
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,290
Even so, I can't move
until you listen to me!

50
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,350
Why?
Why does my chest feel like this?

51
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,940
Wait! Your opponents are us, right?!

52
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,600
Haven't learned your lesson yet?

53
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,580
A Sekirei not yet emerged
doesn't know anything!

54
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,130
Seo!

55
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,080
This man! Is he an Ashikabi, too?!

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,250
Geez, guess I've got no choice.

57
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,260
Hey! Close your eyes, kid!

58
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,930
This is a little too stimulating for ya.

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,930
Enough! Just do it!

60
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,420
Wh-What art thou going to do?

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,470
"Don't look!"

62
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,670
"Don't look!"
Don't look, Ku-chan!

63
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,110
Don't look, Ku-chan!

64
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,300
Wh-Wh-What are ye doing?!

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,300
This is how...

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,040
...Sekireis fight.

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,980
Thunderstorm of our pact,
destroy our Ashikabi's misfortune!

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,670
This is an incantation only
emerged Sekireis can use...

69
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,470
That is...

70
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,420
The special words to chant
when we use major power...

71
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,050
Every Sekirei has his or her own incantation.

72
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,890
The incantation...

73
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,230
"God's Song"
- God's Song!
- God's Song!

74
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,490
- God's Song!
- God's Song!

75
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,930
Watch out!

76
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,470
High energy reaction!

77
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,000
"Musubi-tan"
High energy reaction!

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,710
"Musubi-tan"
They are in big trouble!

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,910
"Musubi-tan"
Hello? Musubi-tan?

80
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,130
Hello? Musubi-tan?

81
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,410
Thunder?

82
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,950
"Incoming > > > > > Matsu"

83
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,950
"Incoming > > > > > Matsu"
Matsu-san!

84
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,610
Matsu-san!

85
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,350
Go to the place on the map I'll send you.

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,720
Mina-tan might be in danger!

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
He's in our way!

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,520
Thou!

89
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,870
We can't have him as
collateral damage, you know?

90
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
A-Are you okay?

91
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,910
This man protected me with his own body...

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,720
We won't miss next time.

93
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
Is that the best thou canst do?

94
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,730
It escaped.

95
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,560
Hey, stop there!

96
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,410
Seo-san, please calm down!

97
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,270
Don't come any closer!

98
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,410
How will you pay me back, huh?

99
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,420
Why?! My strength is...

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,690
You stomped over my girls too, didn't you?

101
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,420
I can't work up an ounce of strength... Why?

102
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,030
My ability as Ashikabi is endorsed by Takehito.

103
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,030
It's a bit special.

104
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,760
Now, how will you pay for this?

105
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:25,070
Well, how about I force you to emerge
and make you into my dedicated slave?

106
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,780
No, this is not the man.

107
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,780
I don't want it.
The one... the one I want is...

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,750
S-Seo-san!

109
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,660
Could you please... let her go?

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:51,930
She is... she is my Sekirei!

111
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,200
Seo!

112
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,150
Are you cheating on us in front of our eyes?

113
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,150
Quite the nerve!

114
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,480
T-Time out!

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,820
You told us we were the only
Sekireis for you, didn't you?

116
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,810
I haven't done anything, yet!
Listen to me first!

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,500
Thou...

118
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,510
...calledest me "my Sekirei."

119
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,840
Thou must take the responsibility.

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,580
R-Responsibility?

121
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,180
Don't play dumb!
Thou hast said I was thy Sekirei, correct?!

122
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,680
Y-Yes, I did, Ma'am!

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,120
Not only wert thou not afraid of me, but
thou also protected me with thy own flesh.

124
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,830
Furthermore, thou savedest
me from the wicked Ashikabi.

125
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,790
Wicked?

126
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,000
For a monkey, thou art a man of mettle.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,970
Strange...

128
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,240
My heart, which once clamored so
loudly in protest, is surprisingly calm now.

129
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,140
What is thy name?

130
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,410
Minato.

131
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm Minato Sahashi.

132
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,880
Minato...

133
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,550
I-I don't know
anything about you, but...

134
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,550
The reason I met you
in my dream must be...

135
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,890
because we could definitely
grow to understand each other!

136
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,450
So!

137
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Thou art a magical man...

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,400
Very well! I, the Sekirei Tsukiumi, accept
thy marriage proposal with good grace!

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,970
M-Marriage proposal?

140
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,910
Thou hast said I'm thy Sekirei!

141
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,580
I did, I did! I'm sorry!

142
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Minato!

143
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
Yes?

144
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,510
From now on, the only one
allowed to kill thee is me, Tsukiumi.

145
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,100
Wh-What is this?
The feeling welling up from my heart...

146
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,230
Something warm and strong...

147
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,230
So this is... emergence...

148
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,910
Tsu-Tsukiumi-san!

149
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,250
"Tsukiumi" is fine.
Thou hast become my Ashikabi...

150
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,790
with this as a wedding ceremony.

151
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,030
Many... years to come...

152
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,630
We... just wasted a fight?

153
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,030
Seems like it.

154
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,270
Ku-chan!

155
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,300
As I thought...
that little child is thy Sekirei...

156
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,640
Well, she's a mere child
so I can tolerate it, but...

157
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,380
- the real wife is me...
- Minato-san!

158
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,940
Are you all right?

159
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Musubi-chan!

160
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,410
Oh, good! You weren't in danger.

161
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,490
Yes. See, she's Tsukiumi-san.
She's joined our group.

162
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,660
Minato... thou... thou...
How many Sekireis dost thee have?

163
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,600
Um... you are...

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,000
"Calling Minato-tan"
Um... you are...

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,530
"Calling Minato-tan"
Mina-tan! Mina-tan!

166
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:09,660
Mina-tan! Mina-tan!

167
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,340
What happened?! I can't identify
the situation. All I can see are trees!

168
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,740
...the fourth.

169
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,010
Wa...

170
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,680
Wa?

171
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,610
Water Celebration!

172
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,690
Everyone's so late...

173
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,230
It'll be dinner time soon.

174
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,490
When you're like that,
you look like their mother, Miya.

175
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,370
Did you say... mother?

176
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,730
No! Big sister! You look like a big sister!

177
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,910
I guess you're right.

178
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,380
From their point of view,
I am really kind of their big sister...

179
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
We're back!

180
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,370
Ah, they're back.

181
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,020
Oh dear!

182
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,720
We've just come back.

183
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,360
Landlady, we've just come back!

184
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Minato, who is this woman?

185
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,400
She's Miya Asama. She's the landlady here...

186
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,340
Sahashi-san... who is she?

187
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,140
Ah, eh, um...

188
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,410
I'm his wife!

189
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,740
W-Wife?!

190
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,410
What art thou so surprised at?

191
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,950
We have gotten married,
so I've become thy wife.

192
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,280
Wife...

193
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,380
Wh-What was that?
Such tangled-up feelings in my heart...

194
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,190
What's with this little brat?!
Get away from him!

195
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,260
Musubi-chan, what's wrong?

196
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,060
I am...

197
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,770
His wife, too!

198
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,640
Out of my way! The real wife is me!

199
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,040
This is a soap opera. Soap opera world!

200
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,150
Don't you need to join them?

201
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,850
Even though I'm not participating
in the soap opera there, I attack...

202
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,120
no, attract Mina-tan in my own way.

203
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,320
What a lame joke...

204
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,460
To think he made Tsukiumi,
who hated Ashikabi so much, emerge...

205
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,800
Minato Sahashi... he's a mysterious man.

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Now we shall fight!

207
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,970
That's what I want!

208
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,410
Enough!

209
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,810
I won't allow any violence
here in Maison Izumo.

210
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,480
She is... good!

211
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,310
I'm sorry, Landlady.

212
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,820
How about you?

213
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,490
They say when in Rome, do as the
Romans do. I shall obey the landlady here...

214
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,330
Landlady... ah, this is...

215
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,560
The Sekirei Plan.

216
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,830
H-How did you?

217
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,540
I already told you. My husband
worked in the MBI's research section.

218
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,240
Then, when Ku-chan came...

219
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,510
Yes, I could guess the situation...

220
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,850
You are his Sekirei, right?

221
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,040
Welcome to Maison Izumo.

222
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm his wife, Tsukiumi.
Pleased to meet thee, Landlady.

223
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,510
I'm his wife, too!

224
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,130
Thou... couldst thou be?

225
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Hmm, who art thee, again?

226
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,840
I feel as if I'm well acquainted
with one looking like thee, but...

227
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,220
Maybe it's just a chance resemblance.

228
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,050
I'm Kagari.
I look forward to getting to know you.

229
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,890
I just took off my mask.

230
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,430
Should I feel relieved or pathetic?

231
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,230
Kagari-tan.

232
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,230
What?

233
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,910
How are the burns from the other day?
You should stabilize your ability soon.

234
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,910
Are you telling me I should get emerged?

235
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,050
Yes. Even without the
burns, your body is still...

236
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,580
What a thing to say to
a defective being like me.

237
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,250
I won't be chosen by anybody,
nor will I choose anybody.

238
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,590
I only have one wish...

239
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,020
To kill that man with my own hands.

240
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,390
Kagari-tan!

241
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,420
I'm going out to work,
so please tell Miya I don't need dinner.

242
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,570
Kagari-tan...

243
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,950
I-I wanna take a peek... No!

244
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,120
In the end I let him stay last night,
but I can't believe I'm alone with a boy...

245
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,620
I'm sure... I'm your Sekirei.

246
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,960
Please give me your... seal.

247
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,890
Hold it!
What do you mean, seal?!

248
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,330
The symbol to prove that I am yours.

249
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,230
Wait a sec! I can't understand
what you're talking about at all!

250
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,880
So, what's a "Sekirei"?

251
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,980
The Sekirei Plan...

252
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,990
That's the name of the game
unfolding here in the capital.

253
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,120
Game?

254
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,960
And we Sekireis were released

255
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,990
in order to meet our individual
Ashikabi-sama, our masters.

256
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,660
Normally I could never
believe something like that,

257
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,000
but he doesn't look like he was lying...

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,610
I'm number 107, Shiina,
and probably your Sekirei.

259
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,670
Probably?

260
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,610
I said probably because I haven't
confirmed my body's reaction.

261
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,650
And to confirm,
I must have mucosal contact, so...

262
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,220
Mucosal... like a kiss?

263
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,690
If you wish, I can do more!

264
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,490
I...

265
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,830
"More"...

266
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,370
Thank you for the bath.

267
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,040
Is anything wrong?

268
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,280
No, nothing.

269
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,380
I could never tell Mom or Bro about this...

270
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,150
Hey, how about going
out shopping tomorrow?

271
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,690
There aren't any boys' clothes here,
and you need to change, don't you?

272
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,390
But what if someone
chases me like yesterday?

273
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,330
No problem. I thought of a plan.

274
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,740
What?!
Didst thou say she's also Minato's Sekirei?!

275
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,340
Yes... I'm sorry.

276
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,410
That's how it is.
Nice to meet you, Tsukiumi-tan.

277
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,010
Stop that "tan" thing!

278
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,750
Whoa! You've got another one, again!

279
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,790
Minato! Don't tell me she is also...

281
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,190
No, no! She's definitely not!

282
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,690
My Ashikabi's not here.

283
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,500
That's good. I'm Tsukiumi.
Pleased to meet thee.

284
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm Uzume.
You've got a lot of competition. Good luck!

285
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,110
Uzume-san! Stop adding
more fuel to the flame!

286
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,780
Ha! They aren't even worthy
to be called my competition.

287
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,340
Because... I am Minato's real wife.

288
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,320
I am his real wife, too!

289
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,790
Dost thou understand what "real wife" means?

290
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,780
No, I don't.

291
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Here, Minato-san. Open your mouth wide.

292
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,900
Minato, I'm sure thou understandest

293
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,930
that if thou shouldst eat that,
thy life would be forfeit.

294
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Ah... thank you,
but I can eat by myself...

295
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,480
Here!

296
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
You're only a child!

297
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,450
This place has become quite lively.

298
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,820
Yes, it'll be more fun.

299
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,500
That Minato...
I told him I would wash his back, but...

300
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,660
He refrained.

301
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,830
Sharing bath and berth are
the privileges of Ashikabis.

302
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,740
What is "sharing a berth"?

303
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,570
It's when a man and a woman
sleep cocooned together.

304
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,910
"Cocooned"?

305
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,920
Ugh, I feel a chill. I did get
doused with water a lot today...

306
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,190
Big brother...

307
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,060
Who do you like?

308
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,790
Y-You can't just ask me
out of the blue like that...

309
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,260
Well... I like all of you.

310
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,740
Thou dost not need to know.

311
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,770
- Musubi-chan, Tsukiumi...
- Eh? I'm his wife, too!

312
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,210
Matsu-san,

313
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,180
And Ku-chan, too.

314
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,020
All of you chose someone like me who doesn't
have any special abilities or qualifications.

315
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,890
So I want to repay you for caring for me.

316
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,120
Something I can do...

317
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,420
Well, I don't even know
what I can do yet, though.

318
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,170
Was that too complicated for you, Ku-chan?

319
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,540
Ku-chan!

320
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,570
I like you very much, big brother.

321
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,410
Stay with me forever.

322
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,250
And then, when I get bigger,

323
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,450
please make me your wife.

324
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,790
What was that?! I just felt like
someone got the better of me.

325
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,380
Me, too!

326
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Really, it'd be best if we could
stay like this, with no fights at all...

327
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,810
Number 09. I confirmed her emergence.

328
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,540
It's time.

329
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,450
The time has come.

330
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,950
The economy, technologies, networks...

331
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,950
there's nothing to fear any longer.

332
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,430
For the sake of the lovely birds who
flew to land, I shall willingly play the fool!

333
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,890
It's a festival!

334
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,600
The stage Shintou Teito!

335
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,970
The Sekirei Plan moves to phase two!

336
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

337
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is renai no shinansho

338
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, aserazu so

339
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without furaingu de show time

340
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,410
Get the funky beat!

341
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,820
Hayai mono gachi?

342
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090
