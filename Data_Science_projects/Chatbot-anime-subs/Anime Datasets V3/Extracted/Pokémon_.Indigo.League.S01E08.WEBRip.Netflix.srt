00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,730
Sandshrew, pick up your pacing!

172
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,190
[Sandshrew titters]

173
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,734
[Rattatas grunting]

174
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,862
Hey, wait.
I thought you said pacing, not passing.

175
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,447
[both gasp]

176
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,700
-Pikachu!
-Huh, I said padding.

177
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,368
I mean, I said pacing!

178
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,536
[squeaks]

179
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,413
Why are you so tough on Sandshrew?

180
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,208
I have to be tough,
but I ask no more of Sandshrew

181
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,585
than I do of myself,
the very best.

182
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,379
But you aren't nearly as tough
on any of your other Pokémon.

183
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,966
That's because Sandshrew
is the first Pokémon I ever caught.

184
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,843
I will never forget that moment.

185
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,012
We promised to do
whatever it took to become

186
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,723
the greatest Pokémon
and trainer of all time.

187
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,643
Nothing would stop us
from reaching our dream,

188
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,354
no matter how difficult our path.

189
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,357
Enduring fierce storms
and raging winds,

190
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,943
we're sacrificed everything
to achieve our dream.

191
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,320
And it was worth it.
We're an unbeatable team.

192
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,114
What you're doing is wrong.

193
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,658
A great trainer should make
friends with his Pokémon.

194
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,284
Why should I listen to you?

195
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,788
Hey, Brock, don't you have
anything to say about this?

196
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,251
I do.
Your Pokémon are all in great shape.

197
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,336
What kind of Pokémon food
do you give them?

198
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,630
-Ah.
-My own recipe.

199
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,215
Come on, I'll show you.

200
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,638
To get the results I want, I have to
carefully monitor the Pokémon diets.

201
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,724
-Of course, the recipe is secret.
-[Brock] Oh, yeah, of course.

202
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,810
You know, I mix my own food too.

203
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,649
[grunts]

204
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,238
[Pikachu] Pikachu!

205
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,199
-Insulated gloves?
-Check.

206
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,661
-Big rubber ball?
-Check, check, check-a-rooni.

207
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,123
Team Rocket will do what it has to do...

208
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,125
To snatch that little Pikachu.

209
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,669
Maybe we should go back
to our old motto.

210
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,462
This one doesn't feel right.

211
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,173
Hey, how about
a theme-Meowth song?

212
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,426
And I can even do a little dance solo.

213
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,094
Everyone loves me-ooh-thic.

214
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
A song's no good.

215
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,890
[hums]

216
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,433
A dance won't work.

217
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,064
-Here's a line you'll like.
-And what's that?

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,443
How about, choreography killed the cat?

219
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,700
Okay, you wimps get a 15-minute break.

220
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,327
[Rattatas panting]

221
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,703
[Butterfree cooing]

[Sandshrew panting]

223
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,581
[Pokémon panting]

224
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,253
-Hey!
-Now what do you want?

225
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,464
Your Pokémon are totally wiped out.

226
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,882
You better believe it.

227
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,676
In this Gym, we live by the rule
no pain, no gain,

228
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,014
but judging by your little stuffed Pikachu
over there, you don't follow any rules.

229
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,475
It's not a stuffed Pikachu.
Take it back!

230
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,645
Hey, did you hear me?
I said take it back!

231
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,940
-[both grunting]
-Don't, Ash!

232
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,485
You don't win badges for being buddy,
buddy with a Pokémon!

233
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,278
[Brock]
Knock it off, you two!

234
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,281
[Misty] Isn't there a rule against
splashing in the pool?

235
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,744
Pika, pika, chu...

236
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,371
[Sandshrew laughs]

237
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,624
I'm getting dizzy.

238
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,584
Stop complaining.
Look for Pikachu.

239
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,089
-[Jessie] Roll over there.
-[James] What's that?

240
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,258
-[Jessie] Could it be Pikachu?
-[Meowth] Yeah, that's it. Now hurry!

241
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,678
All that rolling made me nauseous.

242
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,263
[James] Got it.

243
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,599
-[Jessie] Lets go.
-[Meowth] Hurry! I feel sick!

244
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,559
-[James] Watch where you're going!
-[Jessie] This way!

245
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,480
[Meowth] Hey, take it easy.
Ah, my leg fell asleep.

246
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,690
I wish your mouth would.

247
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,609
[both panting]

248
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,444
Why do you keep hanging around here?

249
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,446
There must be other trainers
you can bother.

250
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,864
Yeah, right.

251
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,454
Time's up.
Back to work, all of you!

252
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,042
Hey, where's Sandshrew?
Well, that's weird.

253
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,003
What's your Pikachu doing?

254
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,879
Oh. Ohh!

255
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,964
Pikachu.

256
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,883
[grunts]

257
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,344
-It's no use.
-Here, give it to me.

258
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,265
-Huh?
-Pikachu!

259
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,517
Pikachu, you're okay.

260
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,520
Pikachu, have you seen Sandshrew?

261
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,481
-Pika.
-You haven't.

262
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,861
Sandshrew!
Where are you?

263
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,029
Maybe it ran away.

264
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,989
What are you talking about?

265
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,826
The way you treat your Pokémon,
I'm surprised they all haven't run away.

266
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,495
Sandshrew and I have been together
for a long time.

267
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,332
Yeah, I know, but when Sandshrew saw
how well Pikachu and I get along,

268
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,584
it thought, I deserve better.

269
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,920
I'll find a trainer who treats me
like Ash treats Pikachu?

270
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,590
Sandshrew would not
break the promise we made,

271
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,594
not after all we've been through,
not just before our 100th victory!

272
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,970
Chu.

273
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,389
Now move it.
Go find Sandshrew.

274
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,348
-Free!
-Rattata!

275
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,061
[all panting]

276
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,980
Those clowns
will never catch up with us.

277
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,316
I'm exhausted.
You take the bag now.

278
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,319
But a real gentleman
always carries the bag.

279
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,489
Is that so?
Well, as you know, I'm no gentleman.

280
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,408
[all gasp]

281
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,869
[yelling]

282
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,373
You've all had enough of A.J.

283
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,666
and the way he pushes you around,
haven't you?

284
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,794
Well, you don't have to put up
with it anymore,

285
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,796
because now you can come with me.

286
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,465
Anyone who's coming with me,
raise your hand!

287
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,430
[Ash] Just raise your hand.
Get them up there.

288
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,226
-Ash is making a fool of himself again.
-Mm.

289
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,646
You see what happens when you try
to start a mutiny in my Gym?

290
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,731
My Pokémon are all loyal.

291
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,691
So then where's Sandshrew?

292
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,028
-Meowth!
-[A.J. grunts]

293
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,571
[both groaning]

294
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,115
Sandshrew.

295
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,033
[Pokémons tittering happily]

296
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,578
A.J. and all his Pokémon sure are happy
that Sandshrew is back.

297
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,997
[groans]

298
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,458
[laughs]

299
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,087
How could they possibly pick him over me?

300
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,466
A.J. is tough, but as you can see,
he cares deeply for his Pokémon.

301
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,927
[laughs]

302
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,888
[Ash]
Wow, A.J. does care about them.

303
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,350

-What is it?

00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,187
Meowth!

306
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,899
So then it must've been Team Rocket
that kidnapped Sandshrew.

307
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,527
-Wake up.
-Meowth?

308

[yells]

309
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,618
Hey, where am I?
What's going on here?

310
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,706
[whimpering]

311
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,625
How am I gonna get out of this mess?

312
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,171
-[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.
-[James] Make that double.

313
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,466
-Meowth?
-Ugh, Team Rocket.

314
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,259
Use the old motto.

315
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,887
[Jessie] To protect the world
from devastation...

316
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,181
To unite all peoples
within our nation...

317
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,433
[both] To denounce the evils
of truth and love,

318
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,727
to extend our reach
to the stars above...

319
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,979
-Jessie.
-James.

320
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,357
Team Rocket, blast off
at the speed of light!

321
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,402
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

322
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,696
Meowth! That's right!

323
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,824
That felt great.
We don't need a theme song.

324
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,659
It's a classic.

325
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,496
So these are the creeps
who kidnapped my Sandshrew?

326
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,208
Mm, that was an unfortunate mix-up.

327
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,710
We have no interest
in your second-rate Sandshrew.

328
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,794
Second-rate?

329
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,464
The only Pokémon we want is Pikachu.

330
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,257
You can keep all those other wimps.

331
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,218
Wimps, are they?

332
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,261
That's it! Huh?

333
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,596
I'll take care of this.

334
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,140
No one insults my Pokémon
and gets away with it.

335
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,600
Let's step outside.

336
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,018
Uh-oh.

337
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,068
Team Rocket has insulted our Gym!

338
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,362
We'll answer them with our 100th win.

339
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,780
100th.

340
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,158
That's right.
As Sandshrew and I vowed.

341
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,619
Good luck!

342
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,997
Your small talk will cost you big-time!

343
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,917
-Ekans, go!
-Your turn, Koffing!

344
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,586
Ekans!

345
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,549
Koffing!

346
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,467
Sandshrew, go!

347
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,136
-Koffing!
-Ekans!

348
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,559
Ekans, bind it now!

349
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,727
Ekans!

350
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,313
[Ekans groans]

351
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,315
-It's so strong.
-Good work!

352
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,275
Excellent!

353
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,569
Koffing, Sludge attack!

354
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,862
Koffing!

355
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Meowth, don't just stand there.

356
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,871
[humming]

357
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,832
Stop pussyfooting around!

358
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,334
Just biting my time.

359
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,338
Ah! The moment of tooth!

360
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,425
Finish it!
Sandshrew, Fissure Strike!

361
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,427
[Sandshrew yelling]

362
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,805
[thunder rumbles and all gasp]

363
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,480
Go, Sandshrew!
Drill into the ground till it splits!

364
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,572
[all yelling]

365
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,249
[groans]

366
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,627
That's it! I forfeit the match!

367
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,337
-Koffing!
-Ekans!

368
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,796
-Come back here!
-Meowth, where are you going?

369
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,299
[Meowth]
To write us a theme song!

370
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,260
[Jessie]
Not that again! Ugh!

371
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:01,265
We did it, Sandshrew!
We finally reached victory number 100!

372
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:11,233
Today, all our sacrifices and hard work
have finally paid off!

373
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,402
Now we can start winning our badges.

374
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:27,667
When I return here, I'm gonna be
the number one Pokémon Master.

375
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,251
Why don't you come along with us?

376
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,422
Thanks, but Sandshrew and I
have our own path that we must follow.

377
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,721
Someday we'll meet again
at the big Pokémon League competition.

378
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,265
Okay, but next time,
you better be in shape,

379
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,685
because I only want to beat
expert trainers.

380
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,436
That's a deal.

381
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,230
So long!

382
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,024
He's tough, but pretty cool.

383
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,610
Yeah, looks like
you've found another rival.

384
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,072
[Ash]
A.J., I'm not going to lose next time!

385
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,283
I'll train hard to become the greatest
Pokémon Master in the world,

386
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,535
