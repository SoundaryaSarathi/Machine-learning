[All] Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,081
I can't wait to take a bubble bath.

22
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,833
I have to hit the Laundromat.

23
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,003
I'm going to find the Vermillion City Gym
right now.

24
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,714
-[Brock] Hold it.
-Huh?

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,426
-What's the matter?
-[Pikachu's stomach growls]

26
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,263
-Pikachu.
-It must be hungry.

27
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,391
We haven't eaten anything decent
for three days now.

28
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,561
Hey, Pikachu,
you feeling hungry, little buddy?

29
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,937
[stomach growls]

30
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,188
Oh!

31
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,357
[laughs]

32
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,943
I guess we're all a little hungry,
right, Pikachu?

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,029
Pika.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,373
[Ash] I think it's hungry.

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,375
We'll fix Pikachu up.

36
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,502
[All] Huh?

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,756
I know why you're surprised.

38
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,342
I look like all the other nurses, don't I?

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,594
My first cousin works in
Pewter City,

40
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,263
and my second cousin works
in Viridian City.

41
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,600
I think I'm the prettiest one, don't you?
[giggles]

42
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,101
-Yeah--
-[boy] Hurry!

43
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,354
-Huh?
-You'll be okay, Rattata.

44
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,439
Hurry!

45
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,193
That Ratatta's in rough shape.
I wonder what happened.

46
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,738
Oh, it's the 15th one
brought in this month.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,114
What?

48
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,283
[Brock] This is terrible.

49
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:42,579
[nurse] They all lost to Lieutenant Surge,
the Vermilion Gym Leader.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
Whoa, he must be a great trainer.

51
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,919
So, Ash, you scared already?

52
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,755
-No way.
-Well, you talk big.

53
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,841
But when you see how tough it is
to get badges, you turn chicken.

54
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,510
Maybe you should just quit now.

55
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,012
Besides, the only badges you do have
you got out of pity.

56
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,139
A badge is a badge!

57
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,392
[gasps and groans]

58
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,353
Why don't you try prove how tough you are
at the Vermilion Gym?

59
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,814
From the looks of things here,
you'll have to be tough

60
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
to battle with this Lieutenant Surge.

61
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,944
You think he's that tough?

62
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,779
We gave you badges, you know.

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,365
How do you think we'll look
if you get crushed by Surge?

64
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,117
You have nothing to worry about,

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,828
except maybe seeing
my own incredible strength.

66
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,287
[nurse]
All right, that's enough.

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,540
She started it.

68
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,543
-Remember, this is a hospital.
-[both moan]

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,676
They say if two people fight,
they really care about each other.

70
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,386
-Me care about her?
-Me care about him?

71
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:40,971
[both sigh]

72
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,808
-[giggles]
-[musical bleep]

73
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,144
That signal means
your Pokémon has recovered.

74
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,939
[munches] Mm! Yum!

75
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,983
-[Ash] Pikachu!
-Pik.

76
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,153
I hope you're full because
we got to win big at that Gym today.

77
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,530
-Pi!
-Come on, let's go win a badge.

78
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,532
[boy] Please hurry!

79
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,909
Just hold on, Pidgey.

80
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,871
I guess they must've come from that Gym.

81
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,539
-Pi!
-Huh?

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,791
-Pikachu! Pikachu!
-What?

83
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,001
Don't be a coward.

84
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,087
-Pika. Pikachu.
-Huh?

85
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,508
Don't I care if you end up
like that Pidgey in there?

86
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,178
-Is that it?
-Pika, pika!

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,930
Yeah. I guess you're right.

88
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,600
[sighs]

89
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,768
No problem.

90
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,020
You won't end up that way
because you'll win.

91
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,104
[grunting]

92
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't be a scaredy-cat, Pikachu.

93
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,358
Pika. Pikachu!

94
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,360
[grunting and groaning]

95
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,781
The way they fight,
must mean they care a lot.

96
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,703
[Ash]
So this is the Vermilion City Gym.

97
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,705
It's not too late to back out.

98
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,999
Why should I back out
when I'm going to win?

99
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,126
Just stick around and watch me.

100
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,962
I'll stick around to see your face
when you get creamed.

101
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,882
If you think We're going to get creamed,
you're going to be disappointed.

102
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,134
Are we ever going to go inside?

103
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,137
[creaking]

104
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,771
Hello. I've come for a Pokémon battle
to earn a thunder badge.

105
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,982
Hey, boss, another victim
for the emergency room.

106
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,112
-Which one?
-[Ash stutters]

107
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,916
Whoa, he's huge.

108
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,752
Is he the Gym Leader you have to beat?

109
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,005
-Welcome to Vermilion Gym.
-[Misty] Ah!

110
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,801
Oh, my next challenger is a cute one.

111
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,136
Don't think I'll go easy on you.

112
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,888
[stammers] Excuse me,

113
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,933
-I'm not the challenger. [chuckles]
-Then who?

114
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,268
Me, that's who.

115
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,771
Hm? Oh, you.

116
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,773
Okay, baby.

117
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,608
[grunts angrily] I'm no baby.

118
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,193
My name's Ash Ketchum.

119
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,698
[chuckles] I call everybody
who loses to me baby. Huh?

120
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,451
-Pi?
-[chuckles] A Pikachu.

121
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,786
Hey, look at this.

122
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,664
Baby brought along a baby Pokémon.

123
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,166
-[all laugh]
-Quit it.

124
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,544
Why are you making fun of my Pikachu?

125
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
Pika, pika!

126
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,922
Well, I'll show you why.

127
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,216
Go, Poké Ball!

128
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,887
Rai!

129
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,973
It's a Raichu.

130
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,477
[Pokédex] <i>Raichu. A mouse Pokémon</i>
<i>of the electric element.</i>

131
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,855
<i>Raichu is the evolved form</i>
<i>of Pikachu.</i>

132
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,858
<i>It can shock</i>
<i>with more than 100,000 volts,</i>

133
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,319
<i>enough to render</i>
<i>a Dragonite unconscious.</i>

134
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,945
Chu.

135
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,449
[grunting] Okay, baby.
If you want to quit,

136
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,826
-now's your chance.
-Raichu.

137
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,995
There's no way we're going to quit now.

138
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,914
[Surge chuckles]
What could a baby like that do?

139
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,584
If you just want to become
a Pokémon Master,

140
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,837
you should make your Pokémon evolve
as soon as you catch it.

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,090
There's more to raising a Pokémon
than forcing it to evolve.

142
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,509
And I like this Pikachu
just the way it is.

143
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,886
[both laughing]

144
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,763
Wrong, baby.

145
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,806
Electric Pokémon are only useful

146
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,684
once they've learned
all their different electric attacks.

147
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,646
You keep it puny like that,
it's no more than a little pet.

148
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,689
Pika!

149
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,068
-Can Pikachu beat Raichu?
-I seriously doubt it.

150
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,695
Especially if Raichu knows
all the electric attacks.

151
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,822
Okay, baby,

152
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,909
did you just come here
to show us your little pet?

153
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,953
We came here to earn a thunder badge.

154
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,704
-Pika, pika.
-Pikachu?

155
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,873
[growls]

156
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,627
That's unusual.
Pikachu really wants to go into battle.

157
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,962
I'm not surprised.

158
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,465
Pikachu, I'm counting on you.

159
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,759
Pikachu.

160
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,054
Oh, well.

161
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,598
I guess you'll learn
that playing with the big boys

162
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,225
can be a shocking experience.

163
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,020

-Pi!
-What's that?

174
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,134
Raichu, show them a real thunder shock.

175
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,013
-Raichu!
-[screams]

176
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,556
[all gasp]

177
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,808
[moans]

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,186
-Raichu.
-It's over, baby.

179
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,108
You didn't really think that Pikachu
could beat my Raichu, did you? [chuckles]

180
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,568
Pikachu.

181
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,737
-Call it back, Ash.
-But--

182
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,115
Raichu's shocks are too powerful.
This is a mismatch.

183
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,534
[grunts] Pikachu, return.

184
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,287
[gasps] Pika.

185
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,290
-Pikachu?
-Pikachu still wants to fight?

186
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,793
Pi... Pikachu.

187
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,130
[chuckles]
It's pretty gutsy for a toy.

188
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,174
-Pika!
-Pikachu!

189
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,634
I enjoy playing with toys,

190
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,095
but playtime's over.

191
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,223
-Raichu, mega punch!
-Rai!

192
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,310
-Now a mega kick!
-Chu!

193
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,311
Pikachu!

194
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,729
[grunts]

195
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,646
[moans]

196
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,275
[Jessie chuckles]
Pikachu's really getting pounded.

197
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,903
That Raichu really must be strong.

198
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,907
Hey, I just thought of something.
If Pikachu loses this battle...

199
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,868
You're right.
Then it's not worth stealing after all.

200
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,453
We've wasted all this time.

201
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,955
-Maybe you can steal Raichu.
-[Jessie grunts]

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,624
-[thudding]
-[whimpers]

203
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,002
Come on, Pikachu.
Can't you zap it like you always do?

204
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,005
-Surge is getting ready to finish it off.
-[gasps]

205
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,926
Now, give us the big finale, Raichu.

206
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,011
Raichu!

207
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,055
[all screaming]

208
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,557
-[Ash] Pikachu!
-[cries]

209
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:14,447
-Pi...
-Pikachu. I'm glad you're okay.

210
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,951
-Pikachu.
-[Ash sighs]

211
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,579
-Pikachu got hurt pretty badly.
-I can see that.

212
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,833
-No, no. I mean its spirit.
-What do you mean?

213
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,878
Pikachu was totally overpowered
by that Raichu.

214
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,257
-Brock's right, Ash.
-We'll try harder.

215
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,385
We'll win next time
if Pikachu tries harder.

216
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,513
I think Pikachu was trying its best
the last time.

217
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,639
Hm.

218
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,225
-[nurse] There is one way you might win.
-[all] Huh?

219
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,438
I'm sorry. I overheard your conversation,
and I just thought that maybe--

220
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,731
How can we win?

221
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,818
A while ago, I just happened
to come across this.

222
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,781
-Wow, it's a Thunderstone.
-A Thunderstone?

223
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,744
Yes. You can use it to make Pikachu
evolve into a Raichu.

224
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,873
I could evolve Pikachu
into a Raichu?

225
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,168
Then Pikachu might be strong enough
to win.

226
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,087
You've got to think hard
before using the Thunderstone.

227
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,088
Huh?

228
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
If you make Pikachu evolve, Ash,
you can't change it back.

229
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,095
Pikachu will never be the same.

230
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,390
If Pikachu becomes a Raichu,
I might be able to win that badge.

231
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,353
On the other hand,
to make it evolve just to fight,

232
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,856
I would be just like Surge.

233
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,318
Pikachu, what do you want to do?

234
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,114
-Pika.
-I really want to beat that Surge,

235
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,366
but I also don't want
to force you to evolve

236
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,869
if you'd he happier
staying the way you are now.

237
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:56,007
-He's letting Pikachu decide.
-If it becomes Raichu, it'll be stronger.

238
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,258
What's it going to do?

239
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,638
-Pi--
-Pikachu.

240
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,847
Save your strength.

241
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,394
-Chu!
-[Ash moans]

242
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,815
-Pikachu.
-Pika, Pikachu! Pika.

243
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,195
Pi, pi, pi, Pikachu!
Chu! Pika, Pikachu!

244
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,656
It's so brave.

245
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,618
-So tell us what Pikachu's saying.
-Pikachu won't change.

246
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,413
If it's going to pick a Raichu,
it wants to do it just as it is.

247
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,249
You mean, it's going to battle again
as a Pikachu?

248
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,836
It's going to fight
in the name of all Pikachu.

249
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,713
-[both crying]
-Really?

250
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,382
That's so beautiful.

251
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,012
Pikachu, together, you and I will beat
Lieutenant Surge and his Raichu.

252
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,180
Pika, pika!

253
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,809
-You're both crazy.
-You should change your strategy, Ash.

254
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,435
Maybe use your other Pokémon.

255
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,105
It's hard, but it's not impossible.

256
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,607
Pikachu and I will find a way to win.

257
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,275
Pika, Pikachu! Pika!

258
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,779
Huh? Pikachu will prove it
can beat Raichu.

259
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,824
It will defend its honor and Ash's.

260
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,743
Oh, dear, that's magnificent.

261
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,162
All right, are we all charged up?

262
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,083
Pi... Pika. [sighs]

263
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,170
-Huh?
-It hasn't fully recovered its stamina.

264
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
You should let it rest
a little while longer.

265
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,260
[sighs] Pikachu.

266
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,807
Oh, this whole thing has me so nervous.

267
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,811
Really? Since when did you
decide to worry about me?

268
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,440
Not you. I'm concerned
about Pikachu. I hope it'll be okay.

269
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,525
-Hey, Ash.
-Yeah?

270
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,653
During the fight, Surge said
that he made his Raichu evolve

271
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,989
-as soon as he got it, didn't he?
-Yeah.

272
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,409
-Then perhaps there is a way.
-Huh?

273
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:56,919
Pikachu, our lucky star is shining today.

274
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,380
Pi? Pika?

275
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,591
Where? I don't see it.

276
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,135
How can you see a star
in the middle of the day?

277
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,929
Oh! I don't mean it's actually shining.

278
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,223
-Let's go, Pikachu.
-Pika.

279
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,935
Seems like they're ready to win,
doesn't it?

280
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,948
[Ash] Huh?

281
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,660
Uh, who are you guys?

282
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,455
[both]
To protect the world from devastation.

283
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,041
[both] We forgot.

284
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,211
We are the challenger's cheerleaders,

285
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,547
and we're here to show our support
for the brave Pikachu and Ash.

286
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,465
[both] Rah!

287
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,594
In honor of the great Pikachu's bravery,
we wish to offer a cheer.

288
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,515
We want you, Pikachu!

289
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,267
Give me a pi Give me a ka!
Give me a chu! What've you got?

290
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:58,815
Pikachu! Fight, fight, Pikachu
You're our Pokémon, yeah

291
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,402
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Yay, Pikachu!

292
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,903
Okay, let's split.

293
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,492
-That was really disturbing.
-Thanks for your support!

294
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,078
-Bye, Team Rocket!
-[all grunt]

295
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,540
-[Meowth] How did they know it was us?
-[Jessie] Lucky guess.

296
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,750
[chuckles]

297
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,631
Hey, baby,
you ready to take another beating?

298
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,427
You didn't even make your
Pikachu evolve.

299
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,011
You haven't learned anything yet.

300
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,180
Don't you be so sure, Surge.

301
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,266
Okay, well, let's see.

302
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,269
[announcer]
<i>The challenger, Ash, using a Pikachu.</i>

303
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,147
<i>The Gym Leader, Lieutenant Surge,</i>
<i>using a Raichu.</i>

304
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,650
<i>The Pokémon will battle one-on-one</i>
<i>with no time limit.</i>

305
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,902
<i>-Let the battle begin!</i>
-[bell dings]

306
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,780
Use the strategy we planned,
Pikachu!

307
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,740
-You can do it!
-Pika!

308
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,200
A strategy?

309
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,661
So they've been planning a new way
to lose.

310
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,457
-Go, Raichu!
-Raichu!

311
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,708
-[screams]
-[chuckles]

312
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,085
[groaning]

313
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,337
Pika... [grunts]

314
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,547
-[whipping]
-Raichu.

315
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,008
-Pikachu!
-Hang in there, Pikachu.

316
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,759
Roll to the side and break away.

317
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,846
-It can't lose.
-Not after the cheer we did.

318
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
Maybe we did the wrong kind
of cheer.

319
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,351
Do it, Raichu.
Give it the body slam.

320
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,605
-Raichu!
-[cries]

321
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,689
[all gasp]

322
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,234
Finish it off, Raichu.
Another body slam!

323
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,404
-Raichu!
-[Misty and Brock] Oh!

324
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,615
-[all gasp]
-[all] Pikachu!

325
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,782
Watch out!

326
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,870
-Hey, what?
-Chu!

327
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,665
-[all] All right!
-Do it, Pikachu! Agility now!

328
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,252
-Chu!
-Raichu, use your body slam!

329
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,796
Raichu! [grunting]

330
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,633
[groaning]

331
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
Uh, Raichu?

332
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,553
It's working. Just like brock said.

333
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,097
Right. Raichu evolved too fast,

334
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,018
and it never learned the speed attacks
it could only learn in the Pikachu stage.

335
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,772
-Okay, use all the agility you've got.
-[grunting]

336
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,493
Your Raichu's way too slow, Surge.
That's its weakness.

337
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,455
Okay, Raichu.
Give it a thunder bolt.

338
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,998
Shut it down.

339
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,668
Raichu!

340
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,628
[all gasp]

341
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,798
[all scream]

342
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,052
[grunting]

343
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,390
The end of the match.
Huh? What?

344
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,518
-Pikachu.
-All right, way to go.

345
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,980
It used its tail as a ground
and dodged the electric shock.

346
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,692
-What a shocking story.
-That was quite a tale.

347
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,152
-Meow!
-[James whimpers]

348
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,823
[Meowth] And now you've both
been punished. [chuckles]

349
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,075
-[James] Caught me.
-[Meowth chuckles]

350
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,786
[panting]

351
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,372
Raichu, give it another thunder bolt!

352
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,416
Rai...

353
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,710
-Oh.
-Rai!

354
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,670
-[Raichu gasps]
-Do something!

355
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,798
It's over.
Raichu ran out of electricity.

356
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,633
All right. Quick attack.

357
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,843
Chu!

358
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,470
Raichu, take down now!

359
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,890
-Rai!
-Pikachu!

360
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,685
-[groans]
-Pika, Pikachu!

361
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,272
Raichu!

362
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,109
Unbelievable!

363
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,570
[whimpers]

364
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,322
We did it, Pikachu.

365
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,198
-Way to go.
-Fantastic.

366
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,242
-[all] Hooray!
-Victory!

367
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,997
Pikachu.

368
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:49,128
Congratulations. Nice job, Ash, Pikachu.

369
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,673
As proof of your victory,
a thunder badge.

370
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,175
Thank you.

371
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,723
Would you look at that?
It's really a thunder badge.

372
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,891
You should be proud.

373
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,560
You and your Pikachu
really fought good together.

374
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,314
Thanks. [grunts]
A thunder badge!

375
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,774
And it's all mine!

376
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,817
Pi, Pikachu.

377
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,780
Nice victory, Ash.
You're no baby.

378
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,992
-Congratulations, Ash, Pikachu.
-You finally got your own badge.

379
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,827
Rai, rai, rai.

380
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,997
-Pika.
-Rai.

381
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,501
Thank you, Pikachu.
This was your victory.

382
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,754
-Pika.
-[grunting]

383
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,132
Wow! Now I can really can see
lots of lucky stars.

384
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,884
Pika, pika.

385
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,846
-Those two really are quite a team.
-Yes, indeed.

386
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,849
[both laugh]

387
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,103
[all laugh]

388
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,899
That Pikachu really is special.

389
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,901
That's why it's worth snatching.

390
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,321
Hey, once we steal it,
maybe we can earn our own badges.
