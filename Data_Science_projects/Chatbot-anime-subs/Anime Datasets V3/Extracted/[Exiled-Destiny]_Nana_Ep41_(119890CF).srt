1
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:09,642
I realized that the time had come to face
the problem I had been ignoring

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:14,172
by not thinking too deeply
about it.

3
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,582
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

4
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:26,452
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

5
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:33,292
Baby I'm standing alone

6
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:36,092
An unforgettable rainy day

7
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,102
Chasing after your shadow

8
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,972
And it's over, it's like sand now

9
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:44,272
I sigh every night

10
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:47,312
I scream like a child and cried

11
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,042
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

12
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:54,112
Please, please God, forgive my sins

13
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,852
I don't need to hide no more

14
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,792
Flowing toward the turquoise light

15
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,832
Just keep going on

16
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,432
You've got the chance now

17
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,632
You've got the power

18
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,132
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

19
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:10,772
I show you my life now

20
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:12,202
I show you my love now

21
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:15,432
I show you my everything yeah yeah

22
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:17,672
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

23
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:20,482
Don't ever change so be yourself

24
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:21,912
I'll show you my strength now

25
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,282
I'll show you my love now

26
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:26,552

I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY.

NO NEW MESSAGES

39
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:03,782
Nobu!

40
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,842
Yasu says lunch is ready.

41
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:08,882
Spaghetti with mushrooms!

42
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:14,242
I think we can count on a tasty meal.
Yasu's cooking is the best.

43
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:16,482
Who are you expecting a reply from?

44
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:20,182
You've been checking
your email all morning.

45
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:22,592
Well, you know,
because the reception is bad here.

46
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,162
But you usually leave your cell phone
in your room.

47
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:31,272
Shin, do something about that habit
of yours of closely observing others.

48
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:36,542
Sorry. But you're easy to figure out
even without observing closely.

49
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,272
I don't want you figuring me out!

50
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:40,372
But I can.

51
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,152
It's dangerous here.

52
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,392
Looking at the night sky,
it's as if you can reach the stars.

53
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,052
You get the feeling that
your dreams will come true.

54
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,662
Shin, thank you for your email.

55
00:03:56,762 --> 00:04:01,902
I feel it's been a long time since
I've seen that many stars.

56
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,012
Even if I close my eyes,

57
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:08,912
I can only imagine artificial neon lights
like in a planetarium.

58
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:10,452
SHIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMAIL.

I FEEL IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

EVEN IF I CLOSE MY EYES,
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
ARTIFICIAL NEON LIGHTS

Because I thought I'm no different
from such neon lights.

60
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:14,722
SHIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMAIL.
I FEEL IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

Your words have saved me
once again, Shin.

62
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,192
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I'M
NO DIFFERENT FROM
SUCH NEON LIGHTS.
YOUR WORDS HAVE
SAVED ME ONCE AGAIN, SHIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Your words have saved me

66
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,592
PHEW

67
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,802
Thank you, Nami. You have quite the tan.

68
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:35,462
No! Yes! I mean,
I'm sorry, I'm kinda nervous!

69
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,512
I've been a big fan of Trapnest
since your debut!

70
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,532
Really?

71
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,902
Don't question her.
She's being polite.

72
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,012
Honey!

73
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,482
You think this pattern is too flashy?

74
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:48,682
You don't need to wear a tie.

75
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,152
Gotta look dignified as a father.

76
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,282
Sorry to keep you waiting!

77
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,562
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Takumi Ichinose.

78
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,502
You sure are tall!
H-How tall are you?!

79
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,892
A meter and
eighty-three centimeters, right?

80
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:08,932
I wasn't asking you.
Fawning all over him...

81
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,562
I apologize that it took so long
before I could come.

82
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,902
These are some gifts from England.

83
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,842
Though, the only thing British
about it is the tea.

84
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,972
- Oh my, this much?
- What is it?

85
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:22,322
Wow, thanks brother!

86
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,782
I'll follow you for
the rest of my life!

87
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,052
How cozy!

88
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:28,822
It's beautiful! Your father would never
buy me things like this.

89
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,132
You certainly seem to be well-off,
Mr. Ichinose.

90
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:36,062
Do celebrities get paid that well?

91
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,702
It depends on the person.

92
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,032
After all, you're profits are determined
by your popularity.

93
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,102
That's true.

94
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,842
Are you sure you can provide for
my daughter and her child

95
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,432
for the rest of their lives?

96
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,242
I'll do all right, sir.

97
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,282
"Sir"?!

98
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,382
He seems like an untrustworthy guy.

99
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:54,842
I may be a celebrity on the outside,
but I'm just a workman.

100
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:59,852
It's difficult to continue a band
regardless of its popularity.

101
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,962
I'd like to be in the same band forever,

102
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,292
but that's not something that
I alone can determine.

103
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,332
Today, I wore a wedding dress
while filming our promo video.

104
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:14,272
TODAY, I WORE A WEDDING DRESS
WHILE FILMING OUR PROMO VIDEO.

with my singing no matter

120
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,002
All right, okay. We're done.

121
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,072
Done already?

122
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,842
We've done enough.

123
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:52,542
At your current level as a singer,

124
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,132
it'll be the same, no matter
how many times we record.

125
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:58,002
In other words, you've given it
all you've got for now and it was great.

126
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,412
What's that supposed to mean?

127
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,412
We can artificially adjust the high notes
you have trouble reaching.

128
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:05,192
Do some voice training before
the live performance,

129
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,482
so you don't embarrass yourself.

130
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,322
Otherwise, even the music magazines
will start writing nasty things about you.

131
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,462
Shut up! Stop laughing!
Let me sing it again!

132
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:16,432
Well then, now that we're done
with the recording,

133
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,702
what do you say we go fishing?

134
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:18,772
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

135
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,732
All right!

136
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,032
That's the one thing I've been looking
forward to doing here.

137
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:22,972
The one thing?!

138
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:23,942
Matsuo!

139
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:25,842
Let me sing some more!

140
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,242
Keep it down!
You'll scare off all the fish!

141
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,902
Say, why did your wife leave you?

142
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:31,582
I think the number one reason Gaia
decided to record at that training camp

143
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:35,522
I THINK THE NUMBER ONE REASON
GAIA DECIDED TO RECORD

152
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,202
Mr. Ichinose. What about your family?

153
00:07:58,472 --> 00:07:59,462
How many siblings do you have?

154
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,372
You have a big sister, right?!

155
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,542
We're not asking you.

156
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,552
Honey...

157
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:07,512
Would you let me talk too?!
This isn't any fun!

158
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:10,742
But you hardly know a damn thing
about my family, do you?

159
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,122
"Damn"?

160
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:13,122
Excuse me.

161
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:14,262
Oh, that's not a problem at all!

162
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:16,622
You can use that language with me
whenever you damn please!

163
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,152
It's not fine! Not at all!
And your Japanese is funny!

164
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,922
Nami, go buy some sake.

165
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,322
Yes, you do that.

166
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,672
And pick up some ingredients
for the sukiyaki too.

167
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,702
Huh? No way!

168
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,192
Besides, what are the ingredients?
Meat?

169
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,492
Let's take the car and
go together, Nami. Okay?

170
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,632
You wanna go out with
your new handbag, don't you?

171
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:36,232
Don't tell me you like Nami.
Please, anyone but her.

172
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:40,882
I'm so sorry! Nana and Nami
are both such noisy girls.

173
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:43,412
Me too?! Don't group me with Nami!

174
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,112
Not at all.
I'm enjoying this very much.

175
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,622
My mother was very weak,

176
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,562
and the rest of my family
was rather dark.

177
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:50,962
Perhaps because of that,

178
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,952
since I was small I've always been
drawn to energetic, happy people.

179
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,362
That's why I find this so attractive.

180
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:02,632
The feeling of a loving family
like yours. This is fun.

181
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,612
I see.

182
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,602
Well, one thing I can guarantee
is Nana's in good health.

183
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,952
So how is your family doing now?

184
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,182
My mother passed away six years ago.

185
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,842
My sister married a local man.

186
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,752
They now live with their
two children and our father.

187
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:24,182
Okay, then we should give them
a visit sometime soon.

188
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,962
We'll all go and pay our respects
at your mother's grave.

189
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,102
Yes, we should.

190
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,222
No, it's okay.

191
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:29,992
- Huh?
- Huh?

192
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:33,302
In fact, my father is
a complete alcoholic,

193
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,792
and lately he can't even manage
a proper conversation.

194
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,002
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,812
An alcoholic.
That must be tough for you.

196
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,282
But we still should go and
introduce ourselves.

197
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,042
No, it's really all right.

198
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,752
He's the type of man
that wouldn't even attend

199
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,812
my sister's wedding or
my mother's funeral.

200
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,752
Besides, I have no intention
of inviting him to our wedding.

201
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,622
I wouldn't want him ruining it.

202
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,392
If there's something not right
about the father,

203
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:59,292
the child isn't gonna amount to much.

204
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,762
I'm a good example.

205
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,872
More importantly, about the location
of the wedding ceremony,

206
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,842
would you mind taking a look
at these documents?

207
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,202
Hey, guy. You're not a salesman.

208
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,692
Honey! You just called him "Guy"!

209
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:41,232
Ren?

210
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:20,702
Ren. You'll catch a cold
if you sleep here.

211
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,342
Here. Come here like a good boy.

212
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:33,952
Come on.

213
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:36,662
Reira?

214
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:40,232
I'm sorry. I guess I dozed off.

215
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,092
Did Mr. Honjo have a bit
too much to drink?

216
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,692
Is he okay?

217
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,872
Yeah. This always happens.

218
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,802
Help me carry him to the bed.

219
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:53,802
Sure.

220
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,882
Shin. Right now, I'm really
regretting having left in Japan

221
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:04,692

REN
MESSAGE FOR NANA

243
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,062
REN
MESSAGE FOR NANA
I GOT BACK IN JAPAN TODAY.
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL.

244
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,032
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

245
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:02,012
Without delay, the eight-day
seven-night long recording

246
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,342
at the training camp finally
came to an end.

247
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:07,852
But even after returning to Tokyo,

248
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:10,282
I can't go home while the place is
still infested with them mosquitoes.

249
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:15,042
What are you reading, Shin?
You're into literature, I see.

250
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,452
An erotic novel. Mika bought it
for me at a book stand.

251
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,122
Is it any good, Shin?

252
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,962
Not at all.

253
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:22,762
Huh?

254
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,062
- No use trying to tease him, Mika.
- Oh, Mika.

255
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,432
- I think Shin knows more about that
- You can only touch him

256
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,632
- than you do.
- from the neck up.

257
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,772
But this is good study material.

258
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,012
What study is that?!

259
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:31,872
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR
AI YAZAWA

260
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:32,972
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR
AI YAZAWA
"The Housewife Next Door"?

261
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:33,342
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR
AI YAZAWA

262
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,682
Starting today,

263
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,242
we're all being thrown into
the so-called agency's dormitory.

264
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,182
They just call it a dormitory.

265
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:44,022
It's really a regular apartment building.

266
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,852
It's for our agency's talents only, though.

267
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,962
Everyone gets his own room,
there's no curfew,

268
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,952
and no nosy dorm supervisor.

269
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:53,962
But security and facilities are
above standards,

270
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,052
so it's safe and comfortable!

271
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:59,862
I don't care what it is, as long as
I can relax and get some sleep.

272
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,962
You're better off not opening
the window.

273
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,402
That's a love hotel next door.

274
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,202
They're not likely to open
their window too often either.

275
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:17,172
What's comfortable about this?!
I don't get any sunlight here!

276
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,352
You have your own toilet and shower.

277
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,422
Where's the bathtub?

278
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:23,552
You're such a complainer!
Who do you think you are?

279
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,462
If you wanna live the high life,
then work your way up there.

280
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,532
I'll make certain that you have
a full schedule starting tomorrow.

281
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:35,332
Wait, Ginpei! Is there a phone?

282
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,812
There's one on the first floor
at the front desk!

283
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:38,812
The front desk?

284
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,772
At least buy a cell phone!

285
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:41,612
Work will be

286
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,132
- so inconvenient without one.
- That's not a front desk!

287
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:48,352
And the security guard's asleep!
What's the point of having one?

288
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,112
He's bored,
which is proof of how safe it is.

289
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,082
I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning at seven.

290
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:55,882
Don't go wandering off outside!

291
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,222
There's something wrong.

292
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,752
Something's definitely wrong about
this production company.

293
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,592
Even the president was a weirdo.

294
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,702
Well, do your best.

295
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:10,342
No, I can't judge people
on their appearances,

296
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,072
but this guy also looks like one of them.

297
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,512
Who are you, miss?

298
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:16,342
I'm Nana from the Black Stones!

299
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:17,832
I just introduced myself
to you moments ago!

300
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,642
Oh right. Did you want something?

301
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,612
I wanna use the phone.

302
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,812
Go ahead and use it. It's free.

303
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,522
Forget it. I don't wanna be overheard.

304
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:31,892
I'll borrow Nobu's phone.

305
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,192
Really, go ahead and use it, miss!

306
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:41,462
But say I call Ren,
what am I gonna say to him?

307
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,042
We're not gonna be able to see
each other for a while anyway.

308
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,312
I actually would prefer
that he leave me alone

309
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,332
rather than have him half-heartedly
show some affection toward me.

310
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,512
That's what I should say to him.

311
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:04,152
I'm finding it hard to breathe.
It must be because the air is dirty.

312
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,662
That's why I hate Tokyo.

313
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,362
Huh? The Black Stones?
I know the band!

314
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:15,602
You do?

315
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,472
Well, it's famous, in a way!

316
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,672
No, not nearly as famous as you.

317
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,412
This is so exciting!
Hey, come on in!

318
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:22,842
Huh? But...

319
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:24,332
Come on! Hurry!

320
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,142
Ow!

321
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:29,182
What are you doing, little man?
You seem to be having fun.

322
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,882
Well, I was just saying hi
to my neighbor.

323
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:32,022
Nana?

324
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:36,022
She's gorgeous!
She sure is a celebrity!

325
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:38,122
It's the real Nana!
Please give me your autograph!

326
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,182
Huh? Yuri Kosaka?

327
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:40,892
That adult video star?

328
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:43,122
You all seem to know her.

329
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:48,562
What the hell kind of agency is
"Shikai Corporation"?!

330
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,902
Why are there adult video actresses
working for it?!

331
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,802
Well, she did start out as an idol.

332
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,512
But when her popularity dipped,
she took her clothes off.

333
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,372
You know a lot about her, Yasu.

334
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:02,212
And how could you make
the dormitory coed?

335
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:03,752
That's borderline outrageous!

336
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:06,622
I'm guessing it's to accommodate
or shelter their talents

337
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:08,092
with some sorta problem.

338
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,392
Like Ginpei was saying,
they just call it a dormitory.

339
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,592
You're right.

340
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,832
But Miss Yuri's been in
so many adult movies,

341
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,092
she must have money.

342
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,562
So why is she living in
a shabby place like this?

343
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:19,002
MISS YURI?

344
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:19,772
MISS YURI?
Miss Yuri?

345
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,002
Miss Yuri?

346
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:20,632
Nobu!

347
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,062
Switch rooms with me.

348
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:22,762
Huh?

349
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,942
With a starving wolf like
you living next door,

350
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,072
"Miss Yuri" would be in danger!

351
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,642
I'm not gonna do anything!
She's a pro!

352
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,732
I don't care! Just switch!

353
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,942
Why are you always so bossy?

354
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,682
Nobuo. I couldn't care less
if you get off on porn videos.

355
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,742
But I hope you haven't
forgotten our plan.

356
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:42,462
Plan?

357
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:47,592
To get Hachiko back!
We pledged to fight together!

358
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,462
So don't get involved
with other women!

359
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:52,532
What are you saying?
You're misunderstanding.

360
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:53,962
Misunderstanding?

361
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,942
You were bashfully and
gleefully chatting with Yuri!

362
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,802
No, not that.

363
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:04,602
I'm not necessarily fighting
to get Hachi back.

364
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,452
And this is unrelated to that.

365
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,172
For me, Hachi and the band
are separate issues.

366
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:16,422
Besides, why do I have to
take care of Hachi

367
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:17,892
just so you can own her
in your yard?

368
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:21,032
Honestly speaking,
I have completely given up on her,

369
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,022
so do whatever you wish on your own.

370
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:25,592
But...

371
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,532
What? Damn, you're being stubborn.

372
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:32,672
Then what are we fighting for?

373
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,652
That's a stupid question.

374
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:47,882
We're fighting so our music will be
accepted as that of a professional.

375
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,052
Hachi has nothing to do with it.

376
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:51,222
Nana?

377
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:56,222
Nobu is free to date
whoever he wants.

378
00:18:57,332 --> 00:19:02,502
But then, how do I
stay connected to Hachi?

379
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,212
I can no longer go home
to that place,

380
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,732
and even if I did, Hachi's
no longer there.

381
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,112
Hey, Yasu, how do you read
this kanji?

382
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:14,552
"Itsuwari."

383
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,582
"Lie."

384
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,322
Thanks.

385
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:20,712
NOBU

386
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:21,752
Yes?

387
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,082
Yasu!

388
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,052
Nana's...

389
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:26,882
Nana!

390
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:36,492
Shin, call an ambulance!
The number's 119.

391
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,262
What's the address here?

392
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,842
Tell Mr. Yamagishi, the security guard
and have him call one!

393
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:41,572
Okay!

394
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,782
We were talking and
then all of a sudden,

395
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,782
she was short of breath and
seemed to be in pain,

396
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:51,752
like she was having an attack.

397
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,322
Nana, are you okay?

398
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,492
An ambulance will be
here soon.

399
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:07,502
It's okay. Don't worry.
I won't leave your side.

400
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,432
I'm not going anywhere.

401
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,282
I think she's hyperventilating.

402
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:29,662
It's so painful you think
you're dying,

403
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,622
but you will never die from it.

404
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,762
It's a living hell.

405
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:36,462
Hey, wait!

406
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,332
Nobu! Do you have a paper
or plastic bag?!

407
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:40,562
Huh? Why?!

408
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,322
Just hurry and find one!

409
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,332
Hey, Hachi.

410
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,272
Humans are such
pathetic creatures.

411
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:53,202
The harder they struggle,
the deeper they sink.

412
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,982
If I were to be born again,
I wanna be a fish.

413
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:06,432
Ren and I, just the two of us would
swim in a small fish tank.

414
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:12,292
I reached into the sky

415
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:18,802
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

416
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:24,182
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

417
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:30,172
Like colorful balloons

418
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,292
I'm alone

419
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,022
My hand had no place to go

420
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:42,652
And gently you took it

421
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:43,832
Starless night

422
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:48,032
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

423
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:53,832
I want to feel your warmth

424
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:55,712
Tears are falling down

425
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:59,812
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

426
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:06,312
Of your hand holding mine
