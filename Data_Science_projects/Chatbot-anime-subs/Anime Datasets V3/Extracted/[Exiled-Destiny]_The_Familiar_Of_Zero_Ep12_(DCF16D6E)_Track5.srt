1
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,555
This is... Lord Wales'...

2
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,803
The letter has been taken,

3
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,939
and the Prince's life was taken
in front of my eyes...

4
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:21,743
The greatest responsibility
for all of this is mine.

5
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,904
I couldn't see the truth
about Wardes...

6
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:32,880
Now, lift your head, Louise Françoise.

7
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,652
Thank you for his final
memento and will...

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,160
Thank you, Louise...

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,404
Princess...

10
00:00:54,542 --> 00:01:00,448
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

11
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:08,947
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

12
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:19,493
The sky where two moons
never fade away

13
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:25,564
That's an impossibility, right?

14
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:32,514
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

15
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:38,119
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

16
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,581
Even if you trip and
become depressed

17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,029
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

18
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:58,907
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

19
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:05,246
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

20
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:11,186
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

21
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:19,685
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

22
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,965
Zero Treasure

23
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:34,042
Isn't this another false lead, as usual?

24
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:37,239
This time, I am sure that
this information is true!

25
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,205
Come in.

26
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,844
Oh, Miss Vallière.

27
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:46,816
Hello, Mr. Colbert...

28
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,658
Um... I'm here to report...

29
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,092
All right, I'll accept
your vacation notice.

30
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,332
About how many days?

31
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,300
We are heading to the village of Talb,

32
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,704
so I believe that we will be back
by the solar eclipse at the latest.

33
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:04,331
Then, if you will excuse me...

34
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,149
Mr. Colbert is taking some time off?

35
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:19,020
Apparently, he has found the
location of the legendary dragon.

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,122
Legendary dragon?

37
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:24,225
He's gone on a search for
a legendary something in the past,

38
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:26,861
and almost stranded himself
out in the ocean.

39
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,364
Well, I'm not counting on him much.

40
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,332
Now, let's hear the report.

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,589
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,742
The Reconquista?

43
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,278
This looks like it will be
rather troublesome.

44
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:46,915
Thank you for the hard work.
You should take a nice vacation.

45
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,349
Um, Old Osman?

46
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,946
Do you know about the
descendant of the Void?

47
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:57,258
My memory is uncertain,

48
00:03:57,258 --> 00:04:01,129
and I don't know who it was
that called me that,

49
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,730
but I'm sure...

50
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,067
Void is the legendary element of
magic that has long been lost.

51
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,201
Legendary?

52
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,237
Such amazing magic...

53
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:14,042
Or rather, even normal magic
for me is, well, um...

54
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,840
You don't have to go into the details.

55
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,248
I guess Gundolf is for real as well.

56
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,675
Gundolf?

57
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,191
Saito is the legendary familiar?

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,660
That's impossible.

59
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:36,197
Here we go...

60
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,357
I'm back.

61
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,669
What is it?

62
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,440
I can't stay in clothes stained
from such a long journey!

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,805
So I was just changing clothes.

64
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,212
Oh, so there was more laundry.

65
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,213
Geez.

66
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:55,450
If you complain too much,
you can do without food!

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,678
Yeah, yeah...

68
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:01,279
How can you go back
to normal like that?

69
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:08,919
You kissed me!

70
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:10,721
You know...

71
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,791
What is it?

72
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,836
How do I put it...

73
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:15,996
Cheer up, okay?

74
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:20,399
Well, this is about all I can say.

75
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,038
Saito...

76
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,755
The elastic is broken.

77
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,791
Yeah, it's broken for sure.

78
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,925
What does that mean?

79
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,450
You say that, but...

80
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:44,923
Oh, well.

81
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,402
You don't suppose, back then...

82
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:49,103
Back then?

83
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:50,434
Oh, no, nothing.

84
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,877
I mean, it's not something
I did on purpose!

85
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,846
I'm just disciplining a familiar

86
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,516
that doesn't take good care
of his master's belongings.

87
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:04,886
I can't possibly be disciplined
over a pair of panties!

88
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,954
It's not that I wanted to do that
when I did it, either!

89
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,323
That's right! You're just a familiar
because you can't help it,

90
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:11,893
because otherwise you can't eat!

91
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,054
That's right! Looks like
you do understand!

92
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:17,799
If you hate it that much,
you can get out of here!

93
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,534
Oh, is that so?

94
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:23,834
This familiar will follow his
master's orders, master!

95
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,114
That hurt!

96
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,048
Geez!

97
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,313
I was looking out for her!
That selfish girl!

98
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,390
Why did I do such a thing?

99
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,487
"Such a thing"?

100
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:47,788
Siesta!

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,024
That outfit...

102
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,403
I was granted vacation,
so I'm going home for a while.

103
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,438
I see, going back home.

104
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:59,574
It's a rather small village.

105
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:01,474
At least, you're lucky you have
a place to go back to.

106
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:04,512
Come to think of it, you said before

107
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:06,481
that your grandfather
came from another world?

108
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:08,916
Yes, that would be my
great-grandfather.

109
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,441
Can you tell me the
details of that story?

110
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:15,189
I was on a desperate journey
for the sake of our country,

111
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,826
but Montmorency thinks that
I went on vacation to cheat on her.

112
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:21,162
That's all thanks to your
usual everyday behavior.

113
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,130
So can you tell her...

114
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,565
Geez, Saito, are you cheating
with a girl like that again?

115
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,206
Kirche! My favor...

116
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:33,207
Shut up!

117
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,902
Two dragons?!

118
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:37,979
Yes.

119
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,114
The first one disappeared
in the solar eclipse,

120
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:44,852
and my great-grandfather was
aboard the second dragon.

121
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:47,054
One disappeared from there,

122
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:50,182
and the other fell
somewhere, they say.

123
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,028
Seriously? And what
happened to that dragon?

124
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,596
Apparently, it is a family heirloom,

125
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:57,932
and has been enshrined somewhere.

126
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,301
Though I've never seen it.

127
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,169
Siesta!

128
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:01,335
Yes?
Siesta!

129
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:01,669
Yes?

130
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,069
Yes?
Can you take me to your village?

131
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,138
Can you take me to your village?

132
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,007
What?

133
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,909
Did you hear that?

134
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,244
Yeah... A treasure...

135
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:12,079
Tabitha, what do you think?

136
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,414
Not interested.

137
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,609
I'm super-interested!

138
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,118
Back then, I hated it,
but I couldn't help it...

139
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:31,966
Geez!

140
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,366
Why can't I get it out of my mind?!

141
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,436
I've said too much. I'm sorry...

142
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,981
No, that doesn't sound
dignified enough as a master.

143
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,472
I'll forgive you. You should be
thankful of it!

144
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,542
Maybe a bit too harsh?

145
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,525
Where did he go?

146
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:05,924
Someone's trying to apologize here...

147
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,080
Siesta?

148
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,283
She just left, saying she was
going to see her folks back home.

149
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:23,284
Going home?

150
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:27,955
Yeah. To the village of Talb.
Anything wrong with Siesta?

151
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,422
No, nothing. Thank you.

152
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:32,059
Siesta's home, is it?!

153
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,628
That dog is always in heat!

154
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:36,063
He kissed me, yet... Kissed me, yet...

155
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:38,463
Kissed me, yet... Kissed me, yet...

156
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,097
He kissed me, yet...

157
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:45,339
The village of Talb?

158
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,704
I've heard of it somewhere.

159
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,245
It's just a little more.

160
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:53,014
It's really nice here.

161
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,416
Um, is it all right?

162
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,118
What is?

163
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,786
Coming out here without
permission from Miss Vallière...

164
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,048
It's all right.

165
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,118
Mr. Saito...

166
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,009
I'll wait here.

167
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,379
Here? Please come to our house.

168
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:28,143
I'd like to properly introduce you
to everyone in the family.

169
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:29,638
Properly...

170
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:32,687
Come on, wouldn't that cause
a misunderstanding?

171
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,422
I see.

172
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:37,050
Oh, well, um... If you
get that depressed...

173
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,492
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,393
This is important to you,
isn't it, Mr. Saito?

175
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,499
Then I'll look up the location of
the treasure, and be right back.

176
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:49,170
Thanks. Sorry to be a bother, Siesta.

177
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,137
It's all right.

178
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,774
She's such a good girl.

179
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,076
Yeah,

180
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:59,080
much more than that selfish girl
that has nothing but pride.

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,182
But your real feelings
are over there, after all?

182
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,173
Of course not! You stay quiet!

183
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,086
The village of Talb is right up ahead!

184
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,463
I secretly brought out what was
hidden in the back of the shed.

185
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:17,198
Is the dragon here?

186
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:20,601
Apparently, the correct name
for it is the Robe of the Dragon.

187
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:21,469
Robe?

188
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,403
Yes.

189
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:26,140
I heard that my great-grandfather
flew from another world using it.

190
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,072
Using?

191
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,200
There they are.

192
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,107
Kirche?

193
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,184
Mole?

194
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:42,650
That means...

195
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:44,458
Hey.

196
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:44,859
You guys... Why...
Hey.

197
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:45,626
You guys... Why...

198
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,129
Or rather, what for?

199
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:51,799
Of course, it's to look for the treasure!

200
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,096
What?!

201
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:58,205
It's this cave?

202
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,141
I'm so excited!

203
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,743
You know, I'm not
playing around here.

204
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,378
Neither am I.

205
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:07,448
I have the fine objective of
finding a hidden treasure,

206
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,450
so that Montmorency will get
a better opinion of me!

207
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,816
What a grand objective!

208
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:16,780
I'm so looking forward to this.
I couldn't do much back in Albion.

209
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,226
Albion...

210
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:21,395
I wonder what happened
to them after that incident.

211
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,631
Lord Cromwell!

212
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:25,166
Lord Cromwell!

213
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,468
Finally, the Tudor family
that had been using

214
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:29,670
this country of Albion for
themselves have all fallen.

215
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,273
Glory to the newly reborn Albion!

216
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:37,267
Hurray for Albion! Hurray for Albion!

217
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:41,816
I wonder how far this goes?

218
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:45,886
I don't know. Not even the
village folk get near here.

219
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:48,354
It's said to have a nest of orc demons.

220
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,850
Say things like that before we go in!

221
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:54,553
Someone is coming.

222
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:56,230
Someone?

223
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,891
Someone other than us...

224
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,760
These are footsteps, right?

225
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:03,771
From behind us...

226
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,136
Seems that way.

227
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:07,541
Who is it?!

228
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,442
Who's there?!

229
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,344
Siesta, behind me!

230
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,402
Okay!

231
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:17,518
That was a warning.

232
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:20,254
If you value your life, leave now!

233
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:21,288
Dammit!

234
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:22,380
Verdande!

235
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:24,725
Wait, this voice...

236
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:28,429
You thieves, going after
a valuable historical relic!

237
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:29,919
Mr. Colbert!

238
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,261
You guys?

239
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,260
Louise?!

240
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,609
I gained information that the
ruins of the dragon was here,

241
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,277
and I came here to excavate,

242
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:45,246
but to think that all of you would...

243
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,314
So our objectives are the same?

244
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:48,338
Objective?

245
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,318
Oh... This is...

246
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,344
Then, are you someone who is
of the blood of another world?

247
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:56,924
To think that such a valuable
piece of research material

248
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,393
was so close at hand!
What an oversight!

249
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:00,928
It's just a legend,

250
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:03,264
and I'm not sure whether
that map is correct or not...

251
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:05,733
I'm here as an aide to our
instructor's research.

252
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,302
It's not that I came chasing
after you or anything.

253
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,004
I didn't say anything.

254
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,605
I didn't want you to misunderstand,

255
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,040
so I just said it first!

256
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,905
And why would I misunderstand?!

257
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:19,914
You know, lovers' quarrels
are nice and all...

258
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:21,415
It's not a lover's quarrel!

259
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,905
But you'll be left behind.

260
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,487
This is turning out to be
just like a class.
Watch your step!
Don't get out of line!

261
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,388
It was a fun treasure hunt
in the beginning.
Watch your step!
Don't get out of line!

262
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:27,955
It was a fun treasure hunt
in the beginning.

263
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,582
No time for small talk!

264
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,789
This is...

265
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,404
Amazing.

266
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,739
How fitting, for a hidden
treasure to rest here.

267
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,297
And the treasure?

268
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:51,241
According to the map,
it's around here.

269
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:55,815
That is...

270
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:06,527
If it's a key of this nature,

271
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,518
it looks like it can be
unlocked with magic.

272
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,799
Tabitha, what are you looking at?

273
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,275
Those are unfamiliar letters.

274
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,945
Okay, it's opening up!

275
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,812
Navy Ensign, Sasaki Takeo,

276
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,448
rests here in another world...

277
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,286
You can read it?

278
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,051
It's Japanese...

279
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,292
The language of my home country.

280
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,690
What?!

281
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,364
Here it is! This is it!

282
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:49,870
What is this?

283
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,633
I've never seen anything
like this before.

284
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,534
This is the Robe of the Dragon?

285
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,702
You're kidding...

286
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,679
I'm certain.

287
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,351
There's no doubt about it.

288
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,420
A Zero fighter!

289
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:23,704
It looks like it has been preserved
with stability magic.

290
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,739
To think it really existed...

291
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,640
You know, when I first
saw you, Siesta,

292
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:32,043
somehow, I got
a feeling of nostalgia...

293
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:36,879
I see. The black hair and eyes
came from Japanese blood.

294
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,553
Japanese?

295
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:43,614
Your great-grandfather and I
come from the same world.

296
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:45,883
Saito!

297
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:50,358
You might be able to
return to your world!

298
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,402
They appeared together
with the solar eclipse,

299
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:59,006
and one Robe of the Dragon
disappeared into the eclipse.

300
00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:02,643
Why couldn't the other one, in other
words, this one, return as well?

301
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:04,845
It is said that my great-grandfather

302
00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:08,549
flew around in the skies even
after the other Robe disappeared,

303
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,517
and in due time landed...

304
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:13,554
I believe he missed
the right timing for it.

305
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:14,521
Timing?

306
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,461
The solar eclipse must have
ended while he was flying,

307
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,019
and he couldn't return.

308
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,499
In other words, if you
fly into the solar eclipse

309
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,234
with this Robe of the Dragon,

310
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:30,237
perhaps you will be able to fly
back into your alternate world?

311
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,439
Then, if Mr. Saito was
to get inside this,

312
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,708
and plunge into the solar eclipse,

313
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,510
he can go back to his world?

314
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,646
Well, that is only an assumption
that I've made,

315
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,705
but that possibility is rather high.

316
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,747
There's a chance that I can go back?

317
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:49,489
Saito is going to be gone...

318
00:17:54,595 --> 00:18:00,090
Then what of the letter sent to
Wales of Albion, my nephew?

319
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:04,602
There is no mistake,
Archduchess Marian.

320
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,708
I have received word from Germania

321
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,144
that they would like to
call off the engagement.

322
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:16,845
My haphazard actions have
caused this situation.

323
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:20,254
Please, punish me
however much you want.

324
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:25,521
You have been through
enough pain already,

325
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,587
with the death of your loved one.

326
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,900
That which has passed
cannot be helped.

327
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,574
Let us accept all of it as destiny.

328
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:43,973
Mother...

329
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,819
Your Highness!

330
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,616
There is a crisis!

331
00:18:57,124 --> 00:19:00,594
To think you'd really find it...

332
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:04,631
I thought you'd get stranded up
in the mountains this time.

333
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:05,532
I thank you for your efforts

334
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,602
in transporting and becoming
caretaker of the Robe.

335
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,637
Something of this caliber...

336
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:13,540
I'm sure I can get permission
to have it at the Institute

337
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,566
as valuable research material
deemed by the Palace.

338
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,977
Now for fuel...

339
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,050
That's right!

340
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,948
Mr. Colbert!

341
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:30,290
If you can make lots of this,

342
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,292
I'm sure the Robe of
the Dragon will work!

343
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,627
Oh, just as I thought!

344
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,230
I was not mistaken when I thought
that was the blood of the dragon?!

345
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,065
It's not blood, it's gasoline.

346
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:39,157
Gasoline?

347
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,328
Hup...

348
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,597
This is the rudder...

349
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,877
And this is the pitch lever...

350
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:52,613
Is this for real? I really know it all!

351
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:55,182
That's why I told you
you'd know if you got on.

352
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:58,785
You can freely use all sorts
of arms and weapons.

353
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,616
That's what this is, right?

354
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:05,552
Yeah, there's no mistake that
this was a weapon of war.

355
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,637
Saito...

356
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,040
Saito is going to be gone...

357
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:35,989
Louise!

358
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,991
We have a huge problem!

359
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,626
Shut up.

360
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,228
I just heard in the village...

361
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:45,432
What did you hear?
Another rumor of a cute girl?

362
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:46,733
Albion...

363
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,768
Albion?!

364
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:51,295
Albion changed its name to the
New State of the Reconquista...

365
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:54,441
And declared war on Tristein!

366
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,068
You're kidding, right?

367
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,714
But when is a solar eclipse coming?

368
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,788
All of Albion, nobles
and peasants alike,

369
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,655
are bowing down in servitude
to you, Your Excellency.

370
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,996
What should be feared is the
magical power hidden in this ring.

371
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:20,867
It was worth the efforts taken in
taking it from the Water Spirit.

372
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,837
But this is only a foothold,

373
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:27,174
in order to take the
entire continent as mine.

374
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,343
Next, we will take the country

375
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:32,179
in the center of the
continent, Tristein.

376
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,806
We have already set up for that.

377
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:37,718
Tristein no longer has
anywhere to escape to.

378
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:40,954
They're no match for the
esteemed Dragoons of Albion,

379
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:42,751
as soon as we send them in.

380
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,794
Now, when will this land of Albion
be closest to the continent?

381
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:48,886
In three days...

382
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,796
On the day of the solar eclipse.

383
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:11,310
As if I were under a real magic spell

384
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:22,352
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

385
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:34,041
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

386
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:45,145
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

387
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:57,126
My true feelings, the
shards of loneliness

388
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:07,997
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

389
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:14,245
For the day to start from zero

390
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:28,895
Since when has there been pain in my
heart when we have an argument?

391
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,464
Since when is it that I can't help

392
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,966
but think of the girl that's
standing next to you?

393
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,866
Farewell, Saito.
