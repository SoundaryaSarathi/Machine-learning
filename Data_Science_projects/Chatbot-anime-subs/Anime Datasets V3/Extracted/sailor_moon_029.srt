1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,436
What?! I didn't know Motoki
had a girlfriend!

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:09,307
Zoisite! Anyone who gets
in the way of lovers

3
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:11,943
deserves to get kicked by a horse,
and turned into a pancake!

4
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,412
What? It's not your fault?

5
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,780
As if I care!

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,511
Sailor Moon is looking for
a boyfriend right now.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

8
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

10
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

12
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

13
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

17
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:02,401
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of
love and justice, Sailor Moon.

18
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,178
But it's not easy, you know.

19
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:08,147
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

20
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,116
before the bad guys get it,

21
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:14,780
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

22
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:19,459
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

23
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,256
so it'll work out somehow.

24
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:32,135
Total Chaos!
The Messy Square Relationship

25
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:38,575
We have a ten percent
chance of rain today.

26
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:45,952
What?!

27
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,788
Darn it! You can never believe
the weather forecast!

28
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,756
"Ten percent" my butt!
I can't believe it!

29
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,796
Hey, watch where you're going!

30
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,331
Sorry...

31
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,027
If "sorry" solved problems,
we wouldn't need the police!

32
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,803
Oh, that voice is...

33
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:05,430
Motoki...

34
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,637
Mako, are you all right?

35
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,735
Yes...

36
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,202
I'm really sorry.
I was a little lost in thought.

37
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:18,384
Don't you have an umbrella?
Then, I'II...

38
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:21,387
Motoki's voice sounds so much like

39
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,287
my senior in school who
broke my heart.

40
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:27,487
Oh, I wish time would just stop now.

41
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,456
Mako.

42
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,430
Shall we go now?

43
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,633
Oh, okay...

44
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,035
Mako, I heard that you're a good cook.

45
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:37,236
Oh, I guess.

46
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:39,572
That's great. Cook me something
when you get a chance.

47
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:40,907
Of course, anytime!

48
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:43,710
And please let me do the cleaning
as well, while you're at it.

49
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,701
Wow, that would be a great help!

50
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:47,580
Here!

51
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,606
Write down your address, phone
number and your favorite dishes!

52
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:55,777
Here. Mako, you're so funny.

53
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:58,483
Everyone says that!

54
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,456
So, your favorite dish is
rice with hashed beef.

55
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:07,299
I wish it had kept raining longer.

56
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,366
Oh, nothing!

57
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:13,106
Mako, I'm sorry, but I need
to stop by my school.

58
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:14,971
Oh, I see.

59
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:19,512
Then I'll come over next Sunday to
make rice with hashed beef!

60
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:20,780
Makoto Kino, heading home now!

61
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,481
Oh, um...
Makoto Kino, heading home now!

62
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,038
Oh, um...

63
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,715
You've made a cute little friend.

64
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,719
Reika.

65
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,382
Is she your new girlfriend that
Mamoru was talking about?

66
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,555
Don't start on that.

67
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,028
I'm just kidding.

68
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,430
By the way, considering
how you're dressed,

69
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,227
is our date tonight canceled again?

70
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:42,668
I'm sorry! It looks like it's going
to take all night!

71
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:46,069
It's okay. More importantly, did you
make up your mind about that?

72
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,542
I'm still not sure.

73
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,378
I see. It's a decision that'll
change your life,

74
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,903
so you should think it over
carefully before deciding.

75
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,148
You're so sweet.

76
00:04:58,117 --> 00:04:59,345
But...

77
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:01,154
What?

78
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,789
Yo, you two!

79
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,689
Oh, Mamoru.

80
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,929
Oh, shoot! Mamoru, if you've got time,

81
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:12,261
have tea or something
with Motoki for me.

82
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,662
I'll call you later!

83
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:18,703
What's wrong? Got a problem?

84
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:20,469
Well, Reika's...

85
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:25,235
She may go to Africa to study.

86
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,571
Africa? Just what kind of
research is she doing?

87
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,383
That's the really amazing thing!

88
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:34,187
It's research on finding out
where life began on Earth!

89
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:36,155
So, what's going to happen?

90
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:37,790
I don't know. It seems like
she's still not sure.

91
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,190
That's not what I meant!
I was asking you!

92
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:43,356
Well, I want her to stay
close by if possible,

93
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,599
but I can't restrict her future.

94
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,430
That sounds just like you.

95
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,438
Oh, I just remembered!
Do you like rice with hashed beef?

96
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:54,273
What? No, not particularly.

97
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,541
Oh, okay.

98
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,177
Mako's coming over to cook
for me in a couple of days.

99
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:59,779
If you want, you can join us...

100
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,076
Mako?

101
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,549
Oh, one of Usagi's friends?

102
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,985
You know how Usagi feels
about you, right?

103
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,054
Yeah, they're both cute.

104
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,822
Cute?

105
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,692
You know, you were just talking
about Reika earlier.

106
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,887
You gotta be joking.
They're still in middle school.

107
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:16,395
Hi, I'm cute little Rei!

108
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:18,264
It's not like that.

109
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:21,501
I just think if I had kid sisters,
they'd be like them.

110
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,059
Kid sisters, huh?

111
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,198
Could it be that Motoki's
incredibly dense?

112
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,682
Kohan

113
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:36,983
Kohan
Coming.

114
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:37,915
Coming.

115
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:43,146
Good morning! It's Makoto Kino!

116
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,454
Wait, wait a second!

117
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,061
Hi, Mako. What's up?

118
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:50,530
Well, excuse me!

119
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,827
What?!

120
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,799
It's a mess in here.

121
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:58,293
Don't worry! I know men don't
clean their rooms often...

122
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,304
Or maybe never.

123
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,175
Kamikaze

124
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:02,475
Kamikaze
Okay! Let's do it!

125
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:06,411
Okay! Let's do it!

126
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:08,714
Do? Do what?

127
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:11,774
Oh, come on. Cleaning, of course.
Cleaning!

128
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,687
I'll have to do it in 30 minutes,
or I'll be late.

129
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,018
Okay, let's do it!

130
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:26,725
Who is this?

131
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,728
Oh, her name's Reika.

132
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,160
She's not your younger sister, is she?

133
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,840
Oh! Is she your girlfriend?!

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,603
Oh, well, sort of...

135
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:44,616
Juban Municipal Junior High School

136
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,643
It's rare to see you agonizing
over something.

137
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:50,553
Mako!

138
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,957
What's wrong? You seem kind of down.

139
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:56,057
Did someone break your heart again?
Just kidding!

140
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,965
It pisses me off when someone
says it so straight up!

141
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,432
I was just kidding.

142
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,037
Anyway, yours truly, the cupid of love,
is here to listen.

143
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:08,441
Maybe you'd be better off worrying
about yourself instead?

144
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,703
Luna!

145
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,945
It could help just to talk.
Who broke your heart?

146
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,215
Motoki.

147
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:16,849
Shock!
Motoki.

148
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,440
Shock!

149
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,355
There's nothing for you to be
so surprised about.

150
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:28,351
Yes, I do. I have feelings for
Motoki... Motoki...

151
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,432
I love Motoki, too!

152
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:34,567
What?! You do?!

153
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,434
That's terrible! Terrible!
What?! You do?!

154
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,136
That's terrible! Terrible!

155
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:40,230
But I thought you were in love
with Tuxedo Mask.

156
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:43,376
I love them both!

157
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,011
Make up your mind!

158
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:47,813
Hold on a second.
Both of you, stop it!

159
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,516
He's got a right to choose, too,
you know...

160
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:51,017
Oh!
He's got a right to choose, too,
you know...

161
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:51,717
Oh!
Now, what?

162
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,452
Now, what?

163
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:56,656
If Motoki broke Mako's heart,

164
00:08:56,656 --> 00:09:00,251
it means that Motoki
has somebody else.

165
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,656
In other words,
that somebody else is...

166
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:05,531
Me!

167
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,132
Wrong! Her name is Miss Reika!
Me!

168
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:08,100
Wrong! Her name is Miss Reika!

169
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:13,472
What?! No way! I can't go on now.

170
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,167
Pull yourself together.

171
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,843
So what if he has a girlfriend?

172
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:19,078
We've got nothing to lose
if he says no.

173
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,246
We just keep trying to win him over!

174
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:20,646
Mako...
We just keep trying to win him over!

175
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:21,510
Mako...

176
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:24,139
Crying doesn't help anything.

177
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,883
You're right. If we don't keep trying...

178
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:30,980
There's no tomorrow for
the sailor warriors!

179
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:35,084
Why is it that I feel there's
no tomorrow regardless?

180
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,423
Crown

181
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,198
Are you ready?!

182
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,567
No hard feelings, no matter
who wins, okay?

183
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:45,401
Okay! So, let's go in order
of height here.

184
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:48,040
What is this, P.E. Class?

185
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,942
Yo, dumpling head!

186
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:51,844
Here comes another useless guy.

187
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:54,580
The dumpling head and the big one
are here together...

188
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,482
I get it. Is it confession time?

189
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,550
Uh-oh!

190
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,951
Bull's Eye
Here's some friendly advise.
Just forget about Motoki.

191
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,186
Here's some friendly advise.
Just forget about Motoki.

192
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:02,586
What's with you?!
This is none of your business!

193
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,390
You're such a jerk!

194
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,827
I'm just saying you're both like
troublesome kid sisters to him.

195
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,658
Nothing more, nothing less.

196
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,660
Kid sisters?

197
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,332
You're lying!

198
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:14,767
It's not a lie.

199
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,463
If you don't believe me, why don't you
ask him yourself, dumpling head!

200
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,805
Don't worry.
I'll ask him about it anyway!

201
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:23,342
And I'm not dumpling head!
My name is Usagi Tsukino!

202
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:24,610
Honestly! How many times
do I have to tell you?!

203
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,441
Yes, Ma'am, dumpling head!

204
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,412
Motoki!

205
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,921
Oh, Usagi, Motoki is off today.

206
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,047
D'oh.

207
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,363
Do you know that Motoki
has a girlfriend?

208
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:45,887
Miss Reika, right?

209
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,432
What are middle school kids
thinking these days?

210
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,571
Oh, but if she goes to study abroad,

211
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,373
it's not like you guys wouldn't
have a chance...

212
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:54,974
What?! Study abroad?!
It's not like you guys wouldn't
have a chance...

213
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:56,108
What?! Study abroad?!

214
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,944
What are you saying?!
Tell me all the details!

215
00:10:58,944 --> 00:10:59,612
Oh!
What are you saying?!
Tell me all the details!

216
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,941
I should never have said that.

217
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,478
Mr. Nasty Guy!

218
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:19,459
So, this girl is our next target.

219
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,666
A model student at
Azabu Technical College.

220
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,438
She is quite beautiful.

221
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,573
Master Kunzite! How could you?!

222
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:29,775
Under that skin, she is
an ugly monster!

223
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,743
And you think she is better than I...

224
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:35,478
Zoisite, jealousy does not suit
such a beautiful face.

225
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,216
Zoisite...

226
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:38,484
I don't know you anymore!

227
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,851
Even this rose is no match
for your beauty.

228
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:43,785
Master Kunzite.

229
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:47,555
I shall bring you the rainbow
crystal without fail.

230
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,350
Azabu Technical College

231
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:15,913
I came here to convince Reika
to study abroad, but...

232
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:18,525
What should I say to her?

233
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:21,127
Let's try raising the temperature of
the subject a little more tomorrow.

234
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,163
Yes, that could be interesting.

235
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:23,930
Bye, I'll see you tomorrow!

236
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,931
Good night!
Bye, I'll see you tomorrow!

237
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:25,158
Good night!

238
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:26,989
It's her.

239
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,069
Oh, excuse me...

240
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,072
Oh, you're the girl who
was with Motoki.

241
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,773
What do you want to
talk to me about?

242
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:37,577
Well... Do you intend to study abroad?

243
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,646
My, news certainly gets around.

244
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,047
I know, was it Motoki who told you?

245
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:42,912
Please don't dodge the subject.

246
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,652
I don't know yet.

247
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,055
I'm still undecided.

248
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,459
The university over there has
a professor that I admire,

249
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,327
but parting with Motoki is...
If Motoki would stop me...

250
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,092
Hold it! Just who do you
think you are!

251
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,903
You wouldn't go if Motoki
asked you not to?!

252
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:05,337
If that's how you feel, forget
about studying abroad!

253
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,375
You can only choose one!
Love or study abroad!

254
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,777
He who runs after two hares
will catch neither!

255
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:14,008
Shoot! I came here to convince
her to study abroad.

256
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:18,411
The weight of this bag is the
weight of my love! Yeah!

257
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,253
Oh, we turn right here.

258
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,619
Mako, you sure know the way well.

259
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:26,118
Finally, I get to see
Motoki's apartment.

260
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,763
Motoki...

261
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:35,224
Usagi, you look so nice in that apron...
Will you marry me?

262
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,433
Marry you?

263
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,702
Usagi...

264
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,676
Oh, but...

265
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:45,245
I'm still not ready emotionally.

266
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:47,543
But if it's with you, Motoki...

267
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,383
Usagi! Usagi!

268
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:50,817
Stop it!

269
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:51,518
What?
Stop it!

270
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:51,751
Stop it!

271
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,119
Oh!

272
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,555
Believe me, you'll never need
to worry about that!

273
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:56,112
Kohan

274
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:59,526
Oh, welcome, you two.
Come on in.

275
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:02,295
Wow, it's so clean, just like
I thought it'd be!

276
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,331
I guess a nice guy really does
keep a neat room, too!

277
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:04,564
Gag!
I guess a nice guy really does
keep a neat room, too!

278
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:05,365
Gag!
Gag!

279
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:05,699
Gag!
Oh! A half-finished cup of coffee.

280
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:08,031
Oh! A half-finished cup of coffee.

281
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,671
Sniff, sniff! I can smell Motoki.

282
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:13,400
What did you come here for anyway?

283
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:14,899
Usagi.

284
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:19,904
What? Oh, no, not yet.
I'm still not emotionally ready.

285
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,882
Wow, you're amazing, Usagi!

286
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:25,452
I didn't know you need to prepare
emotionally to cook.

287
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,086
What?!

288
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:26,720
Come on, Usagi, shall we get started?
What?!

289
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,584
Come on, Usagi, shall we get started?

290
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:31,057
Okay! Let's do it!
Mako, just tell me what to do!

291
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,859
Then would you peel the carrots?

292
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,861
What? I'm not good at peeling things.

293
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:37,030
Then would you mince the onions?

294
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,191
What?! I don't wanna do that,
it'll make me cry!

295
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,101
Then, would you cook the rice?

296
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,403
What?! I don't know
how to wash rice...

297
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:43,503
Bash
What?! I don't know
how to wash rice...

298
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:43,867
What?! I don't know
how to wash rice...

299
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,039
You are just unbelievable!

300
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,506
But...
You are just unbelievable!

301
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:47,268
But...

302
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,074
Hello. Reika?

303
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:57,908
Motoki, I... I've decided.
I'm going to Africa.

304
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,781
What? I can't hear you.

305
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:04,515
I made my decision.
I want to see you, Motoki.

306
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,293
Okay. Okay. I'll be right there.

307
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:07,727
What?!
Okay. Okay. I'll be right there.

308
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:08,421
What?!

309
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,098
Usagi, Mako, I'm sorry, but...

310
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:14,668
Oh, okay, okay.
We'll see you later!

311
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:15,735
Oh, were you listening?

312
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:16,536
Moron!
Oh, were you listening?

313
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:16,970
Moron!
Watch the place for me while I'm gone.

314
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,198
Watch the place for me while I'm gone.

315
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,836
Ouch! I cut my finger!

316
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:31,510
He's so late.

317
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,887
Oh, and here I was, wondering
why she was so late.

318
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,718
So, she's still over here.

319
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:40,816
Oh, no! There's a rainbow
crystal close by!

320
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:41,428
Smack!
Ouch!

321
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:42,162
Ouch!

322
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:44,062
Huh? What? What's going on?

323
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,533
Both of you, transform now!

324
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:50,136
Oh, Motoki hasn't come back!
I'm getting mad!

325
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,137
That's right!

326
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,773
He invites two pretty girls over and
makes them watch his place!

327
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,875
Motoki, you big jerk!

328
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,943
Usagi...

329
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,311
I'm just kidding.

330
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:01,303
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

331
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,153
Jupiter Power Makeup!

332
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:51,197
You're quite brave. But you should
stop wasting your time.

333
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,222
You could never defeat me!

334
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,893
Barbarian.

335
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,599
Zoi!

336
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:06,539
Motoki!

337
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,848
Stay asleep for a while.

338
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,281
You, monster!

339
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,386
You are the truly ugly monster.

340
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:16,287
Monster Rikokayder, one of
the Seven Monsters!

341
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,882
Seven Monsters?!

342
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:24,292
That's right, you're a monster.
Now, look very carefully.

343
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,749
Rikokayder!

344
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:43,750
Miss Reika was...

345
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,218
A monster?!

346
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:47,812
Sailor Moon, Sailor Jupiter, be careful!

347
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:53,652
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

348
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,261
Today, we are not...

349
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,763
...the same as usual!

350
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,731
Broken heart power, 10,000 volts!

351
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,533
Currently looking for a new boyfriend!

352
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,501
Not Mako, too.

353
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:06,438
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

354
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,275
Girls who don't have boyfriends
are nothing!

355
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:12,312
What did you say?!
This is all your fault to begin with!

356
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,012
There!

357
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:13,546
Watch out!
There!

358
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:14,205
Watch out!

359
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,781
The rainbow crystal is mine now.

360
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:21,949
Who's there?!

361
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,096
So, you insist on interfering.

362
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,587
I will not let you have
the rainbow crystal!

363
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:35,168
Wow! Tuxedo Mask!

364
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:37,503
Hey, hey! What about Motoki?

365
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:40,267
Right now, my heart belongs to
Tuxedo Mask completely!

366
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,464
Here, here, here!

367
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:50,708
What is this?! It's disgusting!

368
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:54,254
The protist is the origin of all life.

369
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,356
And you are also one of them.

370
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,557
What?!

371
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,752
She's saying you've got
a single-celled mind.

372
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:02,195
My guardian, Jupiter!

373
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:06,564
Brew a storm! Call the clouds!
Send down the lightning!

374
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,761
Supreme

375
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,806
Thunder!

376
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,535
Big Flask!

377
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,316
My Supreme Thunder...

378
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,613
Here!

379
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:26,716
Watch out!

380
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,621
You saved me...

381
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,557
I can't believe my Supreme
Thunder won't work!

382
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:35,094
You dodged it, but I've still got
lots of lightning left.

383
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:38,086
Oh, no! Sailor Jupiter, do something!

384
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,734
I'll send both of you to Hell!

385
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:44,134
Bubble

386
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:49,673
Spray!

387
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:52,906
What is this?!

388
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,447
Ami!

389
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,248
Rei!

390
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,816
I'm glad we made it in time.

391
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,751
Did you know how long
it took to find you?

392
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,719
Fire

393
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:05,681
Soul!

394
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,267
You should take better care
of lab equipment!

395
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,169
Do not waste resources!

396
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:18,071
Come on, do your thing already.

397
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:19,672
Don't order me around!

398
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:22,575
It's your fault for being so spaced out!

399
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,043
Who's spaced out?!

400
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:26,011
That's enough!

401
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,014
Moon Healing Escalation!

402
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,418
Refresh!

403
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:48,165
Seems like they have
finished over there.

404
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,569
Looks like I have lost.
You can have the rainbow crystal.

405
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:01,279
You are so naive, Tuxedo Mask!
This rainbow crystal is mine!

406
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,981
Zoisite, I will return
the favor someday!

407
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,280
Motoki!

408
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:10,147
Reika!

409
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,332
Any passengers on Flight 658
to San Francisco,

410
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:22,563
who have not yet checked in,
please do so quickly.

411
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,671
Reika, I won't say good-bye to you.

412
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:27,907
Yes, I'll write you.

413
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,043
I'll wait for you, forever.

414
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:30,743
Motoki...

415
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:31,377
Passengers boarding Flight 762
to Nairobi, departing at 3:50,
Motoki...

416
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:36,249
Passengers boarding Flight 762
to Nairobi, departing at 3:50,

417
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,080
please come to #8 gate...
Well, I need to go now.

418
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,849
Be careful.

419
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,196
Mako, let's give up on Motoki.

420
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:53,866
But, Miss Reika might find
someone nice in Africa!

421
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,163
No way!

422
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:56,936
You counted yourself out!

423
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,438
No, I didn't!

424
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,305
You gave up on him, didn't you?

425
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:00,006
I haven't given up yet!
You gave up on him, didn't you?

426
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:00,840
I haven't given up yet!

427
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,442
Motoki's mine!

428
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:04,000
No, you can't have him!

429
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:14,609
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

430
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:18,258
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

431
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:25,960
It's a world no one knows about

432
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:29,864
With white shoes clicking

433
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:33,674
Cross the white moon bridge

434
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:41,740
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

435
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:48,417
Offer a prayer to the moon

436
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:57,158
It will surely bring you happiness

437
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:04,366
Go round and round,
the moon's merry-go-round

438
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:12,641
Make that serene dress made of glass
flutter in the wind

439
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:20,187
She's always watching over us

440
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:26,683
Moon, moon princess
