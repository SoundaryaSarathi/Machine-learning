1
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:05,992
If I saw everyone again right now...

2
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:10,702
I know that I'd depend on them
just as much as I did back then.

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,002
I'm scared of that.

4
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:17,412
That's why I can't move
from this spot.

5
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:24,092
Hey, Nana. The midsummer flowers
will bloom

6
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,082
along Tamagawa again this year.

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:31,382
We'll all be waiting for you
in room 707.

8
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:36,722
I even made matching yukatas for us.

9
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:46,472
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

10
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:49,342
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

11
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:56,192
Baby I'm standing alone

12
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,982
An unforgettable rainy day

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,992
Chasing after your shadow

14
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,862
And it's over, it's like sand now

15
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,162
I sigh every night

16
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:10,202
I scream like a child and cried

17
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:12,942
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

18
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:17,002
Please, please God, forgive my sins

19
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,742
I don't need to hide no more

20
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,682
Flowing toward the turquoise light

21
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,722
Just keep going on

22
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:28,322
You've got the chance now

23
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,522
You've got the power

24
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,022
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

25
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:33,662
I show you my life now

26
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,092
I show you my love now

27
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:38,322
I show you my everything yeah yeah

28
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:40,562
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

29
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,372
Don't ever change so be yourself

30
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,802
I'll show you my strength now

31
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,172
I'll show you my love now

32
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,442
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,472
Baby don't be afraid

34
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:57,112
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

35
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:59,812
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

36
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:02,592
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

37
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:05,492
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

38
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:03,982
Satsuki!

39
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,482
If you keep dawdling like that,
I'm going ahead!

40
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,092
Mommy!

41
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,382
A butterfly! There was a butterfly!

42
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:14,122
Huh?

43
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:15,592
It was big and black
and really pretty!

44
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,952
It's a famous butterfly!
I saw it in my book!

45
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,632
That must've been
a black swallowtail.

46
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:26,832
Black swallowtail?
It's not a butterfly?

47
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:30,172
It is a butterfly.
That kind is called a swallowtail.

48
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:33,942
A swallowtail?!

49
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,842
How's it different from
a normal butterfly?!

50
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:42,552
Oh boy. Lately, talking to Satsuki
reminds me

51
00:03:42,552 --> 00:03:44,352
of talking to Shin in the old days.

52
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:45,422
Why?

53
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,792
I guess it's because
he was like a six-year-old.

54
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,222
What about me?

55
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,402
Shin, you look fabulous!

56
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,762
That looks good on you!

57
00:03:56,972 --> 00:04:00,062
Really? How do I tie this thing?

58
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:01,842
I'll tie it for you.

59
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:04,602
Then make a butterfly bow
like yours.

60
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:08,172
Not allowed.
And this is not a butterfly bow.

61
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:12,142
It's called a Hanabunko.
It's how young girls tie their obi.

62
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,342
Really? Then you can't
wear it either, Hachi!

63
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:14,722
CHEEKY

64
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,822
CHEEKY
Shut up.

65
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:24,422
Today's the day of the annual Tamagawa
fireworks festival.

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,602
No matter how busy we are,

67
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,732
on this one day,
we meet up in this room.

68
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,032
Carrying the same pain inside.

69
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,412
Ahh, that's enough for me.

70
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,922
If I start drinking this early
in the day,

71
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,442
I won't make it to the fireworks.

72
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:54,012
But Yasu, you haven't
changed one bit.

73
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,592
You're like a living fossil.

74
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,992
It's not like I'd change in just
a few months.

75
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:02,662
No, you haven't changed at all
since high school.

76
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,032
So I bet you'd be the same
if you lived a thousand years.

77
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,102
You haven't changed much either, Nobu.
Including your height.

78
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,312
Shut up!

79
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:11,202
Nobu.

80
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,942
Why don't you go take a quick shower
and change into your yukata?

81
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:18,012
Oh, thanks! In fact,
would you mind filling the tub for me?

82
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,212
All right. Very well, young master.

83
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,722
Hey, what about Ren today?
Isn't he coming?

84
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,792
He'll be here in time for the fireworks.

85
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:30,262
He sure doesn't hurry for anyone,
as always.

86
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,692
Here you go, Satsuki!
I bought you a present!

87
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:35,552
Yumeko-chan!

88
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:37,132
- What about for me?
- I have nothing!

89
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:39,132
Mommy, look! Yumeko-chan!

90
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,442
And she's wearing a yukata!

91
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:40,542
RETRO DRESS-UP DOLL
And she's wearing a yukata!

92
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,402
RETRO DRESS-UP DOLL

93
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:47,182
So cute! Thank you, Nobu!
I love this Retro Doll series!

94
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,512
I didn't buy it for you!

95
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,622
Isn't that great, Satsuki?
Say thanks to the old man.

96
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:53,242
Old man?!

97
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,082
YUMEKO SERIES 7

98
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:56,292
YUMEKO SERIES 7
Thank you very much!

99
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:56,622
YUMEKO SERIES 7

100
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:06,522
The flow of time cleanses the past and
heals the wounds in people's hearts.

101
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,802
But there are wounds that
cannot be healed.

102
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:18,072
This room is just like it was then,
as if time had stopped.

103
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,782
Nana. Listen. It's about Nobu.

104
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,012
What about Nobuo?

105
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,522
Nana?

106
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,562
What are you doing?

107
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:48,762
Citron bath salts.

108
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,232
They have a great scent,
don't you think?

109
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:56,542
You don't need to worry so much.
I'm fine now.

110
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,242
It's hot...

111
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,732
I put out a towel for you,
young master.

112
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,212
Nana...

113
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,112
There are so many things
I wanna talk to you about now.

114
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:34,542
But in this apartment,
all I can see are memories.

115
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,032
- What's this?! It's awesome!
- Super view!

116
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:57,812
If we can see them from the room,

117
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,712
I guess there was no need
for the disguises.

118
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:00,842
Yeah.

119
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,912
Hey! Where's Hachiko?!
Why isn't she here?!

120
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,842
Maybe Takumi found out
and told her not to come.

121
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:11,012
Nah. That guy's not one to fuss over
something like going to see fireworks.

122
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:15,022
She'll be here eventually.
No news is proof that she's safe.

123
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:16,622
No, it's proof that something's wrong!

124
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,722
I have to get going.
Everyone's waiting.

125
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:50,192
If I break this promise,
I will be a traitor for sure this time.

126
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:56,232
But I can't stop crying.

127
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:57,522
Bye.

128
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:03,062
I thought I'd feel better once
we talked things over.

129
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,082
But now I realize that

130
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:10,342
I felt the most comfortable
when I was with Shoji.

131
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,812
We were good friends before
we went out.

132
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,452
I thought that once
the break-up drama died down

133
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,852
things could go back to
the way they used to be.

134
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,362
But now I've really lost him forever.

135
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:32,262
I should've treasured him more
back then.

136
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,802
SHIN

137
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,142
What should I do?

138
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,122
If I see Nobu now,

139
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,282
there's no way I could talk to him
and act normal.

140
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,522
I'll get sad and start crying
all over again.

141
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,692
Those with a record
must refrain, you know.

142
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,752
What should I do?

143
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:06,292
But I don't ever wanna betray them
again without saying anything.

144
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:11,172
If I can't go,
then I've gotta tell them that.

145
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,982
Hello, Hachiko?

146
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,682
Nana?

147
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,152
Where are you?

148
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,022
Near Jackson's.

149
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:31,052
I see. Well, hurry up!
The fireworks have already started.

150
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:38,792
I'm sorry.
I don't think... I can go...

151
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:41,542
Why not?!

152
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:48,102
Hey, why are you crying?
Is something wrong?

153
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:51,712
I'm so, .,

154
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,242
...scared of...

155
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,212
, ., seeing Nobu.

156
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:16,702
It's all right. Nobuo isn't here.

157
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,182
You know, that guy's got no guts.

158
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:30,452
He backed out at the last minute.
What a chicken.

159
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:33,722
THAT'S TRUE
He backed out at the last minute.
What a chicken.

160
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:33,952
He backed out at the last minute.
What a chicken.

161
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,882
So you've got nothing to worry about.
Hurry on over.

162
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:41,062
Shin and Yasu are really looking
forward to seeing you!

163
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,162
Don't be so cold by telling us
you can't come now.

164
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:51,062
I wanna see you, Hachiko. So hurry.

165
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:54,802
Okay.

166
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,752
Where are you going, Nobuo?

167
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:08,752
I'm going home.

168
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,922
If she says she doesn't
wanna see me, then I can't stay.

169
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,792
She didn't say that!

170
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:19,202
She says she's scared to see you.
Hachi's still in love with you!

171
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:21,472
Stop twisting things around
to how you want them to be!

172
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:25,442
No, I just know what it's like
to be so scared

173
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:28,072
of being swept away again!!

174
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,312
She's marrying Takumi in two weeks.

175
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:34,852
It's right around the corner.

176
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:37,622
But if you two fell back
in love now,

177
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,252
Hachi would be stuck in
an impossible situation!

178
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:40,962
Of course she's scared!

179
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:46,732
All the more reason
why I shouldn't see her.

180
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,532
Can't you just get stuck with her?!

181
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,572
Forget it.

182
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,812
After all, you probably just wanted
to comfort Hachi

183
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:06,582
who had been dumped
by her old boyfriend

184
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,282
and was being used by Takumi.

185
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,312
- You never really loved her.
- I do love her!

186
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,462
What do you know?!

187
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,822
But now you love that
girl next door, right?

188
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,322
I hear that girl has
the same condition as me.

189
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,492
She can't even go to work
without her medication.

190
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:25,862
So what? She's trying her best
in spite of that!

191
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:31,342
Since long ago,
you've always loved helping girls

192
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:35,402
who are stuck in some sort of situation
you had absolutely nothing to do with.

193
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:39,042
That way, you can always play
the part of the hero, right?

194
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:41,582
Nana, cut it out.

195
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:44,622
But then, the moment you feel
you're being pulled in,

196
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,282
you let go of her hand.

197
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,832
Nobu, she's just provoking you.
Don't mind her.

198
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,632
What an easygoing form of love.

199
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:16,442
Nana can be really cruel.

200
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:20,382
She's purposely trying to push them
into an impossible situation.

201
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,562
Of course, Nobu would react

202
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,752
and get serious from the way
he was confronted.

203
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,392
Hachi's gonna end up suffering
even more.

204
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:37,342
Nobu is a pacifist.
He's always tried his hardest to choose

205
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:40,372
the path that would make
everyone happy.

206
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:46,142
I don't think trying to avoid conflict
is the same as being easygoing.

207
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:50,872
I agree.

208
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,322
After all, it's a battle
against his own desires.

209
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,572
What would you like?

210
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,432
Miss? How many do you want?

211
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,842
Three.

212
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,982
I'll do everything
I can to make you happy.

213
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:48,312
I wanna see you, Hachiko.

214
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:53,482
So hurry.

215
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,862
If you two fell back in love now,

216
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:06,382
Hachi would be stuck
in an impossible situation.

217
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,812
It's been a while since
I've watched fireworks.

218
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:28,122
They sure are pretty.

219
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,582
This is the first time I've ever had
food from a food stand.

220
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,792
It's pretty good!

221
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,862
But it's hard to eat with chopsticks.

222
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,732
I wonder if any of the stands
have forks.

223
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,162
D-Don't spoil him!

224
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,162
Make him practice!

225
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:43,432
Don't grab me so suddenly!

226
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:44,732
My wig will shift!

227
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:45,892
HACHI

228
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,962
- Your wig!
- Hello?

229
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:50,442
Shin?

230
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:51,802
Yeah, what is it?

231
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,972
I got to the apartment,
but no one's answering.

232
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,312
Have you all gone ahead
to see the fireworks?

233
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,252
But the light's on in the room.

234
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:04,622
Where are you?

235
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,092
Shin?

236
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:13,262
Yeah. We couldn't wait any longer
and left. Sorry.

237
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,862
No, I should be the one apologizing
for being late.

238
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,362
I'll head over there right now.
Where are you watching it from?

239
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,202
Yeah. Got it.
I'll call again if I can't find you.

240
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,042
What? You're dressed as a girl?

241
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,352
Can't you just get stuck with her?!

242
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,072
What an easygoing form of love.

243
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:02,942
Over here!

244
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,582
Huh? No way! Shin?!
You're so cute!

245
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,842
Come on! Everyone's here.

246
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:12,852
They're so pretty!

247
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:14,652
Awesome!

248
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,522
They really are pretty, aren't they?

249
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,592
Come on, Shin.
You're sounding like Misato!

250
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:22,922
What a huge diamond.

251
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:29,702
You know, Nobuo aside, why aren't you
inviting me to your wedding?

252
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,542
You did invite Yasu and Shin.

253
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,272
Huh? You'd come?

254
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:34,902
Of course I would.

255
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:38,152
I'll even sing you the punk version
of Ladybugs' Samba.

256
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,872
What's that?
What kinda song is it?

257
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:41,952
I'll buy you the CD,

258
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:43,542
so you arrange it and
play the guitar part.

259
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,622
You be happy, no matter what, okay?!

260
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,322
Nobu stepped aside
so that you'd be happy.

261
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:56,362
So if you end up unhappy,
it was for nothing.

262
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:02,202
Well, with Takumi as your husband,

263
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,502
I'm sure he's gonna make you cry
from time to time.

264
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,982
But you're the fool who fell
in love with him,

265
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,142
so that can't be helped.

266
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,512
And don't get discouraged when
he cheats on you now and then, all right?

267
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,222
Just smack him around until
you feel better.

268
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:23,822
Yeah. You're right.

269
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,652
Thank you, Nana.

270
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:36,472
That day, the riverside was packed
with people,

271
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,172
and I never saw Shoji and his girlfriend.

272
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:43,512
I felt that the curtain had finally
come down on our relationship.

273
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,622
There was such a big crowd

274
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,812
that you could easily lose sight
of the people you were with.

275
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,652
So I wanted to hold Nana's hand...

276
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,022
But I was worried she'd think
I'm insensitive

277
00:19:55,022 --> 00:19:58,652
if I innocently grabbed her hand,
which was as warm as Nobu's.

278
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,862
The wind on my fingertips
was freezing cold.

279
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,702
Come to think of it,
summer ended long ago, didn't it?

280
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:16,212
Did you guys have fun
at the fireworks?

281
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:18,572
Get ready to continue working hard!

282
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:20,872
Huh?

283
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,092
Hey, Nana.

284
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,932
That summer you longed
for more than anyone,

285
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,162
the one we couldn't get back,
is right here.

286
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,232
I'll always be waiting.

287
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:50,752
For ten years... twenty years... fifty years...

288
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:58,982
I can't count how many nights

289
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,592
I wished tomorrow would never come

290
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:10,632
I lost my dream and my love
While being struck by the rain

291
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:15,372
Crying, crying, crying, crying

292
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:23,682
To live as I am without being fake

293
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:27,242
What do I need

294
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:35,252
If I don't believe in myself
what can I believe in

295
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:40,492
The answer is too close to see

296
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:46,732
Black tears are falling down
and I scream out

297
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:53,302
Pretending nothing happened
Tomorrow will come

298
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:58,482
I'll be up against the same pain

299
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:04,382
If I repeat these days

300
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:15,962
Hey, Nana...
