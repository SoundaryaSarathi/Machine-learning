00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream...

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,430
<i>Good morning, Shinji. How's it going?</i>

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,030
No problems.

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm getting used to it.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>That's good.</i>

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,370
<i>Have you memorized the positions</i>
<i>of all the Eva emergence points,</i>

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,230
<i>emergency power junctions, armament</i>
<i>equipment sites and recovery zones?</i>

28
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,540
I guess so.

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,170
<i>Well, let's review it now.</i>
I guess so.

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,940
<i>Well, let's review it now.</i>
<i> </i>

31
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,980
<i>Normally the Eva runs off electricity</i>
<i>provided by an umbilical cable.</i>

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,280
<i>In emergencies, it can switch</i>
<i>to a built-in battery,</i>

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,120
<i>with an active life of one</i>
<i>minute at full power,</i>

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,590
<i>and no more than five minutes in</i>
<i>the minimal activity gain mode.</i>

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,460
<i>This is due to our current limits in</i>
<i>battery capacity technology.</i>

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,660
<i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:09,960
Yes.
<i>Do you understand?</i>

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,630
Yes.
<i> </i>

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,160
<i>Now let's continue from where we left</i>
<i>off yesterday. Initiate Induction Mode.</i>

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,130
<i>Now let's continue from where we left</i>
<i>off yesterday. Initiate Induction Mode.</i>

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>Position the target in the center,</i>

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,870
<i>then switch "on".</i>

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,710
<i>Take it easy. Position the</i>
<i>target in the center.</i>

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,180
<i>Then pull the switch.</i>

45
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,120
<i>Next!</i>

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,830
You know, I wonder why Shinji agreed
to be a pilot after what happened?

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,360
It would seem that he simply
does what he's told to do.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,800
I suppose that's just his way
of getting through life.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,900
Target in the center, pull the switch.

50
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,110
Target in the center, pull the switch.

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,450
Target in the center, pull the switch.

52
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,110
Target in the center, pull the switch.

53
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,080
Target in the center...

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
Episode 3:
The Phone That Never Rings

55
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,330
<i>And now, from Tokyo we go to</i>
<i>Natsuko Shinohara in Matsuzaki.</i>

56
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,990
<i>Good morning, this is Shinohara.</i>
<i>Guess what?</i>

57
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,840
<i>Today I'm in Matsuzaki in West Izu</i>
<i>for a little scuba diving!</i>

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,400
<i>Today's forecast is sunny, with an
<i>estimated high of 32 degrees C.

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,110
Miss Misato, it's morning already.

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,740

<i>We have hot days all year now, but</i>

<i>We have hot days all year now, but</i>
<i>we used to have four seasons:</i>

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,080
I just got back from night duty.
<i>We have hot days all year now, but</i>
<i>we used to have four seasons:</i>

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,600
I just got back from night duty.
<i> </i>
<i>Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.</i>

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,480
I don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.
<i>Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.</i>

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,650
I don't have to go to work until this
evening, so please, let me sleep.
<i>We never see snow these days...</i>

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,280
<i> </i>
<i>instead, due to the recent warmth,</i>

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I see. I'll go.
<i> </i>

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,720
<i>aquatic life has been coming</i>
<i>back little by little.</i>

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,890
Hey, isn't today Thursday?
<i>Aquatic life has been coming</i>
<i>back little by little.</i>

71
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,560
Hey, isn't today Thursday?
<i>As you dive into the sea you can</i>
<i>clearly see an abundance of fish.</i>

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,260
Take the burnable trash to the garbage, please.
<i>As you dive into the sea you can</i>
<i>clearly see an abundance of fish.</i>

73
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,730
<i>As you dive into the sea you can</i>
<i>clearly see an abundance of fish.</i>

74
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,090
Yes, Ma'am.
<i>As you dive into the sea you can</i>
<i>clearly see an abundance of fish.</i>

75
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,860
Yes, Ma'am.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

76
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,430
<i>It makes me think of catching</i>
<i>some for tonight's dinner.</i>

77
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,330
So, how's school?
<i>It makes me think of catching</i>
<i>some for tonight's dinner.</i>

78
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,600
<i>It makes me think of catching</i>
<i>some for tonight's dinner.</i>

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,100
Fine.
<i>It makes me think of catching</i>
<i>some for tonight's dinner.</i>

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,330
Oh, okay. Take care.
<i>It makes me think of catching</i>
<i>some for tonight's dinner.</i>

81
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,830
Oh, okay. Take care.
<i>Although the town brings back sad</i>
<i>memories, this is a hot diving spot.</i>

82
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,000
<i>Although the town brings back sad</i>
<i>memories, this is a hot diving spot.</i>

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
I'll see you later.
<i>Although the town brings back sad</i>
<i>memories, this is a hot diving spot.</i>

84
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,060
<i>Although the town brings back sad</i>
<i>memories, this is a hot diving spot.</i>

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,240
Yes? Hello?

86
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

87
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,420
How's it going? Are you getting
along with him?

88
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,890
<i>Him? Oh, Shinji.</i>

89
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,660
<i>Well, he transferred into school two</i>
<i>weeks ago and he hasn't changed.</i>

90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,470
<i>No one ever calls him.</i>

91
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,700
Calls him?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

92
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:33,970
Calls him?
<i>Well, since I figured he'd be needing</i>
<i>one, I gave him a cellular phone.</i>

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,010
<i>Well, since I figured he'd be needing</i>
<i>one, I gave him a cellular phone.</i>

94
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>I don't think he's ever used it though,</i>
<i>or received any calls.</i>

95
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,010
<i>I'm not sure, but I don't think</i>
<i>he has any friends.</i>

96
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,710
Well, I would guess that Shinji's not
the sort who makes friends easily.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,690
Do you know the fable of the
Hedgehog's Dilemma?

98
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,430
<i>Hedgehog? You mean those</i>
<i>animals with the spiny hair?</i>

99
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,330
Even though a hedgehog may wish to
become close with another hedgehog,

100
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,460
the closer they get, the more they
injure each other with their spines.

101
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,140
It's the same with some humans.

102
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,840
The reason he seems so withdrawn is
because he's afraid of being hurt.

103
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,040
<i>Well, he's going to have to learn</i>
<i>someday that part of growing up</i>

104
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,210
<i>means finding a way to interact with</i>
<i>others while distancing pain.</i>

105
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,500
What's up, class rep?

106
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,700
Did you give him the printout
I gave you yesterday?

107
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,170
What? Well...

108
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,080
Well, there wasn't anybody
home at Toji's place.

109
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,210
Mr. Aida, aren't you
Mr. Suzuhara's friend?

110
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,020
Aren't you worried about him?

111
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,790
Do you suppose he's injured?

112
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,250
What? In that robot incident?!

113
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,160
The television report said that
nobody was injured!

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,090
No way, you saw where the explosion
was on Mount Takanosu, didn't you?

115
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,400
There were fighters scrambled
from Iruma and Komatsu,

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,270
and there were also troops from
Misawa and Kyushu.

117
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,540
I'll bet at least ten or twenty
people were injured,

118
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,000
and there had to be some killed, too.

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,710
Toji!

120
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,110
Suzuhara!
Toji!

121
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,160
Suzuhara!
<i> </i>

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,310
Wow, has the class population
dropped or what?

123
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,250
They've all been evacuated or
transferred to other schools.

124
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250
After all, no one wants to stay after
that last battle inside the city.

125
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,820
Yeah, you're probably the only one

126
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,860
who's actually enjoying the
chance to see a real war.

127
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,820
Yeah, I am. And speaking of which,
where have you been, Toji?

128
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,160
Why were you absent so long? Did
you get involved in the war?

129
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,690
My little sister did.

130
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,700
She was crushed under
a pile of debris.

131
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,440
She survived but she's been in
the hospital ever since.

132
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,350
Both my dad and grand-dad
are working at the lab,

133
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,050
and there's no way they
can leave their posts.

134
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,420
So, if I'm not with her, she's all alone.

135
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,690
That robot's pilot was really dumb!
It makes me so angry!

136
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,490
How could he wreck our own city?
What was he doing?

137
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,200
About the pilot, have you heard the
rumor about the new transfer student?

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
What transfer student?

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,490
Him, over there.

140
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,940
He transferred here while
you were absent.

141
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,600
He came right after the incident.
Don't you think that's odd?

142
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,410
<i>All rise!</i>

143
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,160
And so, humankind was about
to face its greatest trial.

144
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,390
In the last year of the 20th century,

145
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,300
a massive meteor from space
slammed into the Antarctic continent.

146
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,270
The continent's ice cap was melted
almost instantaneously.

147
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,540
The water level of the oceans
increased dramatically,

148
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,640
the Earth was thrown off its axis,

149
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,180
and new, devastatingly abnormal,
weather patterns were spawned.

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,410
The lives of all living things on the
planet were threatened.

151
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,920
Several thousand species and half
of the world's human population

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,580
were lost in the immediate aftermath.

153
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,090
That was the so-called
"Second Impact".

154
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,420
The survivors still had to
live through the hell

155
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,730
of worldwide economic collapse,

156
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,730
<i>[Is it true that you are that robot's pilot? Y/N]</i>
of worldwide economic collapse,
ethnic conflicts, and civil wars.

157
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,400
<i>[Is it true that you are that robot's pilot? Y/N]</i>
However, it has been fifteen
years since then.

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,260
In only fifteen years, we have
restored ourselves.

159
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,000
This is certainly proof of the human
race's resilience, but even more so,

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,540
<i>[It's true, isn't it? Y/N]</i>
This is certainly proof of the human
race's resilience, but even more so,

161
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,610
it is the fruit of the blood,
sweat and tears

162
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,450
your fathers and mothers have
dedicated to this cause.

163
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,650
What?!

164
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,750
Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

165
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,650
Really?! Oh, wow! Cool!
I lived in Nebukawa at the time,
which is underwater now...

166
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,450
Really, the new student was?

168
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,430
Hey, you guys! We're still in class,
you know! Sit down now!

169
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,230
Aw, you're always so bossy!

170
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,460
Hey, come on! Forget her!

171
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,730
Now cut that out!

Cool, it's awesome!

175
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,770

Well...

176
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,030
Hey, how were you chosen?
Well...

177
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,900
Hey, how were you chosen?
<i> </i>

178
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,170

Were there any tests?

179
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,400
Weren't you scared?
Were there any tests?

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,300

181

<i> </i>
What's the cockpit look like?

183
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,310
Well, I'm not supposed to
talk about secret stuff.

184
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,880
Oh, come on! Don't be mean!

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,210
Hey, what's the name of the robot?

186
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,820
I don't know much, but everyone
calls it Eva or Unit 01.

187
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,520
<i> </i>
Eva?

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
And what's its ultimate attack mode?
Eva?

189
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,720
And what's its ultimate attack mode?
<i> </i>

190
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,020
And what's its ultimate attack mode?
Some kind of vibrating knife.

191
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,520
<i> </i>
Some kind of vibrating knife.

192
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,790
An ultra-sonic wave.

193
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,560
That's amazing! We're so proud of you!

194
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, right! Cool! Yeah.

195
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,260
And thus...

196
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,130
Oh...

197
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
<i> </i>
That's all for today.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,200
Everybody stand up! Bow!
That's all for today.

199
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,540
Everybody stand up! Bow!

200
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,910
Everybody stand up! Bow!
Where do you live, Ikari?

201
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,040
Hey, you guys, why don't you at least
show some manners at the end?
In the older part of the city?

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,470
Hey, you guys, why don't you at least
show some manners at the end?
<i> </i>

203
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,290
Sorry, newcomer, but I've
got to beat you up!

204
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,050
I've got to work off my anger.

205
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,460
Sorry, his sister was injured
because of the incident.

206
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,920
That's his excuse, anyway.

207
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,660
I didn't pilot it by choice.

208
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,940
We've got an emergency call.

209
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,530
I'll go.

210
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,650
<i>A special state of emergency</i>

What's the status of noncombatants
and civilians?

226
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,400
We've already received reports that the
evacuation has been completed.

Just text messages again?
<i> </i>

232
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,610
It's news censorship. They won't
show any of it to us civilians.

233
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,620
Even though it's an incredible event.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,530
The fourth Angel would show up while
Commander Ikari is away.

235
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,300
It's a lot sooner than we expected.

236
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,400
The last time they gave us a
fifteen year break.

237
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,900
This time it's been only three weeks.

238
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,270
They never care about our
situation, do they?

239
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,170
They're the type we women
hate the most.

240
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,980
It's a waste of the taxpayers' money.

241
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,280
The committee is demanding that we
dispatch an Evangelion again.

242
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,520
Oh, they get on my nerves.

243
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,620
If they hadn't asked for it, I'd
have mobilized it anyway.

249
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,590
What for?

250
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,220
Just give me a second, okay?
What for?

251
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,550
Just give me a second, okay?
<i> </i>

252
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,020
Well, okay.

253
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,490
Class rep!

254
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,290
What?

255
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,990
We've both have to go to the bathroom!
What?

256
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,660
We've both have to go to the bathroom!
<i> </i>

257
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,460
You were supposed to use the
bathroom before you came here.

258
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,630
So, what's this about?

259
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,440
I've got to see it, at least
once in my life.

260
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,800
You mean the battle up there?

261
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:03,940
Nobody knows when the enemy will come the next time.

263
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,680
Kensuke, are you serious?

264
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,350
If we let this opportunity escape us,
we may lose it forever!

265
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,280
Please, help me unlock the gate.

266
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,950
But you could get killed
if you go out there.

267
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,880
If we stay here in the shelter, who's to
say that the risk isn't the same?

268
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,090
If I could be killed anyway,
I'd rather see it first.

269
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,390
You idiot. What do you
think NERV's for?

270
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,190
And what is NERV's most
important weapon?

271
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,600
It's the robot the new kid pilots.

272
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,930
He protected us the other day,

273
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,130
but you hit him pretty hard. Twice!

274
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,830
If he refuses to fight, we're
all going to die.

275
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,470
Doesn't that make it your obligation
to watch him fight?

276
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,610
Okay, you're not leaving
me any options!

277
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,490
You'll do anything to get what
you want, won't you?

278
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,190
<i>Shinji, are you ready?</i>

279
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,960
Yes.

Yes.

<i>Can you handle that?</i>

283
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,260
Yes.

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,430

Oh! This is it!

<i>Do it just as planned, okay, Shinji?</i>
Target in the center, pull the switch.

291
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,510
Right.

292
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,140
You idiot! You hid the enemy
with your own smoke!

293
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,030
I can't believe it! He's already losing!

294
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,160
Not a problem.

295
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,530
I'm sending you a spare rifle.
Not a problem.

297

<i>Take it!</i>

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,830
<i>Shinji? Hey, Shinji?</i>

299
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,340
Jeez...

300
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,880
Being beaten up must have
really messed him up.

301
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,340
Shut up!

302
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,400
The umbilical cable's
been snapped off!

303
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,500
Eva has switched to its internal
battery power source.

<i>No problems detected. He can make it.</i>

What are they doing there?

312
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,460
Why won't he fight?

313
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,760
Because we're here?

314
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,690
He can't move because of us!

315

<i>Activation time remaining:</i>
<i>3 minutes 28 seconds.</i>

316

<i>Shinji, let them into the cockpit!</i>

317
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,610
Once you've got them, retreat.
We'll start again later!

318
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,440
Do you think unauthorized civilians can
be allowed into the entry plug?!

319
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm authorizing it.

320
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:06,610
You're exceeding your authority, Captain Katsuragi!
I'm authorizing it.

321
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,580
You're exceeding your authority, Captain Katsuragi!

322
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,450
Unit 01's remaining activation time:
3 minutes.

323
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,050
Hold Eva on your current commands
and eject the entry plug. Hurry up!

324
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,320
<i>You two! Get in! Now!</i>

325
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,130
What the... It's water?

326
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,460
My camera! My camera!

327
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,370
<i>Abnormal conditions occurring</i>
<i>in the nervous system.</i>

328
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,980
Of course. It's because you've allowed
two foreign bodies into the matrix!

329
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,410
They're being detected as noise
in the nerve impulse systems!

330
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,910
Retreat! Now!

331
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,060
<i>Utilize recovery route 34, retreat to</i>
<i>the east side of the mountain.</i>

332
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,560
Hey, new kid, she said, "Retreat!"

333
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,790
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away!
New kid?!

334
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,730
I mustn't run away!

335
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,620
Progressive Knife engaged!

336
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,170
<i>Obey my orders, Shinji!</i>
<i>You've got to retreat!</i>

337
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,210
<i>Shinji!</i>

338
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,380
That idiot...

339
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,440
Unit 01, activation time remaining:
30 seconds!

340
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,370
28... 27...

341
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,810
26... 25...

342
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,120
14... 13...

343
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,920
12... 11...

344
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,990
10... 9...

345
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,790
8... 7...

346
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,560
6... 5...

347
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,460
4...

348
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,390
3...

349
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,190
2...

350
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,160
1...

351
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,670
Eva Unit 01, activation ceased.

352
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,760
The target is completely silent.

353
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,340
It's been three days.

354
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,090
You mean, since we were chewed out?

355
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,660
No, since he stopped
coming to school.

356
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,030
Who's "he"?

357
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,160
The new kid, of course.
Who's "he"?

358
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,290
The new kid, of course.
<i> </i>

359
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,830
I wonder what he's been
doing since then?

360
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,530
Are you worried about him?

361
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,870
No, not exactly worried.

362
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,070
Toji, for someone who's so tactless,
you're pretty stubborn.

363
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,840
If you had apologized
to him back then,

364
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,710
you wouldn't have had to agonize
over it for three days.

365
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,680
Here, this is the new kid's
phone number.

366
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,380
If you're so worried, why
don't you call him?

367
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
TO BE CONTINUED...

368
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,050
As the dreary rain pours down,

369
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,500
Shinji, overwhelmed and unable to
overcome his weaknesses, runs away from Misato.

370
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,600
The organization brings the aimlessly
wandering Shinji back. There we no kind words.

371
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Next Evangelion: "Rain, Escape and Afterwards"
And of course, lots of fan service next time too!
