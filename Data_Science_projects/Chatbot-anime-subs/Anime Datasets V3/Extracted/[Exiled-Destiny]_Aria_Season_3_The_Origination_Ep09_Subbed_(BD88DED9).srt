1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,960
Graduation...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,970
Gradually, everyone changes...

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,210
I've learned so many things on my journey.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,410
To everyone I've met along the way...

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,680
...from the bottom of my heart...

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,040
...thank you.

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,300
Wait... That's really embarrassing,
I can't say something like that!

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,960
On this day, which marks the successful
completion of your academic studies,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,870
take pride in yourselves, as the newest
graduates of this time-honored institution.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,330
It is our hope that you spread your grand wings
and take steadfast flight towards the future.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,480
Ah, here comes Alice!

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,050
W-What should we do?

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,390
You tell her!

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,250
Eh? M-Me?

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,190
U-Um, Alice!

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,990
Congratulations on your graduation!

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,660
I-If it's all right with you, could I have the
second button on your uniform, please?

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,900
Here you go.

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,210
Thank you very much!

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,440
I did it!

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm happy for you.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,070
I'd like one, too!

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Actually, I've always been a fan of yours!

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,820
Umm...

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,420
Ah, no fair! I want one, too!
Umm...

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Ah, no fair! I want one, too!

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,890
Ah, no fair! I want one, too!
What the?

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,050
What the?

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,650
Alice! Alice!
What the?

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:32,920
Alice! Alice!

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,160
Alice! Alice!
Ehh?!

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,810
Alice! Alice!

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,750
That was really a surprise...

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,070
I didn't tell you the graduation
ceremony was today, did I?

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,740
Don't underestimate this school's alumni.

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,270
Congratulations on your graduation, Alice!

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,990
Yes, thank you very much.

38
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,730
"Dear Ai, I'm happy to report that this summer,
Alice graduated from middle school!"

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,240
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

40
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,420
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

41
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,560
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,300
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,840
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,240
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,650
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,820
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi
Why don't you just walk home normally?

47
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,260
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi
I thought maybe I should, but...

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,090
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi
...this is my last middle school
challenge, so I have to do it!

49
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,890
...this is my last middle school
challenge, so I have to do it!

50
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,160
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,130
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi
Ah, Athena!

52
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,170
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

53
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,170
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

54
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:41,450
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

55
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:41,980
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru
Hey Junior...

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,950
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara
Hey Junior...

57
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,390
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara
...looks like you failed your
"walking backwards" challenge.

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,720
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara
That's really no problem!

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,090
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

60
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,090
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara
Time stands still when Athena is around.

61
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,160
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou
Time stands still when Athena is around.

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,650
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,870
Surrounded By That Orange Wind...

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,570
Gondola coming through!

65
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,080
What a loud voice!

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Junior, you're really fired up today!

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,140
Yes, I'm all fired up!

68
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,110
School used to take up most of my time,
but now I get to spend it practicing with you two.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,550
So...

70
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,230
So I'm really happy about that.

71
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,470
All right! We'll set our sights on becoming
Primas today as usual! Let's-a-go!

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,600
Yeah!
Yeah!

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Akari, President Aria!
Start with some vocal exercises!

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,500
O-Okay!

75
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,310
Gondola coming through!

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,190
So you're all fired up now that you've
graduated from school, huh?

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,120
Yes!

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm really on a roll right now!

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,930
I don't really understand it myself,
but I feel like anything I do will turn out well.

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,440
Here, President Maa.

81
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,470
Here.

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,970
Say, pretty please, pretty please!

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,700
Here!

84
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,060
Say, Alice...

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,080
Yes?

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,820
Why don't we go on a picnic tomorrow?

87
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,460
This time, for sure.

88
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,150
Athena?

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,820
Geez... What are you doing?

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm sorry!

91
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,760
Lunch is packed up and ready!

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,430
That's really perfect, Athena!

93
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,550
I know! Alice...

94
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,450
Yes?

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:39,620
Today, why don't we pretend that
I'm a customer and you're an Undine?

96
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,860
What an interesting idea.
Sure, I'm up for a challenge!

97
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,830
So Athena, I guess that means you're my
valued customer from this moment on?

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,110
Yes, I look forward to...

99
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,410
Please take my hand, ma'am.

100
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,130
Ma'am?

101
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,920
Eh?

102
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,730
Ah, y-yes!

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,370
Alice, your smile has gotten
so much softer, hasn't it?

104
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,810
Ma'am, please forgive me,
but isn't this the first time we've met?

105
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,940
Ah, I'm sorry.

106
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:40,880
Ma'am, the truth is, I get to practice every day
with a friend who has the best smile ever.

107
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,850
Ahead is Ponte di Rialto, a bridge that spans the
entire 48-meter-wide Canal Grande with one arch.

108
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,520
Unlike Piazza San Marco, this area is a mix of
shops, markets, bars and private residences.

109
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,860
Here, you can really get a sense of
everyday life in Neo-Venezia.

110
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,190
One might say this is
Neo-Venezia's second city center.

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,230
Your sightseeing information is very clear
and easy to understand, Miss Undine.

112
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,630
I owe it to a strict friend who likes to prohibit
everything, and trains me hard every day.

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,710
Well then, Ma'am.
Where shall we head next?

114
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:44,080
If you have any particular sightseeing spots
you'd like to see, please feel free to let me know.

115
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,520
Let's see...

116
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,890
Well then, I'll take you up on your kind offer.

117
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,640
From here on, there will be a stretch of
countryside that continues on for a while.

118
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,450
Please enjoy this other face of Neo-Venezia,
which is typically known for its port-town scenery.

119
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,210
Okay!

120
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,640
Hello!

121
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,200
Excuse us while we pass by!

122
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,910
Take care!

123
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,850
Ciao!

124
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,290
Buon giorno!

125
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,190
Hi!

126
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,460
You seem to be enjoying yourself, ma'am.

127
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,090
Yes, very much!

128
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,310
Ma'am, would you like some more tea?

129
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,240
Thank you. I'm fine for now.

130
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,780
It really is a perfect day for a picnic, isn't it?

131
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,200
Miss Undine.

132
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes?

133
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,700
Why don't we get going?

134
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,930
Right!

135
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,670
Freshly Made
Gelato

136
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,760
Hello, sir!

137
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,490
If you please!

138
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,870
Sure, it's on its way down right now.

139
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,770
So just hang tight for a little bit, okay?

140
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,740
Okay!

141
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,590
Good luck.

142
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,320
What's the matter, Miss Undine?

143
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,100
Do I look that unreliable?

144
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,440
Not at all. You're very reliable.

145
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,610
Good work today, Alice.

146
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,850
Huh?

147
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,990
Until the water elevator reaches the top, you can
come out of work mode and take a breather.

148
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,520
Eh? Ah, okay...

149
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,800
You're really amazing, Alice.

150
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,230
You can do everything now, can't you?

151
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,030
Thank you very much.

152
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,410
Thanks to all that training with my friends,

153
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,640
even I think my sculling and guiding
have gotten pretty good, but...

154
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,710
But?

155
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,700
To be honest...

156
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,680
...it's my canzone...

157
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:43,260
My voice is soft to begin with, and I'm
not very good when it comes to singing...

158
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,930
I'm always worried I'm not singing loudly enough,
or wondering if I'm singing off-key...

159
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:56,340
The more I think I have to sing well,
the more my mind goes blank.

160
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,280
When you feel insecure about your singing,
that feeling is conveyed to those who are listening.

161
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:20,890
Skill is important, of course, but what's
most important is your love of singing.

162
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,330
Love... of singing...

163
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:35,570
If you don't love your own singing,
how can you expect others to love it?

164
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,520
Athena...

165
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,660
Miss Undine...

166
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,830
...our destination is just ahead!

167
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,730
Yes...

168
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,510
Did you know, Miss Undine?

169
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,090
Before this planet's surface was covered
with water, when it wasn't yet known as Aqua...

170
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,700
...they say this world was covered
entirely in the color orange.

171
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,110
Perhaps that's why this time of day,
when the planet takes on an orange hue,

172
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,310
is so dear and a bit nostalgic
to all the people who live here on Aqua.

173
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,680
It's as if our past and future are
both captured in this single moment.

174
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,180
Huh?

175
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,550
There's someone there...

176
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,890
That's... Akari and Aika?

177
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,870
And there's the man from the water elevator...

178
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,200
And behind him are our company representatives
and someone from the Gondola Association?

179
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,400
What's going on?

180
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,050
Thank you for today, Miss Undine.

181
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,120
Lastly, may I request a song?

182
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,740
Miss Undine?

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,810
Ma'am, do you know of Aqua's
famous Three Great Water Fairies?

184
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,460
I may not look it, but I'm actually the
top protégée of the one known as Siren.

185
00:16:48,300 --> 00:17:04,990
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Vesperrugo, fluas en ondetoj

186
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:23,960
Seem like a song of pure happiness
Gi estas kiel la kanto, bela kanto de felico

187
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:44,720
The birds are like messengers, delivering kindness
Cu vi rimark is birdojn, portanta afableco

188
00:17:45,260 --> 00:18:02,580
They fly beyond the sea, placing love on the winds
Super la maro flugas, ili flugas kun amo

189
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:22,930
In the twilight sky, which makes my heart tremble,
Oranga cielo emocias mian spiriton

190
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:35,680
Lies a star of hope that will shine forevermore
Stelo de I'espero, stelo lumis eterne

191
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:43,740
Shine forevermore
Lumis eterne

192
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:11,670
Ma'am, even though I was never
good at it, as a child, I loved to sing.

193
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,940
Your words brought back
the feelings I had back then.

194
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,250
Thank you very much!

195
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:52,290
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami

196
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:57,490
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami
The company has been anxiously awaiting
your graduation from middle school.

197
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,030
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami

198
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,490
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami
Your sculling skills are perfect.

199
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:00,690
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami

200
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,230
The setting sun and the rippling waves
Yuuhi ga shizumi nagareru saza nami
Our concerns about your tour guide skills,
customer service and canzone...

201

Athena, does this mean...

205
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,510
Seem like a song of pure happiness
Sore wa marude muku na shiawase no uta no you

206
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,260
The birds are like messengers, delivering kindness

You have exceptional talent, so you'll surely
lead the next generation of the Undine industry.

207

Umi o koe tobu yo ai o kaze ni nose

213
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,510
They fly beyond the sea, placing love on the winds
Umi o koe tobu yo ai o kaze ni nose
Or should I say...

214
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,580
They fly beyond the sea, placing love on the winds
Umi o koe tobu yo ai o kaze ni nose
...Orange Princess.

In the twilight sky, which makes my heart tremble,
Kokoro furueru tasogare no sora ni

Is that...

222
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
In the twilight sky, which makes my heart tremble,
Kokoro furueru tasogare no sora ni

"Ai, in the brilliant history of Aqua's Undines,"

245
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,770
"the legend of the first
rank-skipping Prima has been born!"

246
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,750
"Alice really is amazing, isn't she?
I kind of admire her for it!"

247
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,980
"Congratulations, Alice!"

248
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,420
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

249
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,090
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

250
00:22:48,830 --> 00:23:00,010
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

251
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:08,880
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

252
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:22,300
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

253
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:31,640
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

254
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:44,620
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

255
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,160
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
