1
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,185
Summer is almost over.

2
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:15,655
Hey Sakura
What?

3
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,554
Is it really okay that
we have so much free time lately?

4
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,157
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,392
Because of that,

6
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:24,896
we had lots of time to play,
didn’t we?

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,166
Yeah, but…

8
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,142
Huh? What are you doing?

9
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,844
I got a letter from Miss Mizuki,

10
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:33,940
so I’m writing her back

11
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:35,341
That lady went somewhere

12
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:38,443
oversea to study, didn’t she

13
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,240
Is she doing fine?

14
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:43,450
Yeah, she said she’s
studyng hard.

15
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,859
But thanks to her,

16
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,262
you’ve officially become
the Mistress of the Clow Cards

17
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:54,664
I’m real glad for that.

18
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,996
Why?
Isn’t it obvious?

19
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:01,367
If that brat had
become the Master,

20
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:03,841
I’d have lost all
my confidence to live.

21
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:05,141
Don’t say that!

22
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,044
Li worked hard at it too!

23
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:11,582
By the way, what’s he gonna do?

24
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:13,746
Has he gone back to Hong Kong yet?

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,482
Not yet,

26
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:19,550
but he said he’d be going back soon.

27
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,088
With this much free time every day,

28
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,591
it’s getting boring!

29
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:28,627
I don’t have any free time

30
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,362
because I have school tomorrow…

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,702
Huh? What’s wrong?

32
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:41,369
The summer vacation homework
were still left in the school bag!!

33
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:42,646
What??!

34
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,216
Gotta finish Maths exercise,

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,484
Japanese exercise,

36
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:49,752
Picture Diary.

37
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:54,456
and then there’s independent research,
and… and…

38
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:56,853
Can you finish them
all in one night?

39
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,855
It’ll all work out!

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,698
It’ll be okay for sure!

41
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:05,669
This is not too good.

42
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,438
Kero, help me please!!

43
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,970
I helped you last year,
and you got mad at me!

44
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,935
Yeah, but now…

45
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,908
Oh, by the way,
I’m on duty tomorrow!

46
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,575
Oh no!
I gotta get up early tomorrow!

47
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:20,810
You’ll be fine!

48
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,984
I’m sure you’ll
get all of them done.

49
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:31,688
[Sakura and the
Mysterious Transfer student]

50
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,495
Good morning!

51
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,335
Did you finish your homework?
Yeah!

52
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:43,799
Good morning, Mother.

53
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,074
Are you okay, Sakura?

54
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:00,058
Good morning, Father

55
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,924
Good morning

56
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:03,556
Today’s only the opening ceremony
but you’re up quite early.

57
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,825
I’m on duty today.

58
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:06,994
I see.

59
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,731
From today on is the 2nd semester.

60
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,101
Work hard, okay

61
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:14,604
Thanks for the food.

62
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,339
Even if you go this early,

63
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:18,641
Yuki won’t be there.

64
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,077
That’s not it!!

65
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:25,715
I’m going now.

66
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:33,416
Humm, I hate Maths already.

67
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,053
Come to think of it,

68
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,988
who’s on duty with me today?

69
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,006
Yukito!

70
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,507
– Sakura!
– Good morning!

71
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:57,276
Good morning!
Oh, you’re really early today.

72
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:01,114
I’m on duty and so…

73
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,253
But you’re early too.

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,322
I got up early to buy breakfast.

75
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,056
Because lately,

76
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,020
no matter how much I eat,
I’m still hungry…

77
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,521
Maybe I bought a little too much.

78
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,192
No… Not at all!

79
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,292
To be able to eat a lot…

80
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,269
It’s the proof of good health, right?

81
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:20,930
Yup!

82
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:25,337
Oh, I’ve to go now.

83
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,736
okay, See you later.

84
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,546
Yukito is the

85
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:37,923
false form of Yue…

86
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,449
Sakura!

87
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,006
But, but but,

88
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:00,536
Yukito is Yukito after all!!

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,480
Good morning!

90
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,880
But, no one’s here yet anyway.

91
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:18,425
On duty, on duty, on-duty.

92
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:23,891
I even finished the summer vacation
homework somehow.

93
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,301
Writing the class journal,

94
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,998
changing the flowers.

95
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:32,441
Let’s make everyone’s desk clean.

96
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,712
On duty, on duty, my…

97
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:40,149
Good morning, Li.

98
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:41,871
Good morning

99
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:43,982
So you heard me…

100
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,580
I see, I’m on duty with Li today…

101
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,560
Because all the Clow Cards were captured
before summer break

102
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,228
we haven’t seen each other
for a while, you know?

103
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,372
– Yeah.
– How was your summer?

104
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,641
– Did you go anywhere?
– No.

105
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,906
– What about the beach?
– Didn’t go.

106
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:11,346
So, are you really
going back to Hong Kong?

107
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:12,506
Yeah.

108
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,445
Since the Clow Cards
already have a new Mistress,

109
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,013
I have to explain to Mother.

110
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,258
I see…

111
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:32,465
It’s not like we’ll
never see each other again.

112
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,435
Tha… That’s right.

113
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,266
Thank goodness

114
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,121
– Good morning.
– Good morning, Tomoyo!

115
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:59,495
– What’s wrong?
– Lately,

116
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,665
there has not been many occasions

117
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,833
for you to wear my special costumes.

118
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:07,666
I still have so many,
many, many costumes

119
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,507
that I would like you to wear for me

120
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,679
And then, to film you in these costumes…

121
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:19,476
It would have been so great!

122
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:23,621
– Tomoyo…
– So great!

123
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:27,686
– Good morning!
– Good morning!

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,991
Thanks for the letter.

125
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,722
Did you get my reply?

126
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:33,792
Yeah, I got everyone’s
reply already.

127
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,325
Oh yeah,

128
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,095
I got one from Miss Mizuki too.

129
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,763
She replied you too.

130
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,072
Is she doing well?

131
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,737
Yeah, she said she’s studying
hard in England.

132
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,047
Do you know who’s
our class teacher

133
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,644
for the 2nd semester

134
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,277
Come to think of it,
who could it be?

135
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,313
Tomoyo, do you know?

136
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,453
Yes, I saw our class teacher just now.

137
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:02,024
– Who is it? Who is it?
– Teacher is here.

138
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:04,760
Get to your seats!

139
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:06,686
It is Mr Terada!

140
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:13,094
So,

141
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,765
summer break ended yesterday,

142
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,369
did all of you bring your homework?

143
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:19,935
Yes!

144
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,340
Today, I’ll introduce you
to your new classmate

145
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,375
who’ll be studying with us.

146
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:28,646
Now, Come in.

147
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:47,165
He seems kind.

148
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:00,379
This is Eriol Hiiragizawa

149
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:02,320
from England.

150
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,015
I hope you’ll all get along

151
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,887
I’m Eriol Hiiragizawa.

152
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:07,722
Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:11,959
Your sear… Let’s see…

154
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:13,520
That’s it.

155
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,056
How about the one next to Li?

156
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,608
Hello.

157
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:31,612
What’s this?

158
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,677
Did I meet him somewhere before?

159
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:43,491
Miss Kaho,

160
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,623
class 5-2 has a new student today

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,631
It’s a boy named
Eriol Hiiragizawa.

162
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:53,534
He seems kind.

163
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,201
But…

164
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,371
For some reason,
I feel like this is

165
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:03,876
not the first time we met

166
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:05,245
Same here.

167
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,284
Hi… Hiiragizawa??

168
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:13,218
I’m so sorry that I scared you.

169
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:19,095
Thank goodness.

170
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,327
Is it all right
if I sit next to you?

171
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,211
Somehow I also feel that

172
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:40,183
today is not the
first time we meet.

173
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,682
It is strange, isn’t it?

174
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,387
We might have met before.

175
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:54,963
We might have met before

176
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,525
in our previous lives

177
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,934
Do you mind
telling me your name?

178
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:10,346
M… My name
is Sakura Kinomoto.

179
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,548
What a beautiful name of the flower

180
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,181
that blooms in spring

181
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,313
May I call you Sakura?

182
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,419
Yes, Hiiragizawa.

183
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,762
Please call me Eriol,

184
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,059
Sakura.

185
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:37,103
That’s like

186
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,601
a promising development

187
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,137
in a girl’s comic

188
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,642
Keeping an eye
on Sakura like that…

189
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,259
Li, did something happen?

190
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,690
Because you’ve been
having such a difficult face all day.

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,058
Li has a new thing

192
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,661
to worry about today, right

193
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,833
Wha… Th… Th… That’s not…

194
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:10,472
If there’s anything

195
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:11,774
I can do

196
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:12,610
let me know.

197
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:16,108
You helped me so much

198
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,142
when we were
gathering the Clow Cards.

199
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:21,518
This time I wanna
be of help to you.

200
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,216
But you’re

201
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,423
going back to Hong Kong soon.

202
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:33,659
I can’t go yet.

203
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,966
I’m still staying here.

204
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:37,858
– Really?
– Yes.

205
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,106
I see now! That’s great!

206
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,010
Thank goodness!

207
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,648
Ice-cream bars
over there are very good.

208
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,649
I’ll go buy some.

209
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:07,325
Because a new rival
seemed to have appeared.

210
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,667
If you went back to Hong Kong,
it would be like giving her up, right?

211
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,898
I said that’s not it!

212
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:15,568
Thanks for waiting.

213
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,039
Here, Tomoyo, Li.

214
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:22,505
– Thank you very much.
– Thanks.

215
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,312
Touya Big Brother!

216
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,353
Don’t do that, Touya!

217
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,116
You want some too, Yuki?

218
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:41,961
I’ll buy you another one, okay?

219
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,157
It… It’s okay. No need.

220
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,636
What’s wrong, big brother?

221
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:52,537
A new student came
to our class today.

222
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:54,573
We have one too.

223
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,604
But what about it?

224
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,087
Touya!! I was looking for you!!

225
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,030
Oh? You must be
Touya’s little sister!

226
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,230
Yes! I’m Sakura Kinomoto.

227
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:18,666
I’m Nakuru.

228
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:20,464
Nakuru Akizuki.

229
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,036
Just as I thought,
you’re so cute!!

230
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,544
Hey! don’t be such a…

231
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:41,322
Later, Touya! See you tomorrow!

232
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:47,160
– Ice-cream.
– She took it…

233
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:52,302
– Is something wrong?
– Nothing.

234
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:55,262
Thanks for your ice-cream!

235
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:08,547
Oh! It is raining…

236
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,582
Oh no! The laundry!

237
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:19,595
This is the last basket.

238
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:20,987
Just leave it there.

239
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:22,625
I’ll put them in afterwards.

240
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:23,858
Thank you.

241
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,931
Then I’m going to my part-time job.

242
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:28,563
You have part-time today?

243
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,439
It’s written on the board.

244
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,567
Then, what about dinner?
No, thanks.

245
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,205
Oh no,
I bought dinner for 3 persons…

246
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:40,314
Transfer student?

247
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:42,881
What kinda person?

248
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,548
His name is Eriol Hiiragizawa.

249
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,688
Aerial?
What kanji is that?

250
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:52,888
It’s not a kanji!
E-RI-O-L.

251
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,759
He’s from England.
England…

252
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:58,634
No!!!

253
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:08,068
So, what kanji is that?

254
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:09,511
Forget it!

255
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,210
You weren’t listening at all.

256
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,918
…and now the forecast
in your local area.

257
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,629
What incredible rain.

258
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:31,329
And it was so sunny
in the afternoon too.

259
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:37,403
What?

260
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,342
What’s in that drawer?

261
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,914
The book of Clow Cards!

262
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,114
What?!

263
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:00,188
Kero!!

264
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:10,335
I might be troubling you

265
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,404
from here on

266
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,011
but if it is you,

267
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,003
it will be okay for sure

268
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,341
This voice…

269
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,846
This is Clow’s voice…?

270
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,263
– Sakura
– Kero,

271
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,158
Clow’s voice

272
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,522
came from the book…

273
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:37,924
Clow’s voice?

274
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:41,368
What’s this?

275
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,670
SA-KU-RA?

276
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,677
My name?!

277
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:50,873
what does this mean?!

278
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:00,388
Kero,
did you sense that just now?

279
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:02,815
Yeah, I sensed it too.

280
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:04,855
What’s this aura…

281
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,064
The rain in Tomoeda

282
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,496
will continue to fall.

283
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:11,596
It’s a limited area raining.

284
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:12,832
It’s cloudy in the surrounding area.

285
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,163
where the rest of the area

286
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,469
will enjoy another sunny day.

287
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,845
This isn’t just
any normal rain after all.

288
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,580
So… why this?

289
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:36,483
Mysterious rain in Tomoeda!

290
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:40,092
This’s also Card Captor’s
call, Right?

291
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:44,999
My, it has been so long
since the last filming!

292
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:50,705
Kero?

293
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:52,443
Be careful.

294
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,141
I sense very powerful aura.

295
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:01,513
But all the Clow Cards
have been gathered.

296
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,200
What’s this?

297
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:34,309
– Kero! I’ll leave Tomoyo to you!
– Okay!

298
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:42,218
Sakura!

299
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:00,601
Sakura! What’re you playing?

300
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:01,771
Use magic!

301
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:11,715
O, Key which hides
the forces of darkness,

302
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,817
reveal thy true form before me.

303
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,022
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

304
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,358
Release!

305
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:27,736
Release!

306
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:31,500
Release!

307
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:38,475
Release!

308
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:47,082
Release!

309
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:56,022
Why?

310
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:58,899
Watch out!

311
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,134
Are you okay, Sakura?

312
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:07,276
Kero, the key…

313
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:13,916
This aura…

314
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:16,950
Impossible.

315
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,221
It can’t be… But…

316
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:23,787
Sakura! Are you ok?

317
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:26,363
Sakura,

318
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:29,798
invite the snow-rabbit over tomorrow.
(Yukito = snow-rabbit)

319
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:31,698
Yukito?

320
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,768
Why Tsukishiro?

321
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,439
Yue is the one I need to talk to.

322
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:38,042
Yue…

323
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,366
I want to check with him
on something.

324
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,673
Why doesn’t the new Key
turn into a wand?

325
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,473
And

326
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,782
this aura…
