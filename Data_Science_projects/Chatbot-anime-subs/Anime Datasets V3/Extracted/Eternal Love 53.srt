<i>[Episode 53]</i>

3
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,556
Your Majesty...

4
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,026
Jiu'er.

5
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,569
I'm really happy that
you carried me home.

6
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,549
But you're drenched.

7
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,656
That makes me very upset.

8
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,046
In the future...

9
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:51,705
In the future, we'll walk home
only after the rain stops. All right?

10
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,927
All right.

11
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,878
This is not real.

12
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,670
What isn't real?

13
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:21,306
It isn't real to call you, Your Majesty.

14
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,578
You're Dong Hua.

15
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,217
Lord Dong Hua.

16
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,485
You look better like this.

17
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:46,306
You were a bit ugly in your mortal form.

18
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:51,895
Was I?

19
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,253
Could I be ugly?

20
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,736
I was just teasing you.

21
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:04,850
You look great in every form.

22
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,616
I even cut off my tail for you.

23
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,483
In my dream...

24
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,596
Shouldn't you reciprocate
my feelings for you?

25
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:22,896
Don't tell her...

26
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,776
that I was here.

27
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:09,862
<i>It was indeed a sweet dream last night.</i>

28
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,300
You're awake, little fool.

29
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:19,795
You're never to do
anything foolish again.

30
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,988
You cut off your tail...

31
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,197
Fortunately, Zhe Yan did it first.

32
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,274
Otherwise, you'd be the first
eight-tailed little fox in Qing Qiu.

33
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,206
Father told me

34
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,228
that the tails of a nine-tailed fox
can do a great many things.

35
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,326
I wanted to see if it could carve
my name and Dong Hua's name

36
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,411
on the Rock of Three Incarnations.

37
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,781
I've said all that I should.

38
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,689
I'm now at a loss for words.

39
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,113
I can only sigh.

40
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:02,451
Auntie, who do you think
I dreamed about last night?

41
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:09,711
It definitely wasn't me, right?

42
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:19,651
I'll have Mi Gu accompany you back
to the Fox Den today to get some rest.

43
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,798
Once I'm done cultivating all the elixir
needed for my mentor's meditation

44
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,509
I'll head home to keep you company.

45
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,531
You're not to act foolishly again.

46
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:33,872
Don't worry, Auntie.

47
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:37,637
Cutting off a tail is
as good as having died once.

48
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:41,214
I've suddenly figured some thing out.

49
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,889
You suddenly fell out of love with him?

50
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,100
No.

51
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,702
There's still plenty of time.

52
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,757
I'll surely find a way.

53
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,482
Xin Nu, look.

54
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,709
Does it resemble her?

55
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,875
Yes, it looks
almost exactly like her now.

56
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,120
Your Highness...

57
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:00,157
I made this out of my magical powers.

58
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:02,676
It won't last for long.

59
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:07,076
It's unlike what Ye Hua had wanted
to make out of the Soul-gathering Lamp.

60
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,951
Your Highness, it took you days
to create this.

61
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,989
What does it do?

62
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:20,769
I'll have her accompany His Highness
through the trial in the Mortal Realm.

63
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:28,187
You mean to send her to the Mortal Realm
to accompany His Highness?

64
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:38,144
Didn't I tell you that Bai Qian and I
share the same weakness?

65
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,777
We're both in love with Ye Hua.

66
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:44,057
Once she's in love with Ye Hua
she will get jealous.

67
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:47,919
Just like I was jealous of
Su Su and Ye Hua's affection.

68
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:56,008
I want Bai Qian to know that
she's just a substitute for Su Su.

69
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,798
So what if she's a high god of Qing Qiu?

70
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:04,240
In the end, she is but a substitute
for that dead mortal.

71
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,753
She's no different from
this wooden figurine.

72
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:14,789
You want her to act like Su Su
and stay by His Highness's side

73
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,836
to upset Bai Qian.

74
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:20,321
Exactly.

75
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:23,548
Bai Qian will be jealous
of this substitute

76
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,389
as much as I was with Su Su.

77
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,318
Her status as a high god
doesn't make her any different!

78
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,692
From now on, you are to keep
an eye on this woman at all times.

79
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:44,227
Inform me immediately if you see
Bai Qian visiting His Highness.

80
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,302
Yes.

81
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,274
Lift your chin up and
let me take a look at you.

82
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:20,297
That woman wasn't as gentle as you are.

83
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,292
She was strong-minded and unyielding.

84
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,484
It doesn't matter.

85
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:28,607
His Highness has lost his memory
in his mortal form.

86
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,777
He won't remember that mortal.

87
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:38,190
From now on, your name is Su Su.

88
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,224
Yes.

89
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,673
Young Master ranked first
in the examination!

90
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,524
- Great!
- Congratulations!

91
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,638
My Young Master is giving out
celebratory pastries.

92
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:04,703
Come and have some.

93
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,144
- Yes!
- Yes!

94
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:07,936
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

95
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,841
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Young Master!

96
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,745
Thank you, Young Master!

97
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,128
You're here?

98
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:29,890
Sir, have you mistaken me
for someone else?

99
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,856
Indeed...

100
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,753
You might resemble her,
but you are not her.

101
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:38,974
Sir!

102
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:45,043
Could you be so kind as to buy me?

103
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,764
I really need some money to
bury my father.

104
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:56,801
Since I resemble that lady
you have on your mind

105
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:01,399
could you help me for the sake of that?

106
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,327
Young Master, let's go.

107
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,280
There are many like her on the streets.

108
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,772
Sir!

109
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,357
Take this.

110
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,427
Thank you, sir.

111
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,191
Do you have anyone else?

112
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:33,139
No, I have no one else.

113
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:38,370
Bury your father and then
come over to my manor.

114
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,225
Really?

115
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,398
Of course.

116
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:42,754
Young Master is the top scholar.

117
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:43,892
Why would he lie to you?

118
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,388
Thank you, sir.

119
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,447
You've been in the elixir chamber
for six straight days.

120
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,630
Aren't you bored?

121
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,527
How could I be bored
making the elixir for Master?

122
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:16,046
Sixteenth, do you remember the day
we asked to train under Master?

123
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,865
How could I not?

124
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:23,094
We stepped into the Grand Hall at
the same time to train under Master.

125
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,316
We even argued for a long time

126
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,919
about who was the Sixteenth and who
was the Seventeenth Disciple.

127
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,138
Speaking of which,
Master favored you more.

128
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:32,024
Although I was made the senior

129
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,909
he gave the cultivated
Jade Purity Fan to you.

130
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:37,942
You were so lucky.

131
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,232
You dare to bring that up?

132
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,586
I had to address you as my senior
for 90,000 years because of that fan!

133
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,773
Do you still think that
you were at a disadvantage?

134
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,211
Seventeenth...

135
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:53,022
It's nothing.

136
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:55,909
What is it?

137
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,628
You wish to speak but you're hesitant.

138
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,792
You're like a man who's lost his heart.

139
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,659
What are you talking about?

140
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:05,597
I'm such a heartless man.

141
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,265
How could that happen to me?

142
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,563
You're right.

143
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:13,748
How can a heartless man
like you keep someone on your mind?

144
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,120
Sixteenth.

145
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,471
Sixteenth, you...

146
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,024
Here, get up.

147
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,337
Are you all right?

148
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:35,590
What happened?

149
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:42,134
You're indeed a high god.

150
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:44,216
That was such a powerful blow.

151
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:46,119
I almost died on the spot.

152
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,532
That was just a prank.

153
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,527
70,000 years ago, you didn't have
such a low level of cultivation.

154
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:56,432
However you have slacked off,
it couldn't be this low now.

155
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:58,413
What exactly happened?

156
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:01,485
It doesn't concern you.

157
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:04,798
Fine!

158
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,315
You don't have to tell me
if you don't wish to.

159
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:14,269
But I think it has to do with
that brief romance of yours.

160
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:19,255
You really got that right.

161
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:23,410
Is she...

162
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:25,994
Is she pretty?

163
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,236
She's prettier than you.

164
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,136
Really?

165
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,597
In my eyes, she's a hundred times...
a thousand times prettier than you.

166
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,759
I'm not talking to you anymore.

167
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,822
Master is going into
meditation tomorrow.

168
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,884
All the other seniors are heading back
to their original posts.

169
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,155
What about you, Sixteenth?

170
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,423
Where will you be going?

171
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,668
I'm going to the Sea of Innocence.

172
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,120
The Sea of Innocence?

173
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,880
Isn't that the burial place
of the Celestial Tribe?

174
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,226
What are you going to do there?

175
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:04,491
What else could I do there?

176
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,209
I'm guarding the tombs for
the Celestial Tribe

177
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,473
until I vanish into
the realm of nothingness.

178
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,902
Stop joking.

179
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,450
Why would tombs need to be guarded?

180
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:20,999
You don't understand.

181
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:27,767
When a person seeks nothing,
nothing he is told to do matters.

182
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,746
Moreover, that is the oath
I made to the Heavens.

183
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,729
Should the Heavens grant me my wish

184
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:41,287
I would spend the rest of my life
in the Sea of Innocence.

185
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,199
Sixteenth, you...

186
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,394
Don't ask about it.

187
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:49,451
I won't tell you even if you do.

188
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,040
<i>Master, I was wrong.</i>

189
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,992
You drank so much wine.

190
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:21,619
It's best to cry it all out or the sorrow
will accumulate in your organs.

191
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,327
That would be a waste
of such good wine.

192
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,892
Master, these are the elixirs that
Zhe Yan produced.

193
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:13,990
Master, take them with you into the cave.

194
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:24,410
Master...

195
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,090
Is there anything else
you wish to brief me on?

196
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,951
When is your wedding with Ye Hua?

197
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,560
The Indian Summer of October.

198
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,203
The peach blossoms will be in full bloom.

199
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,540
It's good timing.

200
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,122
Seventeenth.

201
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,038
Once you marry into the Celestial Palace

202
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,608
you will belong to the Crown Prince.

203
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,523
The Celestial Palace is
unlike Kunlun Mountain.

204
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,913
There are many complicated rites
and regulations.

205
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:55,788
Be sure to rein in your temper.

206
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:58,147
Don't get into any trouble.

207
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:03,462
When I was in Kunlun Mountain
I always got into trouble.

208
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,748
Master helped me through it all.

209
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:09,952
I know all about it and
I've kept it in mind.

210
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,019
Master, go into meditation with ease.

211
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,694
Ye Hua will look after me.

212
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:19,756
He surely won't let me
get into trouble again.

213
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:23,051
I look forward to seeing
Master leave meditation soon.

214
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:25,313
It'll be even better if you can
make it to our wedding.

215
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:30,355
By then, I'll surely kowtow to you
and offer you tea.

216
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,044
All right.

217
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,842
I'll take my leave now, Master.

218
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,109
All right now.

219
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,621
Just see me off here.

220
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:08,459
Sixteenth, why would you
do this to yourself?

221
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:12,711
I'm a deity of Kunlun Mountain
and the disciple of Mo Yuan.

222
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,308
Since I have made an oath,
I can't take my words back.

223
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,732
Furthermore, the Sea of Innocence
is such a tranquil place.

224
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:21,326
It's the best place for me to train.

225
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:26,486
Seventeenth.

226
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,259
I won't attend your wedding
with the Crown Prince.

227
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,421
But should you need me to risk
my life to help you

228
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,713
by all means, come to me
in the Sea of Innocence.

229
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,137
Touch wood.

230
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:39,942
Since all the seniors are back
at their original posts

231
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:45,592
I'll leave Kunlun Mountain
in Second Senior's good hands.

232
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:49,493
I won't keep nagging.

233
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,590
I'll get going.

234
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,048
Head back now.

235
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:21,588
What are you waiting for?

236
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:25,606
Second Senior, I have matters to handle.

237
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:27,088
I'll leave the mountain now.

238
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,074
Seventeenth, you must miss your husband.

239
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,143
By the way, I have something for you.

240
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,059
When Senior left early this morning

241
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,940
he told me to give you
the Soul-gathering Lamp.

242
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,506
You left it in the West Sea.

243
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,676
The Soul-gathering Lamp?

244
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:49,593
If Senior hadn't brought it back to me
I'd have forgotten all about it.

245
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:51,991
This is after all a sacred artifact
of the Celestial Tribe.

246
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:52,992
It has to be returned.

247
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,266
While Master is in meditation

248
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,405
Second Senior will
have to look after him.

249
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,906
Some feigned politeness that is.

250
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:04,751
He's not just your mentor,
but mine as well.

251
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:08,204
Should anything come up
in Kunlun Mountain

252
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:09,933
you must come to me in Qing Qiu.

253
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,134
I'll get going now, Second Senior.

254
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:39,708
<i>Ye Hua should be 18 years old by now.</i>

255
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:44,538
<i>I wonder what Ye Hua looks
like in the Mortal Realm at this age.</i>

256
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:50,590
Young lad.

257
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,135
Is Young Master Liu at home?

258
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,172
You're looking for
our Eldest Young Master?

259
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,613
Yes, I'm looking for Zhao Ge.

260
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:57,613
Is he in?

261
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,381
No, he moved out a long time ago.

262
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,192
Isn't this the Liu Manor?

263
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,792
Where could he have moved to?

264
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,356
He is already independent
and has his own manor.

265
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,528
He's only 18 years old and
he already has his own manor?

266
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,758
<i>Our Eldest Young Master
is a rare child prodigy.</i>

267
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,160
<i>At the age of 12, he was admitted
into the Imperial College.</i>

268
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,769
<i>Five years ago, the old emperor
opened up the special examination</i>

269
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,450
<i>and our young master took the place
of top scholar with great ease.</i>

270
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,410
<i>He was promoted from a compiler
in Hanlin Academy</i>

271
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,011
<i>to the Minister of
the Ministry of Revenue.</i>

272
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,594
<i>He's really a god-blessed genius.</i>

273
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:33,266
<i>Miss, if you're looking for him,
you have to go to the Minister's Manor.</i>

274
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:38,039
<i>Ye Hua, you really are the
Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe.</i>

275
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,924
<i>You're even second to none
in the Mortal Realm.</i>

276
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:56,888
Master, here's a toast to you tonight
for the peach blossoms.

277
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,243
Sure.

278
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,547
Master, you've been coughing
more often lately.

279
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:19,221
The physician has told you
not to worry too much.

280
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,434
It's bad for your health.

281
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,749
I'm not worried.

282
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,861
I'm lovesick.

283
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:52,244
<i>I haven't seen him for six days
and my token of love means nothing now.</i>

284
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:55,087
<i>He really has gotten involved
in some sort of relationship?</i>

285
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:11,068
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

286
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:13,362
Didn't your husband tell you
not to leave the woods?

287
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:15,942
Ye Hua!

288
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:26,994
I haven't seen High God for days.

289
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:30,221
Su Jin greets High God.

290
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:35,053
How did you know that I was here?

291
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,637
Is High God muddleheaded?

292
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,082
The invisibility magic is
but a camouflage.

293
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:44,932
You might be able to hide from
the mortals, but not the deities.

294
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:48,979
I saw some shimmering lights here
from above the clouds

295
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,951
so I came in search of you.

296
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,596
I was right after all.

297
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,323
What are you doing here?

298
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,568
His Highness is going through the
heavenly trial alone in the Mortal Realm

299
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,288
and I'm worried that he might be lonely.

300
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,681
I've made him a figurine of the person
he misses the most to stay by his side.

301
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,787
I came down here today

302
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:14,920
to see if that figurine is taking
good care of His Highness.

303
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,049
I wasn't paying attention.

304
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,913
I didn't notice that girl is
but a figurine under human skin.

305
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,733
You're so thoughtful.

306
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,992
High God, do you know who
I have made that figurine resemble?

307
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:46,545
Have you heard the name, Su Su?

308
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:54,828
A-Li's birth mother who
jumped off Zhuxian Terrace?

309
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,444
High God, you don't have
to take it to heart.

310
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,148
His Highness is but a mortal now

311
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:05,354
so he can't tell that
she's just a figurine.

312
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:10,791
That could fulfill the wish he has
had on his mind for a long time.

313
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:15,542
Once His Highness returns to
the Nine Heavens

314
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:21,155
he won't care about a figurine,
even if it has Su Su's face.

315
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,888
You're obviously telling me

316
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:29,000
that Ye Hua now has
this figurine on his mind.

317
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:36,519
Aren't you worried that
once Ye Hua returns to the Nine Heavens

318
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,551
he'll punish you for fooling him
with this figurine?

319
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,731
All I did was make a figurine

320
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:47,034
and leave it at the market
outside His Highness's manor.

321
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:50,836
His Highness fancied her
and brought her home.

322
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:56,868
If His Highness insists on blaming me,
I have nothing to say about it.

323
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:03,221
However, it shows that if you love
someone to the core

324
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:07,195
you'll still have an impression of that
person and fall in love with her again

325
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:12,272
even after drinking the amnesia potion.

326
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:16,853
You really do relate to him very well.

327
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,931
I've always been devoted to His Highness.

328
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,635
Everyone in the Nine Heavens knows that.

329
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,089
I definitely can relate to him.

330
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:32,710
By the way, does High God know
that for the past 300 years

331
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,854
His Highness has been trying to gather

332
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:36,997
Su Su's energy with
the Soul-gathering Lamp?

333
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:44,271
I certainly knew about that.

334
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:51,267
Su Jin, among the younger generation,
you're the most understanding of all.

335
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,451
This figurine is very well-made.

336
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,634
You made quite an effort.

337
00:29:57,634 --> 00:30:01,487
It's saved me much trouble now
that she's caring for Ye Hua.

338
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:06,304
When Ye Hua returns to his immortal self
and blames you for it

339
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,804
I'll put in a few good words for you.

340
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,409
Thank you, High God.

341
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:16,355
I'll take my leave now.

342
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:46,854
<i>Ye Hua, I asked you that night
if you remembered who I was.</i>

343
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,144
<i>You didn't even recognize me...</i>

344
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:51,323
<i>But even after taking
the amnesia potion</i>

345
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:55,353
<i>you still can't forget
A-Li's mortal mother?</i>

346
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,192
I thought you were at Kunlun Mountain.

347
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:14,561
What brings you to
the Peach Tree Woods so suddenly?

348
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,025
Fourth Brother, did you know
A-Li's mortal mother?

349
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:27,498
I've heard about her from Zhe Yan.

350
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:31,251
He met that mortal once
in the Celestial Palace.

351
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:35,810
It's said that she died young and
left behind the Imperial great-grandson.

352
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,208
What is it?

353
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,983
Have you not asked
Ye Hua about her?

354
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,319
Since I learned that Ye Hua was
once in love with a mortal

355
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,614
I didn't want to bring it up,
so I've never asked him about her.

356
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:54,585
She's already dead.
Why would it matter?

357
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,586
I also find it meaningless to
be mad at a dead person.

358
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,113
Then why do you still
have such a long face?

359
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,652
Fourth Brother.

360
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:15,413
When Ye Hua told me that
he liked me, I just took it as it was.

361
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:23,128
I never wondered why he fell for me
of all female deities in the realms.

362
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,806
If he fell for you, then that was it.

363
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,755
How can love be figured out easily?

364
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:33,611
Lord Dong Hua knows that
he and Feng Jiu can never be together

365
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,848
so why would he still get
involved with her in the Mortal Realm?

366
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,633
You're right.

367
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:46,818
But then later, I also fell
in love with Ye Hua.

368
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,872
We're in love with each other

369
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:51,436
so I never thought of
asking him about her.

370
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,469
Now that I think about it carefully

371
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:59,971
he mistook me for Riceball's mother
when we first met in the Eastern Sea.

372
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,242
Fourth Brother.

373
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:07,902
If Ye Hua only fell for me
because I resemble Riceball's mother

374
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,632
am I nothing more than her substitute?

375
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:18,500
Ye Hua has been in love with
that mortal for 300 years.

376
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:25,282
For centuries, he's been so devoted
to her and he's never once faltered.

377
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:28,670
Why would he suddenly fall
in love with me right after we met?

378
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,006
I've only seen Ye Hua a few times.

379
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:35,819
You should know him better than I do.

380
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:42,373
Can't you sense whether his love
for you is real or not?

381
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:55,463
If I hadn't seen Ye Hua
so intimate with the figurine

382
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:57,026
that resembles Riceball's mother...

383
00:33:58,547 --> 00:34:04,311
I could perhaps still lie to myself
that he was true to me.

384
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,041
I love Ye Hua for who he is.

385
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:15,844
But if Ye Hua only loves me
because I resemble Riceball's mother...

386
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:22,436
and he transferred his love
for her to me...

387
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:26,715
I can't accept such feelings.

388
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,501
You still haven't lived long enough.

389
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:37,282
What is the point in digging
into such matters?

390
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,708
Give it some thought.

391
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,547
How does Ye Hua treat you?

392
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,744
Give it some more thought.

393
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:47,228
What's the point of holding this
against a dead person?

394
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,126
Yes.

395
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:52,554
I shouldn't have been so muddleheaded.

396
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,322
Qian Qian!

397
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,570
Hey, what's the matter?

398
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,759
Why did her mood changed so quickly?

399
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,617
Isn't everything going well?
She's getting married soon.

400
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:11,992
She was giggling every day
because her mentor returned.

401
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:17,487
The Celestial Tribe really
is Qing Qiu's nemesis.

402
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,864
What is it?

403
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:20,646
What happened?

404
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,550
I don't know.

405
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,077
I can't figure out relationships.

406
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:28,746
You're right about that.

407
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:30,442
Just let them figure things out.

408
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,324
Take the medication.

409
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:35,153
I brewed it for six to eight hours.

410
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:36,983
More medication?

411
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:40,411
Could you have added something
particularly bitter in it

412
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,556
to get back at me for defeating you
at chess in Kunlun Mountain?

413
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,416
Zhen...

414
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,688
Ever since you were old enough

415
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,702
this is how you've reacted
to taking medication.

416
00:35:49,702 --> 00:35:52,121
You always accuse me of
adding something bitter.

417
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,505
I went out of my way to get you
the best candied peach blossoms

418
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,474
from the disciples of Kunlun Mountain.

419
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,490
Are you trying to trick me like
some one-year-old?

420
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,043
Medication with candied blossoms?

421
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,739
This is so good.

422
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,525
Your Highness, how did it go?

423
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:46,967
When Bai Qian saw
that figurine with Ye Hua

424
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:51,958
she seemed to be calm
but she can't fool me.

425
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:58,969
I've finally found her weakness.

426
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:03,452
It's just a matter of time before
she leaves His Highness.

427
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,367
Congratulations, Your Highness.

428
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,460
Bring me some hot tea.

429
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,802
Yes.

430
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:40,628
Auntie, would you like to have your meal?

431
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,682
Not a day goes by that do I not hate you.

432
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,028
But perhaps today I don't.

433
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:15,534
His Highness loves you to the core.

434
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:21,581
I'm sure that you wouldn't want him
to marry anyone else, would you, Su Su?

435
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,775
Your Highness.

436
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:27,793
When the Crown Prince returns
and figures out

437
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:29,293
that you deceived him with a figurine

438
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:32,172
what will you to do if he blames you?

439
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:42,009
My clan was wiped out 70,000 years ago
to save the Celestial Tribe.

440
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:46,521
That being said,
the Heavenly Lord still needs me

441
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:49,293
to keep the branch leaders
of my clan in order.

442
00:39:49,293 --> 00:39:54,594
The Heavenly Lord
and many branch leaders are around.

443
00:39:55,684 --> 00:40:00,221
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

444
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:02,755
Yes.

445
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:11,902
Auntie has been sleeping for two days
since she got back from the woods.

446
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,831
Exactly.

447
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:15,902
Auntie!

448
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:17,927
Auntie.

449
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,672
Bring in some wine.

450
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:55,782
Auntie.

451
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,213
Feng Jiu, you're here?

452
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:12,494
Do you know that when I asked
Ye Hua a few days ago if he knew me

453
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:15,307
he said that he didn't.

454
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:24,409
But then just a few days later,
he brought home another woman.

455
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,315
Auntie, the Crown Prince took
the amnesia potion.

456
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,744
It's normal that he doesn't remember you.

457
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,884
He doesn't remember...

458
00:41:38,137 --> 00:41:39,846
But do you know

459
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:46,534
the woman he brought home
looks exactly like Riceball's mother?

460
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,824
Su Su?

461
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,646
You know Su Su as well?

462
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:57,568
When I was still in the Celestial Palace

463
00:41:57,568 --> 00:41:59,106
- I...
- That's enough.

464
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:00,570
I don't want to hear about her.

465
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:11,536
Auntie, the Crown Prince once tried
to gather Su Su's soul with the lamp.

466
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:14,972
I thought that you wouldn't
take that to heart...

467
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:19,902
I didn't.

468
00:42:22,902 --> 00:42:24,954
That's because I was too silly!

469
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:31,224
I thought that I shouldn't be too
concerned about his past.

470
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:40,458
But when I saw him recognize
that woman instead of me...

471
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:43,885
I knew then...

472
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:52,105
The one he has on his mind
isn't me, it's her.

473
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:58,744
