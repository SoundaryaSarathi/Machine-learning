1
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,170
Thanks for the meal, I'm leaving now!

2
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,720
Hey.

3
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,520
I was just wondering if you were here...

4
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,440
I am now.

5
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,090
It doesn't really matter.

6
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,010
I didn't actually have anything to tell you...

7
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,250
Lunch.

8
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,860
Huh?

9
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,290
Wanna eat together?

10
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,500
Why do I have to eat together with you?!

11
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,920
Well, you know...

12
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,700
It's strange for a boy and a girl to eat together!

13
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,040
Why is it strange?

14
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,170
You see,

15
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,930
Because we're not dating...{We haven't start going out together yet...}

16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,050
What I'm saying is, you should eat together with your friends!

17
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,990
By the way...

18
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,960
Eh?

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,950
Did you hear anything from your brother?

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,080
About what?

21
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh, nothing really.

22
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,650
After school...

23
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,160
Eh?

24
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,090
Why don't we go home together?

25
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,650
I can't! I have dance practice today!

26
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,200
For the Mugiha festival?

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,760
Y- Yeah...

28
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,130
Awesome! You're a dancer?!

29
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,460
Dancer...

30
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,180
Something lovely like that! Why'd you keep it a secret from me?

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,930
Not like I was actually hiding it...

32
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,040
Besides, I am not dancing because I like it.

33
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,550
Tomoyo, you're late.

34
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,190
Here.

35
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,750
Friends always exchange their side dishes with each other.

36
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,500
Sorry I'm late! There were lots of people at the snack bar!

37
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,340
Err, Isurugi Noe-san, this is Kurobe Tomoyo.

38
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,470
Are you going home?

39
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,300
We don't have club activities today.

40
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,970
I see...

41
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,320
Then...

42
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,110
Even though he told me he has practice...

43
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,080
Shin-!

44
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,830
It's going pretty well for him, I must say.

45
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,220
If it goes well, maybe the four of us could go out together next time.

46
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,220
Kind of like a group date...

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,440
Hey, where should we go?

48
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,380
Anywhere's fine.

49
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,120
What's with that?

50
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,800
Hey, isn't that a new sweater?

51
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,520
Yup, how observant of you.

52
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,650
Told you to leave it to me!

53
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,740
I know everything about Aiko, you see!

54
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,290
But... isn't that one just a bit plain?

55
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,480
Doesn't seem like Ai-chan's taste...

56
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,290
A change is nice, occasionally.

57
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,840
You could have told me, I would've gone shopping with you.

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,030
Didn't you buy that one over at that store?

59
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,150
What was that store that Ai-chan likes to go again?

60
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,660
Oh yeah, why don't you also buy yourself a sweater?

61
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,000
Since all you've been wearing is that one.

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Sweater, huh?

63
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,320
"If I'm to get another one, it'd sure be nice if it was one that Ai-chan made..."

64
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,470
Or, that's what I want to say.

65
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,350
Sure.

66
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,130
Eh? Really?!

67
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,750
YES!!

68
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,910
Good day, bocchan!

69
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,320
I see things are getting pretty hot between you two!

70
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,270
Whoa! be careful!

71
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,980
Let's go to the seashore.

72
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,320
It's cold...

73
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,460
Here.

74
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,810
You're cold, right?

75
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,190
What about you?

76
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,470
I bet Shinichirou-kun's colder than me.

77
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,860
What do you mean by that?

78
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,910
Besides, it's usually guys who do this.

79
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,670
It's fine.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,220
It's the second time already...

81
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,090
Well, I'm fine with it, anyways.

82
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,390
Nah, it's nothing.

83
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,420
You don't have dance practice today?

84
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,340
That's right.

85
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,740
Shinichirou-kun is the main lead, huh?

86
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,020
You know, if you'd like, next time...

87
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,120
Today...

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,520
At lunch, Isurugi Noe came to the bleachers at the field.

89
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,740
Oh, you mean where you eat?

90
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,910
She told me "Friends always exchange their side dishes with each other."

91
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,700
Huh? Did she give you any trouble?

92
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:13,300
Nope. Besides, it was me who asked Shinichirou-kun to introduce Isurugi Noe to me.

93
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,300
Let's go home.

94
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,950
Speaking of Isurugi Noe...

95
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,640
What?

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,370
Well, don't you think she's a strange girl?

97
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,490
Well, she's not a bad person, though.

98
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,820
Hmm?

99
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,730
Y- Yeah. That's right.

100
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't say it clearly, but...

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,250
I would like the two of you to stop walking around together outside.

102
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,210
But why?

103
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,910
Maybe you don't understand this,

104
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,390
But to begin with... you already live under the same roof, a boy and a girl...

105
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I understand.

106
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,590
That's a lot.

107
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,850
Yup, but I can't eat with boys.

108
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,510
Oh, is that so...

109
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,480
They're all liars.

110
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,600
It's not actually red.

111
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,500
They probably added some dye.

112
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,900
Captain Takaoka...

113
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,370
Lunch practice?

114
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,450
Yup.

115
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,880
Just Hiromi?

116
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,300
Yup...

117
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,680
Don't you think that Hiromi's been pushing herself too hard recently?

118
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,820
Yup, let's do this.

119
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,470
Geez... How did you find out about this place?

120
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,100
You were just like Raigou-maru!

121
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,810
Looking cool, courageous, shining bright!

122
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,930
Is that so?

123
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,160
Later, bocchan!

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
Oh, thanks for coming!

125
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,610
Come on, over here.

126
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,360
Hey, Shinichirou.

127
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,030
It's fine if I eat with guys once in a while, right?

128
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,770
Oh, you can't eat that one.

129
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,570
You will only lie more if you eat food that rips people off.

130
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,740
Lie?

131
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,430
Sausages aren't actually red.

132
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,520
But you made this...

133
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,890
I nearly misunderstood Shinichirou...

134
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,370
But, I got it wrong. I can eat with Shinichirou!

135
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,160
Shinichirou's a person who can shed precious tears.

136
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,100
Tears, huh?

137
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,480
But, how are you going to turn my tears into yours?

138
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,940
There's still quite a lot to do.

139
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,460
But, granny did it on me this way.

140
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,750
"Following the windy night,"

141
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,440
"Is the moment when Raigou-maru wants to fly to the sky."

142
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,230
"It's a breezy afternoon with a clear sky,"

143
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:35,340
"Because of the wind the day before, broken straws and grass are everywhere, scattered across the ground."

144
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,450
"Even those worms, delicious and usually hard-to-find,"

145
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,130
"could be easily found."

146
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,030
Perhaps I can fly, too!

147
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,000
Isn't this exactly how she imagines it?

148
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,820
Yo.

149
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,570
So you really did come.

150
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,950
I told you, didn't I.

151
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,770
So, have you decided yet?

152
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:21,440
Now look here... don't go around trying to control how others feel.

153
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,280
It's not that big of a deal.

154
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,460
Then, in return for me dating Isurugi Noe,

155
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,260
You'd also need to go out with Hiromi, how about that?

156
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,370
Eh?

157
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,630
See, you need to think about it as well.

158
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,960
That's not what I meant,

159
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,550
Who's Hiromi?

160
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,440
It's Yuasa Hiromi! Don't tell me you don't know!

161
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,360
Oh, you mean No. 6 on your team?

162
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,550
That girl is quite cute.

163
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,200
Alright, then.

164
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,660
Hey, hold on!

165
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,630
Dammit, just what's with that guy?

166
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,140
Is he retarded or something?

167
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,880
He couldn't possibly be serious, right?

168
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,020
Same for Hiromi, I don't see any good in that guy.

169
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,600
I don't get it at all!

170
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,220
Just what the hell does he think other's feelings are?

171
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,990
How could he possibly propose to date with someone else as a return of favor?

172
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,340
But it was me who proposed that as a return favor.

173
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,470
If that guy's serious,

174
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,530
then wouldn't it be perfect for Hiromi?

175
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,220
So this is how you truly imagine?

176
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,700
Err...

177
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,100
I have something to tell you.

178
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,660
Well... there's no rush... we could talk about it at school tomorrow.

179
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,550
Come in.

180
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,800
It's the first time I've entered this room.

181
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,980
Isn't this the first time?

182
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,720
It's the first time that you've entered my room, ever since I moved here, right?

183
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,210
Eh? Is- Is that so?

184
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,600
Maybe you're right.

185
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,320
Yup.

186
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,380
Yeah, it's my first.

187
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,280
Hey, what's with this conversation?

188
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,200
So, what is it?

189
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,280
I just met No. 4 from Hotarugawa High.

190
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,480
He told me that he thinks you're cute.

191
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,720
Hmm...

192
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,880
Don't "hmm" me. Aren't you happy?

193
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,890
I don't like nosy boys like you.

194
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,250
You know, I didn't imagine you'd reply th-

195
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,020
What's that?

196
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,950
Well...

197
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,060
Is that the only reason you entered my room?

198
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,970
But didn't you let me in?

199
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,050
I told you, it's fine if we talk about it tomorrow.

200
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,790
We'll be in trouble if your mother finds out.

201
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,730
I have something to tell you.

202
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,590
Well... there's no rush... we could talk about it at school tomorrow.

203
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,190
Come in.

204
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,080
Isn't this the first time?

205
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,090
It's the first time that you've entered my room, ever since I moved here, right?

206
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,850
Eh? Is- Is that so?

207
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,910
Maybe you're right.

208
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,700
Yup.

209
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,770
Yeah, it's my first.

210
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,890
What am I talking about?

211
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,580
So, what about it?

212
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,820
About today...

213
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,590
I just met No. 4 from Hotarugawa High.

214
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,790
No way...

215
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,440
He told me that you are cute.

216
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,940
Hmm...

217
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,940
Don't "hmm" me. Aren't you happy?

218
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,370
I don't like nosy boys like you.

219
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,550
I don't like nosy boys like you.
You know, I didn't imagine you'd reply th-

220
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,270
What's that?

221
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,430
Well...

222
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,580
Is that the only reason you entered my room?

223
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,880
But didn't you let me in?

224
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,410
I told you, it's fine if we talk about it tomorrow.

225
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,220
Are you only in here to talk about that?!

226
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,310
We'll be in trouble if your mother finds out.

227
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,050
He entered my room to say something like that...

228
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,570
Bocchan, it took me a long time to pack this up.

229
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,020
Old picture books from back when I was young truly are nostalgic.

230
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,150
I will help you out the next time you clean up the storage.

231
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,830
Wha-!

232
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,580
Isn't that an old photo album?

233
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,300
The photos are all laminated.

234
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,620
Oh! Dad was really young!

235
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,110
He looks just like bocchan.

236
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,750
You think?

237
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,100
Huh? Why is the face of the woman in this photo cut off?

238
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,760
Over here as well.

239
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,450
Hey!

240
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,110
Hey, let's meet up at Ai-chan's later.

241
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,120
I need to go home and finish up my stuff first.

242
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,330
I'll go on ahead.

243
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,190
Right!

244
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,220
Today, I'm late for the opening time.

245
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,230
Take a seat there.

246
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,550
Is Cola fine with you?

247
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,450
Sure.

248
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,600
Here, your Cola.

249
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,760
Hmm? What's this?

250
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,820
A sweater?

251
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,740
Eh? Ah, yeah...

252
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,630
For real? So even Ai-chan has a girl-like side!

253
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,730
Come on, no peeking.

254
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,860
How nice...

255
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,850
I bet Miyokichi is really happy.

256
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,850
Wh- What's wrong?

257
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,300
Shinichirou, isn't your size about the same as his?

258
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,130
Huh? Well, yeah, something like that.

259
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,310
Can I do some measurements?

260
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,510
Since I'm not confident enough.

261
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,770
Eh?

262
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,000
Why don't you just get him to do it?

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,060
Come on!

264
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,690
It itches.

265
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,780
Sit still!

266
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,310
Isn't it enough?

267
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Not yet.

268
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,650
About last time...

269
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,430
Eh?

270
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,240
That...

271
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,590
What?

272
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,510
Hey, Aiko!

273
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,860
Don't open the door!

274
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,300
Eh...?

275
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,800
Isn't it tough when you can't tell your feelings to the one you like?

276
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,260
You!

277
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,140
There's nothing to forget!

278
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,900
Not a single moment...

279
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,000
What... kind of joke is this?
