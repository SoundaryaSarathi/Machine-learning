1
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,794
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,901
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:09,192
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,466
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,777
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:25,936
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,096
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,935
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,140
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,493
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,646
This should give us a good idea of what's around here.

15
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:07,288
See if you can find a menu, I'm starving.

16
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,569
I bet we'll find something to eat here! The Fire Days Festival.

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,042
Fire Nation cultural exhibits... jugglers, benders, magicians.

18
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:19,531
This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!

19
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,736
You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.

20
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,431
Hey, a poster of me!

21
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,376
A wanted poster. This is bad.

22
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,085
I think we better keep moving.

23
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:32,055
I have to learn firebending at some point,...

24
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:35,764
...and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.

25
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,755
I guess we could check it out.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,456
What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town...

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,869
...where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,916
We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.

29
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,174
Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble.

30
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:05,810
You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.

31
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,596
Ready disguises!

32
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,342
It's like you're a whole different person.

33
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:25,149
Let's go.

34
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,424
I think we need some new disguises.

35
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,628
Where are we gonna get masks like that?

36
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:49,543
Get your genu-ine Fire Festival masks here!

37
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:52,614
That was surprisingly easy.

38
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,281
Hey, there's some food.

39
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:05,964
Finally! What do you have?

40
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,709
Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.

41
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,391
I'll take 'em!

42
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,127
Aaahh! Hot! Hot!

43
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,966
"Flaming fire flakes" hot? What do you know?

44
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,397
Hey, look at this.

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,961
Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!

46
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,854
Oh, no!

47
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:36,383
Aang, hold on! Where are we going?

48
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,557
I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.

49
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,423
Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.

50
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,267
I gotta learn that trick!

51
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:56,453
Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!

52
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh! Oh! Me! Me!

53
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,497
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,374
I want to get a closer look.

55
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:04,489
It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.

56
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,961
How about you, little lady?

57
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:14,156
Awww, She's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!

58
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:18,577
Awww! That could'a been me.

59
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:28,376
This next trick is called "Taming the Dragon." You will be my captured princess!

60
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:44,008
Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!

61
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,145
It's too strong, I can't hold it!

62
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,607
We gotta help her!

63
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,571
No, we don't want to make a scene!

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,809
The rope, it's breaking!

65
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:10,286
Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?

66
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,419
Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

67
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,633
I think it's time to go.

68
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,762
Follow me! I can git ya outta here!

69
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,867
There they are!

70
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,293
Over there!

71
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,627
I'm calling Appa!

72
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,583
I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,650
This way!

74
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:53,865
Okay! Not this way!

75
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,029
Appa! Down here!

76
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,380
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

77
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,597
You seem to really know your explosives.

78
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:40,926
I'm familiar.

79
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:42,678
You're a Fire Nation soldier!

80
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:46,291
Was. My name's Chey.

81
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:53,745
I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend,...

82
00:06:53,824 --> 00:07:00,093
...Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?

83
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,142
He was very highly ranked, we get it.

84
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:05,887
Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more.

85
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:08,933
He's the first person ever to leave the army... and live.

86
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,806
I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though.

87
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,138
Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

88
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:19,545
Some say he's mad... but he's not! He's enlightened.

89
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,724
You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?

90
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,355
We've gotta go see him! He can train me!

91
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,849
We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!

92
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:33,840
He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar!

93
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,201
That's why I followed you into the festival.

94
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,869
Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning.

95
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,210
Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master...

96
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,669
...who would actually be willing to teach me.

97
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,380
It can't hurt just to talk to him.

98
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,960
That's what you said about going to the festival!

99
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,567
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?

100
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:02,108
Don't move!

101
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,594
Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!

102
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,439
Hold on, you know these guys!?

103
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:15,995
Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?

104
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:19,239
Shut up! Keep moving.

105
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,854
Go on. He sees you only.

106
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,311
Oh that's okay, we can chat later.

107
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:35,656
Is that where Jeong Jeong is?
I need to talk to him right away.

108
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:39,029
No! You wait there. Go now!

109
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:46,828
Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!

110
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,734
So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?

111
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:57,870
Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!

112
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,998
No fights. Theft was way down.

113
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:04,779
I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?

114
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,642
They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect.

115
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:13,965
Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.

116
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,174
What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

117
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,718
He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here.

118
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,184
He wants you to leave immediately.

119
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,268
Finally! Let's hit the road.

120
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,227
Why won't he see me?

121
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,691
He says you're not ready.

122
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,615
Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.

123
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,591
Wait, how does he know that?

124
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:41,926
He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.

125
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:45,337
I'm going in anyway!

126
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,975
Get out.

127
00:09:57,694 --> 00:10:00,505
Master, I need to learn firebending.

128
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:04,957
Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

129
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,143
I'm the Avatar. It's my destiny to...

130
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,403
Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny?

131
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:15,064
If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny?

132
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:19,276
No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control!

133
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:26,436
He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.

134
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,840
Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.

135
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:37,266
To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself.

136
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:42,726
But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.

137
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,364
Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.

138
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:52,044
Are you deaf! How can I teach you if you refuse to listen?

139
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,048
Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth.

140
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:03,453
Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive!

141
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,300
It breathes, it grows, without a bender, a rock will not throw itself!

142
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,991
But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path...

143
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,195
...if one does not have the will to control it!

144
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:22,117
That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!

145
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,329
You think I am weak?

146
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:30,686
Avatar Roku! No! No! I did not mean that!

147
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,579
I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes.

148
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:43,191
Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending.

149
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:46,936
Yes, yes, I will teach you.

150
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,522
Really? That's great!

151
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:06,077
Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. Good, good!

152
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,810
Wait! What do I do now?

153
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:12,856
Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking?

154
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,712
Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!

155
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,605
Hey!

156
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,616
But what am I concentrating on?

157
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:23,462
Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire.

158
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:26,410
Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!

159
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:27,864
So when do I get to make some fire?

160
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,610
Concentrate!

161
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,856
Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?

162
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,470
No fire yet.

163
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,394
What?

164
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:50,175
Power in firebending comes from the breath.

165
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,644
That is why you must master proper breath control.

166
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:55,681
You brought me up here to breathe?

167
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,234
Assume your stance.

168
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:58,080
Wider.

169
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:58,830
You're not even look...

170
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:03,202
Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth...

171
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,337
...without talking.

172
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:12,237
Good. Keep going.

173
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:23,805
What are you doing here!? I did not tell you to stop!

174
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,700
I've been breathing for hours.

175
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,725
You want to stop breathing?

176
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:30,040
I want you to stop wasting my time!

177
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:33,039
I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun.

178
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:38,057
I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!

179
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,132
I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline.

180
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:46,111
He was only concerned with the power of fire...

181
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,346
...how he could use it to destroy his opponents...

182
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:55,068
...and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

183
00:13:55,136 --> 00:14:03,960
Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.

184
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,438
Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.

185
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:31,909
I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.

186
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,981
We're going to work with fire now.

187
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,448
Oh yeh!

188
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:41,423
I mean, let us begin.

189
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:47,484
Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame...

190
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:52,305
...from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.

191
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,418
Master! There is trouble.

192
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,496
What's going on?

193
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,080
Concentrate on your leaf.

194
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,799
This is the worst firebending instruction ever.

195
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,620
All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe.

196
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,528
I'm sure there's a good reason.

197
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:09,645
But I'm ready to do so much more.

198
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:24,639
I did it! I made fire!

199
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,306
Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.

200
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,578
Careful!

201
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,717
Now that's firebending!

202
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:37,414
Aang, you'll hurt yourself!

203
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,603
Wonder how that juggler did it?

204
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:53,493
Katara! I'm so sorry!

205
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,878
Katara, what's wrong!? What did you do?

206
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:00,917
Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so...

207
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,940
I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!

208
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:08,253
Look what you did! You burned my sister!

209
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:24,167
You burned my sister! This is all your fault!

210
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:28,552
I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.

211
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:34,805
I'm sorry, I didn't... I'm sorry!

212
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,280
You have healing abilities.

213
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,305
The great benders of the water tribe sometimes have this ability.

214
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:14,911
I've always wished I were blessed like you... free from this burning curse.

215
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,760
But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.

216
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:25,326
Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain.

217
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:29,219
It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge...

218
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:37,873
...between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.

219
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:45,003
Go get your friends and flee!

220
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:51,147
Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!

221
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:14,497
Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.

222
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,295
Master Jeong Jeong.

223
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,344
Katara! Are you all right?

224
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:30,057
I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?

225
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:38,435
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.

226
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,917
I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.

227
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,841
You'll have to eventually.

228
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,859
No, never again.

229
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:48,100
It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.

230
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,974
What? How?

231
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:53,494
I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here.

232
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,944
Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!

233
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:56,710
Where?

234
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:59,409
By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.

235
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:02,058
I have to help him!

236
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:06,388
Look at you. You were once so great.

237
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,317
I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.

238
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,263
It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.

239
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,805
It's Admiral Zhao, now.

240
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,787
That title will not help you against the Avatar.

241
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:22,918
Do not try to fight him! You are no match!

242
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:25,498
I think I can handle a child.

243
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:30,266
I have never seen such raw power.

244
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,058
Jeong Jeong!

245
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:35,795
We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!

246
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:45,392
It's a trick! He's run off into the woods.

247
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:48,115
Find him!

248
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:51,587
Let's find out what my old master has taught you.

249
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,449
You were Jeong Jeong's student?

250
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,139
Until I got bored.

251
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:02,984
I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward.

252
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:09,266
But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!

253
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,854
Whoa! Wild shot!

254
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,311
I'll show you wild!

255
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,067
No self control...

256
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,063
Stand and fight, Avatar!

257
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:30,433
Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.

258
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,567
I was!

259
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:40,331
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!

260
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:48,425
Ahoy! I'm Admiral Zhao!

261
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,936
I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.

262
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:05,716
Sloppy. Very sloppy.

263
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:22,510
No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!

264
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:26,548
You've lost this battle.

265
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:30,789
Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!

266
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,013
No, but you have.

267
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:42,513
Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

268
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,244
Have a nice walk home!

269
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:56,231
Aang, come on! Let's go!

270
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,777
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

271
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,121
He disappeared. They all did.

272
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:16,173
Hey, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!

273
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:26,699
Aang, you're burned.

274
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:30,465
Let me help you.

275
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,436
Wow! That's good water.

276
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,356
When did you learn how to do that?

277
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,321
I guess I always knew.

278
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,273
Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.

279
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:52,335
Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble...

280
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,574
...and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!

281
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,526
Two?

282
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,995
He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.

283
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,418
Oh, and the time that big snake bit me!

284
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,487
Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.
