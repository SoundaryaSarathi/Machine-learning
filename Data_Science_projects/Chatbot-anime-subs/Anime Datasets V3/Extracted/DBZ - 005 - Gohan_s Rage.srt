00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:17,500
W- what is this!?

2
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,606
I- it's Son Goku's boy...

3
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:28,887
I- impossible!

4
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,912
G- Gohan!

5
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,570
R- run, Gohan!

6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,504
Run away!

7
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:54,508
B- Battle power...

8
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,881
O- one thousand... one thousand
three hundred seven!?

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,193
Stop picking on...

10
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:13,392
...my father!!

11
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,789
G- Gohan?

12
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,120
Father?

13
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,730
Did you-?

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,393
Father...

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,912
Y- you little brat!

16
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,777
R- run!

17
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,813
Gohan, run away!

18
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,851
Run away! Quickly!

19
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:19,023
N- now his battle power is a mere 1?

20
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:26,903
It changed suddenly,
along with his emotions.

21
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,874
Father...

22
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,206
Run!

23
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,137
Gohan!

24
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,584
Gohan!

25
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:51,229
S- stop! Please stop! He's-

26
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,232
-still just a child? Is that
what you were going to say?

27
00:02:54,232 --> 00:03:00,238
You've got to be joking! That brat has
a battle power far higher than you two!

28
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm going to kill him now,

29
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,803
while he's still incapable
of adeptly using his power.

30
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:09,180
Don't worry.
You'll see him again soon enough!

31
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,171
In the Other World, that is.

32
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:24,961
Wait!

33
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:31,234
<i>You're the first one who has</i>
<i>inflicted this much damage on me.</i>

34
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,475
<i>But this is the end of the line for you.</i>

35
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:51,984
W- why, you!

36
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:55,257
You still have this much power left!?

37
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,026
Piccolo!

38
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:09,195
Hurry! Do that
technique from earlier!

39
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:21,186
I've been getting it ready,
just in case!

40
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:25,179
But it's still going to take...
a little bit more time!

41
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:29,194
Why didn't you grab his tail!?

42
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:34,199
If he decided to, he could
cut off his tail on his own!

43
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,064
Y- you knew about that?

44
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,209
Piccolo! Hurry!

45
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,939
Hurry it up, please!

46
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,409
<i>Damn! Thanks to the blow that kid</i>
<i>landed on me... my power has dropped!</i>

47
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:58,890
L- let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

48
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,018
You're going to get it too,
clinging to me like this!

49
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,166
I'm going to die together with you!

50
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,066
Y- you're what!?

51
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,837
Are you out of your mind!?

52
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:16,136
This is the only way
there is to defeat you!

53
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,637
Son Goku!

54
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:25,350
I'm not going to hesitate here.

55
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,049
If I can wipe you out as well,
nothing could be better for me!

56
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,095
<i>But then again,</i>

57
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:41,533
<i>your friends will probably just bring</i>
<i>you back to life with the Dragon Balls.</i>

58
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:46,232
Piccolo... still not yet?
My ribs are broken!

59
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:55,012
H- hurry!

60
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,053
O- one thousand
four hundred eighty-five!?

61
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:20,259
L- let me go! I was in the wrong!
I- I'll never come to this planet again!

62
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,178
Y- you think you can fool me again?

63
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:31,849
It's no lie! Don't you believe the
word of your own older brother!?

64
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,285
Piccolo! Hurry and do it!

65
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,525
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready for this!?

66
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,889
Do it!!

67
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,537
W- wait!

68
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>Makankosappo!!</i>

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,338
Stop!!

70
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:34,270
D- damn it to hell!

71
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:35,530
Damn... To think that I...
would be done in... by these guys!

72
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,805
T- take that!

73
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:48,853
W- who would have thought...
that Kakarrot...

74
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:53,847
...w- would even lay down...
his own life...

75
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,527
You idiot...

76
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,864
Son Goku can come back
to life right away.

77
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:01,532
W- what!?

78
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:05,870
We have these nice things called
Dragon Balls here on this planet.

79
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,208
By asking of them, any desire
one may have can become possible.

80
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,878
Bringing the dead back to life,
for example.

81
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:16,278
Damn it all...

82
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:23,179
Still, you've told me something good...

83
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:30,528
The entire situation up until now...

84
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:35,566
has been communicated to
m- my two pals, deep in space.

85
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:36,567
What?

86
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:40,503
They know that I've been done in...

87
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:46,941
...and they will be sure to come here...

88
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:51,916
...to handle not only you...

89
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,253
...but to completely mop up...

90
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:59,155
...e- every last person on this planet,
in the blink of an eye.

91
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,962
And while they're at it...

92
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,932
maybe they'll use those
whatever-you-called-them things...

93
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,868
and have me brought back to life.

94
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,204
T- those...

95
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,872
...other two...

96
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:18,543
...when will they get here?

97
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:22,604
One year... just one year from now...

98
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:33,558
One year? Two more of you...
who are even stronger?

99
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:38,896
Your chances of winning will be
absolutely zero that time for sure...

100
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:43,196
Enjoy yourselves as much
as you can for the next year...

101
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:54,439
It was a short-lived joy, wasn't it?

102
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:03,145
You guys are no more than worms,
after all...

103
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:21,430
<i>Right now, Goku-sa and the others must</i>
<i>be havin' a good time at the Kame House.</i>

104
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:26,071
<i>l wonder if Gohan is</i>
<i>adjustin' okay to them...</i>

105
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,881
<i>Still, he'll be okay.</i>

106
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,611
<i>That boy's got good manners.</i>

107
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:39,379
I wish I had gone, too...

108
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:43,322
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

109
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,257
Pa!

110
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,569
Chichi, where's Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

111
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,572
Hey, Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

112
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:57,564
I brung you a whole mess of presents-!

113
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,573
Pa!

114
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,686
I think it was around here somewhere.

115
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,542
You're out of your misery now.

116
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,535
You just had to go and spit out
all of that uncalled-for blather.

117
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,047
Son Goku, he's dead.

118
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,617
There's somebody there!

119
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,060
Some of them are down!

120
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,902
T- the only one standing is...

121
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,392
...Piccolo!

122
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,343
W- what the hell?

123
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:18,818
<i>At that same time,</i>
<i>a great distance away in space...</i>

124
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,295
That miserable Raditz...

125
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,505
He's dead.

126
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:10,269
He's pathetic! I mean, really...

127
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,810
...for him to be killed by someone

128
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,846
with a battle power of
just a bit more than a thousand!

129
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:20,184
What should we do? Put this
planet on hold and go there?

130
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:24,989
They mentioned something... interesting,
didn't they?

131
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,525
" Dragon... balls," or something.

132
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:31,195
Yeah. It sounds like
they can grant any wish.

133
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,197
All right then, let's go.

134
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,199
We're going to bring
Raditz back to life, right?

135
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,727
Don't make jokes! We don't need
that good-for-nothing any more.

136
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,210
We won't ever grow any older,

137
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,475
but instead have eternal youth.
How does that sound?

138
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:53,551
If that were so, we could
enjoy fighting forever!

139
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:56,520
I get you. That would be great!

140
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,815
That's how it happened.

141
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,562
I- I see...

142
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,164
Goku! Goku, I say!

143
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:10,099
Hey, Goku! Stay with us!

144
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,071
Gohan-<i>kun</i> is fine.
He's just unconscious.

145
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:22,179
Thank...

146
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,180
...goodness...

147
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,515
He's coming around.

148
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:25,850
Goku...

149
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,521
Chichi won't... chew me out...

150
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,182
Son-<i>kun</i>...

151
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,868
K- uririn...

152
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:50,541
...this dying stuff... it's pretty...
n- nasty, ain't it?

153
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,543
Y- you might say that.

154
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:56,547
W- what are you saying, Goku!?
D- don't give up!

155
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,549
This isn't like you!

156
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,217
Goku!

157
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:06,157
T- this time... it doesn't look...
so good for me...

158
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:10,355
D- don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

159
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:18,798
I'm... counting... on it...

160
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,511
Goku...

161
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,308
Goku!!

162
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,350
Goku!!

163
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:56,207
Everything else aside,
Kakarrot's son's battle power...

164
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,543
...was unusually high,
compared to Saiyan children.

165
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,879
It could have been some
kind of mistake, couldn't it?

166
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,216
No, there's no mistake.

167
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:12,145
Raditz did actually take a great
deal of damage from that kid's strike.

168
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:19,430
Apparently, when our blood
is mixed with an Earthling's,

169
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,167
it results in a hybrid with mighty power.

170
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,331
Hmph, a Super Saiyan, you mean?

171
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,844
I get it. If we were to produce
those guys one after another,

172
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,336
then once again, Saiyan rule
will no longer be a dream.

173
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,017
You've got to be kidding.

174
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,520
Just watch those guys grow and gain
even greater power for themselves.

175
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,320
Then it will be <i>our</i> positions
that are in danger.

176
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,527
That would be true.

177
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,862
In any case,

178
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,866
we will exterminate everyone on Earth.

179
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,096
Three days should be enough for that.

180
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,645
Until then, let's have ourselves a good,
long sleep for the first time in a while.

181
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,943
Yeah! I'll look forward
to seeing you in a year!

182
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,366
Goku!

183
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,841
Goku!

184
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:40,177
Goku...

185
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:43,977
Son-<i>kun</i>! I can't stand you dying!

186
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:46,410
Goku!

187
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:55,484
He vanished!

188
00:18:57,194 --> 00:19:00,686
I get it. This is Kami's doing.

189
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:05,869
This is something he would be capable of.

190
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,705
That bastard.

191
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:12,209
He's thinking of using Son Goku
again for some nonsense or other.

192
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,234
Some nonsense?

193
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:23,220
<i>How does Kami-sama</i>
<i>intend to use Son Goku?</i>

194
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,523
<i>Now that Goku is no longer</i>
<i>here to rely on,</i>

195
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:30,926
<i>is there any means left</i>
<i>of defending the Earth?</i>

196
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:43,370
<i>The mighty Saiyans arrive</i>
<i>on Earth in one year!</i>
