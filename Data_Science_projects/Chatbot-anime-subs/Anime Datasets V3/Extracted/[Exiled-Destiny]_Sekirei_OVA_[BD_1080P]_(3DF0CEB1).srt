00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,220
"Kusano's First Shopping Trip"

2
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm home!

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,960
Ah, Landlady!

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,030
Welcome back.

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,030
Musubi-san won again today?

6
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,030
Yes!
This is my tenth consecutive win!

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,090
Tsukiumi-san, thank you, too.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,880
Here! Open your mouth!

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,050
I'll pass you the fish.

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,210
I-I'm telling you, I can do it by myself...

11
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,420
Tension zings through the room even
in an ordinary scene of domestic bliss.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,460
Matsu-san!

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,060
Say, Musubi-chan.

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,490
Yes?

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,660
Maybe... you can switch
with Tsukiumi sometimes...

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,070
I refuse!

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,970
Forget about Little Kusano.

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,470
That position next to Minato
rightfully belongs to me, his real wife!

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,680
Therefore, it is meaningful
to get it back by my own hands!

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,650
Isn't that a bit over the top?

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,950
It isn't. It's a matter of
my pride as thy real wife!

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,090
What's the matter, Ku-chan?

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm your wife, too!

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,760
So, I will compete in
the shopping race, too!

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
That's her eleventh lap.

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,970
She's full of fighting spirit.

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,110
There's one problem.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,650
Kusano-tan's never really gone
out of the house, and she may get lost,

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,420
or face something
even more dangerous.

30
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,720
But looking at her,
I fear she shan't listen to us,

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,050
no matter how hard
we try to convince her.

32
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,430
Ku-chan always asks me
what she can do to help me.

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,500
I wonder if
because she's the littlest

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,370
that she wants to work as
hard as everybody else does.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,310
Well, I do rather
understand her feelings.

36
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,140
Yes...

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,780
But I worry about her
going out shopping alone.

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,220
Then I'll give her a hand.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,550
What?

40
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,890
I'm leaving!

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,090
Here I go!

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,330
I'm going!

43
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,700
Take care!

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,170
Do your best, Ku-chan!

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,530
Right!

46
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,830
Now...

47
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,670
Let's start the shopping race!

48
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,380
Musubi, I trust thou understandest.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,880
We'll watch over her
stealthily from the shadows

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,580
so she can succeed
at shopping, won't we?

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,590
Right.
We shall put aside our duel this time.

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,850
Yes! Let's do our best!

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,860
System on!

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,730
Now I can pinpoint her
position no matter where she goes!

55
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,600
It's kinda nice... that
everybody's working hard for Ku-chan.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,570
Because of you.

57
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,840
Huh?

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,050
I'm sure that they are good kids
because you're the one they're with.

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,770
Landlady...

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,290
Looks like Ku-chan's lost.

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,160
The landlady put
the map in her shopping bag!

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,090
Look at the map! The map!

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,720
It seems like she's completely
forgotten about the map.

64
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,500
What?!

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,570
Kusano-tan's straying from the planned path.

66
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,840
We don't need you to tell us that!
Musubi, do something!

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,930
Yes!

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,920
Ahem. This road has closed.
Please take another road.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,390
Okay!

70
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,050
Ah, if you have a map,
you should look at it.

71
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,940
I just blocked the road and told
her about the map. It's perfect!

72
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
Good work, Musubi!

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,740
She calls this
"just blocking the road"?

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,900
That's it, huh?

75
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,380
The shopping district is straight ahead.

76
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,640
It's going well.

77
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,290
A kitty cat!

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,910
She's going into the alley!

79
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,130
She looks like she's chasing Mr. Cat.

80
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,890
What?!

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
They're going to collapse.

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,370
Hey Kusano, that's dan... dan...

83
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
She's off of her route again.

84
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,100
Shut up! This is not the time for that!

85
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,350
Oh no!

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
What are we even doing?

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,330
Tsukiumi-san, look at Ku-chan!

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,560
What?!

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,150
No!

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,770
If that's how you want to play this...

91
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,900
Tsukiumi-san, where are you going?

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,740
Why is Kusano-tan taking
such a complicated route?

93
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,580
Um, it was Mr. Cat...

94
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,610
Huh? Who?

95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,250
Water Arrow!

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,770
I see. We can just lead Mr. Cat
toward the shopping district.

97
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,800
Let's go, Musubi!

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes!

99
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,360
To the right!

100
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,180
She's getting close to the shopping district.

101
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,690
But... what are all these...

102
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:30,920
"Supermarket Maruyama"
But... what are all these...

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,540
"Supermarket Maruyama"

104
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,790
No more kitty cat...

105
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,630
We managed to lead her to her destination...

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,630
Y-Yes.

107
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,600
All that's left is to buy potatoes and carrots.

108
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,800
"Organic Vegetables
Corner"

109
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:44,870
"Organic Vegetables
Corner"
I wonder if she's forgotten what to get.

110
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,200
I wonder if she's forgotten what to get.

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,840
What?!

112
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,710
I have an idea!

113
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,640
What's that?

114
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,510
"Meat"
What's that?

115
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,480
Why do I have to act so suspiciously?

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,820
No, no, Tsukiumi-san.
You must disguise your voice.

117
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,020
Like this?

118
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,230
Ah, this is the season when
potatoes and carrots taste the best!

119
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,830
You're right! Those are
absolutely the things to get.

120
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,230
Potatoes and carrots!

121
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,670
Yes, potatoes and carrots!

122
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,410
Good! Now, all she
needs to do is go home.

123
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,570
Yes.

124
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,410
Kusano-tan's made it home safe and sound!

125
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,560
Let our solemn duel begin now!

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,260
Yes!

127
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,260
I have the superior sprinting power.
The seat next to Minato shall be mine!

128
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,600
I won't lose!

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,070
W-Who came first?

130
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,280
I don't know... Where's Ku-chan?

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Come to think of it...

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Tsu-chan, Mu-chan.

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,640
- Kusano!
- Ku-chan!

134
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,290
Thank you.

135
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,290
You helped me a whole lot
with my shopping, didn't you?

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,730
Oh well, considering how flashy they were
about it, it would be odd if she didn't notice.

137
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:29,740
I couldn't shop by myself.
So I lost the shopping race.

138
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,540
No, the seat next to
Minato belongs to thee.

139
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,610
Thou didst well in thy
very first shopping trip.

140
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,610
Thou art certainly qualified to be his wife.

141
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,920
Out of respect, we have decided to
grant thee a seat next to Minato forever.

142
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,750
Isn't that right, Musubi?

143
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,760
Yes, we have!

144
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,930
Welcome back.

145
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,930
Welcome back, Ku-chan.

146
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,930
I'm back, big bro...

147
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,960
Ku-chan?!

148
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,930
- Kusano!
- Ku-chan!

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
She fell asleep...

150
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,940
Our plan was a complete failure.

151
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,780
We did it so secretly, too...

152
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,810
Yeah...

153
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,950
That lack of self-awareness might
be the biggest cause for this failure.

154
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,360
My, it's unusual for all three of
you to be in the bath at once, isn't it?

155
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,960
We're reviewing our game
today while we wash up.

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,100
Reviewing your game?

157
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,970
Ku-chan found out we were
helping her behind the scenes.

158
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,870
But I think you were both admirable.

159
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,610
You gave her a seat next
to Sahashi-san, didn't you?

160
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,010
That is... well...

161
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,980
Yes...

162
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,980
If our other choice is to
worry this much each time...

163
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,150
It's much easier for us
to just race by ourselves.

164
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,290
Ah, you're awake?

165
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,830
Where's everyone?

166
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,460
They're taking a bath so we can
have dinner together after you wake up.

167
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,740
How about we all go out
shopping together sometime?

168
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,270
With no races or anything.

169
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes! Hey, big brother.

170
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,420
I like Mu-chan, Tsu-chan,
Ma-chan, and everybody very much!

171
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,620
Yes.

172
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,520
Me, too.
