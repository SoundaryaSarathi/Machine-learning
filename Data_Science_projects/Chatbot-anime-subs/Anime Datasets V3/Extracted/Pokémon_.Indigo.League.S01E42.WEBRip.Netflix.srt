What's that, Brock?

174

The juice of this fruit
has very special properties.

175
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,972
It has the power to heal your throat
if it's sore or tired.

176
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,225
If Jigglypuff eats it,
it might start singing.

Would you like to try some?

I wanted to tell you,

346
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,306
I'm really sorry about starting that fight
with you yesterday.

347
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,682
Oh, no, no. It was my fault.

348
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,933
Huh?

349
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,478
Jigglypuff's song
not only puts people to sleep,

350
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,230
but maybe it has the power
to make people nicer, too.

351
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,690
-[man] Hey, it's you.
-Huh?

352
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,361
I just wanted to apologize
for bumping into you like that last night.

353
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,364
-Uh, you're that guy.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

354
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,366
That's okay. Thanks for the apology.

355
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,785
So, where's Jigglypuff gone?

356
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,455
-Did it get mad and run off somewhere?
-Jigglypuff!

357
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,754
[Jessie] We've failed again.
The earplugs didn't even work.

358
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,965
But the skies are blue
and the air is so fresh.

359
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,259
[Meowth] Isn't life great?

360
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,178
[all laugh]

361
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,763
[James] Tra-la-la-la-la!

362
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,684
[Ash] This is great.
Everyone in town is so happy now.

363
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,522
Yeah, everyone needs a good rest now
and then to recharge.

364
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,191
But where could Jigglypuff
have run off to?

365
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,818
I wanted to capture it.

366
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,196
Maybe it started its own quest
to find someone

367
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,407
who can hear its song
all the way through.

368
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,325
I hope we meet Jigglypuff again.
