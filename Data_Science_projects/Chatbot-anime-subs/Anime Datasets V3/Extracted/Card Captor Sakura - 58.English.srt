1
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:04,479
Weird…

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,141
I was pretty sure…

3
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:09,146
I felt Clow’s aura here.

4
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:17,885
It’s like as if
nothing ever happened.

5
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:38,340
Hey Sakura,

6
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,011
there’s nothing
around here at all.

7
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,748
It’s raining.

8
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:53,796
This isn’t going to do
much right now.

9
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:55,522
Shall we retreat for now?

10
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:17,612
Sakura and her friends
are going home.

11
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:19,679
Is that ok?

12
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,263
It would seem that
you have a plan.

13
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:36,703
[Sakura and Friends’ Big Trouble]

14
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,476
I’m soaking wet.

15
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,687
I’m transforming.

16
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:55,250
Wait Yue, let me go first.

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,693
It wouldn’t be good if Yukito
saw me like this.

18
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,426
Hurry up then.

19
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,337
Umm Yue-san.

20
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,546
– Please come in.
– I’m ok.

21
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:24,178
But, you’ll catch a cold…

22
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,317
I don’t catch colds.

23
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,960
– Ah, I feel Clow’s aura.
– No good!

24
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,333
I can’t transform!

25
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,240
What?

26
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,316
I can’t transform to Yukito.

27
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,160
Now what will you do,

28
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,790
Sakura-san?

29
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,904
Why don’t you fold your wings?

30
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,382
I’m totally soaked…

31
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,255
Don’t do that! Here…

32
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,117
What’s going on??

33
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,359
I felt Claw’s aura again

34
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:14,729
and then…

35
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,893
We can no longer transform.

36
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,067
What shall we do?

37
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:27,765
Hmm… I don’t know…

38
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,068
I can’t think of anything.

39
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:30,813
Me neither.

40
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,181
Why don’t we try it one more time?

41
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,780
I guess.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,524
It… it is no good…

43
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,263
Now what

44
00:04:56,873 --> 00:05:01,139
Now what… now what now what??

45
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,505
What was that noise?

46
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:09,309
No… Nothing…

47
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,953
It was me…

48
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,354
Now what… now what… haaaao.

49
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:26,067
Now what. Now what. Now what…

50
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:29,796
Now go to bed…

51
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,532
Since we can’t do much about it now,

52
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:03,333
anyway, shall we get some rest?

53
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,740
Maybe tomorrow morning,

54
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,707
you can transform back.

55
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,178
Yeah…

56
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Yue-san, Please sleep on the bed.

57
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,623
No.
I’m fine.

58
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,186
– But…
– No problem.

59
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:28,560
How come you don’t ask me,

60
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:29,897
Sakura?

61
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:32,999
Huh?

62
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,195
But Kero-chan,

63
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:37,036
you are… well…

64
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:42,806
Goodnight.

65
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:09,235
I definitely

66
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,067
can’t think of Yukito-san

67
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,508
and Yue-san being the same person.

68
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,446
But,

69
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,950
if Yue-san can’t transform back,

70
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,290
then what happens to Yukito-san

71
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:32,685
Sakura-chan.

72
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,428
To make sure that doesn’t happen,

73
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,201
we have to think of something tomorrow.

74
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:53,341
Shall we try again?

75
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:07,090
It’s still not working.

76
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,392
What about Yue-san?

77
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,338
It really doesn’t work?

78
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:21,739
Sakura-san, breakfast is ready…

79
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,640
Yes… yes…

80
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,113
Just wait for me.

81
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,493
Thank you for the food.

82
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,763
It’s sunday… I’m sorry.

83
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:52,069
No, that’s fine…

84
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:58,312
Well then, I’ll be back…

85
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,049
See you then.

86
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:10,486
– I’m leaving too… 
– See you when you get back…

87
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,560
But what can we do to

88
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:21,831
bring Kero-chan and Yue-san back?

89
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,691
Stop eating snacks

90
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,958
so mindlessly

91
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:48,489
and think of what we can do.

92
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,793
Even if we are in a hurry,

93
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,429
it won’t do anything

94
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,772
Oh yeah, tonight is

95
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:01,338
your turn to cook dinner, right?

96
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,213
Don’t you have

97
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,174
a lot of things to do?

98
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:10,052
But…

99
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,085
Then should we not think about

100
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:16,415
this after you finish your chores?

101
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,422
If you don’t do them,

102
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:20,224
your big brother will nag at you.

103
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:22,224
I don’t know how to say.

104
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:25,124
I guess so,

105
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,201
ok let’s finish them.

106
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:30,463
Help me, Kero.

107
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,603
Huh? Why me?

108
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:36,977
Doing things
together will finish sooner.

109
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,041
Otherwise,

110
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,848
my big brother will be back.

111
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,819
I can’t handle delicate objects

112
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,553
with hands like this, in this form.

113
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:51,060
Would you please?

114
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,628
Ok,

115
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,193
then ask Yue too!

116
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,163
It is unfair

117
00:10:58,468 --> 00:10:59,730
to just ask me.

118
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:12,279
Ok! Yue-san,

119
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,816
please take a rest here.

120
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,719
Ahhh! Why are you saying that!?

121
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,358
Why do I have to help you day after day?

122
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,088
Things you won’t make Yue do,
I won’t do either.

123
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,494
It would be better
to ask for Yue’s help too.

124
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:35,631
Rice washing Yue,

125
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,265
bathtub cleaning Yue,

126
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:41,165
laudry laying Yue, dusting Yue!

127
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,642
I think you should help out
with household chores too.

128
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:48,711
Hrm? I’m ok.

129
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:51,179
Since I’m cute!

130
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:08,201
Coming!

131
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,997
Kinomoto-san, package.

132
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,978
Do you have a stamp?

133
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:20,309
Ah, please wait a moment.

134
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,286
Here you go!

135
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,423
Here…

136
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,791
It will go bad,

137
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,661
so put it in the fridge.

138
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,337
Ok. Understand.

139
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,103
Keep up the good work.

140
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,167
Thank you.

141
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,986
What were you thinking?

142
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:03,115
I had something to ask you…

143
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,726
Dumping this I guess…

144
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:09,888
It is difficult to hold it.

145
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,113
I started the laundry.

146
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:29,508
Well done.

147
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:39,326
Why aren’t you making
Yue do anything?

148
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,596
Clow and you

149
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,492
both treat Yue too nice…

150
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,142
Take this…

151
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:03,986
No! Don’t do it!!!

152
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,284
Hrm, how can we get you cleaned up?

153
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:43,750
Do you have the Bubble card?

154
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,196
– Yeah.
– Use that card on me…

155
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,455
– Is that ok?
– But

156
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,523
since you shouldn’t overdo it,

157
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,569
make sure you wish sincerely

158
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,769
that you want
to clean me before using it.

159
00:14:58,174 --> 00:14:59,436
I get it.

160
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,645
RELEASE!

161
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:14,519
Kero, here we go…

162
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,116
Go.

163
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:17,957
O Card created by Clow,

164
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,861
discard thine old form and be reborn.

165
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:24,191
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

166
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:25,892
Bubble!

167
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:38,493
I didn’t know
I can use the Bubble card to do this…

168
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,144
Clow used to wash me like this often.

169
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,612
Then Clow-san made

170
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,652
this card for you, Kero?

171
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:50,720
That’s not it…

172
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:52,621
Clow used to use bubble

173
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,120
to wash me,

174
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,255
but also to wash his clothes.

175
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,834
Really?

176
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,225
Yeah, he was weird.

177
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:03,735
Also, he shut his sensitive sides away.

178
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:07,570
Then, I’m going over there to clean up.

179
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:09,976
Ahh, yes. Back then…

180
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,011
and then… and then…

181
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,614
was like this…

182
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,108
damn it…

183
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,150
Haaoo, what happened to the floor?

184
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:34,194
Yue-san, you cleaned it?

185
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,435
Thank you.

186
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,402
What about Kerberos?

187
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,239
In the washroom,

188
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,907
I just gave them a bath with Bubble.

189
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:49,911
Ah, Clow-san used

190
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,617
to wash Kero with bubble too, right?

191
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:54,647
How did you know?

192
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,089
Kero told me.

193
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:07,736
Yue-san…

194
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,465
You really care for Kero, don’t you?

195
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,367
Even now…

196
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,607
What make you think that?

197
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:15,968
Because,

198
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,174
you have this kind look

199
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,142
when talking about Kero.

200
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,550
My dad told me…

201
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,954
because he still loves my mom so much.

202
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,122
Even if he was to reborn,

203
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,053
he will end up loving her again.

204
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,189
You just seemed

205
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,625
Like my dad

206
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,834
when he talks like that
so I was just curious…

207
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,518
Ah, I’m sorry for

208
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,207
saying weird things all of a sudden.

209
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,690
We gotta hurry up and finish cleaning

210
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,836
and get you guys back
to your original forms…

211
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,333
Waaa! It is crab!!

212
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,039
A crab?

213
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,405
Its shell…

214
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:26,012
Protecting the insides.

215
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:27,773
Protect.

216
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,218
That is it.

217
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:32,845
Ahh!! That was a good bath,

218
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:34,414
I feel so refreshed…

219
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:35,748
I have an idea,

220
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:37,553
Kero.

221
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,558
Menu for dinner?

222
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,355
Not that,

223
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:43,693
just come with me.

224
00:18:58,481 --> 00:18:59,971
O Card created by Clow,

225
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,413
discard thine old form and be reborn.

226
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,354
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

227
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:10,619
Shield!

228
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:17,688
Shield, huh.

229
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,465
Try transforming now.

230
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:23,972
Right.

231
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,179
It worked!

232
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:35,809
I thought about Shield since

233
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,214
it is able to block off
magic and attacks.

234
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,054
Yue-san, please give it a try.

235
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:52,965
It worked!

236
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:02,374
Huh? Why am I over at Sakura’s house?

237
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,977
It’s already over. That wasn’t so fun.

238
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,044
So you decided to use the Shield card.

239
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:14,354
You are a careful person.

240
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,520
Shield is used

241
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,691
to protect valuable objects.

242
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,530
If the user’s will to

243
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,558
protect that object is stronger,

244
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,797
then the stronger the power of Shield.

245
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,999
It surely is,

246
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:31,564
Sakura…

247
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,608
I’m sorry,

248
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,376
I feel as if I’ve suddenly
barged in and burdened you.

249
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,009
It’s nothing.

250
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,612
Crab-goroke?

251
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:48,452
Well, it tastes so formal.

252
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,389
What did you say?

253
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,962
Touya! Sakura, it is really good.

254
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,192
Really?

255
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:57,699
Yes.

256
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,661
That’s good.

257
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,464
But it’s really a good thing
that you can return back, Yukito…

258
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,703
Hey, Sakura!

259
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:12,109
You haven’t eaten anything.

260
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:15,149
Shall we see test your
food for poison?

261
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,778
That’s not it.

262
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,820
Yuki, have some antidote
before you leave.

263
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:21,683
I said that’s not it…

264
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,668
It’s quite tiring to stay
large like that.

265
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,212
But stopping us

266
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,141
from returning to
our alternate forms.

267
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,444
It must be Clow.

268
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,614
What’s going on?
