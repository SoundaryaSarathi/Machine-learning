00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,790
, Emergency measures have been taken</font></font>

168
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,680

.Taquero-sama</font></font>

173
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,790
He claimed Minerva from Martha Alvenus</font></font>

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,100
. From today onwards, I'll get to Tenby Academy</font></font>

175
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,550
Maybe a very short period of time may be, but to look forward to working together</font></font>

176
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,590
Kenkibo</font></font>

177
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,450
, Aoyama-san, in fact</font></font>

178
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,720
Countermeasures taken yesterday on that knowledge</font></font>

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,180
It caused difficulties. You may inside the school</font></font>

.I understand</font></font>

181

In addition, you did not pass the exam until your feature</font></font>

182
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,930
Huh? </font>How do you know this?</font></font>

183
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,820
. I have received a report from the school principal</font></font>

.Edo Almckin-Ki never failed before</font></font>

186
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,990
... Therefore,</font></font>

If you fail. Just configuration exam, I think</font></font>

193
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,420
.Hassana, do not be frustrating</font></font>

194
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,710
.Almckin-so is not considered life like for you</font></font>

195
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,900
. I want to be with Takeru-sama all the time</font></font>

196
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,500
... and also my post Kkhtaibth</font></font>

. This is true</font></font>

198
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,840
Banished from your eyes. If Takei-chan for a moment, you'll chase another girl</font></font>

199
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,700
.Aa him from a bad excuse</font></font>

.Alomr has nothing to do with me</font></font>

201
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,700
What happened?</font></font>

202
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,570
Is there a problem for you?</font></font>

203
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,100
.Ooh, you are the heroine with a beautiful silver hair</font></font>

204
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,150
I thought. Also, it's not here, it's not on my list</font></font>

205
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,080
Minerva-san. It's, which has come here yesterday</font></font>

.Harith to get the talent, learn everything in one day is possible</font></font>

211
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,890
In this case, why not ask everyone for help</font></font>

212
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,220
...This means</font></font>

213
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,370

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,700
. This is the case that I wanted to see her</font></font>

221
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,040
It seems that you misunderstood something</font></font>

222
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,390
.Alomr is not so</font></font>

223
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,080
Huh?</font></font>

224
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,790
. Many of the women Taatnafsn to get the man it is quite like the story of the harem</font></font>

225
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,990
Is not this is the standard in this country?</font></font>

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,400
Try hard doing it yourself is the right way, right?</font></font>

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,190
Later advisors will Otvkdk</font></font>

, Even if we meet again</font></font>

258
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,510
No. We can be together</font></font>

259
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:08,460
. How should I say it? </font>I've always been very close to me and is still far away from me</font></font>

260
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,900
.Walohm, it should be more interested Dikma things to talk about</font></font>

261
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,900
... about it ... I know it is related to him, but</font></font>

262
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,930
A.-It's not about Btaki-chan</font></font>

263
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,170
. [We have said only done</font></font>

264
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,910
. If, the matter is true</font></font>

265

268
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,870
.For this rate, you will not be able to hit five meters away tomorrow's exam</font></font>

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,850
Are you disturbed by the fact that you are not able to stop the battle again?</font></font>

270
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,210
...shut up</font></font>

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,510
. I do not know why it has become complicated with those things and I do not want to even know</font></font>

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,930
. But if you think you are right, just make your way to</font></font>

279
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,170
.Hmm ... There is nothing wrong if they were more, too</font></font>

280
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,060
Do you have such a detailed planning already for your future?</font></font>

Oh, what's the problem?</font></font>

283
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,450
. I think that the time has come to lose its progress in training</font></font>

284
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,550
I come also advisors will</font></font>

285
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,100

.You can cook a delicious meal for him</font></font>

287
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,000

.Aanaho-chan, will make a lot, so excited about being</font></font>

292
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,310

Do you do it?</font></font>

297
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,120
. This can not be imagined</font></font>

298
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,830
.Amcunnina feeling the amount of elements is increasing suddenly</font></font>

299

Most importantly, do this from Fltk?</font></font>

301
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,620
A.-I do not know</font></font>

302
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,280
.Sidta, someone here</font></font>

303
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,680
.I know that</font></font>

304
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,810
It seems that it is not the other person Takeru</font></font>

305
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,640
What about off the game hide and seek?</font></font>

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,520
.Minerva</font></font>

307

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,850
Maybe, Hemegama-san, too</font></font>

312
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,990
You can see the element itself?</font></font>

313
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,990
If, how do you look in your eyes?</font></font>

314
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,750
Why Minerva-san allowed to go alone?</font></font>

315
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:23,500
.Hemegama Kodama bearing evidence of what they want Kamigarri, Yamato O'Kane</font></font>

319
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:44,120
Why we ordered us to live as students in ordinary Tenby Academy?</font></font>

320
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,690
. This is true</font></font>

321
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,220
Good timing.</font></font>

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,050
.Ood to ask you about something, too</font></font>

323
