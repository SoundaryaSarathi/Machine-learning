-What's the matter?
-Pika?

I think maybe I'm allergic to ghosts.
Kind of feel sort of dizzy.

You're not scared are you?

00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:19,431
Haunter, in Saffron City,
there's a trainer named Sabrina

00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,308
who uses psychic Pokémon.

40
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,729
Ghost Pokémon are strong
against psychic Pokémon, right?

Stop goofing around!
Aren't you even coming in with me?

53
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,992
Last time, she wanted to play with us
and pretended we were her bowling pins.

Remember?

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,957
And she almost bowled a strike.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,918
Now that I've got Haunter,
that won't happen again.

57
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,170
I wouldn't be too sure, Ash.

58
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,840
What if Haunter's the one
who's controlling you?

59
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,258
Huh?

Another battle?

79
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,228
Even after my Kadabra beat up your Pikachu
during the last match?

80
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,396
You don't have a chance.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,565
This time, you won't have it so easy.

82
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,651
If you lose,
you'll have to play with me again.

83
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,531
Go, Kadabra.

84
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,329
Kadabra.

85
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,833
And I choose as my Pokémon Haunter!
Go, Haunter!

86
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,003
So, you captured a ghost Pokémon, did you?

87
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,011
-Where is it?
-Kadabra, Kadabra.

88
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,472
Uh, Haunter?

00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,476
Hey, Haunter, where'd you go?

90
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,854
Will Haunter please report to the floor?

91
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,482
Looks like the ghost Pokémon got spooked.

92
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,318
Haunter's not the most dependable Pokémon
in the world.

93

Enough stalling.
Send out your Pokémon at once

Great, back where we started.

Forget Haunter. Send out another one.

101
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,461
Right.

Uh, yeah, just a sec.

111

The battle will begin now.

112

Uh...

113
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,238
I quit.

-Quit?

Hey, take it easy. Please wait!

Hey, where'd you come from?

130
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,455
Sometimes, you've got to retreat to win.

00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,684
Hey, Pikachu, I'm glad you're safe,
but would you please get off my back?

136
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,478
Will you all please get off mine?

-Charmander!
-Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle.

138
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,024
[sighs]

139
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,652
Sabrina's the meanest trainer I ever met.

140
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,655
She wasn't always such a mischievous girl.

141
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,574
You mean, you knew Sabrina
before she changed?

142
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,078
Huh?
Well, I've heard stories.

143
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,838
Please stop, Sabrina. That's enough.

144
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,758
That's not a toy.

145
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,677
Humph.

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,098
[both grunting]

147
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,017
[man]
Though she was very young,

148
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,020
Sabrina became completely obsessed
with her psychic training.

149
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,650
She didn't want to make friends.

150
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,445
All she wanted was to be left alone
to develop her powers.

151
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,948
Her parents tried to help,

152
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,284
but Sabrina used her psychic powers
to drive them away.

153
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,538
The conflict caused Sabrina
to split into two girls.

154
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,666
The strong Pokémon trainer
who is always causing trouble

155
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:24,129
and the lonely little girl
who desperately desires to make friends.

156
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,633
That doll that Sabrina always holds
represents her true self

157
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,971
before her training,
before she rejected her own heart.

158
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,559
Sabrina had this picture of her family
in her room.

159
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,478
If you have the same picture,
then that must mean you're...

160
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,981
[thinks] <i>Huh? Does he know?</i>

161
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,233
<i>He must have figured it out by now.</i>

162
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,484
<i>After everything I've said,</i>

163
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,487
<i>he must have figured out the truth</i>
<i>about Sabrina and me.</i>

164
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,741
<i>He must realize that I'm Sabrina's father.</i>

165
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,077
Then that must mean you're a photographer.

166
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,579
-Ah!
-Pika!

167
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,248
Don't you see? Don't you get it?

168
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,083
-Get what?
-Never mind.

169
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,170
Sabrina turned Brock and Misty into dolls.

170
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,174
-There's nothing we can do about that.
-Huh?

171
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,136
The only way to rescue your friends
is to defeat Sabrina.

172
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,098
Isn't that why you traveled
to Lavender Town to get a ghost Pokémon?

173
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,976
But Haunter's disappeared someplace.

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,062
Then you must find Haunter first.

175
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,608
Without it, you'll never be able
to defeat Sabrina and her psychic Pokémon.

176
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,234
I guess not.

177
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,528
[sighs]

178
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,034
Pikachu,
where do you think Haunter could be?

179
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,702
Pika, pika.

180
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,831
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation...

181
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,209
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation...

182
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,128
To denounce the evils of truth and love...

183
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,631
To extend our reach to the stars above...

184
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,883
-Jessie.
-James.

185
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,052
Yeah, yeah, that's very dramatic.

186
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,638
Now, let's cut to the chase
and catch that Pikachu.

187
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,556
Just leave that to us.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,893
By the way, what's the secret weapon
you got cooked up this time?

189
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,523
A deadly weapon that's been perfected
over thousands of years.

190
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,900
Now we have learned to use
its awesome powers.

191
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,821
With a flick of this fishing net,
we'll round up Pikachu.

192
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,989
You mean that's your secret weapon?

193
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,493
It takes a genius to realize
a fishing net is the perfect weapon.

194
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,330
Oh, James, it's the greatest discovery
since Einstein invented the light bulb.

195
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,251
[both] Even greater than the chicken
who invented the egg.

196
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,252
[both groan]

197
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,214
All of us true geniuses know, of course,

198
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,801
that it was actually the egg
that preceded the chicken.

199
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,721
Of course. I knew that.
I had just forgotten.

200
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,432
Now you got my brain scrambled.

201
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,686
Let's cut the eggs-planations
and capture Pikachu!

202
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,689
[grunts]

203
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,693
[growls]

204
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,611
[all scream]

205
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,530
[all yell]

206
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,116
[chortles]

207
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,786
[all whimper]

208
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,372
Jessie, pull us up!

209
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,623
You're too heavy.

210
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,252
I can't even pull myself up
until you both let go of my legs.

211
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,796
B... B.. But, Jessie, you have to.

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,964
Be brave.

213
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,719
If I let go, we're all goners,
but if you let go, at least I'll survive.

214
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,222
I'm the designated survivor,
so both of you better hold on tight.

215
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:26,394
[sobs] I thought we'd finally gotten away
from all those horrible ghost Pokémon,

216
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,771
but they followed us all the way here.

217
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,275
[howls]

218
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,904
[grunts]

219
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,907
Don't laugh, Jessie.
Otherwise, you're going to let go.

220
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,951
[gibbers]

221
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,412
[grunts]

222
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,331
Don't laugh. Don't smile.

223
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,416
[grunts]

224
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,004
I won't crack. The members of Team Rocket
have been trained to resist all silliness

225
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,006
and to be totally serious.

226
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,717
[chortles]

227
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,939
[screaming and laughing]

228
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,192
I really don't see what's so funny.

229
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,944
She's going to die laughing.

230
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,864
[screaming and laughing]

231
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,282
Huh? What was that?

232
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,535
-It's Team Rocket.
-Pikachu.

233
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,955
[chortling]

234
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,874
Haunter, you stopped them
from capturing Pikachu.

235
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,709
[guffawing] Haunter!

236
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,336
Way to go.

237
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,463
Now let's get back to Sabrina's gym.

238
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,006
[grunts]

239
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,634
But you promised
you'd help me battle Sabrina.

240
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,261
I can't beat her psychic Pokémon
without you.

241
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,596
[growling]

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,140
Please,
you can't let her make a fool out of me.

243
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,393
Haunter! [chortling]

244
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,437
Oh, gee, thanks, Haunter. Thank you.

245
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,772
Just help me save my friends,

246
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,899
and you'll never
have to help me out again.

247
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,485
Haunter, Haunter, Haunter.

248
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,076
[Brock thinks] <i>Misty,</i>
<i>what do you think's going to happen to us?</i>

249
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,662
[Misty thinks] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I've never been a doll before.</i>

250
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,082
[Brock] <i>I don't even like dolls.</i>
<i>Are we going to be stuck this way forever?</i>

251
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,501
[thinks]
<i>That depends. It's up to Sabrina.</i>

252
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,004
-[Brock] Ah!
-[Misty] <i>That other doll just spoke.</i>

253
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,007
[thinks] <i>It's nice to have company.</i>
<i>I'm Sabrina's mother.</i>

254
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,466
[Brock] <i>Her mother?</i>

255
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,510
[Misty]
<i>She turned you into a doll too?</i>

256
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,971
[mother]
<i>Please don't think badly of Sabrina.</i>

257
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,432
<i>She's really a good daughter.</i>

258
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,184
[Kadabra giggling]

259
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,772
-My new dolls are so cute.
-[both] Huh?

260
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:39,777
What game should I play first
with my brand-new Brock and Misty dolls?

261
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,279
Maybe we can have tea.

262
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,449
[Brock] <i>Sabrina.</i>
<i>Turn us back into humans right now.</i>

263
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,369
[Misty] <i>I challenge you to a match.</i>
<i>If I win, you've got to change us back.</i>

264
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,873
If I change you back,
you'll just run away from me.

265
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,708
You have to stay as dolls.

266
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,212
We'll play together all the time,
and we'll all be friends forever.

267
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,922
[Ash] Sabrina!

268
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,799
I knew he'd be back.

269
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,097
Have you returned for more humiliation?

270
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,475
Haven't you realized
that you'll never defeat me?

271
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,062
Brock and Misty are my friends,
and I can't leave them behind,

272
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,899
not even if you're going to turn me
and all my Pokémon into dolls!

273
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,150
-Pika!
-[both] <i>Ash!</i>

274
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,154
If you want to be a doll too,
I'll be glad to play with you.

275
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,824
It'll be a one-on-one battle.
Sabrina's Pokémon will be...

276
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,410
Kadabra.

277
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:34,457
-And for my Pokémon, I choose Haunter!
-Haunter?

278
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,834
Well, where is your Pokémon?

279
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,755
Oh, no, not again. Ah!

280
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,882
-[Pikachu] Pikachu!
-Why don't you forfeit?

281
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,259
That way,
I'll have new dolls to play with.

282
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,011
Ah!

283
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,763
Haunter! Haunter!

284
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,100
You promised me!
Where'd you go? Please stop hiding!

285
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,853
-Haunter! Haunter!
-Pika.

286
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,939
This time, you won't escape.

287
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,858
[giggling] My new dolly.

288
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,443
Dolly?

289
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,238
[groans]

290
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,365
-Pika!
-Pikachu!

291
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,993
You don't stand a chance against Kadabra.
You'll get beat up again.

292
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,704
-Come back!
-Pi. Pika!

293
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,834
-You don't want Sabrina to make me a doll?
-Pikachu.

294
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,378
-You want to fight for me?
-Pika!

295
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,298
Thank you, Pikachu. You're a real pal.

296
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,470
Pikachu, thunder shock!

297
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:33,182
Pikachu!

298
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,892
Kadabra, teleport.

299
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,644
[grunts]

300
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,898
Kadabra, psybeam.

301
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,405
Kadabra.

302
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,283
[whimpering]

303
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,036
Pikachu.

304
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,041
Try to hang on, Pikachu.
Come back at Kadabra with a thunderbolt.

305
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:05,798
Pikachu. Pika... chu!

306
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,760
Kadab... [whimpers]

307
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,013
-That's it.
-Recover.

308
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,140
Kadabra.

309
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,017
-[Ash gasps]
-Pika!

310
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,144
It's impossible to win.

311
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,021
[giggles]

312
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,189
Haunter?

313
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,484
Haunter!

314
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,152
[chortling]

315
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,279
Two against one's not fair.

316
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,366
It is just playing around on its own.

317
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,787
Haunter is not battling against you,
so it isn't against the rules.

318
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,372
Ah!

319
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,790
[grunts]

320
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,211
[growls]

321
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,300
[all] Huh?

322
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,972
[both gasp]

323
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,476
[Haunter cackles]

324
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,732
-Ah, she smiled.
-Huh?

325
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,319
-[chuckles]
-Haunter, Haunter.

326
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,071
[both laugh]

327
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,573
Is that Sabrina laughing?

328
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,701
Ever since she started
her telekinetic training as a little girl,

329
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,496
I've never seen Sabrina laugh like this.

330
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,500
I've never seen her so happy
in her entire life.

331
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,254
But if you've known Sabrina
ever since she was a little girl,

332
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,924
-does that mean...?
-Hmm. So you figured it out, eh?

333
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,510
You must have taken her baby pictures too.

334
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,929
[man screams]

335
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,682
Just how dense can a person be?

336
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,143
[clears throat]
But I'm glad you came back.

337
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,231
That Haunter has helped Sabrina
rediscover the human part of her heart.

338
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,607
What do you mean?

339
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,110
Haunter was supposed to beat
the psychic Pokémon,

340
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,445
and instead,
it's making friends with Sabrina.

341
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,989
I'm going to be a doll.

342
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,365
-Hmm, look over there.
-Huh?

343
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,867
[laughing] Kadabra.

344
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,705
I don't get it.
It looks like Kadabra's in pain.

345
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,373
It's not in any pain.

346
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,793
Kadabra and Sabrina
are joined telepathically.

347
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,047
Kadabra is rolling with laughter,
just like Sabrina.

348
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,719
[groaning]

349
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:19,223
[laughing]

350
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,191
[both gasping]

351
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,151
[both] Ah!

352
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,194
-Misty! Brock!
-Pika!

353
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:38,576
Since Kadabra is no longer able to battle,
I officially declare Pikachu the winner.

354
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,872
[both laughing]

355
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,040
[Ash] Goodbye!

356
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,586
-Thank you for everything!
-Have a good journey!

357
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,964
-Take care of yourselves!
-See you later!

358
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,680
[Ash] I've finally got a marsh badge.

359
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,558
And that marsh badge
puts you one step further along the road

360
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,934
to the Pokémon League.

361
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,189
Yeah, but do you really think
I deserved to get this marsh badge?

362
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,607
[Misty] Sure.

363
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,361
Making Sabrina laugh herself
into a defeat is great strategy.

364
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,612
Pika, pika!

365
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,489
Keep it up, and you'll become known

366
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,533
as the funniest Pokémon master
of all time.

367
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:23,496
Hello up there, anyone!
We're trapped down here!

368
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,541
-Stop pouring cement! Ah!
-Get me out of here quick!

369
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,669
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

370
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,546
I could've sworn I just heard
Team Rocket's voices.

371
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,881
No way.

372
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,009
We've got more important stuff
to think of, like where we're going.

373
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,804
Okay. So where's the next closest Gym?

374
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,681
In Celadon City.

375
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,267
Look out, Celadon City!
Ash Ketchum is coming to town!

376
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,396
-Pika!
-Hey, wait up, Ash!

377
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,980
[narrator]
<i>With a little help from Haunter,</i>

378
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,818
<i>Ash was able to defeat Sabrina</i>
<i>and win a marsh badge.</i>

379
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,529

383
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,666
<i>how will Team Rocket</i>

384
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,836
-A little cement...
-Will never stop Team Rocket.

385
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,713
A little cement?
