1
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:35,460
Looks like Freeza is
out and about, all right.

2
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,463
And so then, right there,
I told him...

3
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:41,193
Wait, hold on now...

4
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,066
What's this?

5
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,529
--What was that!?
--What's going on!?

6
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,498
W- what was that explosion just now?!

7
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,109
V- V- V-

8
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,873
Vegeta!

9
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,891
Damn!

10
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,731
Hey!

11
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,564
Where are the Dragon Balls?

12
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:07,443
Look at all of you,
lined up so loyally!

13
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,676
If you don't want to tell me...

14
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,879
...then you don't have to tell me.

15
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:41,112
Lousy small fry.

16
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:44,843
You can swear your allegiance
to Freeza from the Other Side now.

17
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,054
Damn it all, Freeza...

18
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,724
Seeing as how Ginyu stayed behind,

19
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:57,061
the Dragon Balls must
be around here somewhere.

20
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,998
In any event, those Earth
punks can locate them

21
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,400
with that strange
device of theirs.

22
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,070
They should be here
very shortly now.

23
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,336
Until then, I'll see about changing
into some new battle wear.

24
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:26,352
So, this is what it's like to have
a body with a power of 180,000?

25
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:34,432
However, I think my previous face
was more handsome. Right, Jheese?

26
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:36,525
Absolutely!

27
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:47,776
I- I've got to go faster, or Kuririn
and Gohan will get killed!

28
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,881
That way? No, this way!

29
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,394
<i>Ribbit... ribbit... ribbit...</i>

30
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:08,388
Damn it, I can't keep my balance
very well in this body.

31
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:22,080
<i>You know, there's something very unusual</i>
<i>about the medicine Kakarrot was using.</i>

32
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,082
<i>Not only does it heal injuries,</i>

33
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,518
<i>but it completely restores</i>
<i>one's strength as well.</i>

34
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,617
<i>The only ones in my size</i>
<i>are the older models, huh?</i>

35
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,034
We're almost there, Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

36
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,707
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, there it is!

37
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:53,473
G- got it! So that's
their spaceship, huh?

38
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:01,052
So, you've arrived, Earthlings.

39
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:04,422
It's no good if they realize I'm here.

40
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:09,325
I have to suppress my battle power,
the way they do.

41
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:17,402
Let's hurry and find them!
No one else seems to be here.

42
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:21,072
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, wait!

43
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,374
According to the readings
on the Radar,

44
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:26,775
the Dragon Balls aren't inside
the ship, but away from it.

45
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,419
Where are they, Gohan?

46
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,683
Let's see... this way.

47
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,682
Right over here.

48
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,368
Here they are, Kuririn-<i>san</i>, here!

49
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,670
Yeah, looks like something
was buried here, all right.

50
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,039
Why would they put them here?

51
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,041
Okay, let's dig them out!

52
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,372
Right!

53
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,051
Here's one! I found one!

54
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,394
There's another one over here!

55
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,396
Hooray! Here's another!

56
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,399
Looks like all seven are here after all!

57
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,665
<i>So that's where they hid them, huh?</i>

58
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,802
We've got them all!
We've got them all!

59
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:37,415
<i>Good. Now just summon</i>
<i>that Shen Long thing.</i>

60
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,384
<i>l'll put you two away,</i>

61
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:45,914
<i>and then have my wish of eternal life</i>
<i>and youth given to me!</i>

62
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:50,085
We did it!

63
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,023
Hey, Gohan, what's that
on your face?

64
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:06,400
Well, what about you,
Kuririn-<i>san</i>?

65
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,143
<i>Hurry up and summon it,</i>
<i>would you!?</i>

66
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,404
We sure worked hard for this, huh?

67
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:40,242
Yes. Now Piccolo-<i>san</i> and everyone else
can finally be brought back to life.

68
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,417
<i>Do it already! Summon it!</i>

69
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:52,090
Okay, here goes. We've come such
a long way for this moment.

70
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,094
Let's have ourselves a look at what
the original Shen Long looks like!

71
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,686
Right.

72
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:26,379
Come forth, Shen Long,
and grant me my wish!

73
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:46,074
Come forth, Shen Long,
and grant me my wish!

74
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,073
<i>The incantation is as simple as that?</i>

75
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:12,170
<i>W</i>- <i>what's wrong?</i>
<i>lsn't something supposed to happen?</i>

76
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,037
<i>What is this Shen Long?</i>

77
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:36,727
H- h- he's not coming out...

78
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,897
Shen Long isn't coming out. Why not?

79
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:43,734
Why isn't Shen Long blasting out of there?

80
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,737
Maybe the incantation is a little different.

81
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:48,739
--Shen Long, come forth!
--<i>Those dirty punks! What are they doing?</i>

82
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:51,742
--Please grant us our wish!
--<i>Those dirty punks! What are they doing?</i>

83
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,006
Maybe his name isn't Shen Long.

84
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,749
That's strange.

85
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:03,754
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, someone
is coming this way!

86
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:08,759
Hey, I can feel two <i>Ki</i>!
Is it those two Ginyu guys?

87
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,763
If so, does that mean
that Father was beaten?

88
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:16,100
<i>Things are turning</i>
<i>for the worse again!</i>

89
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,637
They're evil <i>Ki</i>!
There's no mistake,

90
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,105
it has to be those two
from before!

91
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,774
W- what happened to Goku, then?

92
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,110
We've got to suppress our own
<i>Ki</i> and take cover, Gohan!

93
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,702
Right!

94
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,077
The Dragon Balls have been dug up!

95
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:02,341
What's going on?

96
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,617
How did anyone know
where they were buried?

97
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,760
Goku!

98
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,463
It's me, it's me!
You sure surprised me!

99
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:24,101
I thought, " Ginyu! It must be
that Ginyu guy coming!"

100
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:27,538
I didn't know you had beat him,

101
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,774
and convinced his pal
to come over to our side.

102
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:32,977
Are you the one that found
the Dragon Balls here?

103
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:35,713
How did you know
where they were?

104
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,082
What are you talking about, Goku?

105
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:41,052
I used the Dragon Radar
to find them, of course.

106
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,722
Radar, did he say? Damn,
they've got something like that?

107
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,892
So, have you gotten
your wish granted then?

108
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,061
That's the funny thing.
It didn't work.

109
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,732
Shen Long won't appear.
I can't figure out why.

110
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:59,070
The password may be different
from what we use on Earth.

111
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,739
So, it didn't work, huh?

112
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:07,078
Goku, is something wrong with you?
Something about you...

113
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,080
It just doesn't seem right.

114
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,752
And how come you're wearing
that Scouter, or whatever it's called?

115
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,754
You really want to know?

116
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,520
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!
That isn't Father!

117
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,358
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, run!

118
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:39,043
So, there's another one of you, huh?
I didn't get any reading on my Scouter.

119
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:43,503
Apparently you can control your
battle power all the way down to zero.

120
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,051
What do you think
you're doing, Goku?!

121
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:52,045
It's not Father!
That isn't Father there!

122
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:58,996
I- if that isn't Goku,
then what's going on?

123
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:00,731
He looks just like him!

124
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:05,668
I don't know,
but I can just tell.

125
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:22,086
I've switched bodies. This one was
so much stronger, you see.

126
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,755
What!?

127
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:28,092
<i>H</i>- <i>he's switched bodies?</i>

128
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,356
That's right.

129
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:43,966
Red Magma of the
Ginyu Special Corps, Jheese!

130
00:14:50,548 --> 00:15:01,982
And I am... Commander of
the Ginyu Special Corps... Ginyu-<i>sama</i>!

131
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:12,069
D- damn... This unfamiliar body
makes it hard to read <i>Ki</i>, as well.

132
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,739
" Unfamiliar body?" That's right!

133
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:23,080
If I ain't used to this body,
he shouldn't be used to my body, either!

134
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,751
You've switched bodies?
That's impossible!

135
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,754
I think I'll test it out right now.

136
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:37,695
The incredible power of a
better-than-180,000 battle power!

137
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:42,032
D- don't do it, Goku!
You're being controlled somehow!

138
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:44,830
You've been hypnotized or something!

139
00:15:56,147 --> 00:16:00,384
<i>Whether he's actually switched bodies,</i>
<i>or has just been hypnotized,</i>

140
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:03,721
<i>Kakarrot's strength</i>
<i>would still be the same.</i>

141
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:07,157
<i>Things are getting</i>
<i>worse and worse!</i>

142
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,165
I'm going to keep increasing
my power even higher and higher!

143
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,065
I hope you're ready!

144
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:26,177
Commander Ginyu! That other
bastard followed us here.

145
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,667
What?

146
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,113
I've found you!

147
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,703
You've done well
to make it this far.

148
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:57,708
I should have made
the wound more severe.

149
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,712
K- Kuririn, Gohan, listen up!

150
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:06,547
That ain't me!
He's taken over my body!

151
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:13,057
You mean, it's true?

152
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,060
I- i- it can't be!

153
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,730
That's Father?

154
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,067
<i>Yahoo!</i>

155
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:26,737
<i>Yum, yum!</i>

156
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:30,741
I couldn't stand that!

157
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:35,679
That guy is Ginyu!
Don't hesitate to take him down!

158
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,849
There's no way he can defeat
you at your present levels!

159
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,019
Go on, start beating on him!

160
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,079
S- start beating on him, you say?

161
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,695
Fool! You think I cannot defeat them?
This was originally your body!

162
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,298
It's battle power is over 180,000.

163
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,858
There's no reason why that
would have changed!

164
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:04,008
You'll see, once you give it a try.
That's my body there.

165
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:08,712
How do you even expect to use
its <i>Ki</i> well, let alone <i>Kaio-ken</i>?

166
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:14,818
If body and mind ain't completely united,
you won't get any great power!

Your lies won't work on Ginyu-<i>sama</i>.

00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:21,959
I'll show you what my
battle power is right now!

00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,060
Jheese...

170
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,755
Yes, sir!

171
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,828
Jheese! How high is my battle power?

172
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:13,444
<i>Just how high a battle power does Ginyu have,</i>
<i>now that he has stolen Goku's body</i>?

<i>Moreover, will Goku be able</i>
<i>to get his own body back</i>?
