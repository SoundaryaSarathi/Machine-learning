1
00:00:02,283 --> 00:00:05,582
There were many sheep
in the grassland.

2
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:08,985
They had white hair,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,914
soft and warm.

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:16,689
This girl walked quietly
near the sheep,

5
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:19,027
because she didn’t want to
terrify the sheep.

6
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,428
But, when the sheep

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,668
found the little girl,

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,205
they ran away quickly.

9
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,911
Are you alright, Sakura?

10
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,237
I’m fine, I’m fine.

11
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:35,976
The girl’s voice made
the sheep more afraid.

12
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,476
And run faster.

13
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:41,046
They jumped over the fence.

14
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,547
Faster and faster.

15
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:47,656
The girl followed the little sheep

16
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:50,787
like she was dreaming.

17
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,926
She ran faster and faster.

18
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:59,638
One sheep, two sheep…

19
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,941
three sheep…

20
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,704
And finally

21
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:08,505
when the girl came
very near to the sheep,

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,815
she fell down…

23
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:18,554
Li-kun…

24
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:21,694
What’s the matter, Kinomoto-san, Li-kun?

25
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,388
Excuse me.

26
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:31,403
[Sakura’s Sheep Alert?!]

27
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:34,232
What? A gigantic teddy bear?

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,969
Yes, somehow, Clow’s aura
made the teddy bear grow huge.

29
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,210
It was really pretty scary.

30
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,516
Why did that happen?

31
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,853
Sorry, but it really
had nothing to do with me.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,284
Next time, be more alert!

33
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,363
Okay. I promise.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,589
Here you go!

35
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:04,228
These are newly introduced
by my mom’s company.

36
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:06,669
Please accept them.

37
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,437
Here’s one for Sakura

38
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:11,267
and one for Kero.

39
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:12,776
Thanks.

40
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:16,743
And here’s one for Li.

41
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,346
Thanks.

42
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:20,613
Ah!

43
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,450
I can use this to contact you later.

44
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,499
I feel sleppy…

45
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,536
I’ve been feeling sleepy a lot lately.

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,607
It can’t be helped.

47
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:43,407
The conversion of Clow cards
must have been tough on you.

48
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:45,270
And Kero, too.

49
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,916
Sakura Cards.

50
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:00,690
By the way!

51
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,062
After the conversion,
the magic of the Clow cards

52
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,091
will be completely yours, right?

53
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,826
Looks like that…

54
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,264
That’s

55
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,138
why those new Sakura card

56
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:14,966
deserve their
own characteristic pose!

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,472
Characteristic… Pose…?

58
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,877
Certainly! Certainly!

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,679
I really feel that you should

60
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,913
create one as soon as possible

61
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,479
For Sakura, so cute,

62
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,346
so beautiful, so elegant.

63
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:29,678
This should come ever so naturally!

64
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:31,583
Come!

65
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,790
Let’s practice!

66
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:53,073
All in all,

67
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:54,378
it’s been pretty tough
on you, hasn’t it, Sakura?

68
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:57,614
But

69
00:03:58,052 --> 00:03:59,766
it’s also been pretty rough
on him over there.

70
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,112
Somehow…

71
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:26,520
I can’t seem to
eat enough these days…

72
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,535
As of late…

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,055
I have been strangely tired… and…

74
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:37,526
Sleepy…

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,427
Yuki…

76
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,475
Huh? Touya!

77
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,015
So your soccer meeting’s ended?

78
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:30,515
Touya…

79
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:32,477
Yes.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,332
Ah!

81
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,582
Sorry!

82
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,667
What?

83
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,782
Yuki,

84
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,391
Well, you know,
you are well-liked and popular…

85
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,500
…even if you don’t know
you’re popular.

86
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,829
I…

87
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,296
If you don’t need me…

88
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:01,434
then you will become…

89
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:11,051
Why should I not need you?

90
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:12,546
You know what I mean, dumbass!

91
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,621
I… I…

92
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:21,788
I what?

93
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,394
I’m sleeping.

94
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,096
I heard your voice, Touya.

95
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,031
Ar, Touya,

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,771
the teacher was calling
for you earlier.

97
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:35,464
So hurry up, will you

98
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:36,253
Akizuki…

99
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:39,245
Nakuru!

100
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:42,373
You turned up here deliberately,
didn’t you?

101
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:44,109
And what’s wrong with that?

102
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:49,587
Later.

103
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,393
See you in class!

104
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,725
Just as I though, he knew
what I was thinking all along.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,524
He’s pretty sharp.

106
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,702
You may not realize it,
but you do sleep a lot.

107
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,242
So, don’t interfere, ok?

108
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,866
…and we practice

109
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,932
my new pose all the way…

110
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,372
And?

111
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:47,442
How’s the pose coming along?

112
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,014
Is that a good pose?

113
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,680
I’m not sure, but…

114
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,008
Tomoyo is really enthusiastic,
isn’t she?

115
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:54,977
But,

116
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:58,784
why do I have to convert the Clow Cards?

117
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,890
And what does this piece

118
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,189
of paper have to do with all of this

119
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,085
Let me see…!

120
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:32,154
This…

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,687
My opponent is a magic user,
too, right?

122
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,091
Well… Well…

123
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:42,393
What’s wrong, Sakura?

124
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,634
So what if it’s

125
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,164
another magic users

126
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:49,068
Watch me trash them all the same!

127
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,957
Cheer up, will you?!

128
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:53,729
Yeah, I should!

129
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:57,879
Coming!

130
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:09,520
Good evening, Sakura.

131
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:11,856
Yukito!

132
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,259
Please come in!

133
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:16,963
Actually, I just came
today to deliver this.

134
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,867
Here…
Touya forget to take it with him.

135
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:21,635
Can you pass it to him?

136
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,500
Sure.

137
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,979
I can see Yukito one more time.

138
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,231
Don’t behave like that, okay?

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,867
Y… yes.

140
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,017
If this goes on…

141
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,455
he can’t return to his original form.

142
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:15,291
That’s because Yue depends on
Sakura’s magical power.

143
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:22,162
Yukito faints frequently
and his vonacious appetite is useless.

144
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,398
All these new things…

145
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,671
These new cards

146
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:32,774
who give their all for her

147
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:47,758
My symbol is the Sun

148
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,154
and my powers are self-sufficient.

149
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,530
But…

150
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,835
Its light fills me with strength.

151
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:58,396
So I’m not dependent on anyone’s power.

152
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,035
At this rate,

153
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,039
I will fade away.

154
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:04,900
and Yukito

155
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,606
will vanish along with you.

156
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,741
Sakura will be really sad.

157
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,347
In the last incident,

158
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,392
it was Clow’s presence that we felt,
wasn’t it?

159
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,995
I’m not sure.

160
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,431
But, if I’m not mistaken,
I think I felt the same presence too.

161
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:34,363
But these incidents are getting
increasingly dangerous.

162
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:39,407
The enemy is quite skillful…

163
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:41,911
Yes

164
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,652
But, Yukito…

165
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,517
Kero! Would you like some snacks?

166
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:54,417
Hoee! Oh.

167
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,092
It’s you, Kero.

168
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,266
Somehow.

169
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,729
I’m not used to seeing you so big yet.

170
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,569
I’ll change back to Yukito.

171
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,184
Yue! It’ll be terrible

172
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:19,814
if I get seen in this form!

173
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:37,101
Did I blank out again just now?

174
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,707
It’s really tough hiding
the truth from Yukito.

175
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,050
You’ve just been lucky to be able

176
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,479
to deceive Yukito for so long

177
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,352
What do you mean by that?!

178
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:01,124
Ah! Li?

179
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:03,763
Huh? The park?

180
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,500
Got it… I’m going now.

181
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,677
I expected it would end up like this…

182
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:24,215
Of course!

183
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:27,252
Not only is this going
to be a great video,

184
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:30,681
but to film it on this
beautiful night out in the park…

185
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,481
It makes my heart melt

186
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,054
just to think of it.

187
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:39,093
It’s a special evening dress, isn’t it?

188
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:41,965
I never did understand

189
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:43,997
what’s up with the two of you

190
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:45,429
Anyway,

191
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:47,803
do you see where this strange
aura is coming from?

192
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,472
You feel it too, Li,

193
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,942
Clow’s aura.

194
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:53,704
I sense a powerful magical aura,

195
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,139
but I really don’t
know if it’s Clow’s.

196
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:58,784
I would really want to see
who our opponent is.

197
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,621
– Is that so.
– Do you understand me?

198
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,122
It’s strongest

199
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,855
in the vicinity of the penguin

200
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:21,933
What’s matter?

201
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,036
Somehow… The penguin…

202
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,677
It seems different from
the way it used to be.

203
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:31,375
What?

204
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,584
What the heck is this?

205
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,491
This is pretty huge!

206
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,058
Who could have done this?

207
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,039
I feel it… Inside this hole…

208
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,807
Clow’s aura…

209
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,071
Guess we should go have a look.

210
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:02,279
Right!

211
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,775
So! Let’s witness the debut
of your new Signature Pose!

212
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,350
– Tomoyo!
– Let’s go! Sakura.

213
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:11,355
Let’s see the release thing
we did earlier.!

214
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,265
O Key which hides the power of the stars,

215
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,199
reveal thy true form before me.

216
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:26,664
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

217
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:30,176
Release!

218
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,452
Fly!!

219
00:15:58,238 --> 00:15:59,535
Great! I’m coming, too!

220
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,274
What’s this?

221
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:11,948
King of Thunder.
Obey my order!!

222
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:18,650
Look here. You brat!

223
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:20,549
What were you trying to pull off?

224
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:25,001
In that case,

225
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,134
Get BACK!

226
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,246
Such power… Don’t tell me it’s Clow’s.

227
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,638
Just as I thought…

228
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,090
Clow’s aura…

229
00:16:58,098 --> 00:16:58,894
Hey, Kero…!

230
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,596
Kero?

231
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,839
Hoe!! I’m so scared to be alone!!!!

232
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:18,449
A stuffed animal?

233
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:23,583
Isn’t.

234
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,755
this Mr.Sheep from my textbook?

235
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,355
Hoe! What’s Mr.Sheep

236
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,197
doing here, anyway?

237
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:47,111
It’s Sakura’s voice!

238
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,050
What’s happening? Sakura!

239
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,261
Damn!

240
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,968
Ah. That kid is really going at it…

241
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,566
Clow Reed’s spells.

242
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,205
Their forms are practically endless.

243
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,409
Flattery… That kid tries hard,

244
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,347
that’s his good point.

245
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,524
This hurts.

246
00:18:37,497 --> 00:18:38,964
What should I do now?

247
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,224
Which card should I convert now?

248
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,931
If I use watery,

249
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:46,795
I’d be in worse trouble.

250
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,667
Firey will do me in as well.

251
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,178
How now?

252
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,578
Oh! That’s right!

253
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,554
O Card created by Clow,

254
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,891
Discard thine old form and be reborn.

255
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,761
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

256
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,302
Erase!

257
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:40,454
Well done.

258
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:55,669
The power’s aura… vanished.

259
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,050
– Sakura.
– Sakura-chan!

260
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:08,949
Are you alright?

261
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,482
Thank goodness.

262
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,895
Thanks.
I feel bad for making you worry.

263
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,990
What happened there?

264
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,960
Somehow, many sheep appeared.

265
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,806
Sheep?

266
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:28,938
Yes. They were stuffed dolls.

267
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:30,803
Dolls again… huh?

268
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,908
And how was it inside?

269
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,708
Indeed,
I sensed Clow’s presence in there.

270
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,850
But…
What do we do with this now?

271
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,851
Whatever we do,

272
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:46,292
we have to return
the penguin to its original position.

273
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,021
To move the penguin…

274
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:52,124
It’s Power card, isn’t it?

275
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:59,129
Let’s see you do your

276
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,804
Signature Pose Variation No.2!

277
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:05,742
Li-kun! Kero -chan!

278
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:06,838
Turn to look over there.

279
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,040
Why?

280
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,015
Just do it!

281
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:17,986
Don’t you ever… EVER…
look here, okay?

282
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:24,989
It’s so wonderful!!

283
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,504
I feel sleepy.

284
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,510
Sakura-chan!

285
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,179
Sakura.
Hang in there!

286
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,587
It’s been fun, hasn’t it,

287
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,054
Eriol?

288
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:51,388
Yes. Indeed.

289
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:57,930
It will get even
more enjoyable from now on.
