Great. That must be Maiden's Peak,

We'll be landing soon.

Ah, it wouldn't matter to me
if I never saw land again.

24
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,618
I just wasted another summer.

25
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,287
But we had a whole summer
of adventures.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,789
For kids, summer means
playing on the beach,

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,335
splashing around and having fun,
but for me...

28
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,381
summer means bathing suits
and girls to wear them.

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,553

to wait another year to meet a girl.

I'll ride the Ferris wheel all alone.

It's a festival.

Heh, people spend a lot of money
at these festivals,

drop their change all over the place.

-Money is sweeter.

Ah, you're not that beautiful.

00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,624
Who's not beautiful?

[groans]

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,545
Beware.
Not of an old beauty like me

66
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,840
but of a beautiful young woman
or you'll meet a cruel fate.

67
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,843
Ah! That girl on the rock.
I have to meet her.

68
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,596
Ah, I must be the beautiful girl
she's talking about

69
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,805
but I'd never hurt Brock.

70
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,308
I was talking about
an elegant young woman,

71
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,144
not some scrawny
little blabbermouth like you.

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,437
Scrawny?

73
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,564
Real scrawny. Ow!

74
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,109
That's it. I don't have to stand
around here and be insulted.

-Let's get out of here!
-[both groan]

76
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,198
The beautiful woman. A cruel fate.

77
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,950
The cruelest fate
would be never to see her again.

78
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,869
[Team Rocket] Hm. Huh.

79
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,959
Nothing! There's no money anywhere
at this festival!

80
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,713
Not a quarter, nickel or dime.
Not even a penny.

81
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,840
What kind of cheap festival is this?

82
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,176
We got to keep looking
till we find something.

83
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,305
-Ah! A penny!
-[woman] Hold it right there.

84
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,057
Hmm? I dropped this.

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,684
I've been watching you.
You're up to no good.

86
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,354
And there's no good in your future.

87
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,106
Who? The police?
The sheriff' the FBI?

88
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,110
I see a young and beautiful woman
who will lead you to a cruel fate.

89
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,196
I don't need a fortune teller
to know that.

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,325
Some woman is always causing me trouble.
It's a curse. Ah.

91
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,285
Who do you mean?

92
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,287
-[Jenny] Good afternoon.
-Huh?

93
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm with the local police department
and I know exactly what you're all doing.

94
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,752
[all scream]

95
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,380
I see you found some change
that someone dropped.

96
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,092
Whenever money's lost, even a penny,
it must be reported to the authorities.

97
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,844
Thanks for being such
and observant citizen.

98
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,014
Now, if you'll just follow me,
we'll file a report at the station.

99
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,183
-The station?
-We don't want to get in your way,

100
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,144
so why don't you go ahead and file it
without us and keep the change?

101
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,396
Bye-bye!

102
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,234
[old man] Welcome.
To celebrate the summer's end festival,

103
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,738
we will now display the shrine
of the Maiden's greatest treasure.

104
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:09,077
For 2,000 years, this painting has hung
within the shrine of the Maiden.

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,663
Once each year,
it is removed from the shrine

106
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,125
and displayed to the public
during this festival.

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,837
As I unveil the painting,
please gaze upon it with reverence.

108
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,259
[all gasp]

109
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,970
-Who's that's?
-She's cute.

110
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,889
Ah, it's her.

111
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,310
But it can't be.

112
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,152
[both sigh]

113
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,195
[sigh]

114
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,699
She's so incredibly beautiful.

115
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,494
She's the girl of my dreams.
Don't wake me up.

116
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,626
Stay back! The woman in this painting
perished over 2,000 years ago.

117
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,586
2,000 years.

118
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,714
She was in love with a brave
and handsome young man

119
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,676
but he left her and sailed away
to fight in a war.

120
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,640
<i>I'll wait for you forever.</i>
<i>Come back to me. Farewell.</i>

121
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,309
[old man]
And she did wait for a very long time,

122
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,103
hoping to see his ship on the horizon.

123
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,065
But her true love never returned
to that place again.

124
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,652
Still, she waited and waited,
never moving from that spot,

125
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,738
until finally her body
was turned into stone,

126
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,366
just like the cliff
upon which she stood.

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,036
To this day,
she waits for her love to return.

128
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,080
Just tell me. Where's this rock?

129
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,374
Maiden's rock is not far
from this shrine.

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,712
So that's Maiden rock.

131
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,548
It's the most beautiful rock
I've ever seen.

132
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,803
I don't care if she is made of stone.
I'm still in love with her.

133
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,554
If she were my girlfriend,

134
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,432
I'd make sure
she was never out of my sight.

135
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,560
No one would ever steal her from me,
not even Team Rocket.

136
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,646
I'll fight them to keep her safe.

137
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,191
James, you're insane.
Why would we steal a thing like that?

138
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,777
-We could steal that other thing.
-What thing?

139
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,738
Pokémon are valuable
but so are works of art.

140
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,824
Let's swipe that painting.

141
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,827
If we grab that painting,
we could make a bundle.

142
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,704
Oh, Jessie! Jessie!

143
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,791
Before you grab it, grab hold of me.
Whoa!

144
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,295
Team Rocket is really slipping.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,550
No matter how long you wait here,
a rock is a rock, Brock.

146
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,261
Yeah, let's go back to the festival.
This is boring.

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,931
Why don't you two go back.
I want to stay a little bit longer.

148
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,225
You remember
where we're staying tonight, right?

149
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,521
The Pokémon Center near the port.
I'll make it back by curfew.

150
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,024
[sighs]

151
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,985
Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.

152
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,792
11 o'clock. Curfew time.
Curfew time. Curfew time.

153
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,379
I'm really getting worried.
Brock still isn't back yet.

154
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,840
Hmm. Huh?

155
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,467
[rattling]

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,219
-Wait. I'll go out and look for him.
-[Joy] Hold it.

157
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,680
-Oh!
-Don't you realize it's your bedtime?

158
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,266
-Yes, but--
-Staying up late is bad for your skin

159
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,852
and it makes you irritable
and it ruins your appetite.

160
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,439
I won't allow it.
Now get to bed this instant.

161
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,157
[alarm beeping]

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,786
What time is it? Wake up.
Time to steal the painting.

163
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,288
-Wake up, you two.
-Beauty sleep.

164
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,124
Hmm, beautiful, I must meet you.
I'm coming to you.

165
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,542
[wind whistling]

166
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,668
Ah!

167
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,134
What's that?

168
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,346
[screams]

169
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,100
[sighs]

170
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,146
Must be dreaming.
Back to sleep. Meowth.

171
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,402
-My love, I'm waiting for you.
-Ah, who said that? Who are you?

172
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,699
It's you. So it really was you.

173
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,664
2,000 years. Huh?

174
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,835
I've been waiting for you
for such a long time.

175
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,295
It's you. It's really you.

176
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,388
-Brock!
-Brock, where are you

177
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,889
Pikachu.

178
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,724
James? James?

179
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,602
If you're not here,
at least come out and tell us.

180
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,938
-That's right!
-Hey, Brock!

181
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,189
[all] Hm? Huh?

182
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,775
-Oh!
-You again.

183
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,402
-Yuck.
-Double yuck.

184
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,112
I've finally found you.

185
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,323
Oh, wait a minute,
you're not the one I was looking for.

186
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,242
Hey, are you looking for somebody, too?

187
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,746
Ahem. Prepare for trouble
and make it double.

188
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,708
Doing this by myself is a real drag.

189
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:12,255
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,716
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

191
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,552
[James]
To extend our reach to the stars above.

192
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,971
-Jessie?
-[James] James.

193
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,475
Ah, Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

194
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,939
-Surrender now or prepare to fight. Ooh!
-Ah!

195
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,859
-He looks awful.
-Worse than usual.

196
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,943
[Brock groans]

197
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,486
Brock, what happened?

198
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,406
[both groan]

199
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,326
-Pull yourself together.
-What do you think you're doing?

200
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,162
So everything turned out
just as I predicted.

201
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,623
-[all] Huh?
-[Ash] It's the old woman.

202
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,460
Obviously, these two have both
seen the Ghost of the Maiden.

203
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,045
[all] Ghost of the Maiden?

204
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,465
-I love her. I love her. I love her.
-Me too. Me too. Me too.

205
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,926
[all sigh]

206
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:02,764
-They're possessed. Pikachu.
-Pikachu!

207
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,224
[Brock and Jessie groan]

208
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,688
-Uh, who am I? I am Brock.
-Brock's back.

209
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,984
I'm James from Team Rocket. Eeh!

210
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,987
-He's back.
-But not to normal.

211
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,199
All men who pass this way
fall under her spell.

212
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,702
It's always the same story,
over and over.

213
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,665
We find them here acting like zombies
with the life sucked out of them,

214
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,418
babbling like idiots.
It's the work of that Maiden's ghost,

215
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,296
still waiting
for her young soldier to return.

216
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,631
It's just as I warned you.

217
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,093
So what? who cares as long
as I can be with her?

218
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,304
Ah, he isn't cured.

219
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,349
I'm scared.
You've got to do something!

220
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,268
-There is only one thing we can do.
-[all] What?

221
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,270
We have stickers.

222
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,483
These are anti-ghost stickers.

223
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,944
-Ah, however...
-What's the catch?

224
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,073
I can't just give these stickers
away for free.

225
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,118
Uh, ah! Oh, well.

226
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,080
If it's the only thing that'll help.
We'll stick stickers all over the place.

227
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,041
-This'll really work, right?
-Chu.

228
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,003
-Shut your mouth.
-[groans]

229
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,513
-Will she come?
-Oh, she'll come.

230
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,640
-This better work.
-Let's hope.

231
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,396
She's here!

232
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,940
[all screaming]

233
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,488
-It's you.
-I've been waiting for you.

234
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:47,326
-Yes, and I've been waiting too.
-I'm scared. Really, really scared.

235
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,747
-I wanted to meet you.
-And I, you.

236
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,959
-Brock!
-But why?

237
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,254
-Why aren't the stickers working?
-Maybe because...

238
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,256
-We got them...
-[both] For free.

239
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,217
-Free? What do you mean, free?
-A two for one deal.

240
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,179
We got one set free
for every set they bought.

241
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,972
It was a real bargain.

242
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,641
-You used freebies?
-Oops.

243
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,643
I can't believe you're letting
that ghost get me,

244
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,979
just because you're both so cheap.

245
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,399
-You don't want to go?
-Of course I don't want to go.

246
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:23,571
I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

247
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,032
-Grab him!
-Wait, Brock!

248
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,992
Hey, let me go!

249
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,578
I don't want to go!

250
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,497
[screams]

251
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,040
Whoa!

252
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,209
Hey, girl. You can't take him.

253
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,544
-You haven't got a ghost of a chance.
-[splashing]

254
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,005
[all gasp]
[groans]

255
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,341
-Ah!
-You really do care.

256
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,511
It's not because of you.
Girls like her disgust me.

257
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,680
Always waiting around for her man,
as if she were his faithful pet.

258
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,183
She can't stand the thought of losing him.

259
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,144
She cries.
But I'd say, see you later.

260
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,107
-There are plenty more fish in the sea.
-I could sure go for some fish.

261
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,652
I've been waiting.
You cannot not interfere.

262
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,574
[cackling]

263
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,742
[both scream]

264
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,745
-What is that?
-Not any Pokémon I know.

265
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,165
-[Pokédex]<i> No Pokémon entry found.</i>
-They're not Pokémon?

266
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,546
[all groaning]

267
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,256
[Pokédex] <i>Still searching.</i>

268
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,508
[both] Oh!

269
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,595
[Pokédex] <i>Pokémon entry found.</i>
<i>Gastly. A ghost Pokémon.</i>

270
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>It is usually invisible.</i>
<i>It's specialty is hypnosis.</i>

271
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,060
Gastly? You're really a Pokémon?

272
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,396
So you finally figured it out.

273
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,858
Sometimes I'm the ghost
of the 2,000-year-old maiden...

274
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,444
And sometimes,
I'm the mysterious old woman.

275
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,530
But no matter what the disguise,
I'll always be...

276
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,326
Awfully Gastly.

277
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,039
Well, Gastly, time for a battle.
Pikachu?

278
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,668
My hypnotic powers
can work on other Pokémon too

279
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
including little rodents.

280
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,716
-Pika.
-Stop a rodent...

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,050
...with a mousetrap.

282
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,969
[screams]

283
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,679
Mousetraps won't hurt Meowth.

284
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,765
So, Meowth,
you want to play games with me?

285
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:15,725
[roars]

286
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,269
[Gastly] Here's a cat toy
I think you'll enjoy.

287
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,230
Meowth. Meowth. Meowth.

288
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,774
-Go, Ekans!
-Ekans.

289
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,444
A snake's natural enemy is a mongoose.

290
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,154
Dinner time.

291
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,947
[screams]

292
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:34,994
-Your turn.
-Um, uh, Koffing, Poison Gas Attack.

293
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,955
Koffing! Huh?

294
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,208
[Gastly] Smoking is prohibited.

295
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,462
My turn now.
Charmander, I choose you.

296
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,590
Char! Char!

297
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,219
Well, now.
Here's something for you, squirt.

298
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,012
Cha!

299
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,724
Now who shall I defeat?

300
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,226
[groans]

301
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,854
Squirtle, Bulbasaur, attack together.

302
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,775
-Bulba!
-Squirtle.

303
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,237
Ha! What a nuisance.
This is too easy.

304
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,491
Here are Bulbasaur's and Squirtle's
evolved forms,

305
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,993
Venusaur and Blastoise.

306
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,667
And just for fun, I'll combine them
into one super-Pokémon

307
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,796
to make Venustoise.
Try that on for size.

308
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,381
[both scream]

309
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,841
We lose. It's just too strong.

310
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,385
Then how about this?

311
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,720
-What's that?
-It's a cross.

312
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,683
I've also got garlic, a stake
and a hammer.

313
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,978
Uh, what do I look like,
a vampire or something?

314
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,646
[bell tolling]
Huh?

315
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,360
-[all gasp]
-What's happening?

316
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,405
I may not be a vampire
but I hate sunlight.

317
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,032
It's time for me to go
until the next festival.

318
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,784
Don't forget the Ghost of the Maiden.

319
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,329
She and the old lady
will return next year too.

320
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,123
That was ghastly.

321
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,292
-I'll say.
-Pikachu.

322
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,961
Hey, look! The sun.

323
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,726
At the end of every summer,
the visitors send out these tiny boats,

324
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,437
each one with a candle
to help light the way

325
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,232
for any wandering spirits
who can't find their way back home.

326
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:37,867
[Gastly]<i> This summer is over</i>
<i>but your legend will continue to live on.</i>

327
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,997
-Thank you, Gastly.
-My pleasure.

328
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,668
I enjoy keeping alive all the old legends
that people have forgotten over the years,

329
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,339
and if I do a good job of it,
I make a few bucks as well.

330
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,550
I'll see you again next festival.

331
00:18:54,634 --> 00:19:00,264
I'll be waiting until that day
when my true love returns to me at last.

332
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,516
Well, I am a ghost Pokémon.

333
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,144
Perhaps one day I'll meet
the young man you love,
