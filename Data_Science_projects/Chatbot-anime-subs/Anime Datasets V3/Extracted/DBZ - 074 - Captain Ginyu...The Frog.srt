00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,609
I- it can't be!

2
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,480
<i>Change!!</i>

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,462
This is it! I can get
my own body back!

4
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,929
Let me get there in time!

5
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,141
What?

6
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:51,608
O- out of the way!

7
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,867
You bastard...
How dare you... interfere!?

8
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:31,783
Ow-ow-ow-ow...

9
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:35,453
Looks like I'm back to normal.

10
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:40,792
W- what happened? What the hell
did Kakarrot do just now?

11
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,794
What was that light?

12
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:47,288
Did Goku jump between them
in order to stop Vegeta's attack?

13
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,745
I can sense Father!

14
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,416
Father is... Father is back
in his own body!

15
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,417
What?

16
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,282
Are you sure, Gohan?

17
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,190
S- so then, that Ginyu bastard
is now over there?

18
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,125
Damn!

19
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,103
I'll Change with you for
sure this time, Vegeta!

20
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,438
I ain't going to let you!

21
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,530
What!?

22
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,784
<i>Ka</i>...

23
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,809
<i>me...</i>

24
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,390
That rotten Kakarrot...

25
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>ha</i>...

26
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,119
<i>me...</i>

27
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,402
<i>Ha</i>!!

28
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:16,786
Damn, I've taken terrible damage...
I can't control my <i>Ki</i>...

29
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,426
Father!

30
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,018
G- Goku!

31
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,437
That was pretty stupid of you.

32
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:35,031
You won't get in
my way any longer.

33
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:48,880
T- this is bad! If we allow him to take
over Vegeta's body now... it's all over...

34
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,792
I'll take that body of yours!

35
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:09,741
<i>Chan</i>-

36
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,333
What!?

37
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,703
Impressive, Vegeta.

38
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:25,348
He's getting himself busted up,
just like he did against me.

39
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,345
He's planning on trading
places with Vegeta!

40
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:37,428
What's the matter?
Finished already?

41
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,726
That's right! You...

42
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,359
...are finished!

43
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,868
Stop, Vegeta!

44
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,406
You fell for it, Vegeta!

45
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,387
T- this is it.

46
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:05,117
<i>Change!!</i>

47
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,036
N- now what happened?

48
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,350
<i>Ribbit</i>... <i>ribbit</i>...

49
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,715
<i>Ribbit</i>... <i>ribbit ribbit ribbit</i>...

50
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,561
I- I did it!

51
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,403
G- Goku! Are you okay?

52
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,735
Father! Hang on!

53
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:38,750
Y- you really did quite a number...
on my body, didn't you, Vegeta?

54
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,756
Never mind that, explain to me
what happened to Ginyu.

55
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,091
That guy that ran away is a frog.

56
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,763
And that frog-looking thing
over there is now Ginyu.

57
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,593
What?

58
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,767
<i>Ribbit</i>... <i>ribbit</i>...

59
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:04,436
I don't know how you did it, but
I'm still going to mash you underfoot.

60
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,451
Leave him alone, Vegeta.

61
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:19,390
Now that Ginyu is like that,
he can't do anything.

62
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,325
Oh, all right, you can go.

63
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,421
I pity you when I think
of the life ahead of you.

64
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,737
Goku!

65
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,568
Father!

66
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:56,761
Hey, Goku, don't you have
a single <i>Senzu</i> left?

67
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,595
N- nope, I've really had it.

68
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,440
There's no reason why I couldn't vaporize
you bothersome guys right now.

69
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,442
What?

70
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:15,538
Vegeta, you dirty, lowdown...

71
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:26,791
I- it's all right.
He can't kill us just yet.

72
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,561
You're right. There's still
the matter of the Dragon Balls,

73
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,897
as well as the fight against Freeza,

74
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:36,467
and I'm going to need everyone's power,
especially yours, Kakarrot.

75
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,468
Come on.

76
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,231
W- where to?

77
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:44,407
Inside the spaceship.
Bring Kakarrot with you.

78
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,752
W- what are you going to do to Goku!?

79
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,421
I'm offering to heal him.

80
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,389
Why should we believe you!?

81
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,357
Fine, suit yourselves.
You can croak right alongside Kakarrot.

82
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,437
Damn it...

83
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,772
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

84
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,774
K- Kuririn, it's all right.

85
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,442
It's all right?

86
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:23,781
Vegeta's enemy right now
is Freeza, not us.

87
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,772
B- but...

88
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,654
Let's go, Kuririn-<i>san</i>.

89
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:50,566
Hurry it up. We don't know when
Freeza will be coming back.

90
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,448
In here.

91
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:31,881
You go first.

92
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,550
This will treat Kakarrot's injuries
and restore him to full power.

93
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:44,826
W- with all this?

94
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:00,233
A needle!

95
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,748
N- no way!

96
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:07,418
I hate needles!
Let go of me, Kuririn!

97
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:10,421
I don't need any medical attention!

98
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:15,688
You think I would treat you with something
as uncivilized as a needle, you idiot!?

99
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:19,525
R- really?

100
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:23,359
<i>Oh, Father, how pathetic!</i>

101
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,447
Vegeta, what is this, anyhow?

102
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:42,453
It's called a Medical Machine.
In short, it's like a healing capsule.

103
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,555
By immersing oneself
in this special solution,

104
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,392
one's energy is restored to them
in a short amount of time.

105
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,394
So that's how...

106
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:55,733
<i>After l've defeated Freeza,</i>
<i>l'll kill you guys nice and slow.</i>

107
00:12:55,733 --> 00:13:02,969
<i>By that time, make no mistake,</i>
<i>l will be a Super Saiyan!</i>

108
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,435
How about you speak to me, already?

109
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,071
Just telling me one simple
thing is enough.

110
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:37,041
How do I get the Dragon Balls
to grant my wish?

111
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,703
All you have to do is tell me that.

112
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,542
Y- you expect me... to tell you?

113
00:13:56,727 --> 00:14:00,060
You do not need
to say anything else.

114
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:05,725
Well? Do you still want
me to continue this?

115
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,400
Up yours!

116
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:31,362
<i>My apologies, Nail.</i>
<i>Bear it just a little while longer.</i>

117
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:36,767
<i>Very soon, Dende will arrive</i>
<i>at the Earthlings' location.</i>

118
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:43,366
<i>Please, allow my life to last</i>
<i>for at least that much longer.</i>

119
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>J</i>- <i>just a little farther. Grand Elder-sama</i>
<i>said they were in the Maima region.</i>

120
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:05,062
The Medical Machine in this room
is the older model,

121
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:08,732
but knowing Kakarrot, he should
be fully rejuvenated before too long.

122
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,734
The older model?

123
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:15,072
I destroyed the newer model.

124
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:18,599
H- he's not going to drown
or anything in there, right?

125
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:24,271
<i>T</i>- <i>this sure feels good.</i>

126
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,752
Now then, let's get you two
some battle wear.

127
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:33,424
You'll do better by them,
as far as protection goes.

128
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:36,760
Battle wear?
You mean like yours?

129
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,627
That's not how I want
to picture us.

130
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:50,708
Boy, their civilization
sure is ahead of Earth's.

131
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,869
It sure seems like it.

132
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,382
Take off your clothes
and put on that undershirt.

133
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:02,720
Hurry it up.
Freeza is coming.

134
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,725
Say, Gohan, if Vegeta feels
he needs even our help,

135
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:10,319
it must mean that Freeza
is awfully strong, huh?

136
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,398
It scares me.

137
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,400
Now for your battle jackets.

138
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,002
Luckily enough, there are some
smaller sizes here,

139
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,197
for use by those from
Planet Litt.

140
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:27,411
How do we put these on?

141
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,414
I can get my head through,
but my arms won't fit.

142
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:31,682
Just force them on.

143
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:35,419
Those are soft enough that if you pull
on them, they'll stretch.

144
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:38,255
Back on Earth, even when
I turned into a Great Ape,

145
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:41,425
my armor didn't break, remember?

146
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,552
Yet they can still stand
up to a shock pretty well.

147
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,860
Wow, you're right!

148
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,374
Are the gloves and boots
made of the same material?

149
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,035
I suppose.

150
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,042
This is incredibly light!

151
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:07,718
I barely feel any weight at all!

152
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:12,723
It's awful slimy of you guys
to be wearing stuff this nice.

153
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,554
What do you say, Vegeta?

154
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:20,560
Is something the matter?

155
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,401
I- it's nothing.

156
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:27,204
I wish I had armor more
like Vegeta's style.

157
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:30,407
The shoulder area seems a lot
easier to move around in.

158
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:36,413
This is an older type. There weren't
any that fit me in the regular sizes.

159
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:43,979
However, these don't seem to be in the way
at all, Kuririn-<i>san</i>. I can move freely!

160
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,695
Are you sure you're all right?

161
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,697
You don't need to
concern yourself about me.

162
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,101
Well, if you say so.

163
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:01,372
So, what about Goku? How long
will it take him to heal?

164
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,406
Good question.

165
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:06,536
Knowing him, he should be fully
healed in around 40 or 50 minutes.

166
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:13,717
Gohan, I'm going to go see
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>.

167
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,054
I know that Freeza is probably there too,

168
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,391
but if we can't get the password
to summon Shen Long,

169
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,726
there's nothing we can do anyhow.

170
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,062
I- I'll go too!

171
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,726
No. I can handle this myself.
You wait here.

172
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,010
<i>Goku and the others regroup,</i>

173
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,413
