1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,587
Frill-necked lizards, Mexican
salamanders, and human-faced
fish are all mad.

2
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:10,755
Mad, saying they're not toys.

3
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:17,860
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:01:01,342
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

6
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

8
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:22,568
Guided by the light of the moon

9
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

10
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:49,151
I believe in it, miracle romance

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,483
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the eighth grade.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,348
I'm a Cancer. My blood type is O and
my birthstone is the pearl.

15
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:05,153
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

16
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,331
One day, a strange black cat
named Luna appeared

17
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,458
and made me into a sailor warrior.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,965
But she wants me to fight bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.

19
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:20,672
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

20
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:31,177
A Monster's Scent!
Chanela Steals Love

21
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,477
I'm scared!

22
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:11,150
Tuxedo Mask.

23
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,193
Tuxedo Mask.

24
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:28,109
Usagi, I will always be near you.

25
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,082
Tuxedo Mask.

26
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,325
What's with all the racket
so early in the morning?

27
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,229
Why is there a cat here?

28
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:50,889
Cat

29
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:53,569
Get away!

30
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:53,870
Hey!
Get away!

31
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,928
Hey!

32
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,740
Take that cat out of my room now!

33
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,537
Oh yeah, Shingo...
You hate cats, don't you?

34
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,416
Here!

35
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,713
Stop it!

36
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,951
Here here.

37
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:14,557
Will you ever talk back to your smart
and beautiful sister again?

38
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:15,658
Breakfast!

39
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:16,989
Yes!

40
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:19,286
Saved.

41
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:23,327
What were you guys yelling about
so early in the morning?

42
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:30,835
That cat is Usagi's friend, right?

43
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:33,042
Yep, her name is Luna.

44
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,602
The shameless part is just like sis.

45
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:40,478
The fact that she's sleeping with you
sure makes it seem like she likes you.

46
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:44,818
Stop joking. She came in
without my permission.

47
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:50,089
I know, since we've all met.
Why don't we keep Luna?

48
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,228
No way.

49
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,093
Yes way. Yes way. Yes way.

50
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,429
No way! No way! No way!

51
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:58,893
Yes way! Yes way! Yes way!

52
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:03,028
Definitely no way.

53
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,431
It's just a cat. It should be okay.

54
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:08,642
Well, you two figure it out
on your own, okay?

55
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,144
Oh, great.

56
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,508
Why did you go to Shingo's
room anyway?

57
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:20,790
Well, actually I've been busy with
work and... accidentally...

58
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,226
Work? Were you chasing
a mouse or something?

59
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:26,855
No, I was looking for
the Moon Princess.

60
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:29,260
Moon pudding?

61
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:31,465
Hey!

62
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:35,004
Well anyway, try to get on
Shingo's good side.

63
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,807
Bye! I'm off!

64
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,206
Good luck!

65
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,669
Pet Shop Rope

66
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,483
How cute!

67
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:50,475
Oh, she licked my finger! How cute!

68
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,985
That's what I need to do.

69
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:13,107
Jadeite, do you have a new plan
to steal energy?

70
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,577
Yes, Queen Beryl.

71
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,540
The monster Iguana has set it up.

72
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:22,545
Humans have many desires.

73
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:25,988
Just a bit of catalyst can
turn that desire

74
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,257
into a very strong life energy.

75
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:31,158
In other words, the energy flows freely.

76
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,796
And we just take that from them?

77
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:38,865
It is all for our great ruler.

78
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,202
Proceed carefully.

79
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:42,731
Yes!

80
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,306
Hmm. Shingo doesn't like cats?

81
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,346
Yeah, when he was a baby,
a cat bit the tip of his nose.

82
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:00,052
The fear from that still
hasn't disappeared.

83
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:05,291
At least it was just a cat.
I was bitten by an alligator.

84
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,927
Why an alligator?

85
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:14,136
Oh, my mom probably left the latch
open and set it next to me.

86
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:15,603
Alligator! Alligator!

87
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,097
A latch?

88
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:23,368
Umino, you don't mean a handbag
made of alligator skin, do you?

89
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,341
They call it that too.

90
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,783
Umino!

91
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:28,784
Bye!

92
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:30,649
See you tomorrow.

93
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:43,493
Guess that didn't work.

94
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,397
Shingo...

95
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:50,504
The cat. What about the cat?!

96
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:53,300
Shingo, you don't like cats?

97
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:55,805
Mika.

98
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,911
A different kind of pet would be okay.

99
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,811
There's one that is perfect for you.

100
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,854
Huh?

101
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:08,847
There is a pretty neat store that
just opened up. Let's go.

102
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:10,455
Oh, okay.

103
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,388
Pet Shop Perfume

104
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,208
Doesn't it smell nice?

105
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,733
It's some perfume.

106
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:32,879
This scent is coming from
the pets here.

107
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:34,814
What?

108
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,585
Do you like the chanela?

109
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,853
Chanela?

110
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:46,425
Yes, these chanela emit a
perfume-like scent.

111
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,888
And each animal has a different scent.

112
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,034
Wow!

113
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:02,611
I'll buy this chanela.

114
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,512
I like this one.
But it's expensive, right?

115
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:15,124
Just bring the money when you can.

116
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:15,791
Really?

117
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,459
That helps.
Really?

118
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,289
That helps.

119
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:27,303
What a nice smell.

120
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,770
I know.

121
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:34,941
As long as I have my chanela,
I don't need anything else.

122
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,818
Oh, it didn't work, huh?

123
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,617
I don't have to be a
house cat, you know.

124
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:56,121
No. It's not like you to
give up that easily.

125
00:09:56,532 --> 00:10:00,202
Anyways, you're always lecturing me.

126
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,966
You need to set a good example!

127
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,704
Okay.

128
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:08,004
Shingo...

129
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,241
That's it!

130
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:21,223
This chanela is my pet starting today.

131
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,948
So hurry up and get rid of that cat.

132
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,663
You're being mean to Luna.

133
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,707
Usagi, I'm okay.

134
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:40,766
I'm sorry he did that.

135
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,472
Usagi! Tea is ready!

136
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,748
Coming!

137
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:47,010
Oh well.

138
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:52,521
That pet really does smell good.

139
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:56,924
Doesn't it? And this chanela
doesn't eat anything.

140
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,624
Well that's good, money wise.

141
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:04,464
Well, I agree it's cute. But...

142
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,538
Well then, we'll keep
Luna and Chanela.

143
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,272
I agree.

144
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,636
No way!

145
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,706
You are so cute.

146
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:29,925
Shingo! You're going to be late
if you don't hurry!

147
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,628
Shingo! C'mon, Shingo.

148
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:34,363
I'm staying home today.

149
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,557
What?

150
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,795
We'll always be together.

151
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,886
Juban Municipal Junior High School

152
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:11,530
What do you think of my chanela?

153
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,560
My chanela smells better.

154
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:17,641
Let's see. Not quite.

155
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:21,077
Those chanelas are pretty
popular right now.

156
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,871
Yeah, they're a huge hit.

157
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:27,473
But can they bring them to school?

158
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:31,410
Oh, it's Ms. Haruna!
Everyone hide your chanelas!

159
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:38,489
Let's start class.

160
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:41,253
Please open your book to page 234.

161
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,841
Oh, I want to look at my chanela.

162
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,433
I can't wait anymore.

163
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,145
So cute.

164
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,383
What are you people doing?

165
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:01,418
I'll have to confiscate it.

166
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:02,118
No, don't.
I'll have to confiscate it.

167
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,142
No, don't.

168
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,322
Ms. Haruna, are you okay?

169
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,721
I'm going home.

170
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,993
Me too.

171
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,551
Me too.

172
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,501
Naru, don't you think
something is wrong?

173
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,070
I know.

174
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,873
I think the chanelas are cute,
but they're a bit weird.

175
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:26,103
Speaking of which, even Shingo...

176
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,415
I wonder if it has something
to do with it?

177
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:35,485
Hey Naru, do you know where
they sell chanelas?

178
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:38,386
Pet Shop Perfume, I think.

179
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,757
Do you want to go?

180
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,588
Sorry, I've got cram school today.

181
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:45,918
Oh well, I'll go by myself.

182
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,095
Will you be okay alone?

183
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:52,663
It's hard having a dumb brother.

184
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,162
You're such a good sister!

185
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,971
Pet Shop Perfume

186
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:03,845
So this shop has chanelas?

187
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:10,180
What am I going to do if I
become like Shingo?

188
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,179
Hey, Dumpling Head!

189
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,980
That voice...

190
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:20,660
Why do you keep showing up?

191
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:23,591
I can say the same to you.

192
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:29,105
You're not buying a chanela, are you?

193
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,273
Why?

194
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,935
Perfume doesn't suit you.

195
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,838
Shut up.

196
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,413
And I'm in...

197
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:43,016
Welcome.

198
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:45,616
Please take your time.

199
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:47,421
Thank you.

200
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,656
I should have come with Naru.

201
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:57,565
They are pretty cute.

202
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,136
Usagi, don't fall for that trap.

203
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,538
Luna? Why?

204
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,371
I was checking out this store because
something wasn't right.

205
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,037
You think so?

206
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:11,978
Don't look into its eyes.

207
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,544
So cute...

208
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,348
Usagi.

209
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,391
It's no surprise a pretty
customer like you

210
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,360
would pick out the cutest
chanela in the store.

211
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,669
How cute.

212
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:35,138
Usagi, I think you should return it.

213
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,800
If you get any closer, I'll kick you!

214
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,370
Usagi!

215
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,674
I don't like you.

216
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,213
It's okay, it's not your fault.

217
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,519
Coming through!

218
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:54,018
It hurts!

219
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,554
Usagi.

220
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:00,954
Cute kitty cat.

221
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,398
I can't leave her alone.

222
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:19,416
Oh, good.

223
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,884
Luna, what was I doing?

224
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,921
I'm sorry Luna. I just...

225
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,912
More importantly, I'm worried
about Shingo.

226
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,454
Okay.

227
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:33,121
Shingo, hand over that chanela!

228
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:34,727
No way!

229
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,762
What are you doing? Stop it!

230
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,497
You idiot.

231
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,603
Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,266
I'm not giving anyone my chanela.

233
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:52,715
Usagi, there's no time
to be depressed!

234
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,683
We've got to follow him.

235
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,352
But where should we go?

236
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,581
That pet shop of course.

237
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,724
Now change into Sailor Moon!

238
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:07,130
What am I going to do if the chanela
looks at me again?

239
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,965
You can't be scared now.
You've got an important mission.

240
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:14,971
I know.

241
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:18,236
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

242
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:13,763
You are to spread these chanelas.
Do you understand?

243
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,128
Yeah!

244
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,798
Frill-necked lizards, Mexican
salamanders, and human-faced
fish are all mad.

245
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:26,939
Who are you?

246
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:31,145
They are mad, saying that
they are not toys!

247
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,781
Sailor warrior of love and justice,

248
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,144
Sailor Moon.

249
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:43,351
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you.

250
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,427
Why you...

251
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,802
Scary!

252
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,947
Shingo! Shingo!

253
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,763
It's usually at times like this that

254
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,560
the Tuxedo Mask comes to save me.

255
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:27,937
He's not coming.

256
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:29,928
Don't keep depending on others.

257
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,210
C'mon, use the Moon Tiara Action.

258
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:37,310
But Shingo's there...

259
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,750
Just yell, "Moon Tiara Stardust."

260
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,149
Got it.

261
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:01,434
Moon Tiara Stardust!

262
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,545
Oh, I didn't know I could do that.

263
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:14,876
Why you...

264
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:16,943
Over here, Sailor Moon!

265
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,297
I'm done for!

266
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:34,865
That monster's weak point is
at the base of its tail.

267
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,805
Moon Tiara Action.

268
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,033
Sailor V!

269
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,830
Oh crap!

270
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:10,273
Sailor V. Can I get your autograph?

271
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:12,141
I'm a huge fan.

272
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,166
I'm Sailor Moon!

273
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:17,906
Well, you're cute, so whichever.

274
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:20,315
Anyway, can I please have
your autograph?

275
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:23,979
But before that, I have to ask you
to do something, Shingo.

276
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,687
Huh? How did you know my name?

277
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,283
I know everything.

278
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:34,826
Shingo, I want you to be nice to
a cat near you named Luna.

279
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:39,135
That black cat is certain to
lead you to happiness.

280
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:41,569
Okay, anything you ask.

281
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:51,544
Luna, do you want ham next?

282
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,244
It's good that you two
are getting along.

283
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:58,452
Starting today, we're a family of five.

284
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:00,553
Okay, here you go.

285
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:04,222
Either way, it's pretty bad.

286
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,428
In my dream, you and I were together

287
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:20,339
Protected by the stars

288
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,557
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

289
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,627
And we casually talked to each other

290
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:51,440
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

291
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:58,478
I want to become prettier
right here and now

292
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:06,014
Something changes when
you fall in love

293
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:12,559
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

294
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:26,445
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
