<i>[Episode 2]</i>

3
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
<i>Father, please speak.</i>

4
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,759
I am giving you a golden lotus.

5
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,639
Let it grow in
Kunlun Mountain's lotus pond.

6
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,080
Use your immortal powers
to take good care of it

7
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,479
until it takes on a human form.

8
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,800
A golden lotus?

9
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,159
Xuan Nu has disturbed you.

10
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,120
You must be Si Yin's friend.

11
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,159
Yes, I just came from
the herb drying area.

12
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,879
I am taking a walk around the area.

13
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,199
I'll take my leave.

14
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,919
Master.

15
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,879
Xuan Nu looks quite graceful,
much like Seventeenth.

16
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I am going into seclusion tonight.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,360
I will be gone for anywhere from
10 days to half a month.

18
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,599
While I am gone, you will be in charge
of keeping an eye on Seventeenth.

19
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,960
But Seventeenth has
so many mischievous ideas.

20
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,080
No matter how many
mischievous ideas he has

21
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,000
30,000 copies of
"True Classic of Vacuity"

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,024
will be enough to last him half a month.

23
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,719
So the punishment you gave him

24
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,903
was to keep him from straying
from Kunlun Mountain?

25
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
That's correct.

26
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,279
Seventeenth's temper is undisciplined
and he avoids practicing asceticism.

27
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,800
He does not yet know that in half a month

28
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,064
he will face a heavenly trial
to his godly ascension.

29
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,759
Look after him for now.

30
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,079
We will figure something out
after I am back.

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
Yes, Master.

32
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,040
Ninth Disciple.

33
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,079
Please review.

34
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,759
- Ninth Disciple.
- No need for insincere words.

35
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,720
Copying the scripture
is the proper thing to do.

36
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to talk to you about Qing Qiu.

37
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,319
I heard there is an auspicious event
happening soon in Qing Qiu.

38
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,160
Fox King Bai Zhi's first grandchild
is about to be born.

39
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,800
I heard you greatly admire the two gods,
Fox King Bai Zhi and Zhe Yan.

40
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,240
The two of them will be there.

41
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,959
Why don't we join in the festivities?

42
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Fox King hasn't appeared
in thousands of years.

43
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,319
Is your information verified?

44
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,519
Absolutely.

45
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,759
All right. Continue copying.

46
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,959
I am not done talking yet.

47
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,480
Everyone knows one must cross
the Sea of Rebirth to reach Qing Qiu.

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,279
However, I know a shortcut.

49
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,399
With your cloud jumping techniques

50
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,240
we won't be gone for
more than half a day.

51
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,560
When we get there, we'll watch
the two gods from afar, drink a toast

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,759
and then we'll return.

53
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,040
What do you think?

54
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,120
No! Master ordered me
to watch you day and night.

55
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,000
I must not stray from my duties.

56
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,199
Let me put it this way.

57
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Even if you watch me day and night,
you won't be able to guard me.

58
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,639
I will still find a way to sneak out.

59
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,279
It's true.

60
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,680
That's why you should accompany me.

61
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,839
That's still considered watching me
day and night.

62
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,199
You wouldn't be defying orders.

63
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,360
How about it?

64
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,076
This area is the border between
Qing Qiu and Ghost Realm.

65
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,966
This has been the case for
thousands of years.

66
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,879
We should reach Qing Qiu in an hour.

67
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,360
This place feels evil.

68
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,319
I can't use my
cloud leaping abilities at all.

69
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,800
We must be careful.

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,720
I've heard Dong Hua Dijun talk to Master
about the Ghost Realm.

71
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,839
He said the current Ghost Lord
is very ambitious

72
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,720
and he'll surely wage a fierce war
against the Celestials in the future.

73
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,399
What would be the point of the war?

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,079
Ambition, probably.

75
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,079
Speaking of the Ghost Lord, I think
I have seen a painting of him.

76
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:11,199
Watch out!

77
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,480
Speak! Why are you attacking us?

78
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,279
Why did they take their own lives
without saying anything?

79
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,040
We weren't trying to kill them.

80
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,720
That shriek was their secret signal
to commit suicide.

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
Run!

82
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,399
Brother, they are dressed so strangely.

83
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,440
They don't look like
the ones we are searching for.

84
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Nor do they seem to be from
the Ghost Tribe.

85
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,519
That's right. They are
of the Celestial Tribe.

86
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
The Celestial Tribe?

87
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
So what of it?

88
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
Sooner or later, I will have them bow
before us and they will be our prisoners.

89
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,159
As will the entire world.

90
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,080
All right.

91
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,960
But, Celestials are all so beautiful.

92
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,679
When they become our prisoners

93
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,679
you can pick a few
to keep as pets in the palace.

94
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,679
Is that Ghost Lord Qing Cang?

95
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,039
Yes.

96
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,879
I stay at my post in
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods all year long.

97
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,559
This is my first time outside.
I didn't expect to lose my way.

98
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,840
You are Zhe Yan's men?

99
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,399
I am an immortal under Zhe Yan.

100
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,799
Zhe Yan and Qing Qiu are like one.

101
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,960
Ever since Bai Zhi took over as Fox King

102
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,759
he has not interfered in the grudges
between Celestials, Demons, and Ghosts.

103
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,159
He has preserved the peace

104
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,720
that has existed in Qing Qiu
for hundreds of thousands of years.

105
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,799
Yes, our Zhe Yan told us

106
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,440
not to get involved in the affairs
of Celestials, Demons, and Ghosts

107
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,000
to allow peace and quiet
in Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

108
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,600
Ghost Lord, the forest is full
of the corpses of the rebel soldiers.

109
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,960
Is that your doing?

110
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,919
We were lost.
They came out of nowhere and attacked us.

111
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,919
They didn't say a word,
they just came at us with swords.

112
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,360
We did it to save our own lives.

113
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,559
Rightful deaths.

114
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:29,960
I pursued them all the way here in order
to keep a few alive for interrogation.

115
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,720
Yet, you two killed them all.

116
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,759
That's all right.

117
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,820
From this day forth, whoever dares
stand in my way in this world...

118
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,639
will meet the same end.

119
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,500
Yes, absolutely.
We shall take our leave now.

120
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,919
Golden Tiger.

121
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
You are our guests.

122
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,720
You two are invited as guests
to Grand Ziming Palace.

123
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,047
Head back to the palace.

124
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,679
Why is the Ghost Lord
taking us back to the palace?

125
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,759
Could Zhe Yan have offended him?

126
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,879
But this is Grand Ziming Palace.

127
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,799
Celestial disciples
cannot use our powers here.

128
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,480
I can't even summon my sword.

129
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Only those ranked as gods can
come and go freely.

130
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,519
Young immortal.

131
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,799
Princess.

132
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,159
How did you know I am the princess?

133
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,080
You have such a graceful figure
and stunning features

134
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,759
and you can intimidate the three armies.

135
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,120
Of course you are the princess.

136
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,759
It's said Celestials are all
condescending. You seem quite unique.

137
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,080
Princess, you are wrong there.

138
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,616
Our god has long lived in seclusion
in the Peach Tree Woods

139
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:26,315
and bothers not with
affairs of the world.

140
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:30,360
That is why we can't be considered
part of the Celestial Tribe.

141
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
That is for the best.
My father hates the Celestial Tribe.

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you married yet?

143
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,159
Me?

144
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,480
Are you?

145
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,320
No.

146
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,840
Really? That's wonderful.

147
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,879
The princess has taken a liking to you.

148
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,679
Don't make such a joke.

149
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,799
Yao Guang looks at Master the same way.

150
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,759
Here, General.

151
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,120
Let me fill your cup.

152
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,840
Another toast, General.

153
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,799
- Drink another cup.
- You sure can drink.

154
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,639
Come, another cup.

155
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,039
- Come, come.
- Let me fill your cup.

156
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,039
Good, good.

157
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,639
General, you sure can drink.

158
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,080
Let me drink with you.

159
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,360
- Another toast.
- Brother.

160
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,879
Doesn't it taste good?

161
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,679
- Come, fill it up again.
- Drink.

162
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,360
General, drink.

163
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Come, drink.

164
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,919
Drink.

165
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Let me fill it up for you.

166
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,080
- Ghost Lord.
- Ghost Lord.

167
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,639
Sit.

168
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,279
You other tribes sit when you poop

169
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,759
yet you kneel and sit down on your heels.

170
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,519
Sit down properly.

171
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,399
Immortal.

172
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,519
Please.

173
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,840
Please drink.

174
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,159
Immortal.

175
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,720
Yan Zhi, where is your second brother?

176
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,519
I'm afraid he isn't back yet.

177
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
There are numerous beauties
in the palace.

178
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,879
Yet, he still pursues pleasures
all day in the mortal realm.

179
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,480
How is that fitting for a prince?

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,919
Second Brother is...

181
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,539
Today is the anniversary
of his birth mother's death.

182
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,783
I'm afraid that is why he isn't back yet.

183
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,879
You. Why haven't I seen you speak?

184
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,039
Do you not like the hospitality
of my Grand Ziming Palace?

185
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,200
Not at all, my Lord.
I am not good with words.

186
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,799
I'm afraid I'll spoil your mood
if I speak too much.

187
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,679
How is that possible?

188
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,879
My Lord, I drink to you.

189
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,440
You have much talent.
I really like you.

190
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,080
You flatter me, my Lord.

191
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,879
Why don't you become my godson
and live here in Grand Ziming Palace?

192
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,559
From the moment I saw you, I thought...

193
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,079
perhaps it is fate

194
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,039
that has brought you to me.

195
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,839
Although I have two sons and a daughter

196
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,440
I must still ask if you are willing
to take this chance to be father and son.

197
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
That...

198
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,599
What is the matter?

199
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,200
Is Grand Ziming Palace
not good enough for you?

200
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
No, no.

201
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
My Lord, it is just that I must
first discuss this with my parents.

202
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,720
There's no need.

203
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
But such an important matter
as taking a godfather

204
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,599
must receive the approval of my family.

205
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,000
Accepting a familial relation
only requires mutual consent.

206
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
There's no need for permission
from family members.

207
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
That's...

208
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,559
My Lord.

209
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,480
As Your Lord says, taking
a familial relation needs mutual consent.

210
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,200
At the very least,
both parties must be willing.

211
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,119
As lord of the Ghost Realm

212
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,480
can I not take on a godson if I want to?

213
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,839
My Lord, that is not how it works.
Please calm down.

214
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,480
If you really have set your intentions

215
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,440
you must still ask our god.

216
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,599
- Zhe Yan?
- Exactly.

217
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,000
Did you think that by calling yourselves
Zhe Yan's men

218
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,400
you could avoid this difficult situation?

219
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,319
Last year,
on the Heavenly Lord's birthday

220
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,000
when I transformed myself
into an emissary

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,319
to offer a birthday present...

222
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,680
I clearly saw you
standing next to Mo Yuan.

223
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,519
You called him Master.

224
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,319
The two of you are not Zhe Yan's men

225
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,720
but disciples of Kunlun Mountain.

226
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,559
Seize them.

227
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,279
Don't.

228
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,240
Let go of me!

229
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,599
Take them into custody separately.

230
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,920
Young immortal, think carefully.

231
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,960
Do you want to be hacked into pieces
or be my good adopted son?

232
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,680
- Go.
- Come.

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,319
Your Highness.

234
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,240
Father wants to take in
Kunlun Mountain's men?

235
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,599
The intention of the drunkard
lies not in the wine.

236
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,519
- He wants to rebel.
- Rebel?

237
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,920
What are you fretting for?

238
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
Rebelling is their business.

239
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,839
What does it have to do with me?

240
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,640
It has even less to do
with you, beautiful.

241
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,079
Yao Guang likes Master
so she captured me.

242
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,039
The Ghost Lord wants to take a godson.

243
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,759
So I was captured again.

244
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,799
After living for thousands of years

245
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,319
I, Bai Qian of Qing Qiu,
daughter of the Fox King

246
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,200
am just an accessory.

247
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,240
I can't even use my powers.

248
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
You are awake.

249
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,079
Are you going to dine first
or have a nice talk with us first?

250
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,279
No, no, no.

251
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,359
Normally, at this time in the
Celestial Realm, I practice my lessons.

252
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,359
Let's save the chat for another day.

253
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,279
You need to pick a time
to drink and unwind? How boring.

254
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,559
Yes.

255
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,599
- Princess.
- Go on.

256
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Report, Ghost Lord.

257
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,359
Celestial Realm's Second Prince
has brought this year's gift.

258
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,200
He is waiting at the side palace hall.

259
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,200
Gift?

260
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,440
It's said to be Heavenly Lord's birthday.

261
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,457
It's a gift to the lords of the four seas
and Ghost Realm under his rule.

262
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,359
That old man.

263
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,079
Every year on his birthday,
he gifts the entire world.

264
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,519
Does he really think

265
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,784
I am like the Water Kings of
the four seas who bow before him?

266
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,039
It's been 300,000 years.

267
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,039
His Celestial Tribe has ruled over
this world for much too long.

268
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
It is time for a change.

269
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
Drive them out.

270
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,599
Yes.

271
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,599
Enough.

272
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,440
You may all go.

273
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,839
Report, Father.

274
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,640
Qing Cang of the Ghost Tribe
does not know what is good for him.

275
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,319
Not only did he not accept the gift...

276
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,599
but he refused to see me.

277
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,839
The Ghost Lord's behavior is becoming
more and more unacceptable.

278
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,519
He even dares to send back my gift.

279
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,039
It isn't worth much.

280
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Dijun, you must not know.

281
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,720
The current Ghost Lord, Qing Cang,
acts without regard for any authority.

282
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,279
I am afraid he will raise arms
and rebel one day

283
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,240
bringing disaster to the four seas.

284
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,400
With Mo Yuan around, what are you
afraid of, Heavenly Lord?

285
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,039
The Bell of the East Emperor
that can destroy heaven and earth

286
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,960
is in his hands.

287
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,400
The Bell of the East Emperor
was created by Mo Yuan.

288
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Mo Yuan will have a way to suppress it.

289
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,240
Mo Yuan isn't afraid.
What are you afraid of?

290
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:42,299
<i>Ninth Disciple and Seventeenth Disciple
have been missing for several days now.</i>

291
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,160
<i>Should I report this to Master?</i>

292
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Heavenly Father originally gave the Bell
of the East Emperor to the Ghost Tribe

293
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,680
to enable an alliance between
the Celestial Tribe and the Ghost Tribe

294
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,880
in exchange for
thousands of years of peace.

295
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,990
Yet, I never imagined the destructive
Bell of the East Emperor

296
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,559
would now become a danger
to the Celestial Tribe.

297
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,279
That...

298
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,295
Where are the leaders of
the other clans of the Celestial Tribe?

299
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,440
Not here again?

300
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,720
The Celestial Tribe is now afflicted
with troubles internally and externally.

301
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,799
Do you have any good ideas, Dijun?

302
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,279
Good ideas?

303
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,960
Haven't you been thinking about
a marriage alliance with Qing Qiu?

304
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,200
That's right.

305
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,279
Qing Qiu's Fox King

306
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,663
has a strong relationship with
Zhe Yan of Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

307
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,579
With a marriage alliance

308
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,660
the interests of the Celestial Tribe,
the Phoenix Clan, and the Fox Clan

309
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,200
will be indistinguishable.

310
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,319
Should there be a war in the future...

311
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,000
our odds of winning will be much higher.

312
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,359
Not bad.

313
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,400
Not bad.

314
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,500
It's time to seize the opportunity.

315
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,599
I'm thinking those leaders
won't keep their distance.

316
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,279
At the bottom of it,
they are on our side.

317
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,960
They won't let the Ghost Tribe
rule the world.

318
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,839
Who knows.

319
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,000
Excuse me, which deity was that just now?

320
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,200
Dong Hua Dijun.

321
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,680
Dong Hua Dijun?

322
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,488
You're new here?

323
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:42,008
Why did the Heavenly Lord agree
to whatever he said?

324
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,367
Many thousands of years ago

325
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:48,567
Dong Hua Dijun was God of
Heaven and Earth, ruler of the world.

326
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:53,127
Later on, the world was at peace
and Dijun ceded his position

327
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,607
and that is how the current
Heavenly Lord came to be in power.

328
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,728
In the mortal realm, he would be
called Taishang Huang. (Emperor Emeritus)

329
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:01,367
Dijun is the Celestial Tribe's
Taishang Huang.

330
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,048
Thank you and farewell.

331
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,567
- You're welcome.
- I have yet to know your name.

332
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,887
I follow Dong Hua Dijun

333
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,288
as Star Lord Si Ming.
I control the fates of mortals.

334
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,367
Star Lord Si Ming.

335
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,488
Senior!

336
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,607
Senior, we still haven't found them.

337
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,688
Ninth and Seventeenth
have been missing for eight days now.

338
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,807
Where have they gone?

339
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:32,367
Seventeenth has caused trouble again
and has dragged Ninth with him this time.

340
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,249
Aren't you afraid something bad
has happened?

341
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:37,048
Seventeenth has such a way with words.

342
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,528
How could something happen? No, no.

343
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:43,688
He... He must have kidnapped Ninth
and gone out to drink.

344
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,887
They do go to the mortal realm often

345
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:49,327
to put up a stall and offer divination
to pass the time.

346
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,567
Perhaps they'll be back tomorrow.

347
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:55,807
Aside from Yao Guang, Kunlun Mountain
hasn't offended anyone else.

348
00:28:55,807 --> 00:29:01,208
Even if anything did happen,
Seventeenth won't be at a disadvantage.

349
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,647
I am not worried about that.

350
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:06,768
- Instead...
- What is it?

351
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:10,008
Master said a heavenly trial
for Seventeenth's godly ascension

352
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:11,575
would occur around this time.

353
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,664
What? Heavenly trial?

354
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:14,664
He's only been developing skills
for 20,000 years.

355
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:18,127
He won't be able to deduce when and where
the heavenly trial will descend upon him.

356
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:20,127
Supposing that it happens
in the next few days...

357
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,647
it will be an immense challenge.

358
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:23,847
Heavenly trial?

359
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,471
Heavenly trial for ascension?

360
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,488
If Seventeenth is subjected to
the heavenly trial now

361
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:31,607
then even with help from Ninth,
it would still be dangerous.

362
00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:33,488
We can't wait any longer.

363
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:37,728
Twelfth, stay at Kunlun Mountain
and notify Master when he comes back.

364
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:40,167
The others and I will continue to search.

365
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,688
Perhaps we will find them.

366
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:42,807
Yes.

367
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:44,564
Senior.

368
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,483
Bring me along.

369
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:47,523
Now you are worried?

370
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,384
Senior, don't make me
look bad. Let's hurry.

371
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,243
A heavenly trial is a serious matter.

372
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,425
<i>Young immortal, the palace is not
heavily guarded tonight. Leave quickly.</i>

373
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,525
<i>My older brother is watching
your fellow disciple.</i>

374
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:13,284
<i>I am not sure where he is
being held. Escape first.</i>

375
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:17,003
<i>Follow the black bird out of the garden
and head north to get out of the palace.</i>

376
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:21,324
<i>Luring me into a trap?</i>

377
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:24,963
<i>No, I'm already a prisoner.
I wouldn't need to be tricked.</i>

378
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:37,324
Slowly, slow down!

379
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:41,483
Good thing I have you
or else I'd be lost.

380
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,963
Where did it go?

381
00:30:57,284 --> 00:31:00,003
The weather sure is nice today.

382
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:02,683
Come here.

383
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:23,763
Come here.

384
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:45,763
The color of your outfit is strange
but it looks quite nice.

385
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:48,403
Where did you buy it?

386
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,284
Qing... Qing Qiu.

387
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:56,284
I was just worrying about not having
a gift for my father's birthday.

388
00:31:57,044 --> 00:32:01,364
Little fellow, consider it a favor to me
and give me your clothes.

389
00:32:02,763 --> 00:32:04,203
What... What are you doing?

390
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:06,403
You're not a woman.
What are you afraid of?

391
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:09,723
- Take them off now. I'll get someone--
- No!

392
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:12,124
Don't come any closer.

393
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:14,403
You...

394
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,243
<i>Oh no!</i>

395
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:24,324
<i>Without my immortal powers,
won't I drown?</i>

396
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,604
<i>I'll pass air to you.</i>

397
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:29,003
<i>Pass air to me?</i>

398
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:51,443
<i>Did you think passing air
could only be done by mouth?</i>

399
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:53,243
<i>I don't want to touch you.</i>

400
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:59,284
I'm freezing.

401
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:03,243
You are so afraid of the cold.
You are like a mortal.

402
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:07,723
Aren't I reduced to a mortal here?
I can't use my powers.

403
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,844
You are a Celestial?

404
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:15,324
You must be as well.
Were you captured to be a godson?

405
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:19,284
What did you say? Godson?

406
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:23,044
Yes. Doesn't the Ghost Lord
like to take in godsons?

407
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,443
You must be one too.

408
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,324
I am Grand Ziming Palace's second prince.

409
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:29,804
Li Jing.

410
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,884
Who are you?

411
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,844
Forget it. I can't escape
after running into you.

412
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:03,203
I am Si Yin, Seventeenth Disciple
of Mo Yuan of Kunlun Mountain.

413
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:04,844
I was captured by your father.

414
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,603
You are the godson my father captured?

415
00:34:08,603 --> 00:34:11,884
Your father took a liking
to Ninth Disciple, not me.

416
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,563
So you are...

417
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:17,936
I was captured by convenience.

418
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,443
Forget it.

419
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:22,164
I can't escape anyway.

420
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:24,123
Make your move, Second Prince.

421
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:26,844
Make my move? What move?

422
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:31,123
You want me to be like my father
and capture you to be my godson?

423
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:33,724
I'd rather die.

424
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:37,643
I'm just joking.
I don't have a fondness for that.

425
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:40,884
If you want to run, then run.

426
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:43,164
I don't like meddling in these matters.

427
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,684
So you are here. Come back with us.

428
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:48,643
You all are increasingly ill-behaved.

429
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:52,804
Do you still hold
any regard for me, a prince?

430
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:55,123
Second Prince, we dare not be rude.

431
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:56,523
Aren't you going to leave?

432
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:58,884
Second Prince, do you know who she is?

433
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,043
Do you really think I only drink
and indulge my fancies all day long

434
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:10,324
and don't know what happens
in Grand Ziming Palace?

435
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,923
I dare not think that.

436
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,943
A bunch of brainless good-for-nothings.

437
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,443
- Leave now!
- Yes.

438
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:25,204
You're all still there?

439
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,643
Let's go.

440
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:33,083
You are the Celestial pretty boy
my sister took a liking to?

441
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,364
Why do you say that?

442
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:39,844
I heard the palace people say Yan Zhi
took a liking to a Celestial pretty boy.

443
00:35:40,844 --> 00:35:46,443
She helped you escape.
That means she really does like you.

444
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,724
There must be a misunderstanding.

445
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:51,483
It's all right.

446
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:56,164
Since my sister likes you so much,
I can't let you be captured.

447
00:35:56,164 --> 00:36:00,364
I'll humble myself and escort you back.

448
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:01,724
Back to where?

449
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:05,724
Back to where you came from of course!

450
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:09,963
What did you say?

451
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,364
Second Prince is currently
drinking with Si Yin...

452
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:15,684
and will be talking though the night?

453
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:17,403
I heard it myself.

454
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:20,684
They were both drenched from head to toe,
and said they had fallen into the water.

455
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:26,324
Convey my orders not to interfere
with Second Prince.

456
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:29,563
Allow him to mingle with
the one from Kunlun Mountain.

457
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:32,523
When we wage war
against the Celestial Tribe

458
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,963
I'll get a chance to lodge
an accusation against him.

459
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,364
Second Brother?

460
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:56,804
You're back?

461
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:01,563
How come you're drinking here?

462
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:04,204
This Celestial immortal has
such a pretty face.

463
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,923
No wonder he caught your eye.

464
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:09,844
You've misunderstood, Second Brother.

465
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:13,244
I have much experience
in matters of romance.

466
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:17,244
How could I not know?
Have you fallen for him?

467
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,483
But he is from the Celestial Tribe.

468
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:25,523
If you like him, who cares
which tribe he is from?

469
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:30,724
Those from the Celestial Tribe and
the Ghost Tribe cannot marry each other.

470
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:34,324
Furthermore, we are about
to wage war against the Celestial Tribe.

471
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:36,083
You are smart. It is good you are aware.

472
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:40,043
He says he wants to make
their disciple his godson?

473
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:43,724
It is complete pretense.

474
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:49,123
Father has lost his patience and
wants to use this opportunity to rebel.

475
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:59,483
However, I have no interest in rebelling.

476
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:01,523
Are you speaking the truth?

477
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,724
- Then...
- What is it?

478
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:14,324
Speak freely. When did you
learn to hold back with me?

479
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:18,643
Since you do not support revolting,
why don't you...

480
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:21,884
help me help him escape?

481
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,603
You've really fallen for him? Come.

482
00:38:28,164 --> 00:38:31,764
Since you really do like him,
why bother rescuing him?

483
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:35,563
It'll be more satisfying to lock him up
and force him to submit to you.

484
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,483
No, no. If Father finds out,
he will surely kill him.

485
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:45,923
Don't worry. Since he is a hostage,
he is naturally safe.

486
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,364
I forced this fellow to drink a lot.

487
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:52,204
He'll be asleep for at least 10 days.

488
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:57,364
You and I will have to plan
how we'll get him out of here.

489
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,043
You'll really help me?

490
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,603
He and I get along pretty well.

491
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:06,563
I don't want him to die
in Grand Ziming Palace.

492
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:17,483
- Mother!
- The baby is here!

493
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:20,684
- Look, it is a girl.
- A girl?

494
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:24,364
We have so many children
and we only had one girl, Bai Qian.

495
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:28,724
This is wonderful. Now we have
another girl in our Fox Den.

496
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:32,643
Congratulations, Second Brother,
on having a princess.

497
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:36,003
She finally came out of her mother's womb
after 10 days of labor.

498
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:39,603
I'm guessing she'll grow up
to be another troublesome child.

499
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:43,003
Mother, do you think
she'll be like Bai Qian?

500
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:45,284
Isn't it good to be like Bai Qian?

501
00:39:47,204 --> 00:39:52,364
Fox King, look. There is
a red birthmark on the child's forehead.

502
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:55,204
See what it looks like. Come, look.

503
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,003
It looks like a plumed cockscomb flower.

504
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:01,403
Yes, a plumed cockscomb.

505
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:04,603
A plumed cockscomb.

506
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,963
Why don't I choose a name for her?

507
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,204
Bai Feng Jiu. How is that?

508
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,563
Bai Feng Jiu?

509
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:17,844
All right. We'll take
that name then. Bai Feng Jiu.

510
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:22,804
From now on, you'll be Feng Jiu.

511
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:26,483
Jiu Jiu.

512
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:30,003
You have an auntie who is
learning on Kunlun Mountain.

513
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:34,568
She will be very happy to see you
when she returns.

514
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:38,123
Here, here.

515
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:42,483
Take her outside and show her
to the people of Qing Qiu.

516
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,764
This is my newly born princess
of Qing Qiu.

517
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:47,123
Yes, Mother.

518
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:48,844
- Hurry on.
- Yes, Father.

519
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:58,284
- They're coming out.
- Yes, they're coming out.

520
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:04,884
This is the princess, Bai Feng Jiu,
first granddaughter of the king.

521
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:07,244
It's a princess.

522
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:10,884
Congratulations to Fox King
for having his first grandchild.

523
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:15,324
Congratulations to Second Prince
for having a princess.

524
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:36,884
The wine in Ghost Realm is good

525
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:38,614
but it's so strong.

526
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:43,844
Second Prince has ordered
that you all leave.

527
00:41:43,844 --> 00:41:45,043
- Yes.
- Yes.

528
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:54,963
Immortal.

529
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:57,003
You two are...

530
00:41:57,003 --> 00:42:00,603
Second Prince told me to wait here
for you to wake up

531
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,523
and invite you to the hot spring.

532
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:03,963
The hot spring?
