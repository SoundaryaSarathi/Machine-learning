1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,442
Princess?

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:11,215
What is the matter? You're here
alone, and so late at night...

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,985
I have an urgent request
to make of you two in secret.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,566
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:33,065
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

6
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:43,611
The sky where two moons
never fade away

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,682
That's an impossibility, right?

8
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:56,632
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

9
00:00:56,632 --> 00:01:02,237
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

10
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:08,699
Even if you trip and
become depressed

11
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:16,144
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

12
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:23,025
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

13
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:29,531
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

14
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:35,304
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

15
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:43,803
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,018
A Princess's Request

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,361
I have decided to marry
into a family in Germania.

18
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,729
What did you say?!

19
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,299
Of all things, the country of all
those savage upstart nobles?!

20
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,968
It cannot be helped.

21
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,271
To protect our small
country of Tristein,

22
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:12,798
we need a strong
alliance with Germania.

23
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,277
A marriage of convenience
to the country?

24
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:17,643
You stay quiet!

25
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,774
Even if it's for our country,
to face such a hardship...

26
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,987
I am the princess of Tristein.

27
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:28,946
I do not mind sacrificing myself
for the sake of the country.

28
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,749
However...

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,064
However, there is one thing
that I must do before that.

30
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,399
Princess!

31
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:41,770
If there is anything that I can do,
please tell me to do so!

32
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,637
Thank you, Louise Françoise.

33
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,109
I would like you to
retrieve a certain item.

34
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,713
A certain item?

35
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:57,319
A letter that I sent to
Prince Wales in Albion.

36
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,581
Albion?

37
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:02,090
If the world finds out
about that letter,

38
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,388
this engagement will be called off.

39
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,321
Princess...

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,592
What kind of letter is it,
that would ruin a marriage...

41
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,201
I told you to keep quiet!

42
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:16,705
Albion is currently politically unstable,

43
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:18,707
and in a dangerous
situation right now.

44
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:21,209
I hear the nobles
started a coup d'etat,

45
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,769
and the royal family is about
to fall from their reign.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,948
I'm sorry,

47
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:29,611
for even asking such a close friend
to do such a thing...

48
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,180
I...

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,983
But now, you two are the only ones
I can ask such a thing!

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,024
Thank you so much, Princess.

51
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:43,865
Louise Françoise...

52
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:48,904
To request me to perform
such an important mission...

53
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:51,372
I could not be happier.

54
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,008
Louise...

55
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:54,805
Then, will you go for me?

56
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:57,236
Who is it?!

57
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,876
Guiche!

58
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:08,023
I have heard everything.

59
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:10,993
Weren't you just eavesdropping?!

60
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:14,997
Please ask me, Guiche de Grammont,
anything you wish...

61
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,798
Don't be so reckless!

62
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
Grammont?

63
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,502
Then, you must be
General Grammont's...

64
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,304
I am his son.

65
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,467
You will be of service to me as well?

66
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,243
So Guiche is going to
tag along after all?

67
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,906
He's just going to get in the way.

68
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,209
I think I just heard some noise...

69
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,248
Oh, well.

70
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:42,687
Um...

71
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,327
Oh, Siesta.

72
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,817
I'm terribly sorry.

73
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:50,364
That bit about the love potion
really was true.

74
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,835
I was so rude to you, Mr. Saito.

75
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,304
You shouldn't worry about it.

76
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,295
Louise is back to normal too.

77
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:02,402
If it is Gundolf, it is worth believing.

78
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,043
Gundolf again, huh...

79
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:10,752
Hey, who at this school has
a detailed knowledge of history?

80
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,845
History, is it?

81
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:19,461
Originally, there were
five elements of magic,

82
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:22,064
not just Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.

83
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:25,727
The five elements are said to have
been the pinnacles of the pentagon.

84
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,006
That lost apex is the element of Void.

85
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:36,445
Gundolf is the familiar of
the legendary Void mage.

86
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,447
Void mage?

87
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,482
However, in modern times,

88
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,985
no mage has been confirmed
to have Void magic.

89
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,154
The rune that appeared on your hand

90
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,890
closely resembles that of Gundolf.

91
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,825
But...

92
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:53,595
As long as no Void mage exists,

93
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:58,089
unfortunately, we cannot be certain
that you really are Gundolf.

94
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:02,802
The master is far from legendary,
the way she is.

95
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,974
I thought something smelled.

96
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,409
Is this it?

97
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,309
That is the blood of a dragon.

98
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,447
Dragon's blood?

99
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,383
In the past, two dragons
never seen before

100
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:19,454
appeared in the skies
with a tremendous roar.

101
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:21,957
One of them disappeared,

102
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:25,327
and the other fell
somewhere, they say.

103
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,596
I happened to come across blood

104
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,865
that was said to have been
shed at that time.

105
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,527
I am in the middle of replicating it.

106
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,437
This is blood?

107
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,337
I mean, this smell...

108
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:47,178
Prince Wales of Albion and
our princess are cousins.

109
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,010
Cousins, and childhood friends?

110
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,454
Louise?

111
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,023
I'm not any good at magic.

112
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:59,221
Can I go through with
such an important job?

113
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,268
What are you doing?

114
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:08,470
Nothing will get done if you worry.

115
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,997
We got through everything
in the past somehow, right?

116
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,573
Must be nice to be so easy-going.

117
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,623
You know...

118
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:29,885
What?

119
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:33,523
If something happens,
I'll protect you.

120
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,665
Of course, that's to be expected!

121
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,500
You're my familiar!

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,263
Oh, yeah, yeah.

123
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:05,093
This is the Ruby of Water, that my
mother has entrusted me with.

124
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:08,997
Right now, this is the only
reward that I can give you.

125
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,599
Princess...

126
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,968
I will send one of
the guards with you.

127
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,596
Ask him to lead the way to Albion.

128
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:19,608
The guard...

129
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,906
It's about time he would
show up, I'd think.

130
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,101
What?

131
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,276
Verdande!

132
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,522
Oh, my cute little Verdande!

133
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:38,093
You thought I would
leave you behind again,

134
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,729
because I went to the lake
without you the other day?

135
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,464
You touch my heart so!

136
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:46,264
Let me tell you, we can't take
a big mole with us.

137
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,063
What is it?

138
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,677
No!

139
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,078
Wait!

140
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,179
Where do you think you're touching?!

141
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,407
Guiche!

142
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,118
I see, the ring.

143
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,452
The ring?

144
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:09,758
Verdande loves gems, especially
ones that are valuable.

145
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,326
You've got to be kidding!

146
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:16,364
I won't stand for a mole eating the
valuable ring the Princess gave me!

147
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,594
Enough of that! Help me out here!

148
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:27,342
Verdande!

149
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:28,366
Who is it?!

150
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,040
Up above!

151
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,649
A griffon...

152
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,493
Who are you?

153
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:59,074
I am Wardes, leader
of the griffon squad,

154
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,599
ordered by Lady Henrietta to
accompany you on this trip.

155
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,445
It's you!

156
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,847
Of the famous Magic Guards?

157
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,109
Louise...

158
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,187
Sorry to surprise you.

159
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:16,815
I had thought that my
fiancée was in trouble.

160
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,660
Fiancée?

161
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,093
You're kidding!

162
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:25,527
You are as light as ever!
Just like a feather.

163
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,730
It has been a while, Lord Wardes.

164
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,829
What's the commotion,
so early in the morning?

165
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,075
Who's that good-looking guy?!

166
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:40,312
Louise... That wench!

167
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:48,123
The top of the elite, the leader
of the griffon squad,

168
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:51,092
is going to guard us personally?

169
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,390
I can't feel anything but
impressed by all of this!

170
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,663
Whatever.

171
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,799
I was very surprised.

172
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,735
I had not heard that you would be
coming here, Lord Wardes.

173
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,429
We can't move the entire griffon
squad on a secret mission.

174
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:09,911
When I was asked by the princess
to do something about the letter,

175
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,147
I requested to guard
you all personally.

176
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:14,138
You asked to personally?

177
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,151
Of course.

178
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:19,348
Hearing your name, there's
no way that I could stay put.

179
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,253
Lord Wardes...

180
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,485
What's this "Lord Wardes" thing...

181
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,430
Something wrong?

182
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,897
Oh, nothing...

183
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:39,307
Hey, aren't we going to the port?

184
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,409
This is in the mountains,
no matter how you look at it.

185
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,878
You really don't know anything.

186
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,213
Are you tired?

187
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,147
No, not at all...

188
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:51,212
This is a good chance to catch up on
all the time we have spent apart.

189
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,817
Oh, yes...

190
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,350
Well, I won't be surprised at
whatever comes my way.

191
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,901
Oh, it's in sight now.

192
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,836
That is the port village, La Rochelle.

193
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:26,254
All the buildings here are
carved out of one boulder.

194
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:29,757
Thanks to Square-class mages
specializing in Earth,

195
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,622
it's a work of art.

196
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,502
We will spend the night here,
and depart tomorrow evening.

197
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:41,369
Understood?

198
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,272
Understood, Mister Wardes!

199
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:47,942
Saito, at least answer him.
Don't you think it's rude?

200
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,011
It's all right, Louise.

201
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,844
I don't like to act like nobility.

202
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,178
There we go.

203
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,920
You know, I'll tell you this much.

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,288
What?

205
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:03,758
My parents decided
on this fiancée thing.

206
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,260
Hmm.

207
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,262
What was that "hmm" for?

208
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:08,396
He's stuck-up,

209
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:12,300
but he seems to be the most decent
of all the nobles I've met,

210
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,562
so he's a good guy, isn't he?

211
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,001
That's right! I've always looked up
to him, from when I was a child!

212
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:21,743
He had lost his parents early on,

213
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:25,346
and went through many hardships to
become leader of the Magic Guards!

214
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,472
Unlike you...

215
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,875
What?

216
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,883
Well, you know...

217
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,589
I guess I didn't have to tag along.

218
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,783
You're a familiar! It's a given
that you're coming with me!

219
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,800
Oh man... I just don't know.

220
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,972
What, you were in love with Louise?

221
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,440
I'm not in love with her!

222
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,308
So savage, so selfish, such
a twisted personality...

223
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,547
Then why are you so depressed?

224
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,014
"I'll protect you!"

225
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,911
I just wish I hadn't said
something that cool.

226
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:07,681
That's all.

227
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,298
To summon a human familiar...
Nothing less from you, Louise.

228
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,434
Even you would say that,
Lord Wardes?

229
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:22,537
No, I'm not being sarcastic.

230
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:25,597
This is an amazing thing, Louise.

231
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:32,938
I heard that you two had a duel.

232
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,417
That was...

233
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:41,354
Is it true that the duel was the first
time you wielded a sword, Saito?

234
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,358
Well, yeah.

235
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,394
Is it also true that you used
the Staff of Destruction

236
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:49,364
to capture Fouquet
the Sculptor as well?

237
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,698
I guess.

238
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,767
You really know the details.

239
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,704
Being where I am, I get all sorts
of detailed information.

240
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:59,298
Even about a peasant
familiar like him?

241
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,637
That's why I've grown
an interest in you.

242
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,779
I had thought I would like to
ask you for a practice match.

243
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,121
The ship leaves tomorrow night.

244
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,090
It's boring to just
spend idle time, right?

245
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,859
Lord Wardes!

246
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,555
Of course, I won't force you to do so.

247
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,531
I don't mind.

248
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,434
Saito, stop it!

249
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:29,771
Lord Wardes, this is no time
to be doing such a...

250
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:33,434
It's okay. I'll go easy
on him, of course.

251
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:37,372
Now, let's get to our rooms soon.

252
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,914
Come, Louise.

253
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:41,716
Room?

254
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:46,721
No, I can't. We're not married yet.

255
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:49,657
It's all right. We're engaged.

256
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,749
But...

257
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,625
I have something
important to tell you.

258
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,864
A romantic evening.

259
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,809
Not really.

260
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,412
It's pitiful that you're the one
I'm sharing it with.

261
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:12,747
Same here.

262
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:15,683
Oh, that's right! I remember now,
I have to do something!

263
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,818
Do something?

264
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,120
I just remembered that
when we were eating,

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,589
there was a young lady!

266
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:25,047
I have to speak with her.
Otherwise I'd be rude, yes?

267
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:29,794
What's with that logic?

268
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:31,733
Hey, Derf.

269
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,167
What is it, partner?

270
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,603
Do you know about Gundolf?

271
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,901
What are you talking about,
this late in the game?

272
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,577
What are you, if you're not Gundolf?

273
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:47,514
My partner has always been Gundolf,
6000 years ago to the present.

274
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,525
Are you crying, mi lady?

275
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,963
Viscount, you were here?

276
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,568
You were scolded again
by your father?

277
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:16,471
Now, come. I will speak
well to your father.

278
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,173
It's all right. I am at your side.

279
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,488
Your magical powers were always
compared with your older sisters,

280
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,649
and you always pouted
in that small boat.

281
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,627
Geez, Lord Wardes!

282
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:38,463
But I always felt an aura from you
unlike any other, even back then.

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,502
An aura unlike any other?

284
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:45,606
There is a special power
that only you have.

285
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,542
That's not true.

286
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,976
I've had only failures in magic so far.

287
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:54,072
Let's get married when this
mission is over, Louise.

288
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,052
We just happened to buy something

289
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,854
from the bargain rack in
the armory, you know?

290
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,622
Even if it was coincidence...

291
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,715
There is no coincidence in this world.

292
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:08,196
You are my partner, and
that's why I'm here.

293
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,931
Isn't that common sense?

294
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,627
Then why didn't you
tell me until now?

295
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,026
Because you didn't ask.

296
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,704
Well, you have a point.

297
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:23,644
The power to freely
wield weapons, huh?

298
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,712
I'll tell you this,

299
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,948
it only applies to things
made to be weapons.

300
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,983
It doesn't work at all for things
made to be ornaments,

301
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,043
like that shiny sword
from the other day.

302
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,591
Then if I wielded you, would I win?

303
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:38,359
Even against that Wardes guy?

304
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,194
Are you stupid? That's all up to you.
I'm only being used.

305
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,896
I don't intend to end as just the
leader of the Magic Guards!

306
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,304
Someday, I would like
to rule a country...

307
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:55,241
No, I want to be a noble that moves
the entire world of Harkeginia!

308
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:59,146
But, such a sudden marriage?

309
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:02,016
I need you, Louise.

310
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,211
But it's so sudden!

311
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:07,781
Louise...

312
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,559
I will protect you.

313
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,831
If something happens,
I'll protect you.

314
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,699
Saito...

315
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,139
No, that's not it.

316
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,943
Saito came here from another
world, not knowing anything,

317
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:31,646
and I was the one that summoned
him. I'm responsible...

318
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:35,049
It looks like someone is starting
to live inside your heart.

319
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,318
It's not like that! That can't be true!

320
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:40,810
It's all right. I won't ask you to
give me an answer right now.

321
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,125
Listen to me, Lord Wardes!

322
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:49,791
By the end of this journey, your
heart shall be completely mine.

323
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,700
Let us rent one more room for now.

324
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,099
Lord Wardes...

325
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,733
Good night, Louise.

326
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:00,333
Good night.

327
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,607
Oh, wait!

328
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:10,718
Sheesh, I was only trying for a kiss.

329
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,686
These mountain girls
are all so innocent.

330
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,269
Then shall we begin, Saito?

331
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,036
Sure.

332
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:29,437
Stop this foolishness!
Sure.

333
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,671
Stop this foolishness!

334
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,140
Nobles are troublesome folk.

335
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,942
"Am I strong or weak?"

336
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,346
It gets on your mind and
you can't help but to move.

337
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:41,148
Saito, this is an order! Stop it!

338
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,951
I can't hold anything back, okay?

339
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,715
No need to hold back.
Come at full strength.

340
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,742
So agile... as I expected.

341
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:20,681
But you are still a novice,
with many openings.

342
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:29,864
Del Wil Sol La Winde.

343
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,297
Look out, partner!

344
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,730
Are you all right, Saito?

345
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:44,711
You can't win against
a real mage with your skills.

346
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:49,742
In other words, you
can't protect Louise.

347
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:11,364
As if I were under a real magic spell

348
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:22,405
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

349
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:34,128
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

350
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:45,198
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

351
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:57,179
My true feelings, the
shards of loneliness

352
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:08,051
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

353
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:14,299
For the day to start from zero

354
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:28,516
Marriage? It's too sudden
