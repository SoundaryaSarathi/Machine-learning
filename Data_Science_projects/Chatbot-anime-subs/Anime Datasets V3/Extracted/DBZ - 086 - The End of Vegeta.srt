00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,190
"Such Regret... ! Vegeta, Pride of
the Saiyans, Dies"

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,120
Damn...

3
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,960
Piccolo-san!

4
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,850
All right, they're very close. My
apologies, I'm coming now!

5
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,940
Something might just become of this!

6
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,810
How dull. You've utterly lost the
will to fight back.

7
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,310
It's a little soon, but maybe I
should finish you off.

8
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,250
So then, the identity of that huge Ki
was Piccolo after all.

9
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,590
S- Son!

10
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,930
Nice. You were brought back here
with the Dragonballs, huh?

11
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,460
Father!

12
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,930
Are you all right now?

13
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Yeah. Thanks to you guys, I've
recovered from all that damage.

14
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,940
You've stuck it out well, Gohan!
Leave it up to me now.

15
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,250
What!?

16
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,620
Leave it up to you? What, are you planning
on taking that freak on by yourself?

17
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,280
Yep.

18
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,960
Father!

19
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,970
Are you really Goku? There's something
different about the way your
Ki has felt up until now.

20
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,240
S- Son!

21
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,140
Is that Son? He's got an unbelievable
strength of Ki.

22
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,910
There's no comparison to
when he was on Earth.

23
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,930
So you're Freeza?

24
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,100
You're much more of a runt
than I'd imagined.

25
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,100
So there's still another one of you scum left?

26
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,210
Vegeta has promised to fight with
me. Don't you interfere!

27
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,950
You... It's like I've seen you before...

28
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,630
K- Kakarrot, it's you...

29
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,980
K- Kakarrot? But that name is Saiyan.

30
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,110
It's him!

31
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,650
Freeza! Get out here!

32
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,650
I won't let you get away with this!

33
00:06:52,010 --> 00:07:01,350
He looks just like that last Saiyan who
opposed me when I destroyed planet Vegeta.

34
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,840
I won't let a single one of you Saiyans live.

35
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,120
Don't you see, you would do well
just to tremble before me.

36
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,950
Maybe so.

37
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,290
H- He's not the same Kakarrot as before...

38
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,300
He's at last climbed over the
wall of his limitations...

39
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,300
W- Which means...

40
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,630
Are you ready, then?

41
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,300
Yeah.

42
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,900
W- What was that? Did Goku
just do something?

43
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,230
Unreal!

44
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,670
Not even I could see that clearly.
He's exceeded Freeza's speed!

45
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,030
Oh, no! Get out of the way, Goku!

46
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,390
It can't be! He deflected every one of
them, and with just one hand!

47
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,900
Freeza, you'd better fight like you mean it!

48
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,750
H- He's the very thing you fear most...

49
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,080
A Super Saiyan!

50
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,760
That's right! The strongest warrior
in the universe, a Super Saiyan!

51
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,760
Freeza, you're finished now!
Serves you right!

52
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,390
Vegeta!

53
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,390
You knew, Vegeta, that I hate such
petty jokes, didn't you?

54
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,570
Vegeta!

55
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,650
Hey! Vegeta was in a state where
he couldn't even move!

56
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,410
There was no reason to finish
him off on purpose!

57
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,410
The Super Saiyan is nothing more
than a frivolous legend.

58
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,090
He wouldn't stop going on about it.
I hate it when people get tedious.

59
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,930
- K- Kakarrot...
- Vegeta!

60
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,770
Are you... still reciting that soft crap?
Are you not a Super Saiyan!?

61
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,780
Wait!

62
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:38,630
You foolish scum! Get cold-hearted!
If you had only discarded your leniency,
you would surely already be...

63
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,890
...a Super Saiyan!

64
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,900
I just don't see how I could act as
cold-hearted as you do.

65
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,910
And as for this Super Saiyan business,
I don't know what you mean.

66
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,400
A- A Super Saiyan is...

67
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:52,390
How wonderful! Look at it, Zarbon-san,
Dodoria-san! Behold such beautiful fireworks!

68
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,400
L- Listen well, Kakarrot...

69
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,080
And here I've pierced his heart.
What nerve. Are you going to keep talking?

70
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:23,430
Your... our planet of birth, Planet Vegeta...
was not destroyed... in a collision with a
giant meteor...

71
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,030
Don't say any more! You're just
hastening your death!

72
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,710
Freeza did it... !

73
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:48,050
This after we Saiyans... served as his
hands and feet... working exactly as
he ordered... !

74
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,730
Everyone besides us was killed... !

75
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,060
Your father... and my father,
the king, as well... !

76
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,410
Freeza... was afraid that as the Saiyans
gathered strength...

77
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,070
a Super Saiyan would be born among us...

78
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,910
Just listen to you.

79
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,750
Vegeta!

80
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,090
l- I beg you... ! Freeza... defeat Freeza... !

81
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:42,100
Please... by your Saiyan hand...

82
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,120
Vegeta...

83
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,800
Has he finally croaked? Well, shall we
reconvene this Show of Terror, then?

84
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,800
For you to cry...

85
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,480
For you to beg of me, must have been
awfully difficult, I bet.

86
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,130
I understand. It wasn't that your fellow
Saiyans had been killed that was
rough on you-

87
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,140
Having to do as he told you must have
been worse than anything you could stand.

88
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,750
I hated you so much...

89
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,920
...but you had your Saiyan pride.

90
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,440
And now I too will share in some of
that pride of yours.

91
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,960
I am a Saiyan raised on Earth!

92
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,120
For all the Saiyans who were killed by you...

93
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,130
...as well as for all the Namekians here...

94
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,740
I am going to beat you!

95
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,080
Such drivel.

96
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,990
Son Goku opens his eyes to his Saiyan pride.

97
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:45,460
Just how great is his terrible anger?

98
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:56,460
