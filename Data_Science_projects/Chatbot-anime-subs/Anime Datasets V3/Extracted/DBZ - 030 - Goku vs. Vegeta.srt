1
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,477
We're going to change
the location of our battle.

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,140
Suit yourself. It will
all end up the same.

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,828
<i>l should have guessed.</i>

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,319
<i>He's following</i>
<i>with confidence to spare.</i>

5
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:58,350
Gohan...

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,452
Hey, Gohan!

7
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:03,182
--Yes?
--Let's hurry back to Kame House.

8
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:13,329
Let's stop worrying about him already.
We've left the fate of the earth up to him.

9
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,536
It's okay, Gohan! I'm sure
Goku will come through for us!

10
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:28,146
Come on, let's go. Show your
mom that you're all right.

11
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,477
Right.

12
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:46,763
All right, there won't be any
people or animals around here.

13
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,453
I see...

14
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:12,287
You've chosen here to be your
gravesite, have you?

15
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,966
You should be thrilled.

16
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,302
A lower-class warrior
such as yourself

17
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:27,703
is about to be toyed around with
by a super-elite, after all.

18
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:37,982
Saiyans have their warrior ratings
examined right after they are born.

19
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:41,486
When they do, the scum that have
lower ratings, such as yourself,

20
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:46,157
are sent off to planets that do not
have terribly formidable opponents.

21
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:47,325
In other words...

22
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,327
You were a left-behind!

23
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:53,031
And as a result,
I was sent to Earth here?

24
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,334
I should be thankful.
But what's more...

25
00:02:56,334 --> 00:03:01,169
Even a left-behind might be able to overcome
an elite, if he tries desperately enough.

26
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,168
An amusing joke.

27
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,116
Now then, allow me to show you
a barrier that you cannot overcome,

28
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,811
no matter how hard you try!

29
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:22,620
What's the matter, Kakarrot!?
You can do better than this, can't you!?

30
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,292
When you defeated Nappa, you had
to have been doing better than this!

31
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,623
Let me see it!

32
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,737
I should have expected as much...

33
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,807
He still ain't
the least bit serious,

34
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:46,436
but his speed and techniques
already surpass my own.

35
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:53,318
Show me what you've got! Or have you
already used up all of your power?

36
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:56,947
You got it.
I'll show you!

37
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,677
<i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

38
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,151
If that's the limit of what you've got,
then I'll be greatly disappointed!

39
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,586
<i>What a powerful bastard!</i>

40
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,931
And yet,

41
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:17,834
even though I'm in this kind of trouble,
I'm starting to get excited.

42
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,628
I don't see a thing.

43
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:44,963
What's the matter?

44
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:47,632
This is because
you got violent with it!

45
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,634
What, are you blaming someone else!?

46
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,636
Well it's the truth!

47
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:54,973
No, no, that's not why, Sis.

48
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,575
It's not because
the crystal ball is broken,

49
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,345
it's because the terribly
fierce power of their <i>Ki</i>

50
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,915
is concealing them from even
the spiritual powers of your crystal ball.

51
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,585
Then, at least they're
still fighting, right?

52
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,253
Probably.

53
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,313
I know! If I use
that thing, I can tell!

54
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,598
How about it?

55
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:23,829
There are two large
readings to the west.

56
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,668
Just two?

57
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:54,799
<i>He's smiling. Has he given up,</i>
<i>and adopted a defiant attitude?</i>

58
00:07:54,799 --> 00:08:00,238
<i>Or is he poised because he can raise</i>
<i>his battle power up even higher?</i>

59
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,907
What's the matter!?
Finished already!?

60
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,543
You seem to be at your limit.

61
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:09,570
In that case, let me show you
something, as your dying gift.

62
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,385
The overwhelming power
of a super-elite Saiyan!

63
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,977
Let's see it!

64
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,153
That smirk of yours is going
to disappear very soon.

65
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:32,429
What a <i>Ki</i>! It's as if
the whole earth is shaking!

66
00:09:55,686 --> 00:10:01,959
<i>As before, images from the site of battle</i>
<i>have been completely broken off.</i>

67
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,564
<i>A</i>- <i>as of now, there is no way for us</i>
<i>to be able to conceive what is happening,</i>

68
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,125
<i>or indeed if it has all ended.</i>

69
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:13,971
" What Will Become of the Earth!?"
<i>Now then, changing the schedule a little,</i>

70
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:18,806
" What Will Become of the Earth!?"
<i>we now join this discussion of</i> " <i>What will</i>
<i>become of the earth, and what is left for us?</i>"

71
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,648
They ultimately don't
know anything, do they?

72
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,984
Hey, if you're going to sleep,
go sleep at home.

73
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,654
Shut up.
Give me another.

74
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:33,488
Eh? That's your tenth one!
Do you have any money?

75
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:39,997
Tenshinhan is dead and all...

76
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:43,489
I don't have any need
for this money anymore.

77
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,773
Hey, are you all right?

78
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:58,082
B- by the way, do you have
a place to stay? If you like-

79
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,283
I can hear it.

80
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,952
W- what?

81
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,622
Can't you hear that sound!?

82
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,182
W- what are you going on about?

83
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,330
H- hey, look!

84
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,195
W- what is that!?

85
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:07,982
T- the crows are fleeing
from something!

86
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,876
It's like there's a typhoon!

87
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:34,305
The trembling of the
atmosphere has stopped.

88
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:37,297
A- all the clouds
have been blown away, too.

89
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:53,256
It's over, Kakarrot!

90
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,168
You fool!
Behind you!

91
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,272
<i>Kaio-ken</i> times two!!

92
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:37,465
All right, nice going.
Way to avoid it.

93
00:14:53,984 --> 00:15:01,948
<i>Damn... What power and speed! I can't</i>
<i>even keep up with him with a 2X Kaio-ken.</i>

94
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:07,420
I guess I ain't got much choice.

95
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,603
Even if I wreck my body,
it's better than dying.

96
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,940
I'll have to raise the <i>Kaio-ken</i> to 3X.

97
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,277
I intentionally made that one
easy to dodge for you.

98
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:24,805
It wouldn't be any fun to have you
die on me so easily, after all.

99
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:39,630
<i>They came close by, so I can't help but</i>
<i>come take a look at 'em, but what's this?</i>

100
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,330
<i>Both Goku and that bastard're so strong,</i>
<i>it's like l'm havin' a bad dream here!</i>

101
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:57,581
<i>Now then, I wonder how long my body will</i>
<i>hold out once I raise the Kaio-ken to 3X...</i>

102
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,919
What's the matter,
Kakarrot!? Come get me!

103
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,926
<i>Either way, I have to do it.</i>
<i>Ain't no way I can win like this.</i>

104
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:13,597
Have you lost everything up your sleeve?
Looks like you picked the wrong opponent.

105
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,935
I was the number-one most powerful
man, even among the Saiyans.

106
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:22,273
No matter how much training you've done,
you're still just a left-behind.

107
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,277
Looks like your time of death
has been extended by only a little bit.

108
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:31,615
<i>T</i>- <i>this is bad. That Saiyan bastard's</i>
<i>overwhelmin'ly got it over him.</i>

109
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:36,954
<i>l'd best be gettin' outta here now,</i>
<i>while I can, huh? Yeah, l'd better get goin'.</i>

110
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,354
<i>lt won't do no good</i>
<i>for me to be here anyhow.</i>

111
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:04,915
May my body withstand this!
<i>Times-three Kaio-ken!!</i>

112
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:10,254
No! You can't go any higher
than 2X, Son Goku!

113
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:14,925
Although, there's definitely
no way he can win like this.

114
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:18,156
I never imagined he'd
have that much strength.

115
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:24,500
He may not be able
to win this fight.

116
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:53,964
W- what's going on?

117
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:56,233
H- has something happened?

118
00:17:56,233 --> 00:18:04,575
I think it's probably Son-<i>kun</i>, but this
battle power reading is rising incredibly...

119
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,910
--Goku!
--Goku-<i>sa</i>!

120
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,938
17,000... 19,000... 21,000...

121
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,316
It can't be!

122
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,831
W- what?

123
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:24,822
<i>lgnoring Kaio's warnings,</i>
<i>Goku uses a times-three Kaio-ken.</i>

124
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:31,660
<i>Will Goku's body be able to withstand</i>
<i>a battle power beyond its limits?</i>
