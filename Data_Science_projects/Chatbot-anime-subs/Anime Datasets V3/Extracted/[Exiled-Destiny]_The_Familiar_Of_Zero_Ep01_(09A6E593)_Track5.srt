1
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,787
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

2
00:00:53,787 --> 00:01:02,456
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

3
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,834
The sky where two moons
never fade away

4
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,878
That's an impossibility, right?

5
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:25,652
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

6
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:31,425
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

7
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:37,887
Even if you trip and
become depressed

8
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:45,494
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

9
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:52,212
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

10
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:58,552
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

11
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:04,491
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

12
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:12,990
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

13
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,464
Zero Louise

14
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,580
Everyone, congratulations on
making it to your second year.

15
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,516
I am Mrs. Chevreuse,
and I have been appointed

16
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,486
to the Tristein Institute
of Magic for the year.

17
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,523
My element is earth, and I am also
known as Chevreuse the Red Moon.

18
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,619
I will be teaching you earth-based
magic for the next year.

19
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,765
Now, everyone, what are the
four major elements of magic?

20
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,164
Ah-hah!

21
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,636
The four elements are Fire,
Water, Air, and Earth!

22
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:54,074
And what coincidence! My element
is Earth, just like you, missus!

23
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,635
Also known as the Brass,
I am Guiche de Grammont!

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,814
Please remember me.

25
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,016
Nice to meet you, Mr. Grammont.

26
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,252
Earth is an important type of magic,

27
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,121
involved in the revitalization
of all things.

28
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,590
In order to demonstrate that to you,

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,753
I will have you memorize
a spell in basic alchemy.

30
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,188
Rel In Yan.

31
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,270
Is that gold?!

32
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,205
No, it's brass.

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,638
Is that it?

34
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,637
I'll have someone try it now.

35
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,011
All right, you. You over there.

36
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,580
What is your name?

37
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,951
Louise.

38
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,923
Louise de la Vallière.

39
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,159
Um, ma'am?

40
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,126
Something the matter?

41
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,686
I think it's better not to...

42
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,864
It's dangerous!

43
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,764
If Louise is going to do it,
I'll do it instead!

44
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,070
Dangerous? How can
alchemy be dangerous?

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,173
I'll do it! Please let me do it!

46
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,140
Well said.

47
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,657
Louise, stop it!

48
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,716
Quiet. You're ruining
my concentration.

49
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,786
Think hard about the metal
that you want to turn this into.

50
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,699
Rel In Yan.

51
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,615
Another year has started
with no particular problems.

52
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,784
Yes, there's nothing better.

53
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:48,847
As the Institute's principal,
I can wish for nothing more.

54
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,989
Oh, brother.

55
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,637
Taking care of your health is part
of my job as secretary, Old Osman.

56
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,708
Are you going to take away one of
this old man's very few pleasures,

57
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,142
Miss Longueville?

58
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,667
Please stop touching my buttocks.

59
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,717
Please also stop acting senile

60
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,981
when you're caught in a bad situation!

61
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,688
Come to think of it, tomorrow is

62
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,316
the familiar summoning ritual
for the second year students!

63
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,287
Damn old geezer.

64
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,397
The familiar is a lifelong
servant and friend,

65
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,059
as well as one's eyes and ears.

66
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,838
My familiar, Motsognir...

67
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,636
It's been a long journey
together with you.

68
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,309
Oh, I see, white! White as snow!

69
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:51,018
I think Miss Longueville'd look
better in black than in white.

70
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,819
Don't you think so?

71
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,987
Old Osman,

72
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,683
if you do it again, I will report it
to the royal family!

73
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,759
Fool!

74
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,095
Don't be so upset just because
someone peeked at your panties!

75
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,655
That's why you haven't been
able to get married yet!

76
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,896
Ouch... I'm sorry, I won't do it
again, really, forgive me...

77
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,840
That was...

78
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,909
I believe it's her again.

79
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,377
You mean the third daughter
of the Vallière family?

80
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,797
This is what I feared!

81
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,131
It looks like I screwed up a little bit.

82
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,732
What?!
It looks like I screwed up a little bit.

83
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,066
What?!

84
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,867
What part of this is a little?

85
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,203
Your success rate to date
has been zero!

86
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,727
Louise the Zero!

87
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,814
Hey, how was it?

88
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,227
Another trip to detention?

89
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,863
Or are you finally expelled?

90
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,852
Just kidding!

91
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,125
I'm not being punished.

92
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,771
Why not?

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,006
They said it was partially
the teacher's fault

94
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,033
for making me do it after all
the students tried to stop her.

95
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,916
I just wasn't doing my best today.

96
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,085
You're always having a bad day!

97
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,188
You can't even get a real byname,
Louise the Zero!

98
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,416
Shut up!

99
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,792
Tomorrow will be a sight!

100
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,057
What kind of familiar will
you be summoning up?

101
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,599
As far as summoning spells...

102
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm confident in Summon Servant,
if nothing else!

103
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,937
Just you watch!

104
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,007
I'll conjure up a familiar so
divine, beautiful, and powerful,

105
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,841
that it will be better than anything
any of you can cook up!

106
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,917
Hey, what do you think, Tabitha?

107
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,579
I don't know.

108
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:14,294
But to think that she would
say it that confidently...

109
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,488
Maybe...

110
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,590
No way.

111
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,231
Is it the appointed time already?

112
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,402
Wait, Styx!

113
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,166
Kirche, it's me, Pelisson.

114
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,171
Oh, no, Styx was coming tomorrow!

115
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,882
I'm sorry, Pelisson,
wait just a minute!

116
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,168
I'm confident in Summon Servant,
if nothing else!

117
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,435
I wish I hadn't said that...

118
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,207
Finally, today is the day
of the summoning ritual.

119
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,551
This is the first test since you
advanced to the second year,

120
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,654
and the sacred first day where
you meet your familiars,

121
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,088
with whom you will spend
your lives as nobles.

122
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:26,967
I'm looking forward to the amazing
familiar you're going to summon!

123
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,264
Leave me alone.

124
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,012
It's a bugbear! Amazing!

125
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,207
Oh, that was splendid.

126
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,687
And if I end up with
some strange familiar,

127
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,589
I'll be embarrassed
for the rest of my life!

128
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:55,118
I'm sure you will summon a cute,
charming familiar, Montmorency!

129
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,030
Of course!

130
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,102
They say that the familiar that's
summoned best suits the summoner!

131
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,004
So someone like me...

132
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,062
Next up?
So someone like me...

133
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,505
That would be me, Guiche
de Grammont, Mr. Colbert.

134
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:15,982
I will now summon the finest familiar
in the history of the Institute.

135
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,618
Then, my fame...

136
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,353
Enough with the small talk.

137
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,055
People are still waiting their turn.

138
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:22,987
Then...

139
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,661
O Bremir, our grand creator
that always guides us...

140
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:32,030
O noble one who will become
a servant of Guiche the Brass!

141
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,969
Answer my divine summons!

142
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,630
Salamander! Kirche summoned that?!

143
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,703
At the end, you obtained quite
the familiar there, Miss Zerbst.

144
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:14,538
It fits my byname, Kirche the Fever.

145
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,314
Now, was that everyone?

146
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,250
No, we still have Miss Vallière to go.

147
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,591
Louise the Zero!

148
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,026
What will she summon?

149
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,661
There's no way she can
summon anything!

150
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,561
We'll just have another
explosion, nothing else!

151
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,766
After all that boasting,

152
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,602
you'll summon something more
amazing than this little guy,

153
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,803
right, Louise?

154
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,134
Of course!

155
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,798
Please...

156
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:52,033
My servant, that exists
somewhere in this universe!

157
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,102
What's with that spell?

158
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,811
Well, it's original.

159
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,313
My divine, beautiful,
and powerful familiar!

160
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,125
I wish and assert from
the bottom of my heart...

161
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,355
Answer my guidance!

162
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,656
Just as expected...

163
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,431
Are you all right, Montmorency?

164
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,531
Something wrong?

165
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,376
A human?!

166
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,454
That outfit... It looks like a peasant...

167
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,184
Yeah. A peasant, no doubt about it.

168
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:45,358
This is divine, beautiful,
and powerful?

169
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,266
Who are you?

170
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,168
What was that? Where am I?

171
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,217
You don't understand our language?

172
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,377
Where are you from, peasant?

173
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,788
English? No, it isn't...

174
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,085
Besides...

175
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:15,261
Nothing less from someone
who put up a huge front!

176
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,094
To think that you would
summon up a peasant!

177
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,402
I just made a small mistake!

178
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,204
Nothing less from Louise the Zero!

179
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,229
A result that meets
everyone's expectations!

180
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,543
Hey, wait...

181
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,911
Shut up!

182
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,146
Mr. Colbert.

183
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,180
What is it?

184
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,410
Can I try summoning again?

185
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,218
I can't allow that.

186
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,385
Why?

187
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,156
This ritual is a sacred one that
decides the mage's entire life.

188
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:47,393
Trying a second time is blasphemy
against the ritual itself!

189
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,296
Whether you like it or not,

190
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,491
this boy has been chosen
as your familiar.

191
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,168
I don't know what he's talking about,

192
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,762
but from what they're wearing,
these guys all are really crazy.

193
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,541
But I've never heard of using
a peasant boy as a familiar!

194
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,679
I will not allow any exceptions,
peasant boy or not.

195
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,446
Continue on with the ritual.

196
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,680
With this?

197
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,228
Hurry up, or you will
really be expelled!

198
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,354
Yeah! You heard it!

199
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,288
All right...

200
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,661
What is it?!

201
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,926
Go for it, Louise!

202
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,808
Be thankful for this.

203
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:38,539
Normally a noble would never
do this with a peasant boy!

204
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:44,247
My name is Louise Françoise
Le Blanc de La Vallière.

205
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,821
Pentagon that rules the five powers,

206
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,591
bless this individual, and
make him my familiar!

207
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,218
What is she doing?!

208
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,528
Come on, stay still!

209
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,830
Hold on...

210
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,359
What, uh, wait...

211
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,409
It seems Contract Servant
has ended peacefully.

212
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,747
Hey! What did that thing
right now mean?!

213
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,725
My body's getting hot...

214
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,716
What did you do to me?!

215
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,762
It will be over soon.

216
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,398
It's just the rune of the familiar
being burned onto you.

217
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,330
What?!

218
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,015
What was that dream just now?

219
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,683
So you've finally woken up.

220
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,695
It wasn't a dream!

221
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,331
I thought about it long enough
to get an ulcer.

222
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,001
But I've given up. I'm going
to have you as my familiar.

223
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,468
Be honored.

224
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,906
Where in the world have
I been taken away to?!

225
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,364
Take me back home! If you're
not going to take me back...

226
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,022
Wash those.

227
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,424
Even if you don't understand
our language,

228
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,891
a familiar can understand that much.

229
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,696
What is this...

230
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,998
You don't even understand
your master's orders?

231
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,602
If he can't understand an order,
he's worse than a dog.

232
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,071
Hey, why are you trying
to seduce me?!

233
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,339
In the first place, who are you?

234
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,610
Oh, be quiet! All you do is chirp!

235
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,414
Right, silencing magic.
I learned it last year!

236
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,574
This must be some bad dream!

237
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,984
Get me out of this dream,
and back on the 'net!

238
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,619
Let's see...

239
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,889
Ansur Ver Ang.

240
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,383
Notice the tracks, and
answer my requests!

241
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,436
Strange...

242
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,836
What was that just now?

243
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,376
I held back 'cause you're cute,

244
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,011
but if I have to use force...

245
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,002
I understand! I understood that!

246
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,907
Did you just say, I understand?

247
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,545
Say something.

248
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,658
What, so you can speak Japanese?

249
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,957
What does this mean?
I cast a spell of silence...

250
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,530
Another failure.

251
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,199
You, what's your name?

252
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,502
Me? My name is Hiraga Saito.

253
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,803
Hiragasaito?

254
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,173
But before that, why am I here?

255
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,710
I summoned you, of course.

256
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,545
As a familiar, right?

257
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,773
A familiar?!

258
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,196
This is it!

259
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,061
But it can't be...

260
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,924
As a precaution, I will have
to inform the principal.

261
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,672
So, it's like this...

262
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,574
This is the kingdom of Tristein,
on the continent Harkeginia?

263
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,780
And you're a student in
the Institute of Magic.

264
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,181
I won't allow a familiar
to call me "you".

265
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,021
My name is Louise.
Louise de la Vallière.

266
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,511
Yeah, right, right.

267
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,927
So, Louise, I'm this familiar
that you summoned.

268
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,663
That thing that all
sorcerers tote around.

269
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,427
That much I know from
movies and manga.

270
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,637
Why is my familiar a peasant boy?!

271
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:02,199
I wanted something cool
like a dragon or a griffon!

272
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,568
Hiragasaito?

273
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,844
A familiar ran away?! You're kidding!

274
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,522
I don't know if it's a new cult,
or some fantasy novel maniac,

275
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,490
but I can't stay here any longer!

276
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,562
I'm good at baking soufflés.

277
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,501
I would love to try one.

278
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,769
Really?!

279
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,071
Of course, Ketty.

280
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,774
I wouldn't lie to your eyes.

281
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,576
Lord Guiche!

282
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:40,137
There is nothing hidden
behind my feelings for you.

283
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,684
Isn't that the peasant
that Louise summoned?

284
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,946
Oh, crap!

285
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,688
In today's ritual?

286
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,257
It caused quite a stir among
the first year students as well.

287
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,594
He had suddenly fainted
and stopped moving,

288
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,528
so it was quite troublesome for us.

289
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,564
Hold on, you.

290
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,532
Yes?

291
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,301
A peasant putting a noble to trouble,

292
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,962
and not even a word of thanks?

293
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,140
Oh, was that so? Well, thanks.

294
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,767
Then I'll be seeing you!

295
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,769
Irritating jerk.

296
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,202
Oh, no!

297
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,606
A restless fellow.

298
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,784
Louise, your familiar just passed by.

299
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,523
Catch him.

300
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,292
He ran away.

301
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,628
The familiar with whom
you sealed a contract?

302
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,330
Nothing less from
your familiar, Louise.

303
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,665
Common sense doesn't apply to it.

304
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,724
Don't be impressed by it, help me!

305
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,601
I've no choice.

306
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:42,607
Being with you all alone like this
is like a dream, Kirche the Fever.

307
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,007
It looks like tonight won't end
with just a fever.

308
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,680
All right, an exit!

309
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,690
That guy... He's the one
that Louise the Zero...

310
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,215
Yes, the peasant familiar.

311
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,161
Oh, he's over there!

312
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,129
Right.

313
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,765
Hey, what are you guys doing?

314
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,134
Oh, just listen to this!

315
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,364
Knock it off! He's getting away!

316
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,774
What was that about magic?!

317
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,605
I gotta hurry out of this crazy place...

318
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,150
Help me! I'm gonna fall!

319
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,311
Just give yourself up.

320
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,123
This is the second time
that I've kept you afloat.

321
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,026
Is this for real?!

322
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,859
A familiar that runs from his master?

323
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,030
It's just too funny!

324
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,169
Then this is...

325
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,667
You're kidding me!

326
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:11,760
As if I were under a real magic spell

327
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:22,631
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

328
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:34,353
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

329
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:45,423
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

330
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:57,405
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

331
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:08,277
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

332
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:14,688
For the day to start from zero

333
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,408
Peasant or dog, now that
you're my familiar,

334
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,933
be prepared for some
really hard training!

335
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,979
Wait, what are you doing?!

336
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,948
Dueling against a noble?!
