1
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:22,480
Yeah, that's right, short stuff,
do as much as you can.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,747
I, ReaCoom-<i>san</i>, will let you
match up against me, okay?

3
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,581
Darn it!

4
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,508
Ultimately, we're not
going to get a turn, huh?

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,510
That's okay.

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,948
Taking out those two runts wouldn't
give us anything to boast about anyhow.

7
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,608
G- Gohan...

8
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,141
That's pretty good.

9
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,234
How about this, though?

10
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,243
All righty...

11
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:47,090
<i>Masenko!!</i>

12
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:03,114
Did you see that?

13
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:07,448
Yeah, for just a second,
his battle power was over 20,000.

14
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,045
Gohan...

15
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:35,480
Wow, you're good, you're good.
You made my handsies smart.

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,573
Now then...

17
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,754
Take this!

18
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,770
G- Gohan!

19
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:07,278
Oh, my. Is something the matter,
Goku-<i>chan</i>'s wife?

20
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:11,374
Gohan-<i>chan</i> is in a terrible fix.

21
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,454
Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

22
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,456
My Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

23
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:24,554
Cheer up, Missus. Gohan-<i>chan</i>
will be fine. My Bulma said so.

24
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,133
Is it ready!?

25
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:32,137
Oh, is that you, Chichi-<i>san</i>? Have a look
at how wonderfully this is turning out.

26
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:36,474
You wouldn't think that I put it
together in just two days, would you?

27
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,477
I'll tell you, this second one
was a lot easier than the last one.

28
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,913
I even nailed down the right
location for the speakers.

29
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,751
All I need to do now
is a test flight.

30
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:53,491
Just you wait, Gohan!
Ma is comin' to save you right now!

31
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:57,757
Hey, Chichi-<i>san</i>, won't you let me
explain how to use it before you go!?

32
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:03,265
Just which one of these
is the startin' switch!?

33
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,033
Hey, just a minute, I say!

34
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,379
G- Gohan!

35
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,732
There, didn't I tell you so?

36
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,561
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

37
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,237
Still alive?

38
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,587
Good, good!

39
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,121
Magnificent, Ginyu-<i>san</i>.

40
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:35,460
I would not have expected you to bring me
all seven Dragon Balls so quickly.

41
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,465
It was worth it to call in
the Ginyu Special Corps, all right.

42
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:45,470
It gives me, Ginyu, no greater joy
than to have you say so, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

43
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,642
This means that I am about
to acquire eternal life.

44
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,810
What wonderful joy.

45
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,746
If you would like, shall I
dance the dance of joy?

46
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,758
P- perhaps you could
do that next time.

47
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,589
Really?

48
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:14,766
Who would have thought the immortal
youth I dreamed about would come true?

49
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:18,436
Even I, of all people,
am starting to get excited.

50
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,538
The birth of the perfect and everlasting

51
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,442
ruler of the universe is about
to happen, isn't that right?

52
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:30,711
Now, Dragon Balls, give me,
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, eternal life and youth!

53
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,800
<i>W</i>- <i>what was that?</i>

54
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,234
<i>l've got an odd feeling of uneasiness.</i>

55
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,250
<i>No doubt about it,</i>

56
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,584
<i>the hands of evil will be extended toward</i>
<i>Grand Elder-sama in the very near future!</i>

57
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:19,924
<i>Forgive me, Earthlings. I have</i>
<i>a duty to protect Grand Elder-sama!</i>

58
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,782
Darn it...

59
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,290
Father!

60
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,443
You got up, did you?

61
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,604
You got up, you got up!

62
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:54,792
I won't be beaten.
Not by you.

63
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:58,284
I won't... be beaten...

64
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:36,763
What have we here? Did you
mean for that to be an attack?

65
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:10,802
N- nothing is happening, huh?
Have you become immortally young yet?

66
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:14,397
N- no, I do not believe so.

67
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,910
W- why?

68
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:26,484
<i>G</i>- <i>go on, take it.</i>

69
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:28,920
<i>Even if you do get</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls together,</i>

70
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,491
<i>you guys won't be able to get</i>
<i>your wish granted anyhow.</i>

71
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:39,430
As I recall, when I took the second
Dragon Ball, that is what the Namekian said.

72
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:44,268
I thought he was just
being a poor loser.

73
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,608
" You guys." That is exactly
what he said. " You guys."

74
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,514
There has to be some sort
of passcode for these!

75
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:01,786
A secret passcode to grant wishes,
that only the Namekians know!

76
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,123
A password! A place! Or perhaps
a way of arranging the Balls!

77
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,793
We will have to ask
a Namekian for it.

78
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,389
A Namekian? Are there any of them
still surviving anywhere?

79
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,143
T- this reading is from
Vegeta and company.

80
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,814
It's possible that Vegeta
or the others know what it is.

81
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,410
I- in that case, I must stop
my men from killing Vegeta!

82
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:41,158
Have a look at Point 8829401.

83
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:45,424
There are two readings which
I believe could be Namekians.

84
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,927
There is also a reading
that is approaching that point.

85
00:11:53,838 --> 00:12:00,111
We have not once attacked this area,
so they must be survivors, yes?

86
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:05,449
Well then, I will go there at once and force
them to tell me how to get a wish granted.

87
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:09,715
That will not be necessary.
I will go ask them directly.

88
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:17,461
After all, I am more accustomed
to dealing with these people.

89
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:22,133
Ginyu-<i>san</i>, please stay here
and keep watch over the Dragon Balls.

90
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:26,069
Yes, sir, understood.
Please leave everything to me.

91
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,410
Now, to go flying...

92
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:46,422
I won't be beaten...

93
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,096
G- Gohan...

94
00:12:54,165 --> 00:13:01,772
I have to... defeat you guys...
for Piccolo-<i>san</i>... Yamucha-<i>san</i>...

95
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:06,777
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>... Chaozu-<i>san</i>...

96
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:10,213
Or I can't bring anyone back to life!

97
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:21,792
All right, here I come!

98
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,728
<i>ReaCoom Bomber!!</i>

99
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:50,784
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go!

100
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,930
Whoops, I'm over here!

101
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,554
Have you finally
reached your limit?

102
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,755
D- don't get up anymore, Gohan...

103
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,866
Darn it...

104
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:34,387
I- I am... Father's...

105
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:41,558
...S- Son Goku's... son...

106
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:47,138
You wont... you won't...

107
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:52,143
Oho, you still have enough energy left
to be spouting that sort of nonsense, huh?

108
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:55,738
I don't know what planet you're from,
kid, but this is surprising.

109
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,752
Your opponent is too much for you, huh?

110
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,246
I won't be beaten!!

111
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,360
Whoa!

112
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,760
He's just about ready to croak.
He doesn't have any battle power left.

113
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,594
Of course not.
His neck has been broken.

114
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,255
Gohan!

115
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:32,933
P- pathetic little brat... And here
I thought he'd gotten a little better...

116
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,439
Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

117
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,786
Yo, are you awake?

118
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,619
Are you all right, Missus?

119
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:54,465
Gohan-<i>chan</i> is... Gohan-<i>chan</i> is-!

120
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:59,459
Oh, my...

121
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:04,301
Sheesh...

122
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,979
These guys were all
just worthless scum.

123
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:14,918
I don't understand why Freeza-<i>sama</i> expressly
called in the Ginyu Special Corps for this.

124
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:21,585
Well, nonetheless, I guess I should
finish off all three of them.

125
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,920
What's that?

126
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:36,266
It's a ship. It's landing.

127
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,124
<i>At last, Goku had touched down.</i>

128
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:35,587
<i>Goku, rescue the desperate Gohan and friends</i>
<i>from the devilish hands of ReaCoom!</i>
