1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,700
Apprehension of Spring

17
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,000
The town I was born in.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
The house I was born in.

19
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,200
My father and brother.

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
It's like I just met them for the first time,

21
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
but they're very nostalgic people.

22
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Good morning, brother!

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Brother!

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,700
Brother! Wait up!

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm home.

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,100
Welcome back, brother.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,900
<i>nitsuke = japanese boiled and seasoned food</i>
Isn't this nitsuke delicious?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,900
Yeah.

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
My mother taught me how to make it.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Brother!

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Eh?

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
Let's go to the amusement park together again!

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,200
Somehow, everything looks like it's sparkling.

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,400
A younger sister...?

35
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Good morning, brother!

36
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Umm...

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
What do you do for lunch usually?

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,500
<i>bento = packed lunch</i>
I made a bento today.

39
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
If it's alright with you, would you take it with you?

40
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,400
Brother?

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Brother!

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Brother...

43
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Eh? And then?

44
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,000
He said he was anemic...

45
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,500
Is he sickly?

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
His complexion hasn't been too good lately.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Hmm...

48
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
I want to...

49
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,500
become...

50
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,400
closer to...

51
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,400
my brother.

52
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
You don't get along with him?

53
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,200
That's not it, but...

54
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,200
But he seems uncomfortable.

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
It can't be helped if he's twelve years older than you.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,100
But... more...

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,700
since we're siblings.

58
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,700
The fire of envy is burning wildly within my heart...

59
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Thanks for the meal!

60
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
That idiot...!

61
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, I guess I'll head home.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,300
Good work.

63
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
You should hurry up and go home early too.

64
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Isn't your cute little sister waiting?

65
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
That's why I don't want to...

66
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,000
Have her make you a meal full of love!

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Like the bento from lunch!

68
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Shut up!

69
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,600
There's nothing to worry about!

70
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,500
I'll take care of your membership entrance!

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Umm... I'm not interested...

72
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
You are...

73
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,700
Glasses...

74
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
Glasses...?

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Brother!

76
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,700
You!

77
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
I came to visit.

78
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,000
So she says.

79
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,500
Why don't we all go out and eat together?

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,100
Hurry and finish up your work.

81
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Dad said he would be late today so we should go out and eat.

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,100
Brother, what would you like to eat...

83
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Hey! Koushiro!

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,500
Idiot! Why did you come all the way here?!

85
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,400
Because...

86
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,100
Listen, I don't want you to ever come to my office again!

87
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,400
Understand?

88
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Brother...

89
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,100
Did I...

90
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey, brother...

91
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,500
And stop calling me brother!

92
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Then...

93
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Then what should I call you?

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Hey...

95
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,500
It was a chance to become close to a female high school student lawfully.

96
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,800
He was such a jerk!

97
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
He went off to work early by himself.

98
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,600
Didn't you say you wanted to be closer yesterday?

99
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm so disappointed.

100
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
In truth...

101
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,200
I want to play with him and have him help me with homework...

102
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,400
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

103
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,300
Aren't most siblings like that?

104
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,000
All I do is fight with my older sister.

105
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,700
I didn't think he was so mean!

106
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm never going to call my brother "brother" again!

107
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Now, now.

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,700
Then why don't we go have some fun after school...

109
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
and let out all our feelings!

110
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,400
Okay?

111
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah!

112
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Poor girl.

113
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,400
She visited you because she wanted to be closer to you.

114
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
That attitude was uncalled for, wasn't it?

115
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,300
Shut up! I know that already.

116
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Then what?

117
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,700
What do you not like about her?

118
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
It's nothing.

119
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,100
It's not like I dislike her.

120
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
When she's in front of me,

121
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,700
it just makes me want to run away.

122
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,100
What's wrong with you?

123
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Did you go crazy after you got your heart broken?

124
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,200
I forgot...

125
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,400
I forgot about it... completely.

126
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
Damn it!

127
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,100
It's so sweet! This is so delicious!

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Isn't it, isn't it?

129
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,100
Chocolate caramel ice cream is definitely the best!

130
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Yeah!

131
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Nanoka, you don't know much about the stores around here, right?

132
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Let's go shopping together next time.

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
I'll show you around!

134
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah!

135
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
Hey, Futaba-chan!

136
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
What's up?

137
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
You're eating it again?

138
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
You sure love the ice cream from this place.

139
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,700
She went to the same junior high as me.

140
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm Tamaki Youko from class 4. Nice to meet you.

141
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm Kohinata Nanoka, nice to meet you too.

142
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,100
Hey, I was going to go karaoke with my friends, so...

143
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
do you guys want to come along too?

144
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm home.

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,500
What are you doing?

146
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,700
Nanoka said...

147
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,100
on the phone that she's going to be late.

148
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
What?

149
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She contacted you, so it's fine.

150
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
You idiot!

151
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Right now, Nanoka could be surrounded by strange men and might get kidnapped!

152
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,500
If something like that happens...

153
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,000
I... I'll...

154
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,300
You're overreacting.

155
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
Ah! I sang a lot!

156
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,300
It was so much fun!

157
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
I feel so refreshed.

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
It's gotten kind of late, huh?

159
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
Are you okay, Nanoka?

160
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
I called them just in case.

161
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,600
Let's go again next time!

162
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Yeah!

163
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,100
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

164
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,400
See you! Bye!

165
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Try to make up with your brother.

166
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
This is the Saeki residence.

167
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
This is Nanoka.

168
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,700
Are you stupid?!

169
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,600
What have you been doing until this hour?

170
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Um... no...

171
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,900
Where are you right now?

172
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
At the public phone outside the park.

173
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Why did you pass through such a place?

174
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't you know there are many perverts around there?

175
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,800
I got it!

176
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
I was just going to tell you I'm heading home right now!

177
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,000
Bye!

178
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,400
Hey! Hello?

179
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
What's with him?!

180
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
He's so arrogant!

181
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,200
I was feeling down...

182
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,900
I know now...

183
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,900
That time...

184
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,100
I didn't know why you cried that time, but...

185
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,900
thanks to that, I didn't have to cry.

186
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Even if I remember about the guy I used to like,

187
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm all right now.

188
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,400
But...

189
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Why does it have to be like this?

190
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Get on.

191
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
No thanks.

192
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,900
Who do you think I came out here for?

193
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,800
Hurry up and get on.

194
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Brother, you just did that on your own!

195
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Fine...

196
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Call me whatever you wish.

197
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,300
Dad is worried about you,

198
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,600
let's hurry up and go home.

199
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm leaving.

200
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Okay.

201
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Brother?

202
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
What?

203
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Nothing...

204
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,200
As for me,

205
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I was getting irritated from still feeling uncomfortable.

206
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
She's my younger sister.

207
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,300
So this is fine.

208
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,900
This is normal, and ordinary.

209
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,800
I continued pedaling as if to tell myself that.

210
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,550
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

211
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,580
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

212
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,480
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

213
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,950
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

214
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,040
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

215
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,440
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

216
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,020
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

217
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,270
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

218
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,710
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

219
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:34,510
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

220
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,920
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

221
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,290
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

222
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,790
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

223
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,910
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

224
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,700
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

225
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,370
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

226
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,130
Chidori goes

227
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,000
I do not intend to misuse the Marriage Consultation office.

228
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I just want to innocently and lawfully become friends with female high school students!

229
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,100
Punishment - Hiding Glasses.

230
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Glasses...
