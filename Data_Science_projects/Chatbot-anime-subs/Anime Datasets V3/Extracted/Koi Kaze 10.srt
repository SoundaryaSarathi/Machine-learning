00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,200
I want to touch her.

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,200
I want to hold her tight.

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
I want to be closer to her.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
No...

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,000
I am such a pervert.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,400
No!

22
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,200
Wintry moon

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,400
It's not like I wanted to hurt her.

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
Good morning!

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,100
Good morning.

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Is she... still sleeping?

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Nanoka already left.

28
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
She wanted to leave early today.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,500
I see...

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Come on, let's eat.

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,600
She won't even give me a chance to apologize, huh?

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,900
No, maybe there isn't even a need for that anymore.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
If I just disappear from her life, won't that solve everything?

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Don't say it!

35
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
You love me like a sister would love her brother.

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Saying that you love your sibling like that...

37
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Something's wrong with you.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,000
I know that it's strange.

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,100
I got a bit ahead of myself.

40
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,600
"What do you think of me?"

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,600
I shouldn't have asked such a shameless question.

42
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,600
But then, why did he...?

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,600
You're moving? Why?

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
A man your age living in your parent's home...

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,900
I was so envious of your situation.

46
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Stuff happened.

47
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,800
You... do understand how busy the office is during this season.

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,800
We got a Christmas party, and end of the year party, a New Year's party,

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,400
and in just a few more weeks there's going to be a Valentine's party.

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,700
In other words, it's going to be a hellish time of party planning.

51
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,300
And you say you're moving tomorrow?!

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
A lot happened.

53
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
So I guess you've already found your apartment?

54
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,600
Not yet.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Any likely targets?

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,900
None.

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Well, what are you going to do?

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Who knows?

59
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Then decide now while we're working outside!

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,200
Hey, stop.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,100
What do you think?

62
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
If there are any conditions you want, let's hear it.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,500
But I believe there's enough to suit you in here already.

64
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,900
Yeah.

65
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,500
It's fine, isn't it?

66
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,700
It's close to the station and there's a convenience store right there, so shopping should be easy too.

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,500
This place is closer to the office than my home.

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It's a very convenient apartment.

69
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,000
Why do we have to decide on your conditions?

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Can he move in tomorrow?

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Sure. If I have the deposit and take care of some paperwork,

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500
then I'll be able to talk with the landlord.

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Paperwork as in...?

74
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,500
At the very least, the lease contract.

75
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,200
I can wait for the guarantor's seal until tomorrow though.

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,100
And if that's the case...

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,100
Nanoka!

78
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I thought you went home already.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
And what are you gazing at by yourself?

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm not gazing at anything in particular.

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,600
That's such a stupid answer.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,300
Did something happen?

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
You've seemed so lifeless since this morning.

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm fine.

85
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
It's just that I don't really feel like going home.

86
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,200
That's not "fine" at all, then!

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Let's play games as much as we want!

88
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,500
Let's listen to CDs as much as we want!

89
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's eat snacks as much as we want!

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
And can also chit-chat as much as we want.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,100
So cheer up, okay?

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Yeah.

93
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,200
Hello Nanoka-chan.

94
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
Hello.

95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,500
What's up with this room?

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,900
You should clean this place up.

97
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,300
Stop being so noisy.

98
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
I know, I will, so just shut up, sis.

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,200
You never do it when no one tells you to.

100
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,700
Geez, Nanoka and I have something important to talk about.

101
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,900
It's a complicated issue that you'll never get,sis.

102
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>fukuzatsu = complicated, fuku = clothing</i>
Speaking of clothing, let me borrow that blue shirt.

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,800
You said you gave it to me and would never wear it again!

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,100
I changed my mind now. Hand it back.

105
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,200
That's so cheap!

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
Monster! Devil!

107
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Are you sure it's okay?

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,300
Huh? You're moving tomorrow, right?

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
You'll be busy with this and that, right?

110
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,700
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
I'll make sure I pay you back.

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, what happened?

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
It's nothing.

114
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,300
You wouldn't be running away in the middle of the night if it really was "nothing".

115
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,800
Don't say such cynical things.

116
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,700
But what you're doing is pretty much a night flight.

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I guess so.

118
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,800
Thanks for your work.

119
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Thanks for your work.

120
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,200
What's up with him...?

121
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
One more time!

122
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's cheap! Loser goes out!

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Give it to me!

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sis, you're being so mean.

126
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,700
All right! All right!

127
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,200
This person is going to become a bride next year.

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Can you believe it?

129
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Really?

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, pretty much.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Annual tribute...

132
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
She's...

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
She's...?

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,700
<i>Japanese idiom for getting married</i>
She's finally going to pay her annual tribute.

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Have you girls found guys yet?

136
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, it's the best time for "it".

137
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,200
"It" meaning pure love relationships.

138
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
Saying that while your marriage got arranged...

139
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,800
I just meant for relationship purposes.

140
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,400
There's much more to think about when it comes to marriage.

141
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,900
Don't you marry someone because you like him?

142
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
I like my fiancé, of course.

143
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,500
But just liking him isn't enough for this arrangement.

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,500
There are various constraints in reality.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,100
And then you come to the point where you ask "is this really okay?"

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
Of course it'll be good.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,400
With you gone, this place will be so much more peaceful!

148
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
Yes, yes, I know.

149
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,650
Was that a call from her?

150
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,150
A-ah, yeah, sorry.

151
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,150
S-she said she's staying at a friend's house or something.

152
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,450
I see.

153
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,950
What's the matter?

154
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,450
Nothing.

155
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,550
Hey, I'm...

156
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,450
I'll get it.

157
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
Hello, this is the Saeki's.

158
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,250
Hello.

159
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,650
Y-yo...

160
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,150
What's up?

161
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,750
I'll be staying at Futaba-chan's home tonight.

162
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,750
O-okay...

163
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,250
Dad just told me that.

164
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,250
And I also said that I'll be back before noon tomorrow.

165
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,550
But I think I'll stay here a bit longer, so...

166
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,950
I see.

167
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,650
-You know...
-I...

168
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,850
-Sorry.
-What?

169
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,150
Brother.

170
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,850
You're not angry?

171
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,250
About what?

172
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,550
About me asking what you thought about me.

173
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,250
We'll be eating first, then.

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,350
O-okay.

175
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
I asked you such a strange thing.

176
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,350
Ah, you did?

177
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,350
Yeah.

178
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,050
And then you said... I was weird.

179
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,350
Of course I didn't mean it.

180
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,450
But...

181
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,150
You're not weird and I'm not angry.

182
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,150
Really?

183
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,050
Yeah. That aside...

184
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,550
I should be the one apologizing for doing that to you...

185
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,750
Sorry, I know it's my fault.

186
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,850
I don't really care about that.

187
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,850
But...

188
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,350
Just a bit, though.

189
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,350
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,650
But, I don't really care that much about it.

191
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,350
I see.

192
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,950
I'm glad.

193
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,750
Same here.

194
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,150
To be able to talk with you.

195
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,250
Yeah.

196
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,550
Oh yeah, I...

197
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,550
Yeah?

198
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,550
No, nothing.

199
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,250
What is it?

200
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,550
I said nothing.

201
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,750
But I want to know.

202
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,950
Really, it's nothing.

203
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,050
Brother.

204
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,450
I...

205
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,250
Maybe I'll call off staying over here tonight.

206
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,650
What are you talking about? I'm hanging up.

207
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,050
Okay.

208
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,850
See you.

209
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,850
Okay.

210
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,150
The food's going to be gone!

211
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,650
Sis, you eat too much.

212
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,650
It's all right, I made these myself.

213
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,150
You won't be able to wear your wedding dress at this rate.

214
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,950
I'm still fine.

215
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,350
The say, "One second of negligence, one lifetime of obesity".

216
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,950
You too.

217
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,050
Nanoka?

218
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,150
What's the matter? Got no appetite?

219
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,250
Or does the food look nasty?

220
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,650
What did you say?!

221
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,950
Of course not.

222
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,350
Then eat up! It's delicious.

223
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,950
That's right. Hey Futaba, grab some for her.

224
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,950
I know already!

225
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,850
But man, it's not like I'm saying no to you living alone.

226
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,250
I know this came out of the blue.

227
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,250
I'm sorry for saying this all of a sudden.

228
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,950
What are you not satisfied with?

229
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,450
Nothing like that.

230
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,050
That can't be!

231
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,850
Or else you wouldn't say you want to move out all of a sudden.

232
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,350
Well, I've been thinking about it for a while.

233
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,450
What is this? Just be sincere and tell me the truth.

234
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,950
Is there anything you're not content with about me?

235
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,250
Or did something happen between you and Nanoka?

236
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,950
No...

237
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,550
What's the matter?

238
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,950
I just felt like coming back.

239
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,550
I came back.

240
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,350
What do you mean you're moving out?

241
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,050
Here.

242
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,450
Thanks.

243
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,450
Come in.

244
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,250
What's the matter?

245
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,650
Can we... sleep together?

246
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,250
I want to be with you.

247
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,350
At least for today.

248
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,450
Hey! Hold it for a second!

249
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,950
I am strange... after all.

250
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,650
Even though we're siblings, I...

251
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,250
I'm saying such selfish things.

252
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,050
It's not strange.

253
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,850
It's fine because we're siblings.

254
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,650
Stuff like this... in reality.

255
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,950
Then why are you moving out, brother?

256
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,950
You know.

257
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,850
I don't.

258
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,150
You should.

259
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,150
Let's make a promise, tonight's the last time.

260
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,650
We won't meet again.

261
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,050
Why?

262
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,250
Why are you saying such things?

263
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,150
That's strange.

264
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,350
Things like "the last time"...

265
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,250
You're not going somewhere that far.

266
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,250
That's strange,

267
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,050
even though we're siblings.

268
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,250
Yeah, even though we're siblings.

269
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,250
I...

270
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,850
I always had something I wanted to say, but couldn't.

271
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,350
You remember when we rode on the ferris wheel?

272
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,250
Even though I wasn't really sure back then,

273
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,350
the truth is..

274
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,150
I was very happy that moment.

275
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,150
That's why at this rate, I...

276
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,460
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

277
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,490
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

278
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,390
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

279
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,860
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

280
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,950
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

281
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,350
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

282
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,930
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

283
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,180
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

284
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,620
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

285
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,420
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

286
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,830
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

287
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

288
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

289
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,820
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

290
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,610
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

291
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,280
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

292
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,830
Play games, listen to music, eat snacks,

293
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,180
play games again and chit-chat cheerfully!

294
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,030
Master Takahashi's punishment!
