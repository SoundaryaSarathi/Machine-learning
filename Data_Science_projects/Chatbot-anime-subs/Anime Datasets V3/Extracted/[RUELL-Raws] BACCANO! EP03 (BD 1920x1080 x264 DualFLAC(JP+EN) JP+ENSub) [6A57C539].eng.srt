1
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,154
Deal with it.

2
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,007
Find him, and bring him here.

3
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,495
And the item?

4
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:15,938
It's safe.

5
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:20,108
However, your wife and daughter are aboard.

6
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:21,332
What's the Rail Tracer?

7
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,620
The people, you see... they all disappear...

8
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,256
And the very existence
of that train just vanishes...

9
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,500
All right, all right!

10
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:13,801
Miss, it's not healthy for you
to get too much sea breeze.

11
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,141
Thank you, Benjamin-<i>san</i>, but...

12
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,181
Okay, take it up!

13
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:24,062
I want to wait here
a little longer... just a little longer.

14
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,147
Miss...

15
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,782
<i>Big Brother Dallas...</i>

16
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,223
Welcome!

17
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:05,508
My name is Nicholas, and
I run the English edition desk here.

18
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:09,231
My, my, you gentlemen
are from the Runorata Family,

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,442
under Mr. Gustavo, are you not?

20
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,612
How did you know?

21
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:19,217
Because I am an employee
of the <i>Daily Days</i> newspaper.

22
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:24,073
As information brokers, there isn't
a single thing that we do not know.

23
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:29,072
Then we'll move this along.
Do you know a punk named Dallas Genoard?

24
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:34,118
Yes, Dallas Genoard is the second
son of the renowned Genoard family,

25
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:37,552
a notorious juvenile delinquent,
who is currently missing.

26
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,332
Tell us where he is,
no matter how trivial the details are.

27
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,598
500 dollars.

28
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,016
What?

29
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,936
That information will cost 500 dollars, cash.

30
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,968
Further, you will trade me
one piece of information about yourselves.

31
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:52,377
Information?

32
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:55,484
I would like you to tell me

33
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,823
why the Runorata Family is after Dallas Genoard.

34
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,908
What will you do if we tell you?

35
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,938
What good is an information broker
that has no information?

36
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:10,140
If we tell you, and someone
comes in to buy that information...

37
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,213
We'd sell it to them, of course.
That is our business, after all.

38
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,259
Why, you! You think we're just
going to stand here and let you--

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,811
Excuse us.

40
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,145
With the nature of our business,
things can get rough.

41
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:33,816
Now then, what is your purpose
in looking for Dallas Genoard?

42
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,153
Why, you!

43
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:47,863
You got a problem, kid?

44
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:52,376
Look here.
I am in the care of the Runorata Family.

45
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,963
A punk-ass like you
can't afford to go against--

46
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,511
Runorata?!

47
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:02,958
Where do you get off talking so big?

48
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,883
You guys are like employees to us!

49
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:09,128
Ingratiate yourselves to
my pop and brother, will you?!

50
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,632
Exploit my family, will you?!

51
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:14,982
We're the reason you guys
can even get by, you know!

52
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:20,988
Enough, already.

53
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,157
You're going to kill him.

54
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,742
Who are you?!

55
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:29,455
Go on. This here is Gandor turf.

56
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:33,000
Best not to announce the name
Runorata around here too much.

57
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:41,761
I don't care if you're Gandor
or anyone else, nobody asked you!

58
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:42,593
Let's go.

59
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,725
Who were those guys?

60
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,727
No one I know.

61
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,025
Well, well, well,

62
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:02,087
it's almost time for our show to start!

63
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:05,533
It's almost time for their lives to end!

64
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,188
How delightful, how fun!

65
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:12,858
I'm so excited,
I won't be able to sleep tonight!

66
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:16,163
If you enjoy it that much,
you should have gone by yourself.

67
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:19,544
But there's nothing I could have done.

68
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,966
I lost the draw, after all.

69
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,177
Lua, I'm so frustrated!

70
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:30,600
My dream is to kill everyone in the whole world
who wants to live more than you do,

71
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:36,480
and then finally, spend the rest of your life,
killing you slowly to death.

72
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,928
You could kill me
right here and now for me, Ladd.

73
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:44,405
What are you talking about?! No, no, no!

74
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,688
The world is still overflowing with many,

75
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:50,648
many people that I still have to kill, you know!

76
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,831
Killing you won't be for a long, long,
long time to come.

77
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,875
Ladd...

78
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:01,088
So until then,
you stick with me, and don't die.

79
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,214
Got it?

80
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,972
Vicky is completely wound up.

81
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,893
Aw, damn.

82
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,231
I envy that Vicky. I really, really do.

83
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,986
No, no! There is no
god in this world anymore!

84
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,948
Vicky no doubt must have
gone and killed him earlier!

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,992
Then, why don't you go see for yourself?

86
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,535
That's it!

87
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,982
You're right. I can go see, can't I?

88
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,704
I'm such an idiot.

89
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,874
There's no need for me to wait in here.

90
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:44,048
And here I was, thinking
I had to stay here, behaving myself.

91
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,675
Be right back.

92
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,720
Watch it, you little brat--

93
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,378
S-Sorry! Excuse me.

94
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:55,768
The train is in trouble!

95
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,342
T-That's why I have to get to
the conductor's compartment!

96
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,233
Anyhow, I'm sorry!

97
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,694
Wasn't that...

98
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,570
I'm sure of it.

99
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,908
This is starting to get interesting.

100
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:14,331
Lua, would you go with him,

101
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,872
and see what's happening
in the conductor's compartment for me?

102
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,874
And, if there's a kid with
a tattoo on his face there,

103
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,212
snatch him up, will you?

104
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,681
There's something very
interesting happening on this train.

105
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:40,438
I wonder what the "trouble" is that
that tattooed kid was talking about.

106
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:46,694
This is bad.
If I don't cut loose soon, I'm gonna bust.

107
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,823
Hey, stop that!
Your hand is gonna burn up!

108
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:58,122
No problem!

109
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,124
See?

110
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,962
Oh, that's amazing, Randy.

111
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,857
It'll be just the thing
to entertain with at the party tonight.

112
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,218
I'm sure Firo will be delighted, too.

113
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,017
Hey... Pecho, what are you doing?

114
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,019
I'm doing it, too.

115
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,730
Hey, wait! Your gloves are...

116
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,982
...made of cloth!

117
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:29,245
Hey! It's not going out!

118
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,455
It's gotta be done with leather!

119
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:34,658
Now calm down! Take your glove off, right now!

120
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,245
It's hot! It's hot!

121
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,416
You okay?

122
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,505
I thought I was gonna die!

123
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,215
I'm not about to let
myself get burned up over you.

124
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,925
I'm so embarrassed...

125
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:49,441
Quates-<i>sama</i>! It's finally perfected!

126
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,919
Damn! Why now, of all times?!

127
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:37,642
Miss, here it is. The information
broker where my kid friend is.

128
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:40,910
Oh, but this is a newspaper, isn't it?

129
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,738
Hmm, we may be able to
place a degree of faith in this place.

130
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:50,502
You ask 'em 'bout Master Dallas,
or anythin' else, and they'll know it.

131
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,047
Thanks for coming in!

132
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,982
Welcome! What brings you in here today?

133
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,946
Amazing!

134
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,823
Isn't this amazing, Maiza-<i>san</i>?

135
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,579
The Martillo Family capos have been choosing
their hats here for generations.

136
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,123
I bought mine here, too.

137
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,627
A capo, huh? It still doesn't feel like it.

138
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,658
You'll start feeling like it
once you've become one.

139
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,634
Are you sure it's okay for me to do this?

140
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,762
It's okay because it <i>is</i> you, Firo.

141
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,644
I like this one, Maiza-<i>san.</i>

142
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,521
It's perfect for me.

143
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,901
Welcome to the Martillo Family,
and the world of the Camorra.

144
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,780
Maiza-<i>san,</i>
you're a day too early, aren't you?

145
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,784
The ceremony has already begun, Firo.

146
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,580
Oops, excuse me.

147
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,542
Hey, watch yourself, will you?

148
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,836
Watch yourself, will you?

149
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,056
Maiza-<i>san</i>, over there.

150
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,313
I'm going to go have a little look.

151
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,357
Firo, don't be a rubbernecker!

152
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,526
I'm just concerned!

153
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,251
Are you all right?

154
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,253
Y-Yeah.

155
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,340
I'm terribly sorry about that.

156
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:03,510
I'm looking for someone, so...

157
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,191
Hey, you!

158
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,528
Wait up!

159
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:28,869
Whoa.

160
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:33,200
What's the matter, Jacuzzi? What's the rush?

161
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,868
Oh, it's terrible!
This train just might vanish!

162
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,714
So I have to get to the conductor!

163
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,594
Oh, just who I was looking for.

164
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:45,471
Nice...

165
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:46,220
Boss...

166
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,638
Where's Jacuzzi?

167
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,725
He just came by, saying
he was going to see the conductor.

168
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,144
Donny, please come with me.

169
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:57,445
We're going to check on the freight hold
while we bring Jacuzzi back.

170
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,983
Nick, you take the dining car,
if you please.

171
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,905
What, Boss Nice?

172
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,951
What am I supposed to do
with the dining car?

173
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,153
Nick, you take the dining car,
if you please.

174
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,290
Huh... So, does she mean this...

175
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,961
Nick, while we're taking care of the job,

176
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,296
please keep watch over
the folks in the dining car.

177
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,926
Hmm... So in other words,
does she mean this...

178
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,971
While we're doing the robbery,

179
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:34,017
we can't have anyone finding out about it,
causing a scene, and stopping the train.

180
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,689
Which is why, Nick,
keep the people in the dining car quiet.

181
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,650
You got it, Boss!

182
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,407
Gentlemen,

183
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,869
we now commence the rescue of Master Huey.

184
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,715
Samantha!

185
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,800
Elean!

186
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,804
It's been so long!
It's been so long, indeed!

187
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,775
Dallas Genoard...

188
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,605
You know my brother?

189
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,109
Who do you think I am?
Where do you think you are?

190
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,773
The Genoard family's son,
who went missing a year ago.

191
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:33,160
The greatest juvenile delinquent
of our time, Dallas Genoard.

192
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,911
Suck-up to the mighty, bully to the weak,

193
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,625
detested by everyone,
the lowest scumbag around!

194
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,630
My brother was nice to me.

195
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:51,668
Sorry, my bad. It just slipped out.

196
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,473
Sorry, please forgive me.

197
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,298
I'm sure we'll find your older brother.

198
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:01,021
We'll find him safe and sound,
so don't you worry, okay?

199
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,454
You're late! You are late!

200
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:21,291
Our guests are waiting!
They've been waiting too long!

201
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,588
Thanks.

202
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,509
Give me a moment,
I'm just going to skim over this.

203
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,182
Well? Where is my brother?
Where is Big Brother Dallas?

204
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,572
Please, tell me!

205
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,324
Y-Yeah, sure thing...

206
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:02,215
Uh, I'm terribly sorry,
but we don't know anything.

207
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,751
Even with our firm's information networks,

208
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,242
we don't have the faintest
idea where your brother is.

209
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:12,467
It's a complete mystery to us.
I really am terribly sorry.

210
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,298
What's the deal, Gramps?
Is that box that important to you?

211
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,981
Here, let me see it.

212
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,816
Whoa...

213
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,819
Can't be too careful with this one.

214
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,657
You're a determined geezer, huh?

215
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,177
What are you looking at, kid?

216
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:43,291
Nothing. Just sizing you up
to see, if you're going to rob him,

217
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,169
whether you've got the
skills and resolve to do so.

218
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:52,424
Never you mind, kid. You head on
home now, and suck on your mama's tit.

219
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,208
From where this "kid" sees it,

220
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,930
what you guys are doing
is nothing but kid's play, too.

221
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,933
Why, you dirty little brat.

222
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,537
Sounds like you want to
get yourself hurt pretty bad.

223
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:10,115
I'm not a dirty little brat, my name is Firo.

224
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,127
I also happen to be one of
the Martillo Family's young lads.

225
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,322
So what if you are?!

226
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,498
You little punk!

227
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,628
Hey, now, you're pulling
a weapon, in a fight like this?

228
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:40,972
Shut up!

229
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,276
Are you okay, old man?

230
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,451
Is whatever that is really that important?

231
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,244
B-Back off!

232
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,331
This has nothing to do with your kind!

233
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,544
If money is what you're after,
I'll give it to you, so just get lost, now!

234
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,715
You owe your life to me.

235
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,260
Well, it's okay.

236
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,139
Listen, old man,
there is one thing I'd like to ask you.

237
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:27,013
Did you see a girl wearing
a thin, black suit around here?

238
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:30,522
N-No, I haven't.

239
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,315
I see.

240
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,722
You'd better hurry on out of here,
while they're still out of it.

241
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,779
Bye, now.

242
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,427
Firo...

243
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,566
I'm not even hungry anymore, Miria.

244
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,152
There's always room for dessert, right?

245
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,073
Bang!

246
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,121
Okay, shall we get started?

247
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,542
Right, let's do it!

248
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,755
All of you, get down on the floor!

249
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,007
Get your hands up, everyone!

250
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,511
Hey, hey, hey, nobody move!

251
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,183
W-What do we do?

252
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,513
Miria...

253
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,398
What, Isaac?

254
00:21:55,774 --> 00:22:00,523
Get down on the floor,
put our hands up, and what else?

255
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:02,932
"Nobody move!"

256
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:04,449
Oh, right.

257
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,673
Um... Sorry for all the commotion.

258
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,682
You...

259
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,685
Barnes-<i>san...</i>

260
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:45,240
It's here... I'm too late!

261
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,868
It's already overtaken us!

262
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,787
The Rail Tracer...

263
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:07,501
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

264
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:21,765
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

265
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:33,331
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

266
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:40,334
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

267
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:47,424
<i>I believe so</i>

268
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:54,514
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

269
00:23:54,514 --> 00:24:02,012
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

270
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:08,642
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

271
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:18,697
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

272
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,634
<i>Hey, Isaac, what's "satsuriku"?</i>

273
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,134
<i>The "riku"part is the riku from "tairiku."</i>

274
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,181
<i>A land mass, right?</i>

275
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:32,590
<i>The "satsu"part is like "osatsu."</i>

276
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,697
<i>Money, right?</i>

277
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:36,311
<i>In other words, it's a</i>
<i>land that's made of money</i>!

278
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:37,521
<i>Sounds like fun</i>!

279
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:39,980
<i>It really does sound like fun, huh?</i>
