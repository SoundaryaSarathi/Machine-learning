1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:06,161
[Sakura and memories of her mother]

2
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,938
That day it had gotten really late,

3
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:17,103
so I thought I would go through the woods
behind the school as a shortcut

4
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:29,086
A firefly?

5
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,694
Eh!

6
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,180
Sakura-chan

7
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:02,578
Sorry

8
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,552
Naoko-chan, is that story true?

9
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:06,616
Yeah

10
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,824
Could you have just mistaken it
with something else?

11
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,124
No

12
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:12,660
Let’s not talk about this

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,963
I can’t handle scary stories

14
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,772
Hey, why don’t we go check

15
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:19,768
If that story is true

16
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,706
Club ends early today,

17
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:26,443
so let’s invite Rika-chan
and all go together

18
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:27,939
Umm Umm Umm!

19
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:28,646
What?

20
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,812
Isn’t there a cliff inside the woods?

21
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:32,948
It’s dangerous

22
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,483
As long as you don’t go next to
it everything is OK

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,750
But, what if a monster really did come out?

24
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,321
If we run away right away, it will be fine

25
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,956
But

26
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:45,256
Anyway, it’s OK

27
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:51,328
Our break is over, let’s go

28
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:55,067
Why does everybody like scary things?

29
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,306
Even though something scary might happen,

30
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,712
Why do we go?

31
00:01:59,113 --> 00:01:59,772
Ah, Sakura-chan,

32
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:01,377
what’s wrong?

33
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:03,214
Tomoyo-chan

34
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:07,348
Tomoyo-chan, come along!

35
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:08,347
Yes Yes

36
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,685
Why don’t we go back?

37
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,863
It’s fine There is still light out after all

38
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,128
Yeah, yeah Nothing to worry about

39
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:24,266
Hey, it’s almost my mom’s birthday.

40
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,672
What do you think would be a good present?

41
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:32,004
Your mom likes making sweets,

42
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,911
so why not a cute cake dish?

43
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,508
A cake dish?

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,247
Sakura-chan, what do you think?

45
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:42,616
Ah, don’t worry about it

46
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:48,659
Now that you mention it,
this Sunday is my mom’s

47
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:58,867
This way

48
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,078
It’s crows

49
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,022
It was right here

50
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,196
Nothing is coming out

51
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,196
I wonder if it has to be night

52
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,556
Scary…

53
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,221
A long haired woman!

54
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,854
A misty form with pointed ears

55
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:58,889
A swirly thing with one eye

56
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,424
A pink monster with lots of fangs

57
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,231
A giant meat bun

58
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:10,240
What? I saw was a giant meat bun

59
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,781
I was really scared

60
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,321
What, Sakura, are you scared of ghosts?

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,757
I am

62
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,418
Even though you are fine fighting
the Clow Cards?

63
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,386
I just can’t handle things
I don’t really understand

64
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,455
I know where the Clow Cards came from

65
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,561
That’s sort of an indefinite reason

66
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,467
But, didn’t everybody see different things?

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,477
I wonder if there’s a card like that

68
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,168
It’s just about time for dinner

69
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,475
OK!

70
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,645
I wish you could hurry and
return to your normal form

71
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,385
and be my body guard

72
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,114
If you want that,

73
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,650
you’d need to get at least
the Fire and Earth cards

74
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,485
My true form is really cool

75
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,226
Cool?

76
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,458
EH!

77
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,565
It looks great!

78
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:14,235
You like noodles, don’t you?

79
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:15,533
Yeah

80
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,173
I love this picture

81
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:27,118
This is from when Mom was sixteen right?

82
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,684
My mother Nadeshiko

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,958
She worked as a model
since she was in Jr High

84
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,987
We have all the pictures of her

85
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:37,557
From magazines,

86
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,397
and the ones that Dad took

87
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,671
Mom really was pretty

88
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,006
Yes, the most beautiful

89
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,638
and kind person in the world

90
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:57,013
I was only three when my mom died,

91
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,751
so I don’t really remember her

92
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,778
My dad tells me
all sorts of things about her,

93
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:04,590
So I love my mother

94
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,992
If you don’t hurry and eat, it will get cold

95
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,298
Yeah.

96
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,668
If you don’t hurry,

97
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,226
you’ll miss the bullet train

98
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,733
Yeah, yeah

99
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,735
Are your dad and brother gone?

100
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,108
My brother is at work,

101
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,009
my dad is on a business trip for a seminar

102
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:31,413
My dad made pudding

103
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,715
You want to eat my brother’s along with me?

104
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:35,883
Yay! Pudding! Pudding!

105
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:37,449
Ah, I’ll go pick that up

106
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,796
Hello? Kinomoto residence

107
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,662
Tomoyo chan? What is it?

108
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,796
They went to the woods again?

109
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:51,530
Yes, Chiharu called me.

110
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,440
This time they went with other club members

111
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,768
They say it appeared again

112
00:06:58,746 --> 00:06:59,872
The ghost

113
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:11,454
What happened? What happened?

114
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,723
What is the use of the Card Captor
whimpering over a thing like this?

115
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:15,991
But

116
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,160
Are you all right?

117
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,560
I’m not all right, but

118
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,925
There were girls who got hurt, right?

119
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:26,233
Yes, I heard that Chiharu went with
about five people

120
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,002
When the ghost appeared they panicked

121
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,273
And people were falling down

122
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,807
If it is a Clow Card, I have to catch it

123
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,512
Now there is the Card Captor that protects
the peace of the neighborhood

124
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,316
But, what should I do if it is a ghost?

125
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:45,214
Anyway, we can’t tell anything until
we check it out

126
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,851
Well then, shall we precede?

127
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:51,156
That is…?

128
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:54,928
Sakura!

129
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:57,834
Yeah! Fly!

130
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,565
Mom?

131
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,067
Is it really you Mom?

132
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,243
Mom!

133
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,611
What is that?

134
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,213
What’s wrong Sakura?

135
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,721
Kero-chan!

136
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:02,127
Mom…

137
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:10,571
Sakura-chan!

138
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,639
That’s a cliff!

139
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,390
Sakura-chan!

140
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:32,756
Sakura-chan! Sakura-chan!

141
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,398
Sakura-chan!

142
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:43,608
Sakura-chan!

143
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,137
Sakura is all right

144
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,370
Huh?

145
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,336
Are you awake?

146
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:14,603
Yukito-san,

147
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:15,905
Where is this?

148
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,141
It’s my house

149
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,837
Your?

150
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:22,279
Huh? These clothes?

151
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,579
The ones you were wearing are being washed

152
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,683
Ah, it was my grandma who changed you

153
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:33,918
Oh yeah, my brother mentioned that

154
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,989
Yukito lived along with his grandmother and

155
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:38,921
Um, thank you very much

156
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,162
You fell from the cliff

157
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:43,462
Do you remember?

158
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:45,071
No…

159
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,064
I see…

160
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:47,904
But it surprised me.

161
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:49,407
I was walking along the road

162
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,505
and Sakura came floating from the sky

163
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:53,810
So you

164
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,679
Where is Tomoyo-chan?

165
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,116
A group of women wearing sunglasses
came to pick her up

166
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:02,622
She was very worried,

167
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,990
but when I said I would contact Touya

168
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:06,925
she asked me to take care of it.

169
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,123
My brother?

170
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,356
Don’t worry

171
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,864
I’ll explain things, so he won’t scold you

172
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,866
Oh yeah, Kero-chan

173
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,370
Ah, that orange stuffed animal?

174
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:21,136
Tomoyo said
she would take care of him

175
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,706
So, rest a little longer

176
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:41,723
Yukito-san

177
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:42,854
Hmm?

178
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,893
I met my mother at the top of the cliff

179
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:50,396
I wonder if that was my mother’s ghost

180
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,634
A long time ago my brother told me

181
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:59,006
In order for a ghost to
appear they need a reason

182
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:03,547
I wonder why my mother was there?

183
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:08,479
But you know, if it was your mother,

184
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:11,482
would she put you in danger?

185
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,791
Mom

186
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:30,506
Sorry about this Yuki

187
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:31,976
No problem

188
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,548
Sakura-chan said she met her mother

189
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,882
In the woods behind the elementary school

190
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:43,382
Have you ever seen your passed on mother?

191
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes.

192
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,288
But not behind the school though

193
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,323
It’s probably my fault

194
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:51,889
that she is afraid of monsters and ghosts

195
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,459
Ever since she was small

196
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:57,132
I would tell her things like
There’s a woman with a

197
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,529
Or There is a man with white hair floating there

198
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,874
So, that is how Sakura-chan
became afraid of them

199
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,777
She can’t see them, but it seems
that she knows they’re there

200
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,908
She would just start crying out

201
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,441
Do you still see your mother?

202
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,278
No, she wasn’t around any more
when I went to Jr High

203
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,046
I suppose it must be lonely for her
not to have her mother

204
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,725
I don’t think that’s it

205
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:25,158
It’s just natural to want
to see her if she could

206
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,657
Sakura-chan has her troubles too,

207
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:31,033
so try not to scold her for today

208
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:36,806
But, if you really think Sakura-chan
is so cute

209
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,109
you should stop picking on her

210
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,880
The only one allowed to play around
with her is me

211
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:44,147
Have you ever heard of a sister complex?

212
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:44,940
Shut up

213
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:48,578
Come in

214
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:50,283
Sakura-chan

215
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:51,821
Tomoyo-chan

216
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,385
Are you OK?

217
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:54,988
You took the day off

218
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,828
Yeah, I’m just fine.

219
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,721
My brother ordered me to rest

220
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,459
Kero-chan

221
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,169
I’m sorry that I couldn’t do anything

222
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,771
No. Thank you

223
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:12,774
It smells nice

224
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:17,573
But, I wonder what that light was

225
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:23,851
My mother was there In that forest

226
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:27,259
But everybody saw something different

227
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,886
You were the only one to see a woman

228
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:34,196
It might be best to give up on this one

229
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:39,434
I don’t know if it’s a Clow Card
or a real ghost,

230
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,933
but it has enough power
to defeat you and me.

231
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,567
It was me
who asked you to look for the cards,

232
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:47,672
but I don’t want to see you get hurt

233
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:49,713
Kero-chan

234
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:53,546
That was pretty cool, Kero-chan

235
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,180
I am always cool

236
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,818
But, I think I’ll go after all

237
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:01,151
Sakura

238
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:05,154
If it is a card, I have to do
something about it

239
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,992
If it’s my mom

240
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,706
A long time ago my brother told me,
Mom isn’t here anymore

241
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,975
Because I got big so she can relax

242
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,717
and went to a very beautiful
place above the sky.

243
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:33,124
That’s why
I want to ask her why she’s there,

244
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,790
and if she has something to say

245
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,134
Please be careful, Sakura-chan

246
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,965
Don’t fall off the cliff again

247
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,068
Yeah

248
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,432
Be careful of the unexpected too.

249
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:53,135
But, I wonder if it will
appear so conveniently.

250
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,777
It will There is no avoiding my hunches.

251
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,081
There it is

252
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:03,354
Sakura

253
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:13,160
Yeah

254
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,536
It’s Sakura-chan’s mom

255
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:22,841
The same as the picture,
But why can we all see the same thing this time?

256
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,212
Mom

257
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:30,172
Is that really you Mom?

258
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,015
Why are you here?

259
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,686
Mom are you lonely?

260
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,923
Do you want to be with me

261
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,701
Wait! on’t go Mom!

262
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:51,836
No! Don’t go there!

263
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:55,897
Kero-chan!

264
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:57,835
Sakura is

265
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,405
Mom! Wait, Mom!

266
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,245
Please, don’t leave!

267
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,149
Mom!

268
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,183
Sakura

269
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:16,127
Mom!

270
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,026
Why? Mom

271
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,196
Why?

272
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:29,139
If it really was your mother,

273
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:32,041
would she put you in danger?

274
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:35,310
No.

275
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:36,911
Mom wouldn’t do this

276
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,580
She wouldn’t do this

277
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,325
Sakura

278
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:54,622
Sakura

279
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:56,695
You’re not my mom

280
00:17:57,604 --> 00:17:58,571
Who are you?

281
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,107
I have seen that pattern before.

282
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:07,641
It is a Clow Card after all.

283
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,411
That light!

284
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:13,618
Return to your rightful form

285
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:16,052
Clow Card!

286
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,331
You did it

287
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:36,768
It’s the illusion card

288
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,974
That’s why everybody
saw different things

289
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,472
What do you mean?

290
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,374
Illusion is a card

291
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:45,810
That shows people what
they want to see

292
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:48,347
It shows you various things
within your own heart

293
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,653
It’s only natural that
everybody would be different

294
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,618
Now that you mention it,
when we first came here I was hungry

295
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:57,120
And thinking I’d like to eat a meat bun.

296
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,261
The monsters that everybody saw

297
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,260
were what they thought would be scary,
if it appeared

298
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,270
Just all seeing Sakura’s mom

299
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:06,867
It was because we were all shown the photo,

300
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,707
And expected her to show up

301
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,038
And what threw you back?

302
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:15,541
Sakura’s feelings of happiness
from seeing her mom

303
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,449
It were just that strong

304
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:19,678
I’m so glad

305
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,284
That my Mom wasn’t here alone

306
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,915
I would be happy if I could see her

307
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:31,061
But, if she is in a beautiful
place in the sky,

308
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:33,098
that makes me more happy

309
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,099
You tried this hard.

310
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,604
Your mother must be put at ease

311
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:42,738
Well, she might have worried a
little about you this time.

312
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:50,914
I’ll be late!

313
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,221
In uniform even on a Sunday?

314
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,749
I have club

315
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:05,756
Thanks for breakfast

316
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:13,233
Happy Birthday, Mom

317
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,507
I love you

318
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,675
Well then, I’m off

319
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,385
I came because
I was a little worried this time

320
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:34,723
But she seems all right now
