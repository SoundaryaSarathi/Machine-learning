''The Destruction of Planet Namek!?
A Demonic Flash Pierces the Ground''

2
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,080
I- indeed. It appears that somehow
you really are a Super Saiyan.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,890
Having a calm, quiet heart, then
awakened by intense anger, huh?

4
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,390
I see. Which is why no matter how hard Vegeta
worked at it, he could not become one.

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,120
Kuririn-san...Dende...Father will surely win
against Freeza! He will surely win, and
avenge you, Kuririn-san and Dende!

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,060
You bastard!

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,410
W- what humiliation on my part! That I-that
Freeza-sama should take this from him--

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,650
from this Saiyan monkey scumbag! It's unbelievable!
I didn't think this sort of thing could happen!

9
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,940
Contact with the gentlemen from the Ginyu
Special Corps has been cut off,

10
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
and the signal from Freeza-sama's
Scouter has also disappeared!

11
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,610
What...what the hell is happening
on Planet Namek!?

12
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,440
Perhaps it has finally come!

13
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,780
A new era, that is!

14
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,450
A new era?

15
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,490
Freeza, the one who wiped out my
species, has finally been defeated!

16
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,420
You miserable fool!

17
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,420
C- Commander!

18
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,430
That we may stand here this
day, triumphant over the rest of the
universe, is due entirely to Freeza-sama!

19
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,100
And that is not all, he has promised me that some day,
my clan would be raised higher than any other!

20
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,840
Isn't that true of your races as well!?

21
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,580
Freeza-sama is the very savior of the
universe! Treachery will not be tolerated!

22
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,130
Signal on sensors! It is Freeza-sama!

23
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,460
It's an incredible battle power reading!

24
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,070
That's it! Freeza-sama must finally
have gotten serious!

25
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,080
Another one! What is this
other giant reading?

26
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
What's the matter!?

27
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,040
There is another, incredible
reading right near Freeza-sama!

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
-What!?
-I will give you a level reading.

29
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,450
You're finished, Freeza.

30
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:23,570
I- I am Freeza! You're
telling me I'm finished!?

31
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,420
That's it!

32
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,790
The spaceship that Father rode here in!

33
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,430
Still not yet!? If you don't cut that
out, I'm really goin' to get angry!

34
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:10,550
I have mentioned that this would be a piece
of cake-yeow!-if you would not rush me so.

35
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,950
Someone has gotten aboard
Goku's spaceship!

36
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,060
I installed sensor devices in there.

37
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,060
So, who could it be?

38
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,070
Gohan-chan!

39
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,350
Piccolo-san, wait here a moment.

40
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,090
Gohan-chan!

41
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,420
Mother!

42
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:58,430
Gohan-chan! You're alive, aren't ya!?
Thank goodness! Really, thank goodness!

43
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,770
Mother!

44
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,430
--Gohan, what about Goku!?
-What are you doin'!?

45
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,770
How are Goku and Kuririn!?

46
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,350
Father is fighting against Freeza.

47
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,650
Kuririn-san has died.

48
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,720
-W- what did you say!?
-I'm sorry, I don't have the time to go
into detailed circumstances right now.

49
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,380
I have to go get Bulma-san!

50
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,360
Gohan-chan! Don't you be goin' anywhere!
You stay right where you are!

51
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,390
--I'm waiting here for you!
-Wait, Gohan! Wait, I say!

52
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,420
If it is to come down to me being
killed by the likes of you,

53
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,790
I will choose death by my own hand!

54
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,330
Whichever you like.

55
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,220
Fool. You expect me to die?
It is you who will die.

56
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,760
I can continue to live, even in the vacuum of space.
I wonder though, how about you Saiyans?

57
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,400
Now perish, together with
this whole planet!!

58
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,300
Blow up!!

59
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,590
-W- what is it? What's that light!?
-Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

60
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,090
What is this? What's happening!?

61
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,780
Father!

62
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,750
K- Kaio-sama!

63
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,640
D- don't tell me...!

64
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,440
Son Goku did well.

65
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:38,980
Against Freeza, his overwhelming strength proved
him entirely triumphant in their battle.

66
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,780
So then, Goku is...?

67
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,890
He's defeated Freeza, hasn't he?

68
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,800
No. Having been cornered, Freeza...

69
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,800
...destroyed the entire
planet of Namek itself.

70
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,410
So then, what about Goku and the others?

71
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,720
If the planet is lost, no one
can survive. No one except Freeza.

72
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,820
T- that can't be!

73
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,490
It's over. All of it.

74
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,500
Kaio-sama...

75
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,470
Kaio-sama, are you able to hear me?

76
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,700
It is I, the Kami of Earth.

77
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,250
Yeah. What is it? I hear you!

78
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,550
I am now having Mister Popo
gather the Dragonballs of Earth.

79
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,120
I believe he will have all seven
together very shortly.

80
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,450
Is that so?

81
00:13:52,460 --> 00:14:00,390
If I could have you wait briefly, I can have those
who have been in your care resurrected.

82
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,200
However, Chaozu there is now
dead a second time, and so...

83
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,810
That is...

84
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,480
J- just a moment! Are you alive?

85
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,820
Y- yes, gratefully so, thanks to the
Dragonballs of Planet Namek...

86
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,500
Which would mean that Piccolo is
not dead either, correct?

87
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,340
A- as I believe you are aware, myself
and Piccolo were originally one single...

88
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,770
-That's right! Then perhaps...
-Kaio-sama!

89
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,780
Er, Kaio-sama? Kaio-sama?
Are you hearing me?

90
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,450
-Hey, keep it down!
-What a start!

91
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,150
I- I'm not going to let myself die
in a place like this!

92
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,440
Father!

93
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,130
Planet Namek has not been lost!

94
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,800
Goku and Gohan and Piccolo and the
girl called Bulma are all alive!

95
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,140
--All right!
--Thank goodness!

96
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,780
I restrained my power too much, did I?

97
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,780
That's because you were fearful of being
caught in the explosion of the planet.

98
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,120
You failed.

99
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,360
As a result, I've hung on to life.

100
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,030
Hung on to life, you say?

101
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,440
You don't seem to understand at all, do you?

102
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,140
You have avoided the planet's
instantaneous explosion,

103
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,080
but I've completely destroyed its core. Do
you understand what that means?

104
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,080
Five more minutes.

105
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:48,990
Five more minutes, and then Planet Namek will
undergo a great explosion, becoming space dust!

106
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:18,130
Five minutes will be plenty. I will defeat you, then leave
together with my friends in my spaceship.

107
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,130
Unfortunately for you, it will be I who
can hope to do so.

108
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,030
At least, it's a much greater
hope than you have.

109
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,910
In this event, I will show you my
100 percent full power!

110
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,910
There's no way you can defeat me!
Prepare yourself for this!

111
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,480
Why wait until now for full power?

112
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,760
I know why. If you used all your power,
your body couldn't withstand it!

113
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,090
I can't let you stall for any more time!

114
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,430
I'm going to settle this now!

115
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,110
There are five minutes until the
destruction of Planet Namek.

116
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,070
What will be the outcome
of this fierce battle?

117
