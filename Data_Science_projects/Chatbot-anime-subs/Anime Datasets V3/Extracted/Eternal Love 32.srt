<i>[Episode 32]</i>

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Qing Qiu is clearly a land of immortals,
but you've made it like the mortal realm.

4
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Men till the fields and women knit.
There's no trace of magic anywhere.

5
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,639
If everything is done with magic,
then life would not be interesting.

6
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,960
Everyone would get bored.

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm even thinking of creating
a battlefield for them sometime

8
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,439
so they can have some fun
fighting each other

9
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,319
so they don't get too bored.

10
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,240
That actually sounds quite interesting.

11
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,039
When the time comes, I'll lend you a few
Celestial generals to liven things up.

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm hurt!

13
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,479
I told you I can't cook, Aunt.

14
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,639
Looks like we'll just have to
forget about this meal.

15
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,840
We'll be fine even if we don't eat.

16
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,039
What about Riceball then?

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Mi Gu, hurry to the mortal realm
and drag Feng Jiu back here.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,639
Say that something big
has happened at Qing Qiu.

19
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,199
But I can't find her, Aunt.

20
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,000
Then post a notice at
the entrance of the Fox Den

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,719
and say that we need a cook right now.

22
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,439
All right, I'll go right away.

23
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,800
That's settled then.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,159
You can at least make a fire
and burn some firewood.

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,560
Add some more wood.

26
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,639
Your first wife must have had
amazing culinary skill

27
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,840
to have taught you to cook so well.

28
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,479
<i>Wait.</i>

29
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>His wife has already died.</i>

30
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>Wouldn't mentioning her
be reopening an old wound of his?</i>

31
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,879
She was like you.

32
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,240
She could only tend the fire
and burn wood while I cooked.

33
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,199
I don't know how she survived
on Mount Junji before she met me.

34
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
Why aren't you speaking?

35
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,319
I'm afraid you're sad.
I don't know what to say.

36
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,199
Su Su.

37
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,399
See? You're terribly heartbroken.
You've even called me by the wrong name.

38
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,199
Have you been to the Far East?

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Far East?

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,639
<i>I used to go to the Far East
with Sixteenth Disciple to play around.</i>

41
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,160
<i>Has the Crown Prince found some clues
and guessed that I am Si Yin?</i>

42
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,199
<i>Is that why he's using Little Riceball
as an excuse to stay at the Fox Den?</i>

43
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,120
<i>Does he want to recover Master's body?</i>

44
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,360
Why are you looking at me like that?
You look guilty.

45
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,240
N... No, I'm not.

46
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,519
You're almost done cooking.

47
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,360
Although I don't know how it tastes yet,
you do look quite like a cook.

48
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,480
<i>Forget about it for now.</i>

49
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,639
<i>I don't believe that</i>

50
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,319
<i>he can figure out something that's been
concealed for 70,000 years.</i>

51
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,240
If you keep feeding me,
I'll turn into a ball.

52
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
How nice would that be?

53
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
I wouldn't need to carry you

54
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,160
as I leap across clouds
back to the Celestial Palace.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,439
I'll just need to roll you up and
roll you back to your Qingyun Hall.

56
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,120
Father is mean!

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now you have someone to run to.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
It's all right.

59
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,319
Qian Qian, here.
You need more nourishment.

60
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,480
A-Li, here.
You need more nourishment.

61
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,040
Uncle Mi Gu, you need
more nourishment.

62
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,639
Qian Qian, clear out a study for me
to handle official documents.

63
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,360
You need to handle official affairs?

64
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm going to stay here for a few days.

65
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Mi Gu.

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Go tidy up Fourth Brother's old room.

67
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,839
All right, I'll get to it right now.

68
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,720
Mi Gu, come here.

69
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,959
Aunt.

70
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,279
Are they going to sleep?

71
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,920
They're asleep now. The young prince
falls asleep come nightfall.

72
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,160
The Crown Prince takes good care of him.
He does everything himself.

73
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,920
When are they leaving?

74
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
He didn't say.

75
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,879
Didn't you say His Highness
is here to settle a debt?

76
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,959
- I'm afraid...
- Afraid of what?

77
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,680
I've heard

78
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,879
the Nine Heavens has been searching for
Mo Yuan's whereabouts for 70,000 years.

79
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,720
His Highness must not be trusted, Aunt.

80
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,079
You're normally not very clever

81
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,439
but you're thinking
the same thing I am today.

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
I'll be going now.

83
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,639
Qian Qian.

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,639
Ye Hua? You're not sleeping yet?

85
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,120
A-Li has gone to sleep, so I've come
to find you for a game of chess.

86
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,679
Chess?

87
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,879
You're in the mood to play?

88
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,559
Over these years, other than the days
I have been guarding the Chang Sea

89
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,600
I have not stopped searching
for Seventeenth.

90
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Yet, I have not found any clues.

91
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,159
I'm afraid the lookout is grim.

92
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,240
I am the senior disciple,
but I have failed in my duty.

93
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
I couldn't even look after
a junior disciple.

94
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,080
I feel guilty towards Master.

95
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,985
Do not say that, Senior.

96
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:14,279
Not being able to look after Seventeenth
and losing him

97
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,639
is the fault of all of us disciples.

98
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,759
Never mind. It is rare for us to meet.

99
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,960
Let's not speak of
these upsetting matters.

100
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,240
By the way, Sixteenth, are you going
back to the mortal realm for experience?

101
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,799
I'll be honest with you, Senior.

102
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,039
In these 70,000 years,
I said I was gaining experience

103
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,480
but I have been searching for
Seventeenth's whereabouts.

104
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,960
I intended to continue my search

105
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,840
but I changed my mind after
encountering the Ghost Lord yesterday.

106
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:42,480
Kunlun Mountain was worshiped
by all immortals in the past.

107
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,080
Yet, it has now fallen to the extent
that not a soul is in sight.

108
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,159
Since I have not been able to
find Seventeenth even in 70,000 years

109
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,360
then why don't I return
to Kunlun Mountain

110
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,240
and look after Kunlun Mountain
in Master's stead?

111
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:59,840
Do you still remember the words
Master said before he left?

112
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:04,971
I am the same as Seventeenth.
We both believe in what Master said.

113
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:10,701
Since he has told us to wait for him,
then he will surely return!

114
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:17,461
Every day that Seventeenth is not found,
I will continue searching for him.

115
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,542
Then I shall return
to Kunlun Mountain first

116
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,542
and patiently await your good news.

117
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,981
Who are you looking for?

118
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:06,581
Aunt, this is Crown Prince's
civil officer, Star Lord Jia Yun.

119
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:11,381
This is the Crown Prince's
military officer, Star Lord Tian Shu.

120
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,701
Aunt.

121
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,302
Aunt, His Highness gave orders yesterday

122
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,469
that official reports are
to be sent here from now on.

123
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,902
Sent here?

124
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:22,981
Rest assured, Aunt.

125
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,701
I'll only be here once a day
in the morning

126
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,422
to collect the ones
finished from yesterday

127
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:28,221
and deliver the ones
awaiting instruction.

128
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,461
And you...

129
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,741
Rest assured, Aunt.

130
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,221
I am here to protect
the Crown Prince and the young prince.

131
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,741
I absolutely will not disturb
you and His Highness.

132
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,461
I will make my greeting and
then disappear from your sight.

133
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:48,581
Without His Highness's permission,
you absolutely will not see me.

134
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,101
They're from the Ghost Realm?

135
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,782
Why would they be after me?

136
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,501
Does the Ghost Realm still wish to
wage war against the Celestial Tribe?

137
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,422
You say His Highness had
Jia Yun and the others

138
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,326
send all official reports to Qing Qiu?

139
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:10,022
Yes, Your Highness.

140
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,662
Jia Yun had returned just now

141
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:14,125
and announced it to those in
His Highness's slumber hall.

142
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,182
His Highness only met Bai Qian once
at the Eastern Sea.

143
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,812
How come he has now
gone to live with her?

144
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:24,942
Nine-tailed white foxes are said
to have a naturally seductive appearance

145
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,422
and are skilled at using
enchanting spells.

146
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:28,981
I am guessing...

147
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:35,142
I'm afraid she has done
something unbearable to His Highness

148
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,142
and enchanted His Highness!

149
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,302
What does it matter if she has
a naturally seductive appearance?

150
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,461
Wasn't Second Prince
still stolen from her by a snake?

151
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,902
I had to do so many things

152
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:58,101
suffered the pain of replacing my eyes,
and offered the Soul-gathering Lamp

153
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:00,486
to finally be able to enter Xiwu Palace.

154
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,101
But just because she was born
a princess of Qing Qiu

155
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,822
she could so gratuitously take
the position of his main wife.

156
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:13,701
This world is truly unfair.

157
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,542
Yes, Your Highness.

158
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:20,902
We must quickly think of a way
we can teach her a lesson.

159
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,062
No.

160
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:25,902
She is a queen of Qing Qiu.

161
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:28,782
She is someone who is addressed
as Aunt by the four seas.

162
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,381
She is also the Crown Princess
selected by Heavenly Lord himself.

163
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:38,581
I will not gain any benefit
by entering into a conflict with her.

164
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,022
It can't be that
Your Highness will tolerate this?

165
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:46,182
No.

166
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:48,261
This is not a matter of tolerance.

167
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,942
I was able to come this far

168
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:57,022
enter Xiwu Palace even while
Ye Hua was unwilling

169
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,542
and make the four seas believe I am
the only favored consort of Xiwu Palace.

170
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,501
It was not done by swallowing my anger
and confronting adversity...

171
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:08,902
but by relying on...

172
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,182
this.

173
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:15,981
Your Highness is right.

174
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:24,422
Because Second Prince called off
the engagement to her once

175
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,861
Heavenly Lord absolutely will not allow
Ye Hua to do anything.

176
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:33,621
I had thought Ye Hua would
continue to miss the dead Su Su

177
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,501
and wouldn't marry Bai Qian so easily.

178
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,261
But who would've known that
after a visit to the Eastern Sea

179
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,261
he would be ensnared by her?

180
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,782
Xin Nu.

181
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:49,101
To dispose of this obstacle

182
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:54,261
the best method is to make her cancel
the engagement of her own accord.

183
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,581
Cancel it of her own accord?

184
00:16:58,581 --> 00:16:59,822
That's right.

185
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:04,182
She does not have any feelings for Ye Hua

186
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:06,541
and is herself a queen of Qing Qiu.

187
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,342
If by being with Ye Hua,
she feels restricted

188
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:13,261
uncomfortable, and finds nothing happens
according to her will

189
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:14,821
then in a fit of anger

190
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,061
perhaps she really might
cancel the engagement.

191
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,821
Even if she does not

192
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,701
she certainly wouldn't be
pleasant to Ye Hua.

193
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,781
Good idea!

194
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,422
That's right!

195
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,182
Your Highness's idea is best.

196
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,541
Go to Qing Qiu now.

197
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,862
Pass on a message to the high goddess
according to my intentions

198
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,382
and let her see that
the Celestial Tribe has rules.

199
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:49,781
She may have an engagement with
His Highness but they're not married yet.

200
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:53,501
Being together all day and
lying with each other is inappropriate.

201
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,501
Weaken her authority first.

202
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,102
Yes.

203
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,942
I shall go now.

204
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,541
Aunt, did you not sleep well yesterday?

205
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:37,781
The Crown Prince insisted that
I play chess with him last night.

206
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:41,301
I was too sleepy, so I laid my head
down on the table.

207
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,422
In the end, I slept like that
for the night.

208
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,342
I'm going to catch up on sleep.
I'm leaving him to you.

209
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,261
All right.

210
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:10,701
Raise your head.
Let me see your face.

211
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,342
Your Highness.

212
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,981
I heard you saved
the imperial great-grandson.

213
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:30,261
Your Highness, when I was previously
passing by Mount Junji

214
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,221
I saw a monster taking advantage of
the imperial great-grandson

215
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,182
so I stepped in and saved him.

216
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:37,981
I escorted him to the hut
that His Highness often stays in.

217
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:43,582
The young prince
is the Crown Prince's first son.

218
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,221
He is also the Crown Prince's only son
and greatly favored.

219
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:47,741
You are very lucky.

220
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:53,942
Tell me. How should I thank you for
this kindness in His Highness's stead?

221
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,622
I don't dare.

222
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:02,461
I only wish to be able to stay in
His Highness's palace as a normal maid.

223
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,781
I will be content just to
serve His Highness for many millennia.

224
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,781
You are a princess of the Eastern Sea.

225
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,261
With that identity

226
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,102
even if you were to marry into
Xiwu Palace, nobody would say a word.

227
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,862
Wouldn't it be too humbling
for you to be a maid?

228
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:31,902
Don't you agree, Princess Miao Qing?

229
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,501
Stand up.

230
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,342
With your identity, and the fact that
you saved the young prince

231
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:48,261
it would not be difficult for you
to be made a consort.

232
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:57,221
In these 70,000 years

233
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,622
I've been the only one
to serve His Highness in Xiwu Palace.

234
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,301
It is quite lonely.

235
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,662
Sister, if you truly have the intention

236
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:08,142
then I can help you into
a marriage with His Highness.

237
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,153
It would be nice to have more company.

238
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,461
Thank you, Your Highness.

239
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:14,382
There is no need for thanks.

240
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:18,342
I understand your infatuation.

241
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:21,021
It is just like how I am to His Highness.

242
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,021
I sympathize with you,
for we are the same.

243
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:32,301
I heard that High Goddess Bai Qian
of Qing Qiu also attended

244
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,061
the Eastern Sea's banquet
for the Water King's one-month-old son.

245
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:40,142
Did you see the legendary high goddess?

246
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,701
High Goddess Bai Qian?

247
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:50,582
What is the matter?

248
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:52,182
Is it something you cannot speak about?

249
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:56,342
No, it's just that while at
the Eastern Sea

250
00:21:56,342 --> 00:22:00,021
I had mistaken High Goddess Bai Qian
for Your Highness.

251
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:07,021
That sounds quite interesting.

252
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:08,942
Tell me about it.

253
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:29,862
Hold it.

254
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,142
Is your Aunt in the cave?

255
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,261
Are you looking for our Aunt?

256
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:38,422
That's right. I work for
Consort Su Jin of Xiwu Palace.

257
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:41,021
I want to see your Aunt.

258
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:46,541
My Aunt and your lord play chess at night
and take walks during the day.

259
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,541
She's tired now, and is resting.

260
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,821
If anything is the matter, just tell me.

261
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:56,061
My lady isn't someone
who has a low tolerance.

262
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:59,862
Moreover, she is
a future imperial consort.

263
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:05,102
Her Highness sent me
with good intentions.

264
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:09,981
High Goddess Bai Qian and Crown Prince
have yet to be wed in ceremony.

265
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:13,662
They are together all day,
and lie with each other.

266
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,821
On the whole,
it is unacceptable behavior.

267
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:19,382
Even Heavenly Lord did not
act in this way in the past.

268
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:24,981
Moreover, Princess Miao Qian has just
been invited up to the Celestial Palace.

269
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:29,662
The Crown Prince should not neglect her.

270
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:33,461
Our Qing Qiu doesn't have as many
involved rules as the Celestial Tribe.

271
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:39,342
A mere low immortal
is here causing a fuss?

272
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,461
Are you bullying Qing Qiu
because we have no guards?

273
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,862
- Exactly!
- That's right!

274
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:46,541
You're clearly looking for an excuse
to give us a hard time!

275
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,142
Leaving aside that your lord has
a mistress, he even has a son.

276
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:52,061
Our Aunt doesn't disapprove of you all,
yet you all disapprove of her?

277
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:54,367
You all... You uncivilized peasants!

278
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,061
How dare you disparage the
Celestial Tribe for having many rules?

279
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,902
Scram! Leave Qing Qiu immediately!

280
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:00,622
- Leave!
- Scram!

281
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:03,221
- Get out of Qing Qiu!
- Leave!

282
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:07,821
- Get out of here!
- Leave Qing Qiu!

283
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,662
You can't do this!

284
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:12,501
- Leave Qing Qiu!
- Get out!

285
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,541
What are you all doing?

286
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,981
Leave!

287
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:24,342
Mi Gu.

288
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:26,339
What were they clamoring about?

289
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,726
Aunt, Consort Su Jin from
the Celestial Palace sent someone

290
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:30,768
to urge the Crown Prince
to return to the palace.

291
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:32,182
I hadn't even said much to her yet

292
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:35,182
and she was already driven away
by the people of Qing Qiu.

293
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:39,221
Su Jin? Ye Hua's side consort?

294
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,781
Yes, Aunt.

295
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:46,021
How come those people were so fierce?

296
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:48,221
She said some unpleasant things.

297
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:52,261
She said you and the Crown Prince
had not been wed in ceremony yet

298
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:54,622
but are together all day
and lie with each other

299
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:56,382
and it is unacceptable behavior.

300
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:59,021
She said even Heavenly Lord
did not act this way in the past.

301
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:02,301
When the crowd heard that, they were
so furious that they drove her away.

302
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:06,102
I understand.

303
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:31,021
That is a nice painting.

304
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:38,662
Your side consort sent someone just now
to ask for you to return to the palace.

305
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,261
She said some things
that were only somewhat truthful.

306
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:46,781
I considered it for a bit,
and think her words are reasonable.

307
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,701
What was it?

308
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:54,781
She said you and I have not yet
been wed in ceremony

309
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:57,701
but are together all day
and lie with each other.

310
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:03,261
Although what she said is not the truth

311
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,501
I think it's indeed inappropriate for you
to be staying here in my Fox Den all day.

312
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,102
What do you think?

313
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:12,422
I wanted to live here,
so I came to live here.

314
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:16,382
All in all, you are my wife.
How is it any of other people's business?

315
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:21,382
If I had married at a proper age

316
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,541
my grandchildren would've been
as old as you by now.

317
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,221
Qian Qian, you've repeatedly reminded me

318
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:29,142
you are dozens of millennia
older than I am.

319
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:30,701
Is there something you want to say?

320
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,902
It is just an offhand comment.

321
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:40,662
That palace maid said

322
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:43,645
you brought Princess Miao Qing
into the Celestial Palace.

323
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:46,662
Yes.

324
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,301
Qian Qian, sit down.

325
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:55,662
You should lie down.

326
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,182
Choose a comfortable position.

327
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:07,741
Raise your hand and face me.
Have a smile on your face.

328
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,461
Very good.

329
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:26,582
<i>Is he making a painting for me?</i>

330
00:27:26,582 --> 00:27:29,102
<i>How come this Crown Prince has
such variable moods?</i>

331
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:32,501
<i>One moment, he has a cool expression,
and in the next, he has a pleasant smile.</i>

332
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:36,461
Miao Qing was insistent on not marrying
the second prince of the West Sea.

333
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:39,541
She had saved A-Li's life.

334
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:42,714
I allowed her to go to
the Celestial Palace to be a maid.

335
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,382
When she has thought things through,
she will eventually leave on her own.

336
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:51,781
Actually, the second prince of
the West Sea is not that unbearable.

337
00:27:54,942 --> 00:27:56,342
You know him?

338
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,182
<i>He's testing me again.</i>

339
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:01,622
I don't know him.

340
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:04,221
I've just heard Fourth Brother
mention him before.

341
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:08,021
And isn't the second prince
a disciple of Mo Yuan?

342
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,461
In all likelihood, he wouldn't be
that hedonistic.

343
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:13,461
I'm guessing it was just an excuse.

344
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:21,382
Qian Qian, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

345
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,582
There is one more thing.

346
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:27,862
Go ahead.

347
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:30,781
My... my arm is turning numb.

348
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:34,102
C... Can I change positions?

349
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:37,221
As you wish.

350
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,261
Your Highness.

351
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:37,102
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu is not
one to be trifled with.

352
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:39,909
All of Qing Qiu
is full of uncivilized peasants.

353
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,021
They dared disparage the Celestial Tribe
for having a copious amount of rules

354
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:47,142
and said that in Qing Qiu, they just need
to have affection for each other

355
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:49,182
and decorum is of no concern.

356
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:50,862
What?

357
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:52,662
They really said that?

358
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:55,622
Did Bai Qian say that?

359
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:59,582
That is what makes me furious.
I didn't even get to see Bai Qian.

360
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,862
That Bai Qian put on airs
as a high goddess

361
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:05,102
and had a mere tree spirit send me away.

362
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:09,422
She did not care that I was sent by you.

363
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,902
No matter what,
I was once an imperial consort.

364
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:17,821
I was bestowed to the Crown Prince
by the Heavenly Lord himself.

365
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:21,021
And I was the first to be
officially wed into Xiwu Palace.

366
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:24,342
She would actually dare
to belittle me so?

367
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:26,061
She was not just belittling you.

368
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:28,142
Those savages in Qing Qiu also said...

369
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,981
They said Your Highness
is the Crown Prince's mistress

370
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:37,461
and that we are lucky that
their Aunt doesn't disapprove of us

371
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,261
so how dare we go to lecture her.

372
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,461
Atrocious!

373
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:41,942
It is too atrocious.

374
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,781
- They practically--
- Don't say anymore!

375
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,582
Your Highness, what is the matter?

376
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:48,382
I said not to say anymore!

377
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,382
Your Highness, don't be angry.

378
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:03,021
Let me think about

379
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:07,942
how to make His Highness come back
from that fox's side.

380
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:11,582
Your Highness, today is
Heavenly Lord's birthday feast.

381
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:13,902
You must not get too angry.

382
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:22,102
It's all right.

383
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:26,061
I just couldn't control
my resentment for the moment.

384
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:28,862
It's all right.

385
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:38,422
You said today is
Heavenly Lord's birthday feast?

386
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:41,622
Yes, Your Highness. Have you forgotten?

387
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:46,501
I have been thinking about
that Qing Qiu fox the past few days.

388
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:48,501
I actually forgot about this.

389
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:54,461
Have you prepared the gift
I told you to arrange?

390
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,182
Yes, Your Highness.

391
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,781
Are there any special guests this time?

392
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:03,781
It is the same as last year.

393
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:07,862
If I am to say there's anyone special

394
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:12,301
it would be the Water King of North Sea
and his eldest son, Yuan Zhen.

395
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,221
- Yuan Zhen?
- Yes.

396
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:20,142
I heard Yuan Zhen wrote many words
of congratulations for the Heavenly Lord.

397
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:21,862
The Heavenly Lord was very pleased

398
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:25,221
and even allowed Water King
of North Sea to bring his eldest son.

399
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:26,981
I am guessing

400
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:31,261
the divide between the Water King
of North Sea and the Heavenly Lord

401
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:34,862
may be able to be bridged with this son.

402
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:42,501
Quickly, go make preparations.
This must be carried through.

403
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:52,781
Your Highness!
Are you truly going to do that?

404
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:56,102
- I'm afraid...
- No need to be afraid.

405
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:58,301
Nothing will happen.

406
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,963
I heard you've been at the Fox Den
since you were young.

407
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:11,061
You were here before Qian Qian
was 10,000 years old.

408
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:14,862
Yes. Counting the years,
it has indeed been that long.

409
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,422
Since Qian Qian is a high goddess

410
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:20,342
then it's reasonable to say she had to
experience two heavenly trials.

411
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:24,102
Once to ascend to high immortal,
and another to ascend to high goddess.

412
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,902
Yes... yes...

413
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:28,582
Since you watched her grow up

414
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:32,142
then you must know what she
went through for these two trials.

415
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,301
Let me think... let me think...

416
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,981
I'm old, so my brain
doesn't remember things too quickly.

417
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:41,741
<i>Aunt ascended to high immortal
while she was at Kunlun Mountain.</i>

418
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:45,741
<i>Could it be the Crown Prince
is in search of Mo Yuan?</i>

419
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,342
<i>I must be careful.</i>

420
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:53,962
When our Aunt ascended to high immortal,
she happened to be at the Fox Den.

421
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,972
The Fox King himself
shielded her from the trial.

422
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:57,942
As for ascending to high god

423
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:01,622
Crown Prince, you know as well
that she had the battle with Qing Cang.

424
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:04,622
The battle with Qing Cang?

425
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,102
That's correct.

426
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,661
<i>She battled with Qing Cang.</i>

427
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:11,222
<i>That's how she lost her memory
and became a mortal.</i>

428
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:15,862
<i>Ye Hua, Ye Hua...
She is your Su Su.</i>

429
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:18,101
<i>Why must you seek confirmation
over and over again?</i>

430
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:25,181
<i>Whether or not she has forgotten,
it is enough that she is back.</i>

431
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:29,541
Your Highness?

432
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:34,222
Did you think of something?
You look so delighted.

433
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,382
It's nothing.

434
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,661
I'm going to take your Aunt
to the mortal realm.

435
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,141
Mortal realm?

436
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:51,021
The Crown Prince is
so hard to understand.

437
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,661
He's gloomy one moment,
and bright the next.

438
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,942
The rain sure is delightful today.

439
00:35:13,942 --> 00:35:16,101
I finally don't have to
go on a stroll with him.

440
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,021
Lord Ye Hua.

441
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:24,501
Look. I wonder which Water King
is casting rain today.

442
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,222
I don't want you to get drenched.

443
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:29,581
Why don't we stay inside
the Fox Den for the day?

444
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,782
Father says he's taking us to play
in the mortal realm today.

445
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,422
Fortunately, it's not raining
in the mortal realm today.

446
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,461
You two are going to the mortal realm?

447
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:47,021
You should find
an earth deity to guide you.

448
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:52,222
I stay in the Fox Den every day.
I'm not familiar with the mortal realm.

449
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:57,181
Mother, I'd like you to come.

450
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:03,342
Wait for me to get changed, all right?

451
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:16,461
Godfather, I want this one!

452
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:17,461
All right.

453
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:19,541
Which one would you like, young master?

454
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:21,461
Here, this one.

455
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:23,981
Wait. Your pearl could buy
the entire street.

456
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,262
Be careful. Don't drop it.

457
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,822
- Here you go.
- All right.

458
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:31,581
- All kinds of nuts! Healthy and tasty!
- Thank you, Godfather.

459
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:34,141
Come try them! All sorts of nuts!

460
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:36,101
Young master, I have
all sorts of nuts available.

461
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,021
Godfather, I want this one.

462
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:44,461
- Fill up a bag for me.
- All right.

463
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,902
How come you're in the mood
to visit the mortal realm today?

464
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:48,902
Jia Yun brought a large pile
of reports yesterday.

465
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,581
Judging from his expression,
they weren't trivial documents.

466
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,742
Today is A-Li's birthday.

467
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:02,302
How insincere of you.

468
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:03,807
Why didn't you tell me earlier about

469
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,661
such an important matter as
A-Li's birthday?

470
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:09,222
He calls me Mother.
I don't even have a gift prepared.

471
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:10,862
It's so disheartening.

472
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,501
What gift are you going to give him?
A luminous pearl?

473
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,501
How did you know?

474
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,206
Hasn't it been your habit all these years
to gift luminous pearls?

475
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:21,342
Small pearls for young immortals,
and large pearls for old immortals.

476
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:24,021
Although a luminous pearl
would be most precious

477
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:26,141
A-Li is young and
wouldn't know its value.

478
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:28,621
It would just be a waste
to give it to him.

479
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,541
Don't you know? I have one
that is half as tall as a person.

480
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,222
It is like the moon.

481
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:36,422
If placed in A-Li's Qingyun Hall,
it would still be a pleasure to look at.

482
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,782
It is the world's one of a kind--

483
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,061
Watch out!

484
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:47,902
So you're over here! What were you doing?

485
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,581
Thank you, young master.

486
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:51,902
You're welcome.

487
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,902
I was so scared.

488
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,942
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

489
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,501
<i>Qian Qian.</i>

490
00:37:57,501 --> 00:38:02,101
After being missing for a few years,
how come you're now in this state?

491
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:07,942
<i>I have never left Qing Qiu
in these 70,000 years</i>

492
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:09,262
<i>and hadn't been injured.</i>

493
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:11,501
<i>Could it have been a dream
that I just remembered?</i>

494
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:16,702
What's the matter?

495
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:30,382
Misters, all the dishes are served.

496
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:32,661
Here you go.

497
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:35,342
This young master is quite adorable.

498
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:40,581
He may be cute as a child, but who knows
how he will look when he is grown up.

499
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:42,021
Enjoy.

500
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,742
Mother, do you not like me now?

501
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,702
Good looks on a man are not useful.

502
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:56,262
A pair of strong fists is more useful
than a handsome face.

503
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:59,365
Besides, daughters resemble their
fathers and sons resemble their mothers.

504
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:03,822
In my opinion, A-Li won't look anywhere
near bad when he is grown up.

505
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:06,342
Mother is beautiful.

506
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:09,981
Naturally, I won't be anywhere
ugly enough to bring Mother shame.

507
00:39:13,782 --> 00:39:17,422
Yes, no matter how you look
when you grow up

508
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,215
you will still be the apple of my eye.

509
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:22,302
I'll be most protective of you.
You know that, right?

510
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:24,822
You are so good to me.

511
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:32,742
Misters, this liquor was just warmed up.

512
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:35,661
It is perfect for drinking right now.
Have a taste.

513
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:36,702
Thank you.

514
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:38,262
Enjoy.

515
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,101
You like to eat this. Have more.

516
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:48,541
You hate eating this, but it's healthy.

517
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,862
You are so skinny.

518
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:52,862
Even if it doesn't pain you to see
yourself like this, it pains me.

519
00:39:56,581 --> 00:40:00,222
Qian Qian, if you can't bear to listen
to these endearing words

520
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:02,061
what will you do from now on?

521
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:13,920
My lord, Aunt.

522
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,253
Deities from all around the world

523
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:17,190
have arrived for
Heavenly Lord's birthday feast.

524
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,822
Second Prince Die Feng of West Sea
arrived at Celestial Palace

525
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:21,262
and came to Zichen Hall soon after

526
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:23,302
saying he has urgent matters
to discuss in person.

527
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:25,981
I dared not delay,
and came in search of Your Highness.

528
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:30,222
Keep A-Li company. I have to
return to the Celestial Palace.

529
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,981
I'll come back to
look for you two tonight.

530
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,141
All right.

531
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,262
Take care, Mister. Please come again!

532
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:45,501
All right!

533
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,621
Mister, how come it's just
the two of you?

534
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,581
Where is the other mister
who was with you?

535
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,742
Is there any place worth visiting nearby?

536
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,342
Place worth visiting? Yes!

537
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:58,021
Head south that way.
There is a teahouse.

538
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,302
This teahouse may charge high prices

539
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:03,222
but there is some wonderful
storytelling there.

540
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:04,782
- Storytelling?
- Yes.

541
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,222
Let's go to the teahouse then.

542
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:08,661
- All right.
- Thank you.

543
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:11,382
<i>[Yunji Teahouse]</i>

544
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:13,581
Let's continue the story from last time.

545
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:17,541
Good, good...

546
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,782
- It's said the python was 10 zhang long.
- Right here, please.

547
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:23,581
Its scales and spots
shone fluorescent bright.

548
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,061
A rush of astonishing courage
filled Zhang Fei.

549
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:29,021
Searching for prey left and right,
the python instilled panic in all.

550
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:34,333
Splendid...

551
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:39,702
Sure death awaited nine of ten men
caught in its mouth.

552
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,661
Thus, the three men
glanced at each other...

553
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,262
In the time it takes your father
to drink a cup of tea in heaven

554
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:46,302
night will already be upon us
in the mortal realm.

555
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,302
Let's sit here and wait for him.

556
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,342
Crown Prince.

557
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,461
I still have urgent business
in the mortal realm.

558
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,422
I'll have to leave when
this candle goes out.

559
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,222
Then I'll keep it short.

560
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:12,742
Immortals who have left
the Eastern Sea banquet in recent days

561
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:17,422
have encountered groups of attackers
of unknown identity who aimed to kill.

562
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:18,942
Such an occurrence happened?

563
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:21,862
Were any captured alive?

564
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:24,981
None were left alive.
They were all killed by demonic magic.

565
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,942
My Sixteenth Disciple means to say

566
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:29,422
they were puppets
created by demonic magic.

567
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,382
So, it is highly likely their master
comes from the Ghost Realm.

568
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:34,782
The Ghost Realm?

569
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:46,742
