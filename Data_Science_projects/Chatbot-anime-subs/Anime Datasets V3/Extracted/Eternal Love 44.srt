<i>[Episode 44]</i>

3
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,896
- You may be dismissed.
- Yes.

4
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,431
Fourth Brother?

5
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:39,183
You're here to grab a drink with Senior?

6
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:45,242
I do often drink with your senior but
this time, I'm here to visit my sister.

7
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,616
Thank you for your concern.

8
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,794
I just wanted to take a look at you.

9
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,514
But now that I do see you...

10
00:02:55,514 --> 00:03:01,234
Although your injuries are healed,
why do you seem so strange?

11
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,425
You seem so drained and pale.

12
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:05,063
Could it be that you're not pleased
about Mo Yuan's return?

13
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:08,937
I'm happy about it.

14
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,663
How could I not be happy?

15
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:13,612
Why do you look so distracted then?

16
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:16,358
Perhaps it is because I've used up

17
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:19,103
some of my magical powers
and have yet to recover.

18
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,007
All right, I'll tell you.

19
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm mad at Ye Hua over
a trivial matter involving Riceball.

20
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:42,557
Riceball only had two sips
of fruit wine with me.

21
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,825
Who knew that he would be
so bad at drinking?

22
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,348
He got drunk and slept for
14 or 15 hours.

23
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:51,127
I didn't think that
it was a serious matter

24
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,112
but Ye Hua got angry.

25
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:57,590
He said that I didn't care for Riceball
as I would for my own son.

26
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,764
I was too angry, so I said
some mean words in a fit of rage.

27
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,329
I told him to have his side consort
look after his son

28
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,210
and stop coming to see me.

29
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,727
A-Li is just a child.

30
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,930
You fed him so much wine

31
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,518
that he got drunk and slept for
14 or 15 hours?

32
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,492
You didn't even send anyone
to inform Ye Hua.

33
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:18,829
Then as the stepmother, you didn't
say a word about where you were going.

34
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,646
If he isn't angry at all,
he must be quite something.

35
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:29,774
Judging by your character,
you usually brush it off as a joke.

36
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:32,329
But this time, you've lost your poise

37
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,329
and provoked him with
that side consort of his.

38
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,021
You're not acting like yourself.

39
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,244
Are you jealous?

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,398
That's impossible.

41
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,178
But...

42
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:56,076
These two days in the Nine Heavens
I did lose my poise a bit.

43
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,141
I feel so uneasy seeing that
side consort, Su Jin

44
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:02,523
and I can't stand it when
Ye Hua scolds me.

45
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:07,737
Could it be that I'm jealous
and have been for so long?

46
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,297
You really did get jealous.

47
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,732
That can't be.

48
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,935
I'm 90,000 years older than him.

49
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,545
If I married young

50
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,723
my grandson would be about his age now.

51
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:29,142
I even thought of getting him
a few beautiful concubines.

52
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,437
Fourth Brother, if I really fell for him

53
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:40,221
shouldn't I have been moved when
he confessed his feelings for me?

54
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,865
What? He already confessed
his feelings for you?

55
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,533
Good.

56
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,963
If he falls for the sister
I brought up, he does have good taste.

57
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,004
As for the age difference...

58
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:56,112
Father is 15,000 years older than Mother.

59
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,370
As long as you look
good together, it's fine.

60
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,538
You two look great together.

61
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,158
Speaking of side consorts

62
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:09,096
Zhe Yan has been pondering over
getting me a wife

63
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,958
but that hasn't worked out.

64
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,531
He must have felt that no other
female deity is good enough for me.

65
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:23,519
As for you, you're always so slow
when it comes to romance.

66
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,218
Answer me.

67
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:33,538
After he left,
what was it that you found strange?

68
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,461
When Ye Hua first went to Qing Qiu

69
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:44,492
I wasn't used to having him around.

70
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:50,596
But since we'll have to live together
after we're married

71
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:54,024
I just let him do as he wanted.

72
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,471
During the day,
he'd take me out for a stroll.

73
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,920
When he was going through reports
I'd munch on pumpkin seeds.

74
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,427
Then we'd play a game or two
of chess at night.

75
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:07,266
I thought that once we are married

76
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:11,257
we'd have to spend days together
for all eternity, so I got used to it.

77
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,336
But now that you've asked me

78
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:21,014
how did I spend my time
in Qing Qiu before Ye Hua came here?

79
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,526
It now seems that you've really
fallen for Ye Hua.

80
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,915
You don't have to be so perplexed.

81
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:33,833
Since Ye Hua already made a vow,
even if he breaks it in the future...

82
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,083
Judging by this situation,
I can set my mind at ease.

83
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,307
I'll get going.

84
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:42,822
Fourth Brother!

85
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,024
What are you at ease with?

86
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,502
What if he really breaks his vow?

87
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,475
What am I to do?

88
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:53,401
<i>If I did fall for Ye Hua...</i>

89
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:57,826
<i>Haven't I wasted
140,000 years of my life?</i>

90
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:01,656
<i>I actually fell for that chap
who is 90,000 years younger.</i>

91
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:04,244
<i>He should address me as his ancestor.</i>

92
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:28,632
Lord Dong Hua.

93
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,264
Why have I returned before
the 60-year trial was over?

94
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,613
Have you changed my schedule?

95
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,232
I wouldn't dare do that.

96
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:42,955
This is indeed bizarre.

97
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,524
In the Book of Destiny
there was much written

98
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:48,581
but then the words suddenly vanished.

99
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:52,878
Perhaps, Your Lordship is unlike
any other deity.

100
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,008
You took the heavenly trial differently.

101
00:08:55,008 --> 00:09:00,316
Is there anything amiss after your
abrupt return to the Celestial Palace?

102
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,461
I've lost nine-tenths of my powers.

103
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:08,668
What?

104
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:16,740
It's perhaps because my heavenly trial
was cut short and now I'm being punished.

105
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,859
It will be fine in a few years.

106
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,346
Keep this matter to yourself.

107
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,370
No one is to hear of it.

108
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:28,639
Yes.

109
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:45,697
Since Little Princess has
repaid his kindness

110
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,144
you're no longer related
to Lord Dong Hua in any way.

111
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,028
Have some congee.

112
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,460
You lost so much
weight in the Mortal Realm.

113
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:57,883
Mi Gu, tell me.

114
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:02,941
I enraged Lord Dong Hua's
mortal self so much that he died.

115
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:07,884
Did I repay his kindness or
do I owe him more favors now?

116
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:10,967
Little Princess, if that's how you see it

117
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,243
this debt will be hard to figure out.

118
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:18,192
But if it can't be figured out,
I can't just let it go.

119
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,687
I'll say what you don't wish to hear.

120
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,586
Even if you do figure out this debt

121
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,807
could you really forget Lord Dong Hua?

122
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:40,552
Mi Gu, you really can read my mind.

123
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,825
Tell me.

124
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:47,294
Between me and him,
is it just repaying him for his kindness?

125
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,764
All those years we had together
in the Mortal Realm, what is that to him?

126
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:02,768
I often read the plays
in the Mortal Realm.

127
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:07,066
Some repaid kindness
and ended up together.

128
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:12,014
Others went their own ways
when the kindness was repaid.

129
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,327
Tell me...

130
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,158
What about me and Lord Dong Hua?

131
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,842
I was asking you. Why did you
throw the question back at me?

132
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,822
Father?

133
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,078
Where are you running off to?

134
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,453
I've beenunfiliall.

135
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,027
Father, please hit me.

136
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,025
Father!

137
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,133
I've done wrong!

138
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,756
Please don't hit me.

139
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,614
Second Brother, have some mercy.

140
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:43,027
Feng Jiu is the only girl
in the next generation of our family.

141
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:46,754
It won't do if you
beat her half to death!

142
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,206
Our family is totally embarrassed
by this lass anyway!

143
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:50,692
We might as well beat her to death!

144
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,586
That won't do!

145
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,871
Look, Second Brother.

146
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,940
Both Bai Xuan and I have no children.

147
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,408
Qian Qian's wedding
won't be held anytime soon.

148
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,658
When we pass on

149
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,384
the thrones of our five Far Lands
are to be handed over to Feng Jiu.

150
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:06,462
Please show her some mercy!

151
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,620
Auntie...

152
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,745
She already has a son.

153
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:13,999
- What?
- What?

154
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,346
The Crown Prince's son.

155
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:22,062
He's a stepson, but doesn't he
still count as her son?

156
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,563
You're talking about Ye Hua's son.

157
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:30,015
Feng Jiu, you nearly scared me to death.

158
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,345
Ye Hua already has a son?

159
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,232
Haven't you heard?

160
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,125
Someone did mention it to me.

161
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,970
A few hundred years ago
I met Ye Hua once.

162
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,605
I assisted him in pacifying
the unrest in the Far North.

163
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,245
He does have the demeanor
of an apparent heir.

164
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:54,282
Unfortunately, the Dragon Clan
is unlike us, the Nine-tailed Fox Clan.

165
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,188
They like to expand their harem.

166
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:59,602
Before Fifth Sister is married to him,
she already has a stepson.

167
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,481
He's a pampered first-born son.

168
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,813
That makes me quite displeased.

169
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,678
Since Fifth Sister was young,
she's fancied only High God Mo Yuan.

170
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:13,143
Who knows?

171
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,879
She might call off this engagement soon.

172
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,792
Come over here now!

173
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,317
Bai Yi, calm down and let it go.

174
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:32,773
Qian Qian is now alone in
the West Sea guarding Mo Yuan's spirit.

175
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:36,806
I'm worried that she might be bored,
so I'll send Feng Jiu over to her.

176
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,278
Shouldn't you go to the West Sea now
to keep your aunt company?

177
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,168
Yes, Fourth Uncle!

178
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,878
Thank goodness for Fourth Uncle...

179
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,565
You're Yuan Zhen?

180
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:10,831
Exactly.

181
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,724
Are you here to see my aunt?

182
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,057
She's not in the Fox Den.

183
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,363
No...

184
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,548
Yes...

185
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:21,164
Not exactly.

186
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,384
What is it exactly?

187
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:24,529
Speak quickly. I have matters to see to.

188
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,576
I'm actually here to see
the little princess.

189
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:33,336
In the Mortal Realm's Imperial Palace
you and I...

190
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,061
We're not involved in any way.

191
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:39,337
I actually don't feel anything for you.

192
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:42,982
At the bath?

193
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,995
There was a reason for what
I did at the bath.

194
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:50,597
Simply put, Lord Dong Hua and I had
a heavenly trial of love to overcome

195
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,363
but you were in the way.

196
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,758
That's good then...

197
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,664
Why have you returned?

198
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,357
You're done with your heavenly trial?

199
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,371
It wasn't supposed to end so soon.

200
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,602
Lord Dong Hua was
my father in the Mortal Realm

201
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:06,711
and he was so enraged by me that he died.

202
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,863
I had to die for my sins
in the Mortal Realm.

203
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:11,630
I've returned without finishing
my 60-year heavenly trial.

204
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,879
You were also affected by that?

205
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,511
I'm really sorry.

206
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,077
Not at all. It's quite
a blessing in disguise.

207
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,849
It's because of you and Lord Dong Hua

208
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,249
that I was able to return earlier
to Deity Duty.

209
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:28,885
I should thank
the little princess instead.

210
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,157
Don't bother.

211
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,807
If there's nothing else,
I should get going.

212
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,360
Oh no...

213
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,123
I forgot to ask her
to greet my mentor for me.

214
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,240
You returned after sensing
the divine energy?

215
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,082
Yes, Senior!
We spotted the divine energy!

216
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,397
Good!

217
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:50,285
Good! Are you all well?

218
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:53,763
- Yes! Yes, we're all well.
- We're all well.

219
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,356
Where is Zi Lan?

220
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,399
- Zi Lan?
- Zi Lan?

221
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,605
When the Ghost Lord said
that he saw Si Yin

222
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,820
he left the mountain.

223
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,594
Speaking of which,
it has already been days.

224
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:05,986
I wonder where he is right now.

225
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,325
Back in the day

226
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:11,861
he used to quibble
the most with Seventeenth.

227
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:17,509
Certainly, he would miss
Seventeenth the most.

228
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,643
- Exactly...
- Exactly.

229
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:51,776
70,000 years ago

230
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:55,653
Master sacrificed his spirit to
seal up the Bell of the East Emperor.

231
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:58,853
Ling Yu was killed at Ruoshui Riverbank.

232
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,499
Then Seventeenth disappeared
with Master's body.

233
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,325
Now that the divine energy
in Kunlun Mountain has soared

234
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:09,911
and the bells are chiming

235
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:12,156
all the disciples have rushed back
to Kunlun Mountain.

236
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:15,734
Although we don't know
when Master will return

237
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:19,608
he is a man of his word.

238
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:23,209
I believe that he will surely
restore Kunlun Mountain to glory!

239
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:56,864
Master, your disciples have returned!

240
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,949
Master! Your disciples have returned!

241
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:38,750
<i>When Riceball got drunk yesterday</i>

242
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,147
<i>Nai Nai said that
the little prince inherited</i>

243
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,545
<i>his father's poor capacity for wine.</i>

244
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:49,055
<i>One, two, three, four, five.
Five urns of wine?</i>

245
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,462
<i>He's not that bad at drinking.</i>

246
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,630
You're here for the Soul-gathering Lamp?

247
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,105
Come with me.

248
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:41,965
The lamp is here.

249
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,895
Put this at Die Yong's bedside
for three days.

250
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:50,217
Mo Yuan's soul will gather there.

251
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,356
You must remember that
throughout those three days

252
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,798
the light must not go out.

253
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:56,705
You can't use your powers to
protect it either.

254
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,346
You have to keep it lit by yourself.

255
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:02,157
I know. I'll be very cautious.

256
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,939
I worry for nothing.

257
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:10,468
You'll certainly take good care
of Mo Yuan dutifully.

258
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,563
Don't die...

259
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:30,902
There's an aura of mortals on this lamp.

260
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,548
This is...

261
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:39,299
I've used this lamp once.

262
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,683
I remember that Nai Nai told me

263
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:47,880
you once tried to use
this Soul-gathering Lamp

264
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,531
to put together
the body of Riceball's mother.

265
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:54,433
I'll take this lamp then.

266
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:10,147
I know that this lamp is
a sacred artifact of the Celestial Tribe.

267
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:14,507
Is it inappropriate
for you to give it to me so easily?

268
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,037
Before I came to borrow this lamp

269
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,750
I thought that borrowing this lamp
would make up for

270
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,574
whatever Qing Qiu and
the Celestial Tribe owe one another.

271
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:31,972
But now that you've given it
to me so easily...

272
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:36,336
I... I'm really touched.

273
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,875
You've helped me so much.

274
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,517
I should repay your kindness.

275
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:46,576
What is it you need?

276
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:49,836
Tell me. I'll do my best to help you.

277
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:53,468
There's nothing I want.

278
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:56,200
There really isn't anything you want?

279
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:01,999
Then... I'll head back now.

280
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,660
All I ever wanted...

281
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:14,012
All I want has always been just you.

282
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:20,278
You want... me?

283
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,088
Forget that I ever said it then.

284
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:27,256
I should head back now.

285
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,555
Ye Hua...

286
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:50,923
You...

287
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,321
You...

288
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,946
<i>What I think in the day
is reflected at night in my thoughts?</i>

289
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,829
<i>Do I already think of Ye Hua...
in such a lustful way?</i>

290
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,635
Where... Where are my clothes?

291
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:26,369
I find them troublesome,
so I took our clothes off with magic.

292
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:32,778
You... You...

293
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,431
You want to be with me?

294
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:39,737
I want to be with you.

295
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:56,613
<i>This might be the last time
I can have you all to myself.</i>

296
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:01,924
<i>Even if you might only have
Mo Yuan on your mind.</i>

297
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,941
You're not asleep yet?

298
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:29,009
I've often heard of your valiance
from my fourth brother.

299
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,477
He said that any battle
you are engaged in

300
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:35,545
no one has been able to defeat you.

301
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,169
How did you almost
get your spirit vanquished

302
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,057
in that war with the Mermaid Clan?

303
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:50,574
If I hadn't purposely let them win,
how could a mere mermaid hurt me?

304
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,915
Why would you do that?

305
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:01,876
All my life, I've never envied anyone.

306
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:04,712
Apart from my Uncle Sang Ji.

307
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,630
Have you heard that
he eloped with Shao Xing?

308
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:15,042
He and Shao Xing?

309
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,626
Have you forgotten?

310
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:19,269
I was involved in that.

311
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:24,500
My uncle sought love and found it.

312
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,839
It might have been a tough journey,
but it ended well.

313
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:37,281
The Heavenly Lord might dote on him
but he never made him the Crown Prince.

314
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:45,709
Without such a title,
it was easy for him to get away.

315
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:52,526
What about you?

316
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,492
Me?

317
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,005
Although I'm the Crown Prince

318
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:04,429
it's fortunate that the woman I love is
Qing Qiu's High God Bai Qian.

319
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:16,998
Qian Qian...

320
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:18,457
Yes?

321
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:25,991
If one day, someone took
your eyes...

322
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,228
Would you forgive him?

323
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,810
Who would dare take my eyes?

324
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,921
What if that man is me?

325
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,945
You?

326
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:56,223
If you really take my eyes,
it'll be over between us.

327
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:12,990
You must remember to keep that
Soul-gathering Lamp lit for three days.

328
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,256
You can't be even one hour short.

329
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,278
You can't use magical powers.

330
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,818
You have to watch it yourself.

331
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,268
I know.

332
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:28,284
I will be careful. Don't worry.

333
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,153
Sleep well.

334
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:51,208
When I'm gone, you mustn't
leave these bamboo woods.

335
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,588
All right.

336
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:55,534
If you're lonely, call my name
in the mirror.

337
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,354
But you must remember
not to leave this place.

338
00:28:58,354 --> 00:28:59,482
All right.

339
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:04,323
<i>Why does this mortal
look so much like me?</i>

340
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:11,218
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!

341
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:14,146
Ye Hua! Ye Hua...

342
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,865
Ye Hua!

343
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:19,441
Didn't your husband tell you
not to leave the woods?

344
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,553
Ye Hua!

345
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,318
<i>What's wrong with me recently?</i>

346
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:40,428
<i>I've been having such weird dreams.</i>

347
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:46,596
<i>Isn't this my room?</i>

348
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:48,416
<i>Did Ye Hua bring me back here?</i>

349
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:57,742
<i>Since Ye Hua and I share
a mutual affection</i>

350
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,584
<i>the engagement can't be called off now.</i>

351
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,847
- Emissary.
- Emissary.

352
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:21,353
Is the Crown Prince awake?

353
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,169
Emissary, His Highness has
returned to the Celestial Palace.

354
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,030
He's really busy.

355
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,035
Did he say when he will return?

356
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,816
He didn't say.

357
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,971
Aunt, Feng Jiu has returned.

358
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:50,355
My Xiao Jiu has finally returned?

359
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:51,679
How did it go?

360
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,508
Did you manage to repay
Lord Dong Hua's kindness?

361
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:59,097
I did do my part but I don't
know if I've repaid it all.

362
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:05,218
It seems that my little lass
is really hurt this time.

363
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:07,297
Where are you hurt?

364
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:10,643
Is it here?

365
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,192
Auntie...

366
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:17,297
You do know it all.

367
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,042
All right, hush now...

368
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:52,883
The divine fungal grass shouldn't
exist in the world anymore.

369
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,707
I'm willing to go and destroy it.

370
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,686
Ye Hua, even if the grass isn't destroyed
no one can get it easily.

371
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:13,655
Why bother wasting your effort
on such a matter?

372
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,057
The longer some things are left
in this world

373
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:19,537
the more possible
it is that they can cause damage.

374
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,511
You have a point.

375
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:29,163
Ye Hua, my stamina is failing.

376
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:32,502
I'm prepared to pass
the throne over to you

377
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:35,920
but I have yet to find
a good time to do it.

378
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,277
If you can defeat the
four mystical beasts...

379
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,820
Sure, I'll send you to destroy the divine
fungal grass to prevent further trouble.

380
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

381
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:01,845
Take 30,000 celestial soldiers with you.

382
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,148
I intend to go alone.

383
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,334
You wish to go alone?

384
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:08,415
Yes.

385
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,984
I wish to carry out the task quietly.

386
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:14,050
It will only cause trouble
should this be made known to others.

387
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,978
After all, the divine fungal grass
is a malicious magical plant.

388
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,818
Many others might secretly covet it.

389
00:33:19,818 --> 00:33:22,250
What about the four mystical beasts?

390
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,577
Can you tackle them?

391
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,636
I am to be the next Heavenly Lord.

392
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,385
If I can't even tackle
four mystical beasts

393
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:32,568
how can I win over
all the immortals of the realms?

394
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:36,307
I need only three days
to accomplish this task.

395
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:41,932
All right, three days it is.

396
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,989
I'll await your victorious return.

397
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,150
Yes.

398
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:02,598
Emissary?

399
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,721
Si Yin?

400
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:09,179
She's a woman.
How could she be Seventeenth?

401
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,958
Could she be Xuan Nu?

402
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,295
Speak up!

403
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,112
What are you doing in the West Sea?

404
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:26,918
Senior...

405
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,126
I am Seventeenth.

406
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,519
You really are Seventeenth?

407
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,126
You're Seventeenth?

408
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:50,344
I was too naughty then and
I took Master's body with me.

409
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:53,570
I was too ashamed to see
all of my seniors.

410
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:59,615
Seventeenth, you've kept us searching.

411
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:03,909
70,000 years and I've finally found you.

412
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:07,577
Senior...

413
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:12,833
Why would you disguise yourself
as a woman?

414
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,474
The maids said that
Zhe Yan's emissary is staying here.

415
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,432
Could that be you?

416
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:22,768
You've been in Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods
for the past 70,000 years?

417
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:27,518
I've always been a girl.

418
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:31,311
I only disguised myself as a man
to train in Kunlun Mountain.

419
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,742
What?

420
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:41,376
I'm Qing Qiu Fox King
Bai Zhi's youngest daughter, Bai Qian.

421
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:44,461
I've deceived my seniors and Master.

422
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,876
This is all my fault.

423
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,784
- You really are a woman?
- Yes.

424
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,748
You... you deceived us for so long.

425
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:59,420
Qing Qiu's Bai Qian...

426
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,454
Qing Qiu's Bai Qian...

427
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,797
No wonder hundreds of years ago

428
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,614
when Qing Cang was said to break out
of the bell once again

429
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:11,000
it was Qing Qiu's
Bai Qian who sealed him up.

430
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,617
She brought peace to
the realms once more.

431
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:19,393
Only a disciple of Kunlun Mountain
could have done that.

432
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,806
Good! Well done!

433
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:27,228
Seventeenth, answer me.

434
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,275
Where is Master's body?

435
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:33,590
Do you know that the divine energy
has soared in Kunlun Mountain?

436
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,559
It's a sign that Master will soon return.

437
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,550
There are signs in
Kunlun Mountain already?

438
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,199
You already knew that
Master is returning?

439
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:43,643
I did.

440
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:54,797
Ye Hua said that as long as I stay up

441
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,242
to safeguard the Soul-gathering Lamp
for three days

442
00:36:57,242 --> 00:36:59,010
Master will be able to wake up.

443
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,092
Is Master's spirit really inside
the body of my brother?

444
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:04,557
I've used spirit-tracking magic
to verify it.

445
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,157
It's absolutely true.

446
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:11,000
It's no wonder that my brother has
been ill for 600 years without a reason.

447
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,932
He's actually been hosting
Master's spirit.

448
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:18,581
What happens after Master's
spirit fragments are all gathered?

449
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:23,153
Zhe Yan said that
he knows what to do next.

450
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:39,652
Auntie, I've borrowed their kitchen
to make you a few dishes.

451
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:40,871
Come and try them now.

452
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:48,248
Our Xiao Jiu is the best,
especially her culinary skills.

453
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:50,831
That month when you were away,
I missed you terribly.

454
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:53,588
My parents always said that
leaving me behind in Qing Qiu

455
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,282
caused Auntie great trouble.

456
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:58,356
It seems that I'm the one who is
having a hard time looking after my aunt.

457
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:00,416
Yes, this is the right flavor.

458
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:04,177
I heard from Mi Gu that
while I was away

459
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:07,005
it was the Crown Prince
who cooked for you?

460
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:11,161
Yes, he's had a hard time.

461
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:13,934
Auntie, are you blushing?

462
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,889
How rude!

463
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,547
Are you teasing me?

464
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,507
Auntie, you're in love.

465
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,773
Let me pour you some wine.

466
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:26,978
Congratulations to the iron tree that
finally blossomed and found true love.

467
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:30,206
Her true love is actually
her future husband.

468
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:31,842
How perfect.

469
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,387
Thank you for the well wishes
but I can't have the wine.

470
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:36,739
Why not?

471
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,945
Don't you always drink
whether you're happy or not?

472
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,032
Moreover, haven't you already located
High God Mo Yuan's spirit?

473
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:44,976
You should have the wine.

474
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:49,347
I have to stay awake for three days to
keep an eye on this Soul-gathering Lamp

475
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:51,204
so I can't drink any wine.

476
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:04,661
I brought this Soul-gathering Lamp
for High God Mo Yuan in the first place.

477
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,630
Who knew that after all this time
it would still came in handy?

478
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,355
How did you get it?

479
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,666
Ye Hua brought it here to me.

480
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,204
The Crown Prince gave it to you?

481
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:17,467
Exactly.

482
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:21,985
<i>Since the Crown Prince is willing to
give this lamp away</i>

483
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,061
<i>he must have moved on from Su Su.</i>

484
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,882
<i>He should... treat my aunt well.</i>

485
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,297
What is it, Xiao Jiu?

486
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:38,005
I'm just wondering if this
Soul-gathering Lamp is that powerful.

487
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,251
Don't underestimate this lamp.

488
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:44,768
Look. Am I not using it to
repair my mentor's spirit now?

489
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:51,342
You're right.

490
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:18,166
At this time of the year
osmanthus blooms in the palace.

491
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,307
A-Li always gets a rash
from the pollen.

492
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:24,313
Be sure to boil water with okra
and use that water to wipe his body.

493
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:25,771
That will relieve the symptoms.

494
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,849
The Crown Prince reminds me
to do that every year.

495
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,215
Nai Nai won't forget it.

496
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:34,813
You may be dismissed.

497
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:45,751
Your Highness, the four mystical beasts
are quite spiritually trained.

498
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,659
Why don't you ask the Heavenly Lord
to deploy the celestial guards?

499
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,041
I don't wish to alert too many people.

500
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,710
My Lord, please allow me to go
to Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea with you.

501
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,300
Although I'm not as powerful

502
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,748
I can still hold the beasts off
in an emergency.

503
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:04,373
With your level of cultivation,
you wouldn't be much help to me.

504
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,809
I must get the divine fungal grass.

505
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,900
Should I fail to return in three days

506
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,693
you must not allow anyone
near Yingzhou again.

507
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,090
Especially Qing Qiu's High God Bai Qian.

508
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:26,853
Do you understand?

509
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:30,188
- Yes.
- Yes.

510
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:41,472
