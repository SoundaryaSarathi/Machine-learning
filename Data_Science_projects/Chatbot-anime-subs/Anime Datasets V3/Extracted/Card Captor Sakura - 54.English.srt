1
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,418
All done

2
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:20,222
Big Brother, breakfast is ready!

3
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,627
– Dad!
– Good morning!

4
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:30,140
Good morning!
What’s that? Calendar?

5
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:32,934
A really old one…

6
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,144
That’s right.

7
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:40,074
Nadeshiko had it
when she was still a model.

8
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,020
Say, is it alright if I keep this?

9
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,756
Of course.
Alright!

10
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:52,026
Thanks!

11
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,167
Breakfast is done so
come down when you’re ready!

12
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,558
OK!

13
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:10,538
[Sakura and the Calendar of Memories]

14
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,721
What’s it?
That’s Mother’s…

15
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:27,697
Yeah! Her calendar.

16
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:30,834
I found it while
I was cleaning the room earlier.

17
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,743
Brother, your brithday is written here

18
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,622
It is written there because my birthday

19
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,149
comes one every four years.

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,227
Years when his birthday
wasn’t written on calendars,

21
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:58,653
mother used to big signs.

22
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,663
My birthday is written here too!

23
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:09,233
Thanks Mom.

24
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,906
– Thanks for the meal.
– I’ve to go too.

25
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,440
Goodbye.

26
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:19,580
I’m off!

27
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:25,630
Good morning!

28
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:27,097
Good morning!

29
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,394
Good morning!

30
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:31,702
Good morning!

31
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,099
Good morning, Tomoyo.

32
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,721
Good morning!

33
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:35,722
Good morning!

34
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:40,842
Did something good happen?

35
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,630
Can you tell?

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,243
I can guess if it’s about you.

37
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,213
It was a calendar that my mother used.

38
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:51,407
I see.

39
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:53,516
Calenders you see,

40
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:56,916
A long time ago,
there were written on the ground…

41
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,887
but as it was written on the ground,

42
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,522
the wind would blow over it
and the rain would fall on top of it
making it disappear.

43
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:03,256
Or a wandering dog or cat would

44
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,187
walk over it making
the markings unreadable,

45
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,653
so it was troublesome.

46
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:07,924
Therefore,

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,666
in order to help preserve the calendar

48
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,867
employment for the so called
Calendar Watch was created.

49
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:19,835
There he goes with lies again.

50
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:23,405
– He has a creative imagination.
– Good morning.

51
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,327
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

52
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:28,112
Good morning.

53
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:29,959
Good morning.

54
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,414
Hiiragizawa, you know too, right?

55
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:33,654
About the calendar.

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,362
You know, Hiiragizawa-kun

57
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,224
isn’t like you so he doesn’t lie.

58
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,093
I know about it very well.

59
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:48,839
In ancient Europe,

60
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,132
everyone yearned for a position
in the Calender Watch.

61
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:54,603
And then, anyone who tried
to deface the calendar

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,670
would be severely punished, right?

63
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:58,406
Yes,

64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,318
there are many account of the calendar
in history books.

65
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,247
The most

66
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,516
famous calendar

67
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,322
has to be the one in Egypt

68
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,923
which spans 100 km.

69
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,530
That’s probably the working
of extraterrestrials.

70
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,590
I think we’ll be good friends,

71
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,163
Hiragizawa-kun.

72
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:21,100
Likewise.

73
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,367
– So, it is true?
– I don’t think so.

74
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,745
It looks like Hiiragizawa-kun

75
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:29,604
and Yamazzaki-kun are the same type.

76
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,683
It must’ve been hard
for people back then.

77
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:20,854
Why don’t you try playing with me?

78
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,542
You’re doing very well, Touya.

79
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,372
You’re pretty good, Touya.

80
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,116
I don’t think I’ve
heard that piece before…

81
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,681
It’s a piece that
my mother composed.

82
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,221
It’s a very beautiful melody.

83
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:44,533
– Yuki… 
– What’s it?

84
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,335
– I… I
– That’s so great!

85
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,419
So great, so great!!

86
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,646
Touya, you’re so good
at playing the piano!

87
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,556
Ah, Tsukishiro-kun.

88
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,760
The archery club president
was calling for you.

89
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,489
There was something he wanted
to ask you about the contest.

90
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,161
Thanks.

91
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,766
Then I guess I’ll be leaving, Touya.

92
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:18,001
There’s so many thing written here.

93
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,105
I wonder if this one’s for work.

94
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,643
Brother’s birthday is here.

95
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,821
Tomoyo’s mother’s birthday!!

96
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,686
If I had known about it earlier,

97
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,528
I could have given her a present.

98
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:40,993
I’ll remember next time
and be sure to give her something!

99
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,806
Grandfather… Mom’s?

100
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,534
That means, he’s my
great-grandfather?

101
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:01,278
I wonder what

102
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,117
he was like…

103
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,327
– I’m home.
– Welcome home.

104
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:19,134
– Dad, dad… 
– Yes…

105
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,768
Today is Great-grandfather’s
birthday, right?

106
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,200
Yes, it seems so.

107
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:31,048
Hey,

108
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:36,044
mom gave him presents, right?

109
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:38,153
Mother’s presents

110
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,717
were always hand-made.

111
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,424
But I thought Mom

112
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:45,227
was bad at cooking and sewing…

113
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:48,227
Yes, but mother

114
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,830
put all her effort into making them.

115
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:53,664
Hey, is Grandfather still?

116
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:54,864
He’s very lively,

117
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,437
but I still haven’t had
a chance to meet him.

118
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:58,600
Why not?

119
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,504
Because Grandfather

120
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:05,280
cherished Mother with all his heart.

121
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,179
I’m

122
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,212
the bad guy

123
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:10,643
who stole Mother away from him…

124
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,891
My Dad is not a bad guy!

125
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:17,586
I don’t

126
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,792
remember anything about Mom at all

127
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:21,357
…but she always

128
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,791
looks so happy in the photos!

129
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:26,167
And if you two weren’t here,

130
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,028
I would’ve never been born…

131
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,032
…and I wouldn’t be so happy now!

132
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:32,910
Thanks!

133
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,116
That’s it!

134
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,959
Is it alright if
I make something for Grandfather?

135
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,628
A hand-made present like Mom used to do!

136
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,532
Something I made might be no good.

137
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,995
– Of course not.
– That’s good.

138
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,474
Ah! I might not make it
even if I start right now!

139
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,543
If you do your best,
you could have something

140
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:07,843
made by tonight.

141
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:10,238
But we won’t be able
to get it to him by tonight.

142
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,009
It is alright.

143
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,442
There’s a person who will be able
to deliver the present.

144
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:20,284
Grandfather will surely be happy.

145
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,516
Is it alright like this?

146
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,224
Yes, now bind it here and here.

147
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:05,301
– Ow!
– Are you OK?

148
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:08,661
Yeah, I’ll do my best.

149
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,907
It’s all done.

150
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:23,217
It’s all done, done done!

151
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:24,713
It’s all done!

152
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,082
Hey, hey,

153
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,686
how did Mom deliver her presents?

154
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:34,562
She sent a letter and some nadesico
flowers with the present.

155
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,861
Flowers!?

156
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,367
Hoe!! The flower shops is closed already!!

157
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:43,198
That’s it.

158
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,308
I’m home.

159
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:51,006
Play the organ for me!

160
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,543
It’s great Grandfather’s birthday today!

161
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:53,975
Play that melody

162
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:55,374
that Mom composed

163
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,846
and record it to tape!

164
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,454
Please play for us.

165
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,424
I see, then today is.

166
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,469
Kero, Kero!!

167
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,370
What are you going playing around?

168
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,179
I wanna make some flowers!

169
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,413
Great-grandfather’s birthday huh?

170
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,915
But you told me before

171
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,281
that I can only use

172
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:35,558
the Sakura cards

173
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,025
when I really need to.

174
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,022
Can I use the magic
to make some flowers?

175
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,435
Do you really want to make them?

176
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,597
No matter what happens?

177
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:55,176
Go for it…

178
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,138
If these are your true feelings,

179
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:59,574
then your magic won’t rampant again.

180
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,082
O Key which hides the power of the stars,

181
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,683
reveal thy true form before me.

182
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:13,128
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

183
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,131
Release!

184
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:31,340
Flower!

185
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:56,666
You did it!

186
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,043
They all understand.

187
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,946
Dad, Mom, and my brother,

188
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,384
they understand that I’m happy…

189
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:18,352
Calling for me

190
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,730
was a good idea, Teacher.

191
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:27,534
Grandfather’s birthday… is it?

192
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,969
Nadesico gave him one every year.

193
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,944
Birthday present.

194
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,814
Home made gifts to which

195
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,205
even empty words cannot be made to
lie in describing their looks…

196
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,049
and a letter written describing
her happiness

197
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,912
after getting married to
teacher Kinomoto, and…

198
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:45,950
…nadesico flowers…

199
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,686
This is something Sakura made,
not just anybody.

200
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:54,028
So I’ll have it delivered
to grandfather tonight!

201
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:55,761
Thank you.

202
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:04,633
I see.
It was ok to ask Tomoyo’s mom…

203
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,033
I hope Grandfather

204
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:09,846
will be happy with me…

205
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,822
Yes, Kinomoto Residence.

206
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:32,398
Ah, Sonomi kun.

207
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,006
Thank you for yesterday.

208
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:38,765
Sakura was happy as well.

209
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,470
Eh?
Grandfather?

210
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

211
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,765
No, I’m sorry that I called you
out on such short notice.

212
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,473
Not at all.

213
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:13,809
Please sit.

214
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,980
I’m sorry I didn’t come by more often.

215
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:26,620
How many years has it been?

216
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,318
This is the first time since

217
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:32,122
we gave you the letter of
invitation to our wedding.

218
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,262
Has it been that long already…

219
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,167
I got it,

220
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,636
from Sonomi-san.

221
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:46,209
It was a heart-filled letter.

222
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:50,145
Nadesico was so happy,

223
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:51,880
and now Sakura

224
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,682
is happy as well…

225
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,514
Can you deliver this to
Sakura and Touya?

226
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,052
In return for the gift.

227
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:06,694
They’ll be happy to receive it.

228
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,764
You…

229
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:20,743
There’s something I’ve been meaning
to tell you for a while now.

230
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:25,879
Thank you.

231
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:30,585
And,
I’m sorry.

232
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:38,826
I knew it all along.

233
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,291
You were the one Nadesico chose

234
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,959
and that you would make her happy,

235
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,802
more than anybody else…

236
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:49,102
But…

237
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,371
Nadesico-san

238
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:55,476
was still sixteen…

239
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,213
On top of that,

240
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,286
I was a new, naive teacher.

241
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:04,252
So I didn’t know how much
pain I could possibly cause.

242
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,903
It was only natural

243
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,425
that you wouldn’t give your precious
granddaughter to someone like that.

244
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:18,001
No, I was just being stubborn.

245
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:21,567
I was so lonely when
she left me all of a sudden.

246
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:28,204
I wish I could have told her as well,

247
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:31,773
that she had chosen a great partner

248
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:41,083
My grand daughter
was the happiest in the world.

249
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,298
I’m sure

250
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:55,103
she’s listening… somewhere.

251
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:11,951
I’m home.

252
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:20,286
– Welcome home.
– What’s this?

253
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:24,962
Ah, this is for you and
Touya from grandfather.

254
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:29,052
Saying thank you for the birthday gift.

255
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,001
Is grandfather here?

256
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:32,332
Where? Where?

257
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,472
No, a runner delivered it.

258
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,743
Ah, is that right?
But he was happy for me.

259
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:41,149
I’m glad.

260
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,852
Can I open it?
Of course.

261
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,489
Yours is the one on the bottom.

262
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,192
Why don’t you try it on?

263
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,659
What is this?

264
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,879
What is it this time?

265
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,212
Ahh, it is the clothes
from the time we went to resort.

266
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:22,724
Putting it aside,
and not even saying a word.

267
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,230
Looks good.

268
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,835
I wonder if Grandfather acknowledged…

269
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:38,366
How mother was happy,

270
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:41,911
– and how we’re all happy… 
– Yes.

271
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:45,074
Do you think we will get
to meet Grandfather someday?

272
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,142
Of course.

273
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:54,851
That’s great, right? Mom.
