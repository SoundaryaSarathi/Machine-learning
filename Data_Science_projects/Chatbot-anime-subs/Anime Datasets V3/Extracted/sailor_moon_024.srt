1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,458
Sometimes, a girl can't stop loving,
even if she knows better.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,805
She'll find a love she
wants to believe in,

3
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:09,574
no matter how painful it is.

4
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,701
A girl always wants to believe
that love conquers all.

5
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:14,273
If there's anyone who tries
to get in their way...

6
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:19,676
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish them!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

8
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

10
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

11
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,293
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

12
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

13
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

16
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,479
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

17
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:00,223
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

18
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,358
and fight against bad guys.

19
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:06,522
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

20
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:12,568
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

21
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,805
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

22
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:18,501
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

23
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,976
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

24
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,018
Naru's Cry! Nephrite Dies For Love

25
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,406
Say, Naru, I think it would be better
if you forget about him.

26
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:53,876
I can't.

27
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,178
What?

28
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:58,238
No matter how bad he is,
I still love him.

29
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,141
Oh, boy...

30
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,721
Usagi, you have someone
you love, don't you?

31
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:09,122
What? Me? Well, yeah.

32
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:13,384
Then, you should understand
how I feel.

33
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:21,666
Naru Osaka. Why did the Black
Crystal respond to that girl?

34
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:25,602
Was that the energy of love?

35
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,045
I will protect Mr. Sanjoin!

36
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,081
Because I love him. I love him
with all my heart, so...

37
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,651
It's ridiculous!

38
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:50,697
Sailor Moon knew that girl's name.

39
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:55,493
That girl must know Sailor
Moon's true identity.

40
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,463
Just you watch, Sailor Moon!

41
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,543
I've found it.

42
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,547
So, that is the Black Crystal
that's supposed to reveal

43
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,071
the location of the Silver Crystal.

44
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,479
Jewelry

45
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,528
The Black Crystal is responding again.

46
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:27,369
This girl...

47
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:32,901
Could the Silver Crystal be something
inside a human body?

48
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,275
No.

49
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,271
The Silver Crystal is not
inside this girl.

50
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,657
Mr. Sanjoin?

51
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:28,629
Masato Sanjoin is only a disguise.
My real name is Nephrite.

52
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,430
I do not want to lie
to you anymore.

53
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:36,533
Please just stay there and listen.

54
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,341
Okay.

55
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,606
You are a wonderful girl.

56
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:48,613
Thanks to you, I have learned what
love is for the first time.

57
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:52,014
In the evil organization I have been
a part of, there is no love.

58
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,553
We betray each other and kill each
other for our own gain.

59
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:06,697
I thought that was normal,
but your love opened my eyes.

60
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,507
Now, I am thinking that I would
like to join Sailor Moon

61
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:14,067
to fight against the evil organization.

62
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:19,341
If you know anything about Sailor
Moon, please tell me.

63
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:23,218
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything.

64
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,187
Can you not trust me?

65
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:32,559
No! I trust you! But I really,
really know nothing!

66
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:36,831
I see, I'm sorry to hear that.

67
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:41,198
Oh, please wait!

68
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,372
Mr. Nephrite...

69
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:54,046
If this girl knows who Sailor Moon is,

70
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,881
she is certain to contact her somehow.

71
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,414
Oh, my, what a foolish man.

72
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,283
Has he fallen in love
with a human girl?

73
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:07,362
Master Zoisite!

74
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:11,466
You three, I believe you've heard
everything you need to know.

75
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:13,169
What a stupid man.

76
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,437
Let's attack him now!

77
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:18,774
Now, be patient. Nephrite
is a superb warrior.

78
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:21,208
We don't want to get hurt by making
any ill-planned moves.

79
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:26,408
We'll take that girl as a hostage
and lure him out.

80
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:28,650
Yes, Sir.

81
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:35,019
How can I find out where
Sailor Moon is?

82
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,226
Usagi! Phone call!

83
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:45,065
Who in the world is calling me
in the middle of night?

84
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,002
Hello?

85
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,275
Hello?!

86
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,142
Usagi, I'm sorry for calling you so late.

87
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:57,944
Naru!

88
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,715
What's wrong?

89
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,816
I just thought you're the only
one I could talk to.

90
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,956
Did something happen?

91
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:15,628
Mr. Sanjoin... Mr. Sanjoin is
looking for Sailor Moon.

92
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,665
What?

93
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:24,868
Mr. Sanjoin is in trouble, but
I can't do anything for him.

94
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,165
What's wrong with Mr. Sanjoin?

95
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,838
Naru, are you crying?

96
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,643
I'm sorry for making such a weird call
to you in the middle of night.

97
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,417
I'm okay now.

98
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,020
But...

99
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,822
Really, I'm okay.

100
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:43,292
I feel calmer now after talking
to you, Usagi. Thank you.

101
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,759
Are you sure?

102
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,861
Usagi?

103
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:51,055
I'll bet Nephrite is closing
in on Naru!

104
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:54,703
You're too slow!
I'll going on ahead!

105
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:57,206
Hey, I'm not a cat!

106
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:58,440
Hurry up and come, okay!

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,907
I know that!

108
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,706
Oh, what is this?!

109
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:08,918
I know! It's must be the work of
a monster! Where are you?!

110
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:12,285
Show yourselves! Come on!

111
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:20,024
Okay, then! Moon Prism
Power Makeup!

112
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,692
You have finally revealed
yourself, Sailor Moon!

113
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,006
Nephrite!

114
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:09,801
The true identity of Sailor Moon is
Usagi Tsukino. I saw it clearly.

115
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,512
No way!

116
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,246
Please! Don't tell anybody that I'm
Sailor Moon! Okay?! Please?!

117
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,524
There is no need for you
to hide it anymore.

118
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,982
Not exactly. So, please?

119
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:29,693
Do not worry you are
going to die here!

120
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
I don't wanna die!

121
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:47,650
Someone...

122
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,813
Prepare yourself, Sailor Moon!

123
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,758
Defeat is not befitting of the
beautiful Sailor Moon.

124
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,727
I shall be your opponent!

125
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:02,125
Tuxedo Mask!

126
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,238
Help! Mr. Nephrite!

127
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,008
That voice is...

128
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,310
What's wrong, Nephrite?

129
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:18,379
We shall conclude this
fight another time.

130
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,317
Sailor Moon, I know who
you are now!

131
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:24,912
I will be able to attack you at
any time now! Be ready!

132
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:31,854
What'll I do?! He knows who I am!

133
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:36,031
Do not give up just because he
knows who you are now.

134
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,498
Good-bye.

135
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,898
Tuxedo Mask...

136
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:48,467
Jewelry

137
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:52,804
Oh, no! I need to contact
the sailor warriors!

138
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,619
Hand over the Black Crystal
in exchange for the girl?

139
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,851
One of Zoisite's minions...

140
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:11,322
That idiot! Who cares what
happens to that girl?!

141
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,672
Hurry up, Nephrite.

142
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:53,164
Will he really come for this human?

143
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:57,914
Well, if he doesn't show up,
we'll just kill the girl.

144
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,712
Poor thing. She's scared.

145
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,092
Mr. Nephrite!

146
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:11,960
Die!

147
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,003
Did we get him?!

148
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:42,392
I will never hand over the Black
Crystal to you guys!

149
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:44,121
Tell that to Zoisite!

150
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:04,112
Mr. Nephrite, thank you.

151
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,483
You do not need to thank me.

152
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:09,975
I do not even really understand
why I rescued you.

153
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,984
And I have kept deceiving
you for a long time.

154
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,260
I may continue to lie to you,
even after this.

155
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,697
That's okay.

156
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:25,093
If you'll just stay close to me,

157
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:28,463
I don't mind being lied to.

158
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,541
Oh, no! You're injured!

159
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,475
It's okay.

160
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,042
No, it's not! You were hurt
because of me!
It's okay.

161
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,340
No, it's not! You were hurt
because of me!

162
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,910
It would be bad if those scary people
come back, so come this way.

163
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,810
Now, take your jacket off.

164
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:46,555
Okay.

165
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,770
In San-chome,

166
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,738
there's a place that serves really
good chocolate parfaits.

167
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:08,543
Chocolate parfaits?

168
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,870
Yes. You don't like them?

169
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,181
Oh, no, I like them.

170
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,584
You're lying.

171
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:22,215
See? Sometimes we lie with
kind intentions, too.

172
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,263
Thank you.

173
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:32,793
I always thought it would be nice
to go to there one day

174
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:37,996
and have a chocolate
parfait with you.

175
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,034
It's a little dream of mine.

176
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,371
It sounds good.
Let's do it someday.

177
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,181
Really?

178
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,884
Do you think I'm lying?

179
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,853
Not at all. I'm so happy!

180
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,493
Oh, come to think of it,

181
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,553
does the evil organization give
you Sundays off, too?

182
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,837
You laughed!

183
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,747
It's weird. My eyes are tearing.

184
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,366
Mr. Nephrite!

185
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,604
You let your guard down.

186
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:46,533
Those thorns will keep sucking
your energy until you die!

187
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:51,173
What a miserable way to die.

188
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:56,250
If you do not want us to kill the girl,
hand over the Black Crystal!

189
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,244
Very well.

190
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,224
Hurry, run!

191
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:01,391
No!
Hurry, run!

192
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,125
No!

193
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:02,725
No!
Run!

194
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:03,126
Run!

195
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:03,626
No! No!
Run!

196
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,495
No! No!

197
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,263
You idiot! Run!

198
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:08,730
No!

199
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,935
Do you think you can pull them out
with the strength of a human?

200
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,212
Hurry! Hurry up and run!

201
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,123
That's enough. It's okay.

202
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,300
What?!

203
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,806
Impossible!

204
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:55,269
Mr. Nephrite, please don't die!

205
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,777
Damn it, I'll take care of both
of them at once!

206
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,717
Die!

207
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,962
Are you okay?

208
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,496
Mr. Nephrite!

209
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:31,681
Good work, all of you. The Black
Crystal is mine now.

210
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:34,917
You should be happy to able to
die with the girl you love.

211
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,078
You guys make sure to have
plenty of fun with them.

212
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:39,621
You coward.

213
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,660
Are you ready?

214
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:47,997
Run!

215
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,464
No!

216
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,267
Hold it right there!

217
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:59,672
You're really mean, trying to interfere
with two people in love!

218
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,509
Sailor warriors!

219
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,211
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

220
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,079
Stand under a cold waterfall and
reflect on your conduct!

221
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,521
In the name of Mars,
I will chastise you!

222
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:17,324
We will take care of you
guys first! Die!

223
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:25,695
Bubble

224
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,705
Spray!

225
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,946
Now!

226
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:37,680
What?!

227
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,448
Where are you?!
What?!

228
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:39,142
Where are you?!

229
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:47,652
Fire

230
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,428
Moon Tiara

231
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,895
Soul!

232
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:55,563
Action!

233
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,285
Mr. Nephrite...

234
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,222
Sailor Moon...

235
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:20,323
Yes?

236
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:23,451
It looks like your identity
may remain a secret.

237
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:27,825
No, please don't die!

238
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,135
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,704
What?

240
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:39,038
I don't think we'll get to eat a
chocolate parfait together.

241
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,345
No...

242
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,713
I have ended up lying to you
to the very end.

243
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:53,521
Please forgive me.

244
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:03,522
I'm glad I met you.

245
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,770
Mr. Nephrite?

246
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:21,575
No! You can't! You promised!

247
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:25,446
You said we'd eat a chocolate
parfait together!

248
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,896
No!

249
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:52,177
This is... This isn't fair!

250
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,546
Mr. Nephrite!

251
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:12,891
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne

252
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:19,767
Hoshi tachi ni mamorarete

253
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,021
Tomodachi no toki ni wa ki ni sezu

254
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,159
Nanigenaku hanashite ita kedo

255

Anata dake ki ni naru
shunkan ga atta no

256

Motto kirei ni ima sugu naritai

257

Koi suru to nanika ga kawaru ne

258
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:12,024
Me o tojite tashikamete

259
