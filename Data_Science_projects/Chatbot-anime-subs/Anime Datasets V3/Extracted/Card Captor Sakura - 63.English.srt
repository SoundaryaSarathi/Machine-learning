1
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:18,087
These are for the children,
and these are for the adults.

2
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,460
Please put them on
your hand before you go in.

3
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:27,366
Great!

4
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,007
Sakura-chan is very cute.

5
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:11,750
Excuse me, I would like
to buy #128 please!

6
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,950
[Sakura and Swimming Pool
and Big Waves]

7
00:01:56,763 --> 00:02:00,255
Being able to videotape
Sakura-chan in a bathing suit

8
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,929
in the winter is very good.
It’s like I’m in a dream!

9
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,161
It’s very very fun.

10
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:07,270
We are very lucky because we get
to come here to go swimming.

11
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,969
Right, Tomoyo-chan?

12
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,804
You’re right!

13
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,708
Because I’ll be able to videotape you in
a bathing suit any time from now on!

14
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,650
I’m not coming here to swim only!

15
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:24,053
Wearing the swimming suit that
I made would be like a Sakura fish.

16
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,757
I’m too happy!

17
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,725
Sakura-chan! Tomoyo-chan!

18
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,025
Come over here and swim!

19
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,237
Yamazaki-kun, lets go swimming ok?

20
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,794
I’m going to let go ok, Rika-chan?

21
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,059
Go! Go!

22
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,032
Rika-chan looks like she really
knows how to swim.

23
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:19,371
That is because Sakura-chan
is teaching her since summer vacations.

24
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:31,717
Great! Great!

25
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,625
You can swim really
good by yourself!

26
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,228
Really?

27
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:40,891
It’s true, Rika-chan!

28
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,765
You really know how to swim!

29
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,461
She also knows how to swim underwater.

30
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,768
The way you swim is very pretty.

31
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,341
That’s because Sakura-chan
is a very good teacher.

32
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,248
It’s because you are a very good learner.

33
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,386
No, it is because you are a good teacher.

34
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,090
Swimming by myself, I couldn’t
swim at all! I swam very bad.

35
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:27,043
Shao Lan-kun and
Eriol-kun are really good!

36
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,982
They both swim very fast!

37
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:34,175
Hiiragizawa-kun and
Li-kun are the same

38
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,054
Because they are racing.

39
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,992
This kind of race is for time.

40
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,196
Before, me and Hiragizawa-kun
swam together.

41
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:52,069
But after swiming for a while,
Li-kun came.

42
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,243
So, Hiragizawa-kun
and Li-kun decided to race.

43
00:04:58,811 --> 00:04:59,800
Why?

44
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,841
Because of what they’re
feeling in their hearts.

45
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:04,943
Nothing!

46
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:13,154
So, talking about swimming races,

47
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,760
The earliest time is in Britain
there were 2 gentlemen

48
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,896
that were racing at the Taylor River.
It was in the winter.

49
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,734
So it was very cold.

50
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,067
There was also a lot of fog

51
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:31,074
So they couldn’t see, and they
couldn’t hear so the results were urgent…

52
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,340
Yes Yes!
Lets go over to the pool ok?

53
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:39,542
So the most popular
was the batman’s umbrella.

54
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,479
Talking about how
to use the umbrella…

55
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,086
It is heard that, just opening 
an umbrella can remove the fog.

56
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:51,062
Yamazaki-kun is the kind of person
that likes to make up stories.

57
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:52,622
Really.

58
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,222
So who won the race?

59
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,548
You can’t be too anxious.

60
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:16,388
You should stay calm. Then your potential
can get to the highest level.

61
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,284
But about swimming…

62
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:22,019
To protect the one
who is important to you…

63
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:40,910
You won right?
Why don’t you rest?

64
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:42,245
OK

65
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,609
Shao Lan-kun, will you come up here too?

66
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,485
Shao Lan-kun?

67
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,508
Shao Lan-kun!

68
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,787
Are you OK, Shao Lan-kun?

69
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,523
What’s wrong?
You were staring off into space!

70
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,569
Right! I heard that this place’s
cream soda is really good.

71
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,197
Do you want to go and try some?

72
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,906
Last time it was on the magazine.

73
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,738
It also said that it tastes really good!

74
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,137
That’s right!

75
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,447
Let’s go then.

76
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,648
Sakura-chan do you want to come too?

77
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,315
Ok, lets go?

78
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,821
Everybody wants a cream soda right?

79
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:04,891
Yeah, Cream Soda.

80
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,825
I also want a cream soda.

81
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,292
I do too.

82
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:13,402
Yesterday Kero-chan saw the
magazine that talked about cream soda.

83
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,802
Really?

84
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,868
I told him that
I am coming to swim here today.

85
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:20,008
He kept on begging me to bring him along.

86
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,149
I told him that Chiharu-chan will come, so
he couldn’t come, but he kept on begging.

87
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:30,886
So, Kero-chan kept on saying that
he wanted to come, maybe he snuck in.

88
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:32,884
I don’t think so!

89
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:43,466
She kept on saying,
“You can’t come”.

90
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,074
She underestimated me.

91
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,618
So, I snuck into her
swimming suit bag for a second.

92
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:03,481
Sakura-chan wouldn’t even
think that I came!

93
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,593
Because she didn’t let me come, she will
know the power of me!

94
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,121
Wait for me, Cream soda!

95
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,695
I’m so smart! I’m so smart!

96
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,199
Mommy!

97
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,910
Cream Soda, Cream soda,

98
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,672
Cream soda, Cream soda!

99
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,677
Do you want to order anything else?

100
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:34,375
Welcome!

101
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:36,713
Yukito-san!

102
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:37,920
Hello.

103
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,451
How come you are here?

104
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:41,960
I’m working here, Touya is here too.

105
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,257
Thank you very much.

106
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:49,957
Brother!

107
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:51,826
Sakura?

108
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:53,831
Watch out!

109
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:57,074
Touya-kun! I’ve came to help you!

110
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:02,074
You don’t need to!
I can do this by myself!

111
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,778
Stop it! Were here to work together!

112
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,243
So you can really help me!

113
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,379
Let go of me!

114
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,358
I don’t want to!
Your younger sister is also very cute.

115
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:26,894
What do you want?

116
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,304
Cream Soda!

117
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,939
– Me too.
– Me too.

118
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:31,640
Me too!

119
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,644
One cream soda.

120
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,045
This bar code can be used
for other things also!

121
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:46,915
That’s right, when you guys leave
then you can take off the bracelet.

122
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,025
I would also like a cream soda please!

123
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:53,465
OK!

124
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,123
He is…

125
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:15,545
Right! I would like
to thank you for last time!

126
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,120
No problem!

127
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,290
Yukito-san, you know Eriol-kun?

128
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:25,327
Last time I was in the schools yard,
I fell asleep and he helped me.

129
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,355
Excuse me!

130
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:29,132
OK! I’m going over there.

131
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:31,902
So it happened like that?

132
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,070
I just did what is right.

133
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,239
But helping a someone you don’t
even know is really nice.

134
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,536
Your are a very good person,
Eriol-kun.

135
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,208
Shao Lan-kun, how is it?
Does it taste ok?

136
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,954
Sakura-chan! Did you drink it yet?
It tastes really good!

137
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,120
Really?

138
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,754
Then I want to drink some too!

139
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,658
I’m going to drink!

140
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,765
Really Really good!
It tastes really good!

141
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,274
– Give me three cream sodas please.
– OK.

142
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,149
Akizuki.

143
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:21,444
Call me Nakuru!

144
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,947
Give me three cream sodas.

145
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:24,387
OK

146
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,160
Sorry!

147
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,600
The night before
I had a really good sleep.

148
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,630
But still, I am very tired.

149
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,383
Touya!

150
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,113
I’m OK!

151
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:02,224
I’m just not getting enough sleep,
so I’m tired.

152
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:04,896
Yuki.

153
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:11,425
Whatever I am about to say you
have to listen very carefully.

154
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,066
Last time you said the same thing.

155
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,466
Don’t care if I’m day dreaming.

156
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:22,310
Also, don’t worry if I sleep.
Stop worrying.

157
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,446
What do you mean by “I’m fine”?

158
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,551
I know, you are…

159
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:27,946
Yes, I’m done!

160
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,779
Thank you, Akizuki-san.

161
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,248
Why don’t you tell me later, Touya?

162
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:35,992
Be careful!

163
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:37,894
My roller blades go really fast.

164
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:39,231
They’re ok.

165
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,369
What’s wrong?

166
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,670
I saw something that looked really fun.

167
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,165
Where?

168
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:53,101
It already ended.

169
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,876
There is a person, why is he hiding?

170
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,629
It’s right there! It’s right there!

171
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,956
Sakura has a lot left.

172
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,165
The brat has a lot too.

173
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,363
But, the brat will probably notice me.

174
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:21,840
I should take that one.

175
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:38,087
I heard that there is also
an upstairs where they sell
apple pie that is also very good.

176
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,155
So, lets all go and see then.

177
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:49,857
Really?
It seems like it will taste good.

178
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:51,892
I really want to eat and see!

179
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,772
So after everybody is done
lets all go and try some.

180
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,566
When everybody is done eating.

181
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,641
What is wrong?

182
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,078
My Cream Soda is all gone.

183
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:09,953
Didn’t you eat it all yourself?

184
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:14,254
Of course not,
last time it was up to here.

185
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,126
Oh

186
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,953
When I was talking about apple pie,
it disappeared.

187
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:20,732
Order another one.

188
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,724
But, I remember that it
there was still some left!

189
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:33,945
KERO-CHAN!!!

190
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:40,483
Sakura-chan?

191
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,761
In here, it feels like hot water,
it is very warm.

192
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,799
Sakura-chan, do you want to come in?

193
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:59,198
Sorry, I have to go to the bathroom.

194
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:00,602
Me too.

195
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:03,239
I also have to go and get some batteries
for my video camera.

196
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,539
So, we will go to the pool first ok?

197
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,814
I get it, I’ll see you later.

198
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,157
Kero-chan!
I told you that you couldn’t come today!

199
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:27,689
But when I read about the cream soda,
I had to come and drink some!

200
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,067
How does it taste?

201
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,804
The one that Sakura bought was ok
I think it could have been better though.

202
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,003
You really are a food monster.

203
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:42,546
You wouldn’t know how I feel about food.
You are such a brat, stupid brat.

204
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,216
Who is a brat?

205
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:50,620
Kero-chan, when we were at home you
told me that you wouldn’t come.

206
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:54,192
But it was very easy
to sneak into your bag.

207
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,158
KERO-CHAN!

208
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,027
That feeling…

209
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,070
What is this?

210
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:18,080
How did this happen?

211
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:19,551
It seems like a big wave!

212
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:20,980
What happens?

213
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,350
Let’s hurry and get out of the pool.

214
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:37,667
How can a wave become so big?

215
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,331
Is there something
wrong with the machines?

216
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:40,766
No…

217
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:41,834
Rika-chan!

218
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,306
Rika-chan!!!

219
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,411
Sakura, this is…

220
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,048
I feel his presence.

221
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,719
Eveybody get out of the pool!

222
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,385
How did this happen?

223
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,892
I’ll come right back,
you stay there and hang on.

224
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:13,196
Rika-chan!

225
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,333
Rika-chan!

226
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,570
You can’t go in.

227
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,500
It’s not safe to go play in the pool.

228
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,301
But my friend is going to drown!

229
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,587
If someone doesn’t hurry
then Rika-chan will…

230
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,817
Calm down, hurry and think of something!

231
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,428
Touya, look over there.

232
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:43,661
Are you ok?

233
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,664
Shit, if it stays this
way then it won’t do.

234
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:57,217
I have to hurry.
What should I do?

235
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:00,341
If I don’t hurry then Rika-chan will drown!

236
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:06,186
The reason she’ll drown is because…

237
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,484
Because there is water!

238
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,388
You can’t.

239
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:14,255
At this place, there will be
a lot of people that will see you!

240
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,427
But…

241
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:16,597
Over there!

242
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,235
Right!

243
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:25,269
Release!

244
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:33,007
O Card created by Clow,

245
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,012
discard thine old form and be reborn.

246
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,888
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

247
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,485
Watery!

248
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:02,979
Rain?

249
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,476
But it is an inside pool.

250
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:23,733
I did it!

251
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:39,982
Rika-chan!

252
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,116
Are you ok?

253
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:43,750
I’m fine.

254
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:51,787
I’m so glad.

255
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:54,597
– I’m glad.
– It scared me to death.

256
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:55,697
Are you okay?

257
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,442
Eriol, if Sakura didn’t help
and use her Clow cards,

258
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:14,543
you would have stopped the wave

259
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,519
So what was the point of doing that?

260
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,023
You will soon find out.

261
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,131
Today was very weird.

262
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,496
It’s good that Rika-chan is ok.

263
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:34,262
I want to thank you
for helping me to swim.

264
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:35,869
Sasaki-san,

265
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,042
will you be scared of water later on?

266
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,611
No, though it was a little scary.

267
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:48,410
Sakura-chan,

268
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,955
will you still help me swim?

269
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,185
Of course!
