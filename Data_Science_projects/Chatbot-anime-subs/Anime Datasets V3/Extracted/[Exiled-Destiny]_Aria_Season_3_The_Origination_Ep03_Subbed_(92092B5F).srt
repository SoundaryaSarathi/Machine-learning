1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,000
Wanting to make someone smile
is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,540
That's what being an Undine is all about!

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,100
But how do I do that?
That's what being an Undine is all about!

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,900
But how do I do that?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,370
What makes you two smile?

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,840
For me, it's when I eat something delicious.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,340
When Akira praises me!

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,480
When President Maa smiles.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,010
Stop right there!
When President Maa smiles.

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,580
Stop right there!

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,950
That's actually kind of scary...

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,820
"Dear Ai, the days continue
to be warm here in Neo-Venezia,"

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,420
"so it's safe to say early summer has arrived."

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,230
"Starting next month, I'll have to say goodbye
to my winter uniform for a while."

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,760
"I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also a little
sad about it, so it's a mysterious feeling."

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,240
It smells delicious.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,750
I'm quite proud of this dish. It has cheese in it!

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,870
My, my. I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,780
Thank you for waiting, President Aria.

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,530
President Aria, you don't
seem like your usual self.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,720
Are you reading the Nyan Nyan Puu
comic strip like you always do?

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,930
Huh? You're not?

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,000
This is... an article about the Ca' d'Oro?

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,800
Let's see...

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,020
"The Ca' d'Oro, a Gothic architectural masterpiece
brought directly from Manhome's Venice..."

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,950
"...will undergo restoration work
starting next week."

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,690
You were reading this article?
That's our President!

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,330
"Nyan Nyan Puu Perfect
Guide Book coming soon?"

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,940
My, my, President Aria.
You're in a good mood this morning.

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:13,290
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

31
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,630
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,750
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,520
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,030
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,430
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,870
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:03,370
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:13,180
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,360
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:27,170
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

41
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:36,080
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,870
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

43
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,980
Good morning, Aika!

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,750
You're late!

45
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,750
Those Feelings Within...

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,260
I read that article about the
restoration work this morning, too.

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,400
It's because so many of the buildings
in this city were brought from Manhome.

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,740
Like the Teatro La Fenice and
the Accademia di Belle Arti, right?

49
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,350
There's also the Basilica
di Santa Maria della Salute.

50
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,820
There's another church too,
the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore.

51
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,390
And the Chiesa del Redentore.

52
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,420
Speaking of buildings brought over from Manhome,
Caffè Florian was brought over too, right?

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,330
Yes. You can really get a sense of its
long history from the beautiful rooms inside.

54
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,870
Oh, really? I wish I could see it.

55
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,300
Wha-?! You've never been inside?

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Yeah.

57
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,110
That's really surprising since you're
friends with the owner, Akari.

58
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,520
Since we're on the subject,
why don't we go have some tea?

59
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,890
Good idea. Let's go there for our break.

60
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,790
Yay! I get to see the inside!

61
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,130
I can't wait, President Aria!

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,960
P-President Aria?

63
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,130
What's the matter, President Aria?
Are you all right?

64
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,880
Oh yeah, last month they started restoration
work on this building too, didn't they?

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,810
Wow... Those are such big paintings...

66
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,460
A student from the Neo-Venezia Art University
did the artwork on the scaffold wraps.

67
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,130
A student did?

68
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,800
Students had to submit their designs, and then
the student who was chosen got to paint the wraps.

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,430
I heard it was really competitive.

70
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,970
Because in a sense, the wraps will be the
city's face while they do the restoration.

71
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,040
Once the restoration work is complete,
there won't be a use for them anymore, right?

72
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,590
But even if it's just for a short while,
they'll delight everyone, visitors and locals alike.

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,350
So in a way, it's Neo-Venezia's very own
method of showing hospitality. How wonderful!

74
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,590
No sappy lines allowed!

75
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,990
Huh?!

76
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,400
What is it, Junior?

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,570
There's a bunch of people over there.

78
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,810
I wonder if they're selling something?

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,100
Let's go see!

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,440
Here you go. Thank you very much.

81
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,750
How cute!

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,480
Are those bottled sweets?

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,050
I'd like one, please.
Are those bottled sweets?

84
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,850
I'd like one, please.

85
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,750
Welcome.

86
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,250
Huh? That guy...

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,820
Here you go. Thank you.
Huh? That guy...

88
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,190
Here you go. Thank you.
Isn't he a patissier at the
Hotel Appresso's restaurant?

89
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,560
Isn't he a patissier at the
Hotel Appresso's restaurant?

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,260
Thank you!
Isn't he a patissier at the
Hotel Appresso's restaurant?

91
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,760
Isn't he a patissier at the
Hotel Appresso's restaurant?

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,190
Do you know him, Aika?

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,790
Himeya has a partnership with that hotel.

94
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,260
It's so cute!
Himeya has a partnership with that hotel.

95
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,830
Himeya has a partnership with that hotel.

96
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,090
I've seen him there before.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Welcome.

98
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,790
I wonder why he's selling sweets here, then?

99
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,810
Maybe he quit his job at the hotel?

100
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,110
Here you go.

101
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,370
Thanks!

102
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,510
The children are all smiles.

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,320
Ah! You want one too, don't you, Junior?
Should I buy one for our toddler friend?

104
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,860
You're the one who wants some, Aika.
After all, your brain age is really equal to a child.

105
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Wha-?!

106
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,000
Welcome.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,730
I'd like one, please.

108
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,170
One, is it?

109
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,090
Here you go.

110
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,700
Thank you!

111
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,030
I think I'll buy some and send it to Ai.

112
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,410
Oh, look at what you've done.

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,210
Come now, stop crying.

114
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,430
Are you all right?

115
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,560
Please don't touch it!

117
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,000
It's glass, so it's dangerous, Miss Undine.

118
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,250
I'll clean it up right away,
so please just leave it there.

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,370
Okay.

120
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,150
Here. I'll give you a new bottle
of chocolates. So don't cry, okay?

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,690
But it was his fault...

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,520
It's no problem.

123
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,330
Here you go.

124
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,890
Okay.
Here you go.

125
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,290
Okay.

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,830
Thank you, Mr. Chocolate Maker.

127
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm really sorry.

128
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,730
Not at all.

129
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,400
Be careful this time, okay?

130
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,530
Okay!

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,410
Don't drop it again.

132
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:31,810
Okay!
Don't drop it again.

133
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,140
Okay!
Come on, hold it tightly.

134
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,610
Come on, hold it tightly.

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,310
I feel kind of sorry for the chocolates...

136
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,620
Akari...

137
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,280
It can't be helped. The bottle's broken.

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,130
Here you go.

139
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,030
Thank you very much.
These chocolates are really cute.

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Thank you.

141
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,500
Let's send them to Ai
right away, President Aria.

142
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,940
One, please.

143
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,710
One, please.

144
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,080
Ah, sorry. Welcome.

145
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,040
Ah! I can't wait!

146
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,850
How wonderful! I didn't know
there were so many paintings inside!

147
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,060
This is the Oriental Room.

148
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,600
Each room has its own theme, like the Room of
the Illustrious Men and the Room of Seasons.

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,070
Oh?

150
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,240
Thank you for waiting.

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,670
Here is your caffè latte and hot milk.

152
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,050
It's delicious.

153
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,340
The original caffè latte is the best, isn't it?

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,420
It's really delicious.

155
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,060
The entire café is like an art museum.

156
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,600
You can hear the music coming in from outside...

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,030
...and inside, you can admire the paintings while
enjoying your drink. This is such a luxury.

158
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,370
Hey, Akari. Settle down.

159
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,310
But, but!

160
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:21,200
Just thinking about the number of people who sat
in this chair and used this table is so exciting!

161
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,550
Oh. Hello, ladies.

162
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,920
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Owner.

163
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Hello, Mr. Owner.

164
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,310
Welcome to Caffè Florian.

165
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,090
I see you're having tea in here,
even though it's beautiful outside.

166
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,530
Yes. It's because I've never
actually been inside the café before.

167
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,370
How does the original caffè latte
taste while sitting inside?

168
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,670
It's delicious! I think it has
a slightly different taste.

169
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,140
It tastes the same either way, you know.

170
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,340
But, but! There is a difference!

171
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,750
Now that we're all refreshed,
shall we go back and study, then?

172
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,550
Sounds good.
Okay!

173
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,630
The patissier from earlier... He's gone.

174
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,730
You're right.

175
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,400
Yeah.

176
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,100
Maybe he closed up shop for today?

177
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,830
You're probably right.

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,180
Looks like the restoration work
for Ca' d'Oro started today.

179
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,370
Ah, you're right. The scaffolding
has already been set up.

180
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,750
Get well, and show us your
magnificent facade again soon.

181
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,780
That person...

182
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,600
What's the matter, Akari?

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,070
I just saw that patissier from the other day.

184
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,430
Oh, the one who was selling chocolates?

185
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,970
I haven't seen him in
Piazza San Marco since that day.

186
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,650
I went to go buy chocolates after school the day
before yesterday, but his shop wasn't there.

187
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,050
Come to think of it, I saw him in front of
Palazzo Grimani yesterday.

188
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,490
He was just staring at the building.

189
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,590
He was staring at Ca' d'Oro just now, as well.

190
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,390
I wonder if he quit making sweets,
and is researching buildings now?

191
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,090
Here you go, President Aria.

192
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,770
I wonder if he's not going to
sell chocolates anymore?

193
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,800
Sir, Ma'am, the bridge we're about to
pass under is the Ponte dell' Accademia.

194
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a reconstruction of a bridge that
used to be in Manhome's Venice.

195
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,980
It looks like it's made of wood,
but the structure is actually made of steel.

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,410
I see...

197
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,250
It's headstrong, just like you.

198
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,350
You think so?

199
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,750
I sure do!

200
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,390
Okay then, let's take a picture with
Ponte dell' Accademia in the background.

201
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,030
Akari?

202
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,830
Is something wrong?

203
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,640
No, I'm sorry.

204
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,200
Well then, ready? Say, "Campanile!"

205
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,980
Thank you for all the wonderful memories today.

206
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,180
The pleasure was ours.

207
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,450
Thank you very much.

208
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,250
I'd love to come again.

209
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,660
When we do, please guide us again.

210
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,690
We'll be looking forward to it.

211
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,990
See you.

212
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
Akari, you can take the rest of the day off.

213
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,740
I'm going straight to the
Gondola Association for a meeting now.

214
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,290
Ah, okay.

215
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,410
Bye!

216
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,130
See you later!

217
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,480
President Aria, would it be all right
if we stopped by Piazza San Marco?

218
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,600
The chocolate shop isn't here today, either.

219
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,770
You're right. Let's go see the main piazza, too.

220
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,450
Mr. Patissier?

221
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,960
President Aria!

222
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,810
This place never ceases to amaze me.

223
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,310
I get so excited just looking
at all the different rooms.

224
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,820
Excuse me, Mr. Patissier?

225
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,410
That's it!

226
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,200
Ah, Miss Undine.

227
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,460
Ah, hello.

228
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm glad to see you again.
It's all thanks to you!

229
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,770
Huh?

230
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,530
If you'd like... Let's see...

231
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,180
Could you stop by Piazza
San Marco tomorrow afternoon?

232
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,870
There's something I'd like to give you.

233
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,680
O... Okay...

234
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,760
There's so much I wanted to ask him, too...

235
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,370
Maybe he isn't here yet?

236
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,780
Miss Undine!

237
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,610
Mr. Patissier!

238
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,690
You're going to reopen your shop?

239
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,950
Yes, and it's all thanks to you.

240
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,160
They're so cute!

241
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,070
Remember how you said you felt sorry for
the chocolates when the bottle broke?

242
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,160
When I heard that, I thought...

243
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,910
"I want to make my customers smile."

244
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,310
Those chocolates were made
with love, so it's sad...

245
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,650
...if they're wasted before they
can touch peoples' hearts.

246
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,920
I thought, "When did I forget that feeling?"

247
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,520
Chocolates made with love...

248
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,490
Yes. I was able to remember that, thanks to you.

249
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,360
I thought you had closed your shop for good.

250
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,400
Sorry for making you worry.

251
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,630
I was trying to come up with another way to make
people smile, and a better method of sharing it.

252
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,030
Then, yesterday it hit me.

253
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,680
What if I used all sorts of
different wrapping papers?

254
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,240
Sort of like how there are all sorts
of different buildings in this city.

255
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,660
Ah, is that why you were at Ca' d'Oro
and Ponte dell' Accademia yesterday?

256
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,860
It seems like you always catch me
at the most unflattering moments.

257
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,430
Yeah. When I'm out of ideas,
I walk around the city until I get tired.

258
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,960
When I do that, somehow it's easier
to come up with something good.

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,110
Neo-Venezia gives you hints, doesn't it?

260
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,980
Please, pick any two you like,
for you and your cat.

261
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,550
Eh? But...

262
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,840
Take it as a token of my appreciation.

263
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,750
Okay...

264
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,650
Thank you very much.

265
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,020
Then, I'll take this one, and this one...

266
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,330
Ah... It feels like such a waste
to even open the wrapping!

267
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,270
Don't say that. I'd feel sorry for the
chocolates if you didn't eat them.

268
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,060
You're right.

269
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,640
I know!

270
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,130
It's still a little early to set up shop,
so may I treat you two to a caffè latte?

271
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,020
No matter how often you come here,
it's still beautiful, isn't it?

272
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,790
Yeah. I always stop by Caffè Florian
after I close my shop.

273
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,790
When I look at the paintings,
it somehow puts me at ease.

274
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,310
It really does, doesn't it?

275
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,860
Hello.

276
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,440
Ah, hello!

277
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,970
You're the gentleman who's always here...

278
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,770
Do you two know each other?

279
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,550
He's the owner of this café.

280
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,820
Eh, really?! I had no idea!

281
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,930
Do you like the paintings in here?

282
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,430
Yes. Every painting is magnificent.

283
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:13,670
This entire café, interior and all, was dismantled
and brought over before Venice was submerged.

284
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,870
All the paintings are the originals from back then.

285
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,740
So they're that old...

286
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,750
You must take very good care of them.

287
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,450
Well, these paintings belong here, after all.

288
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,080
They belong here?

289
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,000
It's just a simple phrase, but there's
a lot of meaning in those words.

290
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Yeah.

291
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,920
I see...

292
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,770
The things people create are filled with
the emotion of their makers.

293
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,540
That's why they get passed down, don't they?

294
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,640
They're cherished, and they belong...

295
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,680
Your chocolates are the same way, Anri!

296
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,350
Whether it's a big building
or a small bundle of chocolates,

297
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,660
they're both the same because
they were made with love!

298
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,460
That's why they make everyone smile!

299
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,330
I see...

300
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,960
Then, if my chocolates become
something that belongs in this city...

301
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm sure they will! They'll be
something wonderful that belongs here!

302
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,300
Thank you. I'll do my best.

303
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:32,220
Then, in celebration of
Neo-Venezia's newest addition,

304
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,690
may I treat you to some of
Caffè Florian's special cioccolata?

305
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,180
Yay!

306
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,050
Thank you very much.

307
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,500
Thank you for treating us.

308
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,060
Thank you very much.

309
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,960
Please come back anytime.

310
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,230
Ah! It's Mr. Chocolate Maker!

311
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,440
You haven't been around lately.
What happened?

312
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm sorry. I'm about to open my shop,
so please wait just a little longer.

313
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,380
Here you go.

314
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,950
Thank you.

315
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,530
I want one, too.

316
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:13,830
Of course. Welcome.
I want one, too.

317
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,290
Of course. Welcome.

318
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,360
Of course. Welcome.
"Dear Ai, something new and wonderful that
belongs in Neo-Venezia has just been born."

319
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,470
"Dear Ai, something new and wonderful that
belongs in Neo-Venezia has just been born."

320
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,630
"They're chocolates that are
incredibly sweet, and really cute."

321
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,910
"Thank you for the chocolates, Akari!"

322
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,870
"They taste so delicious because
the patissier made them with love, right?"

323
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,040
"It's so sweet!"

324
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,890
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

325
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,520
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

326
00:22:49,300 --> 00:23:00,440
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

327
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,310
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

328
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:22,800
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

329
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,860
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

330
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:45,120
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

331
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,590
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

332
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,930
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

333
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,070
And my day begins
Hajimaru
