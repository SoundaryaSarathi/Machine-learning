"Freeza's Terrible Declaration! I Will Defeat
You Without Using My Hands"

2
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,270
W- What a Ki!

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,220
Mid-air battle or ground battle, which
are you better at?

4
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,560
Which, you ask? I guess ground battle.

5
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,520
- Where are they going?
- They're just changing locations.

6
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,020
They're probably moving to someplace
where they can fight to their heart's content.

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,190
What incredible guys!

8
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,860
Father...

9
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,210
This means we're going to fight on
the ground, where I'm better at it?

10
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,560
- I'm getting good service.
- Or is it... you're that confident?

11
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,500
When you look at me this way,
I'm very kind.

12
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,830
I know! How about I offer you
another great service?

13
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,080
Great service?

14
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,510
I will keep myself from using
both my hands!

15
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,850
- How's that?
- Both hands? How very generous of you.

16
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,030
So then, can I start us off?

17
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,530
Of course.

18
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,190
Whatever you like.

19
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,990
Ah, I've finally perfected it.

20
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,900
- Well, she sure seems to be in a hurry
to depart.
- Yes, indeed!

21
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,900
Why are you dawdlin' around!?

22
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,810
Tell me! When exactly can we leave!?
While we're all down here like this, my
Gohan-chan is... !

23
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,470
Gohan-chan is... !

24
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,250
S- See here, Chichi-san! Calm down!

25
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,920
Yes, indeed!

26
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,920
What are you doin' durin' all this
commotion!? Dirty old man!

27
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,590
Not at all, Chichi-san!

28
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah, converting this from a single-seater
to a five-seater is quite a chore.

29
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,610
Ah, that reminds me, I haven't decided
where to place the stereo speakers.

30
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,600
We don't need that stuff! Hurry up and
make this thing go!

31
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,870
The biggest issue there is the
energy, you see.

32
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,550
The difficulty is, in order to fill up this
spaceship with energy, it's going to
take a little time.

33
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,550
So?

34
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,220
- How long's it gonna take?
- Well, I just started a moment ago,
so... I don't know.

35
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,220
WHAT!?

36
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,230
You know, guys...

37
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,570
How come we have to go to
Planet Namek too?

38
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,570
That's the place where Piccolo was born.

39
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,570
On top of that, Vegeta and other, even
more terrifying guys will be there!

40
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,580
Yamucha-sama!

41
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,560
l, Pu-Erh vow to go and strike down
Yamucha-sama's enemies!

42
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,290
Please just sit tight, okay?

43
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,930
You're not gonna live too long, are you?

44
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,640
Come on! To think, me, goin' to Planet
Namek? Don't even kid 'bout that! I'm
gettin' out while I still...

45
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,870
Thinking of running away by yourself,
huh? Not going to be that easy!

46
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,890
Oh dear, what's the matter? Have you
finished attacking?

47
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,240
Your motions are too slow!

48
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,580
There, and now from the left.

49
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,250
Next, from the right!

50
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,260
Right! Left! Right!

51
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,190
And the final one, left!

52
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,900
He's strong! Got great speed too,
as big as his talk.

53
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,900
- G- Goku...
- Father!

54
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,370
It's strange. Here I am fighting someone
so incredibly strong, and I'm
giddy with excitement!

55
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,240
If you're not going to come at me, then
I'll bring it to you again!

56
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:58,040
You know something, I'm glad I met you!
I was getting so bored, and the creatures
on this planet are all so weird anyhow...

57
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Ah, sorry, sorry! I've hurt your feelings!
You're an exception!

58
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,720
When I first saw all of you clustered
around, I was all freaked out, but you
alone were different!

59
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,360
That's enough! Who would ever expect
me to die here among all these frogs!?

60
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,040
Ah, so gross!

61
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,050
You seemed to have a lot of promise,
so I'll let you be my friend!

62
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,360
Do you want to eat some too?

63
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,040
For a frog, you're really eating this stuff,
huh? Well then...

64
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,030
Would you eat some of this, too?

65
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,060
It's been a long time since I
laughed so hard!

66
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,390
Overall, you really do seem to understand
what I'm saying.

67
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,570
Say! If we had a translator device, I bet
I could talk to you!

68
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm so clever!

69
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,740
It's finished!

70
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,080
That was easier than I expected.

71
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,590
Indeed, the word impossible doesn't
exist for a genius like me, Bulma-sama!

72
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,430
- Here goes!
- Switch on!

73
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,430
Go on, try saying something!
Don't be shy!

74
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,430
CHAAN-GE!!

75
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,440
W- What's this? What is it?

76
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,960
You're the first person I'd encountered in
some time, so I tagged along, hoping some
kind of chance would come around...

77
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,060
...but to think that I'd be able to
Change so soon...

78
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,400
W- What am I doing over there!?

79
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,080
Just what is going on here!?

80
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,080
You have my gratitude, little miss. It's
enough that I want to dance the
Dance of Joy!

81
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,410
However, this is one unsightly form!

82
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,290
Well then, how about I set out to find
a stronger body?

83
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,490
Who would have thought he could have
possibly done this much?

84
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,760
Dammit... I can't get free... !

85
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,030
I thought you weren't going to use
your hands, right?

86
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,050
The service time has run out.

87
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,540
Well, let me offer my service, if you want
to call it that, by giving you some advice.

88
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,710
Advice?

89
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,050
You put too much faith in your own strength.
As a result, you leave yourself wide open to attack.

90
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,720
My thanks.

91
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,570
Incredible! Goku's super power is such
that not even Freeza is able to appraise it.

92
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:17,090
With his pride injured, will Freeza's
anger explode?

93
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:28,090
