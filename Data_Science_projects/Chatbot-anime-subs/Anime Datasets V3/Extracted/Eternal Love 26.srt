<i>[Episode 26]</i>

3
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,081
What are you two doing?

4
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:21,882
Crown Prince has issued an order.
There will be a wedding in a few days.

5
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:24,722
Aside from the palace's people,
nobody else is to enter.

6
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,401
Impudence!

7
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,842
How dare you block my lady's way?

8
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:30,534
Consort Su Jin has long been bestowed
in marriage by Heavenly Lord.

9
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,842
She will be moving into Xiwu Palace
in less than half a month.

10
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:37,322
Are you two not afraid
of the consequences?

11
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,241
We are freshly returned
from the battlefield.

12
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:46,722
We have been used to
mindlessly drifting around the world.

13
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:49,361
We really do not know
the rules in the Nine Heavens.

14
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,842
If we have offended you two ladies,
please understand.

15
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:57,002
Not lady, but consort. Consort Su Jin.

16
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:06,122
It is of no matter. No wonder
the two of you look so new.

17
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:11,201
After I move into Xiwu Palace,
we'll all be familiar with each other.

18
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,322
- Farewell, Your Highness.
- Farewell, Your Highness.

19
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,122
Be careful.

20
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,762
Thank you.

21
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:48,401
<i>No, there was a wonderful
peach blossom scent around the lady.</i>

22
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,762
<i>It is the scent of my peach tree woods.</i>

23
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:53,401
<i>She must be tied to Bai Qian in some way.</i>

24
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,388
<i>I must make another trip
to the Celestial Palace.</i>

25
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:56,562
Bi Fang!

26
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,442
<i>A-Li.</i>

27
00:04:58,442 --> 00:04:59,961
<i>Mother is leaving now.</i>

28
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:38,762
Your Highness, Nai Nai has taken
the young prince to Consort Le Xu.

29
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,161
I understand.

30
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,762
Where is Your Highness going?

31
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:47,201
It is stifling inside.
I want to go out for a walk.

32
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:49,762
Would you like us to come with you?

33
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:54,682
No need. I am familiar with these paths.
I can go by myself.

34
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,682
Your Highness, do you really
not need us to come with you?

35
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:24,521
This lady hasn't held
the young prince even once.

36
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,242
She must not like to
interact with others.

37
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:30,201
She seems quite pitiful. I wonder
what disease she caught to end up blind.

38
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:06,442
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

39
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,762
Is Your Highness going to
the lotus pond again?

40
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:38,241
<i>I, Ye Hua, ask all the gods
of the world to bear witness</i>

41
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,001
<i>in front of the Lakes of the Far East.</i>

42
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,761
<i>From this day forth,
I will be married to Su Su.</i>

43
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,881
<i>I will love her with all my heart
for all eternity</i>

44
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:51,442
<i>and never part from her
regardless of fortune or calamity.</i>

45
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:47,721
Congratulations, Sir,
you are going to be a father.

46
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,642
Congratulations to you as well.
You are going to be a mother.

47
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,761
Are you really going to marry that woman?

48
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,201
Have you thought about it?

49
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,922
You used the events of the night
A-Li was born as justification

50
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,361
to replace all the maids
that Heavenly Lord granted you

51
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:30,481
and stationed many of your own soldiers
to guard Xiwu Palace.

52
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,761
It has already been wearing
on your father's nerves.

53
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:38,682
Your Highness, Your Highness!
The young prince won't stop crying.

54
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,761
He won't stop no matter what I do.

55
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:42,961
How can this be?

56
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:47,121
Wasn't he doing fine just now?
Why is he suddenly acting like this?

57
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:48,442
Is he hungry?

58
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,201
He was fed before we came over.

59
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,928
The young prince is normally
very obedient.

60
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,881
I don't know what is wrong today.

61
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,001
Be good.

62
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:51,402
Su Su, Su Su!

63
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,001
Su Su, where are you?

64
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,442
<i>Ye Hua.</i>

65
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,241
Su Su.

66
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,322
I am leaving now.

67
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,562
Don't look for me.

68
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:17,042
<i>I will be fine on my own.</i>

69
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:19,162
<i>Take good care of A-Li for me.</i>

70
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:26,442
I once dreamed I could hold his hand

71
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:32,841
and go with him to view the moon,
the stars, and the sea of clouds.

72
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:39,961
<i>However, it seems I won't be able
to do any of that now.</i>

73
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:49,841
Don't tell him his mother
is just an ordinary person.

74
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:56,961
The immortals of Heaven
don't seem to really like him.

75
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:04,241
Su Su, tell me where you are.
I'll come to you.

76
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:10,162
I am at Zhuxian Terrace.

77
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:16,601
Su Jin told me

78
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:22,162
if I jump off, I will be able to return
to where I should return to.

79
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,361
Ye Hua.

80
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,841
Let me go.

81
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,961
I will also let you go.

82
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:49,841
From now on, we won't
owe each other anything.

83
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,881
I will definitely marry you.

84
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,522
- From now on...
- No.

85
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:41,802
- I will be your eyes.
- Don't, Ye Hua.

86
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:04,522
Ye Hua!

87
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:21,721
<i>Since we have made an oath
in front of the Lakes of the Far East</i>

88
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,522
we are to be husband and wife
for all eternity.

89
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:27,481
You must not do me wrong
for all eternity.

90
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:31,081
<i>I have always held a clear distinction
between love and hate.</i>

91
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,642
<i>I can tolerate no wrong.</i>

92
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,922
<i>If you betray me...</i>

93
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,721
<i>What would you do?</i>

94
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:41,922
<i>If you betray me, those oaths
will become null and void.</i>

95
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,841
<i>I will leave you, never to see you again.</i>

96
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,241
Si Yin.

97
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,743
There is such substantial activity
coming from Qing Cang all of a sudden.

98
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,082
It must be related to
the one who sealed him.

99
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,842
Dijun.

100
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,682
You already lost half of your powers
from saving Little Princess.

101
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,442
- I'm worried you--
- You are right to worry.

102
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,561
I need to go into seclusion
to recuperate.

103
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,561
While I am away...

104
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,082
write something for me
in the Book of Destiny.

105
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:19,682
Book of Destiny?
I control the fates of mortals.

106
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,481
I am powerless to do anything
about the fates of immortals.

107
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,082
After I come out of seclusion,
I will be going to the mortal realm.

108
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:30,801
What will you be doing there?

109
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:37,521
The Hong Luan Star will not
be ascendant in my destiny.

110
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,122
When I go to the mortal realm

111
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:42,665
you can write of a marriage
in your Book of Destiny.

112
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,281
She kept me company for so long
in the Celestial Palace.

113
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:51,442
Nevertheless, I should fulfill
her wish to stay with me.

114
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:59,201
If Heavenly Lord asks,
how should I reply?

115
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,642
Just say...

116
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:05,721
I am going to experience
the bitterness of life.

117
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,402
Father, you must not.

118
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,122
Celestials need the divine fungal grass
to purify their cultivation.

119
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:01,682
Otherwise, both you and Ye Hua
will lose control of your powers

120
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,041
and fall into a demonic state!

121
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,602
There is no time to worry about that now.

122
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:08,201
You must not,
even if there is no time!

123
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,459
Father is Heavenly Lord,
while Ye Hua is your successor.

124
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,761
If you both fall into a demonic state,
what will become of the Celestial Tribe?

125
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:16,220
Wait for us to get divine fungal grass
from the Eastern Sea.

126
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,402
Father, do not be impatient!

127
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:20,041
No, there is no time.

128
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,922
Sorry, Father.

129
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,561
Third Brother, what are you doing?

130
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:34,961
What do you think I am doing?

131
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,521
You know how much Father loves Ye Hua.

132
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,961
He will even risk his life for him!
Why would he fear turning demonic?

133
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:44,109
Don't delay anymore, Eldest Brother!
Come with me to get divine fungal grass.

134
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:47,642
Sister-in-law, you'll stay here.

135
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,721
Before we return, aside from
Medicine King, nobody is to come in.

136
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,281
All right.

137
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,922
Let's go!

138
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,761
Ye Hua.

139
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,082
Why must you treat me like this?

140
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,122
I have never sought to
have you only for myself.

141
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:16,842
Am I not even allowed to
merely stay by your side?

142
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:22,122
Your Highness! Your Highness!

143
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:24,682
Go quickly to Zichen Hall!

144
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:25,922
What's the matter?

145
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:29,882
His Highness... His Highness
jumped off Zhuxian Terrace!

146
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,362
It's unknown whether he's still alive!

147
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,201
What? What did you say?

148
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,402
Hurry! Go quickly, Your Highness.

149
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:41,922
Perhaps... you may still get to
see His Highness one last time.

150
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,761
Your Highness!

151
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,321
High God.

152
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:07,521
What has happened?

153
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:10,241
My lord has suffered critical injuries.

154
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,862
Heavenly Lord is waiting for
divine fungal grass in Zichen Hall

155
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:15,076
to transfer his own cultivation
to save my lord's life.

156
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:18,642
Critical injuries? Wasn't he
perfectly fine this morning?

157
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,561
- High God.
- High God.

158
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:26,001
Quick, Medicine King, follow me.

159
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,402
Wait.

160
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,481
High God, what orders do you have?

161
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:35,801
Why don't you bring me inside?

162
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,001
Perhaps my medical expertise
may be of help.

163
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,362
Yes!

164
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:45,001
In this world, the one with the most
medical expertise must be you, High God.

165
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:49,041
Jia Yun, why don't you bring
the two of us inside?

166
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:02,761
All right, please follow me.

167
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,402
Your Highness may not enter.

168
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:10,402
Why am I not allowed inside?

169
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,602
Eldest Prince and Third Prince ordered me

170
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:16,801
not to allow entry to anyone
but Medicine King before they return.

171
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:22,362
But High God Zhe Yan...
Why was he allowed inside?

172
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,250
High God Zhe Yan's medical expertise
is known throughout the four seas.

173
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,521
By defying orders, I am risking my head

174
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:31,122
to allow High God Zhe Yan inside
to save the Crown Prince.

175
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:35,201
Your Highness cannot provide any help
for the Crown Prince's injuries.

176
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:38,162
Please do not make my task difficult.

177
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,041
Then tell me.

178
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,801
Ye Hua...

179
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,561
He is still alive.

180
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,041
Consort Le Xu.

181
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,801
High God Zhe Yan.

182
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:44,321
Your Highness, my medical skills are
incomparable to Zhe Yan's.

183
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:50,642
He was outside the hall by chance.
Why don't you allow him to take a look?

184
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:52,602
All right.

185
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:57,082
You may take a look at Ye Hua.
I will not be in your way.

186
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,842
Heavenly Lord is...

187
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:09,761
No need to explain.
I do not see anything.

188
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:13,162
I have long since sequestered myself
from the three realms

189
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:15,162
and am no longer confined to convention.

190
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:24,241
May I request that you all step out?

191
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,041
All right.

192
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,362
Your Highness, when High God Zhe Yan
retired from the three realms

193
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,001
he may have sealed his magical artifact
under Kunlun Mountain

194
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,201
but he still has his medical expertise.

195
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:59,281
Nobody else in this world
can compare to him.

196
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,922
Let us wait patiently.

197
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:46,521
I do not know what relationship
you have to Mo Yuan

198
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,922
for even your spirit
to be so similar to his.

199
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:54,241
If you are him,
then you had better live on.

200
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,281
Kunlun Mountain has already
waited for you for 70,000 years.

201
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:01,561
If you are not him,
then since you have a face just like his

202
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,442
then you should be like him

203
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:07,721
and persevere for
all the people of the world.

204
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,521
Ye Hua.

205
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,682
My good grandson.

206
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,922
High God Zhe Yan?

207
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:52,521
Was it my two unworthy sons who went to
the Peach Tree Woods to ask you to come?

208
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:56,442
How I came is not important.

209
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,761
Heavenly Lord, Ye Hua is in
no critical danger now.

210
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:06,082
However, whether he will wake up
will depend on his luck.

211
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:07,481
What?

212
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:16,922
What you mean is...

213
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:21,842
He will continue sleeping like this?

214
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:23,561
It is highly likely.

215
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:59,041
Well? Have you retrieved
the divine fungal grass?

216
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,321
Those four beasts possess half of
Heavenly Father's life cultivation.

217
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:06,561
Even Third Brother and I together
are unable to defeat them.

218
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:17,402
It's all right. It's all right.

219
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,642
Zhe Yan has been inside for
a whole night already.

220
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,481
There is surely hope for Ye Hua.

221
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:26,842
High God Zhe Yan is inside?

222
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:30,761
Yes, he has been inside the whole night.

223
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,321
- Father.
- Father.

224
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:49,642
Thank you for your help, Zhe Yan.

225
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,922
It was only by chance.

226
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,362
I have told your father already.

227
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:57,321
The Crown Prince's life has been saved

228
00:29:57,321 --> 00:30:00,402
but whether he can wake up
will depend on his luck.

229
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:04,362
You mean to say...

230
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,761
it's possible Ye Hua may not wake up?

231
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:10,561
It will depend on his will to live.

232
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:14,561
Summon anyone he cares about and
have them accompany him day and night.

233
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,122
This will be helpful in waking him.

234
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:23,481
That mortal is the only one
he constantly longs for.

235
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:30,201
That mortal has already lost her soul
at Zhuxian Terrace.

236
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:36,241
Mortal? Is it the lady who is blind?

237
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:43,961
Everyone, I have already done all I can.

238
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:45,961
- Farewell.
- Zhe Yan.

239
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:50,241
You have done a favor for
the Celestial Tribe by helping us today.

240
00:30:50,241 --> 00:30:54,561
I will surely repay the favor one day.

241
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,521
I am already one unconcerned with
temporal affairs, and have no desires.

242
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,201
Naturally, I do not need any repayment.

243
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:05,122
I merely have been brought to
the Crown Prince by fate.

244
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:27,922
<i>Bai Qian?</i>

245
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:23,162
Fortunately, you are not in
any critical danger.

246
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:24,961
You only have some minor wounds.

247
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,362
Is there wine?

248
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,041
There is wine.

249
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:46,201
But first, you have to tell me
what happened.

250
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:49,241
Ever since you sealed away Qing Cang

251
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:53,362
your parents and brothers have been
searching for you like madmen.

252
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:57,001
Even I have not had
a good night's sleep for a while.

253
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:02,682
Your eyes, and the injuries all over
your body... What exactly happened?

254
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,082
What's the matter?

255
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:12,761
Did you do something shameful and are
afraid I'll tell your Fourth Brother?

256
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:25,001
I may have sealed away Qing Cang

257
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:29,642
but I did not gain any advantage.

258
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:36,281
He sealed my memories and powers

259
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,882
and left me on Mount Junji.

260
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,281
I underwent a trial.

261
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,281
Zhe Yan.

262
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:59,821
I remember you have a medicine.

263
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,241
When taken, one can forget the things
one does not wish to remember.

264
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:07,321
Am I right?

265
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:15,681
These past few years must have been
very depressing for you.

266
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:25,362
Whether to remember or to forget
is your own choice.

267
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,442
However, I must warn you in advance.

268
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:30,922
There is no way to undo the effects
of this medicine of mine.

269
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,442
Once you use it

270
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:38,161
the past events will truly be
of no more concern to you.

271
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,961
My mother often said

272
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:00,722
I am lucky in life.

273
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,041
I was born as an immortal.

274
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:07,644
I was already an immortal
without needing to cultivate.

275
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:14,681
But there is nothing
so convenient in this world.

276
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:22,442
Without experiencing a heavenly trial,
how can one ascend to high god?

277
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:34,001
In the years that flew by

278
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:40,481
I merely experienced a heavenly trial.

279
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:49,121
Since this trial has already passed

280
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:54,722
there are some things
that need not be remembered.

281
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,842
Ye Hua.

282
00:36:07,802 --> 00:36:10,961
Open your eyes and
take a look, won't you?

283
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,282
This is your child.

284
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:15,601
He has just lost his mother.

285
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:19,842
If he loses his father as well,
how pitiful would he be?

286
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:23,601
Open your eyes, won't you?

287
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,762
How come things are suddenly like this?

288
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,681
He was subjected to
lightningbolts every day.

289
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,641
For the Crown Prince's seal

290
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:48,442
he endured 36 sacred blazes
and 9 holy lightning bolts.

291
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:52,722
This jump of his
was clearly to seek death.

292
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:59,041
If we had allowed him
to marry that mortal

293
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,961
at most, there would just be
one more side consort in Xiwu Palace.

294
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:06,322
It would not have been
as bad as losing his life.

295
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:09,481
That's enough.

296
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,442
It is my fault.

297
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:19,722
Father, I have been unfilial.

298
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:22,282
I raised a disappointing son.

299
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:32,402
In the end, he is still

300
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:35,081
the Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince
whom everyone believes in.

301
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:39,521
Ye Hua, you took this step
because I forced you to.

302
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:42,202
I thought after I forced her to her death

303
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,322
you would only be
in low spirits for a few days

304
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:51,561
but thereafter, you would still be

305
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,746
the Celestial Tribe's heir apparent
revered by the four seas.

306
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:58,121
However, I never expected...

307
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:05,521
you would actually place
such great importance on that woman.

308
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:11,842
Ye Hua...
Is he really not going to wake up?

309
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:16,402
I was incapable of curing him.

310
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:20,322
Perhaps there is still a chance.

311
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:23,922
What chance?

312
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:28,362
The Celestial Tribe has a sacred object
called the Soul-gathering Lamp.

313
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:31,322
It was created by Heavenly Father
during the time of the Great Flood.

314
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:34,282
The lamp can gather together
the parts of an immortal's spirit.

315
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:36,481
The Soul-gathering Lamp?

316
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,681
It is a sacred item of
the Celestial Tribe?

317
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,802
How come I have never heard of it?

318
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:44,001
This sacred object belongs to
the Su Jin Clan.

319
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:50,362
Su Jin?

320
00:38:53,402 --> 00:38:57,521
I remember. I remember that lamp.

321
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,442
My mother did indeed say

322
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:02,561
this lamp can gather
an immortal's spirit!

323
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:03,961
Is this true?

324
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:05,681
Where is it now?

325
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:10,481
It was kept in my mother's possession
ever since I was young.

326
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,481
Later, when my entire clan perished
and was buried in the Sea of Innocence

327
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:17,442
I put it away for my mother
with the items buried with the dead.

328
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,161
It is in the Sea of Innocence!

329
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:20,601
Sea of Innocence?

330
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:26,327
It is where the Celestial Tribe
preserves the bodies of immortals.

331
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,842
Since it was buried with the dead

332
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:38,561
then it must be in
your mother's crystal coffin.

333
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:43,242
It's been 70,000 years
since she has passed away.

334
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:50,461
If we are to open her coffin now,
I'm afraid...

335
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:52,402
Heavenly Lord need not worry.

336
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:54,802
Since the lamp can save
the Celestial Tribe's heir apparent

337
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:58,922
the buried surely would not mind
being disturbed for the lamp's retrieval.

338
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:05,722
I'll send Tian Shu to take you
to retrieve the lamp.

339
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:09,802
Being disturbed by her own daughter
is better than by a stranger.

340
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:13,961
Yes, I'll go right now.

341
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:32,202
<i>Mother, thank you
for giving me yet another chance.</i>

342
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:37,922
<i>This time, I definitely won't waste it.
I definitely won't.</i>

343
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:52,922
Your Highness, have you gotten the lamp?

344
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:54,722
In my hands is the Soul-gathering Lamp.

345
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,641
Follow me quickly back to
the Celestial Palace.

346
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:57,842
Yes.

347
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,481
I have retrieved
my mother's burial possession

348
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:27,786
the Soul-gathering Lamp.

349
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:34,762
I hope Your Majesty will remember
everything I have done in the past

350
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:37,481
and remember what you once promised me.

351
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,882
Su Jin, you were once my side consort

352
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:44,041
and are also a descendant
of a meritorious subject.

353
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,762
Should you wish to marry again

354
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:48,641
I will grant you another
fine marriage arrangement.

355
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:50,882
Why must you be so attached to Ye Hua?

356
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:53,041
Please grant me my wish, Your Majesty.

357
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:16,362
All right, I promise you.

358
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:19,202
You brought us this lamp today.

359
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,362
If it really can save Ye Hua

360
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:25,041
I will definitely have you
married into Xiwu Palace.

361
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,722
Thank you, Your Majesty.

362
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:05,442
