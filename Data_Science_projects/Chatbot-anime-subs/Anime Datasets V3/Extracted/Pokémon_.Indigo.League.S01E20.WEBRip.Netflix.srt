15

16
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,411
-[Ash] Wow. look at those rocks.
-Pi.

17
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,583
That's a long drop.

18
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,584
Fall from here
and the ball game's over.

19
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,587
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

20
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,924
[Brock] The map says that this ridge
leads right to Saffron City.

21
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,094
[Ash] And to our next challenge
at the Saffron Gym.

22
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,929
Yeah. huh?

23
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,767
-What are those?
-[Misty] They look like Butterfree.

24
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,937
The Butterfree are celebrating
their season of love.

25
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,439
-Love?
-[Brock] Yeah.

26
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,108
The season of love
is when Butterfree lay their eggs.

27
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,194
The Butterfree find mates
and then lay their eggs across the sea.

28
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,364
-[Ash] Across the sea?
-[Brock] That's right.

29
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,616
[Misty] How cute.

30
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,993
You mean my Butterfree would go too?

31
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,580
If you don't let it cross the sea,
it will never have babies.

32
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,373
Hm. Babies?

33
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,846
[Misty] I'm surprised there was
a hot air balloon for rent out here.

34
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,808
We'll probably see lots of other balloons
once we get up into the air.

35
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,976
Hold on, guys.

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,945
[Ash] Heh, what a view.

37
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,032
-[Pikachu chuckles]
-[all] Huh?

38
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,202
-[Misty] Look, there they are.
-[Brock] Let's go.

39
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,915
[all trill] Butterfree!

40
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,210
Wow, all the Butterfree
are pairing off into couples.

41
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,462
-Okay, Ash.
-Oh, right.

42
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,381
Butterfree, go!

43
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,267
-Go out there and find your mate.
-Good luck, Butterfree.

44
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,112
Huh?

45
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,155
Maybe none of those Butterfree
is its type.

46
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,658
What do you mean
by<i> its type,</i> Brock?

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,285
The Butterfree
all look exactly the same to me.

48
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,912
Some must fly better than others

49
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,332
or maybe they have
slightly different patterns, I guess.

50
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,459
-Huh?
-[all] Huh?

51
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,670
[Misty] Look at all the balloons.

52
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,673
[trilling]

53
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,385
[Brock] They're all Butterfree trainers.
They come at this time every year

54
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,012
to release their Butterfree.

55
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,097
[Ash] Oh.

56
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,685
You just go find yourself
a nice mate, Butterfree, go!

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,607
[laughs]

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,112
[gibbering]

59
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,489
Oh, no, not this again.

60
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,574
[all gasp]

61
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,784
-Butterfree.
-Listen up, Butterfree.

62
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,619
See the Butterfree
that girl just released?

63
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,998
Ha! that one. That one right there
pick that one.

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,794
Don't you get it?
If two Butterfree fall in love

65
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,422
their trainers will meet
and they can fall in love too.

66
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,300
-Oh.
-Don't butt into Pokémon love affairs.

67
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,927
But, Misty,
if Butterfree doesn't find a mate

68
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,429
it won't ever have babies.

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,640
Go ahead, then.

70
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,102
[trills] Free! Free!

71
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,979
Go get them, Butterfree.

72
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,274
The perfect mate for you
is got to be out there somewhere.

73
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,235
Free! Free!

74
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,326
Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free!

75
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,955
It looks like Butterfree
really found someone it likes.

76
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,124
Yeah, love at first sight
with that pink one.

77
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,045
Butterfree's acting kind of weird.

78
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,089
[Brock]
That's Butterfree's courtship dance.

79
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,008
[Ash] Courtship dance?

80
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,012
It's Butterfree's way of saying:
"I want to be your Butterfree."

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,889
Oh, that's so romantic.

82
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,267
If it's successful,
the other Butterfree does a dance too.

83
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,603
[Misty] It's doing something.

84
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,274
What's going on?

85
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,735
Free! Free! Free! Free! Free...

86
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,739
[groans] Free...

87
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,990
[all gasp]

88
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,915
-Butterfree got shot down.
-What? That's so mean. That isn't fair.

89
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,543
[sobs]

90
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,506
[gasps] Butterfree.
Where are you going?

91
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,093
Butterfree!

92
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,554
Shot down in its prime.

93
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,727
[Ash] Butterfree! Hey, Butterfree!

94
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,480
-[Misty] Butterfree.
-Pikachu.

95
00:05:55,564 --> 00:06:01,903
-Butterfree. Come out.
-Butterfree. Where are you?

96
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,033
It's Butterfree.

97
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,995
Hey, there, Butterfree,
are you okay?

98
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,663
[groans] Free...

99
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:17,002
-Hey, how come you look so sad, buddy?
-It was rejected by someone it loved.

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,673
That's a terrible shock.
Believe me, it's a terrible feeling.

101
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,427
I could write a book
about the secrets of love and heartache.

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,471
I guess that book
would be your autobiography.

103
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,472
[groans]

104
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,686
Pikachu. Pika, Pikachu.

105
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,106
Pika. Pikachu.

106
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,442
Do you think maybe Dexter
might be able to tell us

107
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,403
how Butterfree can get that
other Butterfree to be its mate?

108
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,614
Dexter's never been in love.

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,410
I just don't understand it.
My Butterfree's great.

110
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,829
Why would any other Butterfree
reject it?

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,332
Butterfree, maybe you just have
to show off your strengths

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,542
and let the others see
how great you are.

113
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,379
Show how powerful your Tackle is
or how you can use Stun Spore.

114
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,090
That's right, Butterfree.
You've got to be assertive.

115
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,219
Love is all about attacking
your opponent first.

116
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,514
Get in a quick punch and surprise them,
then while they're still weak

117
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,142
take the lead
and you'll beat them hands down.

118
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,728
Trust me,
I know that's the best way to win.

119
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,774
-You mean it?
-Sure do. That's love.

120
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,152
-Ah! I wish I'd known that sooner.
-Let's give it another try.

121
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,820
-Hold it.
-Huh?

122
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,572
A new look might help.

123
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,575

124
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,078

-Yeah, that looks great.

127
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,500
Free! Free!

128
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,045
We got to find it. Where did
that pink Butterfree go?

129
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,966
-This is important to you, isn't it?
-I raised that Butterfree myself

130
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,760
and I'll show them all
how good it is.

131
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,472
Heh, it looks like the trainer
is just as passionate as the Butterfree.

132
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,309
All right, there it is.

133
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,355
Now, Butterfree, this time
just have confidence in yourself.

134
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,357
-Go.
-Pika.

135
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,733
Free!

00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,705
Hm. Now use your Tackle.
That should do the trick.

[Jessie]
Ha-ha! Look at all the Butterfree.

152
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,998
[James] All ours for the taking.

153
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,209
[Meowth] Let's do some networking, ha-ha!

154
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,173
Look! They're stealing the Butterfree.

155
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,258
It's those little twerps again.

156
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,261
No matter where we go,
those kids are always in our way.

157
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,389
But this time
they can't do a thing to stop us.

[Ash] Hey, knock it off.

161
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,522
[Brock] Stop or you're going to disrupt
their whole egg-laying season.

[Misty] Can't you see
these Butterfree are in love?

163
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,446
Heh, we're in love too, little girl,
with all the pretty little Pokémon.

164
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,907
Those Butterfree are free no more.

165
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,826
Argh! We've got to stop them.

00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,383
-We're swiping all of the Butterfree.
-There's never been a happier me.

170
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,096
Can't we speed this thing up
and catch them?

171
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,307
I'm trying, Ash,
but their chopper's a lot faster.

172
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,475
Huh.

173
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,438
Ha-ha, nothing but net.

174
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,943
Free!

175
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,279
Free! Free!

176
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,741
Free! Free!

177
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah. That's it, Butterfree!
Use your Tackle Attack.

178
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,960
Huh, that pathetic little insect thinks
it can stop us.

179
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,130
Butterfree, Stun Spore now!

180
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,094
Ha-ha-ha! That was a stunning failure.

181
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,763
[sighs] I guess I'm going to
have to use Pidgeotto then.

182
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,807
Wait a minute. You can't do that.

183
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,060
Just think how Butterfree would feel.
It's trying its hardest out there.

184
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,981
All right.

185
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
All right. What a catch.

186
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,944
Now let's hit the skyway.

187
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,784
[Jessie] <i>Our thanks to all of you who came</i>

-Here goes.

192
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,475
-I don't see Butterfree or Team Rocket.
-[sighs]

193
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,936
Butterfree was flying
as fast as it could.

194
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,899
I bet it's going to follow that pink
Butterfree no matter where they take it.

195
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,735
Butterfree, where are you?

196
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,945
Pika!

197
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,324

-[Jessie] A very nice catch.
-[James] Just between us, isn't it nice

208
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,697
to have one of our nefarious schemes
actually work for once?

209
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,907
Feels great.

210
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,201
We're at our best
when we're at our worst.

211
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,661
We've finally got it back.

212
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,623
Yeah, when the boss hears about this,
I'll be top cat again.
