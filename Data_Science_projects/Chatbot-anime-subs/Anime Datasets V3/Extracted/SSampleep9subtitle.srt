00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,790
- Well, that</font></font>

31
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,760
. </font>Most of this, there are several oddity among them</font></font>

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,340
As if the mechanism to be Miss, it formed to be a terrorist firing from Oshaltha</font></font>

33
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,970
! </font>It has sensors and ornament Kalmkhalb grow them</font></font>

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,770
... it is not, the maids who display in the manga and light novels</font></font>

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,480
. </font>Not only fictional creations</font></font>

37
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,980
. </font>And not as any maids in the lives of common folk</font></font>

38
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,230
So, what is the maid cafe?</font></font>

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,280
. </font>They completely Mokhtlvat for maids who go and meet Tarafhn</font></font>

42
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,490
Maids go to meet?</font></font>

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,210
. </font>For the factors, the maid is someone looking forward to it</font></font>

44
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,500
Maids?</font></font>

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,550
Looking forward to it?</font></font>

46
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,550
. </font>Maids are something common folk can not reach him</font></font>

47
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,680
. </font>You can say as if they were some kind of celebrity ..</font></font>

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,180
. </font>A special kind of person</font></font>

49
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,930
Kemeto-sama, do you think this is what it?</font></font>

50
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,020
... Well, when I arrived here at the beginning and I saw a lot of maids here</font></font>

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,410
In other words, Kemeto-sama you say you love the maids?</font></font>

54
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,580
