1
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,917
You're Lilah?

2
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,124
Arnold?

3
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,961
What's the password?

4
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,924
- "Romeo sent me."
- He must like you.

5
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,000
- Did he say that?
- He sent you to me.

6
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,719
- He knows I'm desperate.
- You came to the right man.

7
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,728
So, how do we do it?

8
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,083
Do you have money?

9
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,160
- I didn't know how much...
- $500.

10
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:38,238
Jesus.

11
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,765
They're $20 a pop.
I can sell you a packet of 25.

12
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,443
This is prime stuff. Guaranteed fresh.

13
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,407
Could I see them?

14
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,721
No free samples.

15
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,367
Look, this is my cookie-jar money.
I've got to see what I'm buying.

16
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,320
Never let it be said...

17
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,766
"What does a Polish girl get that's long
and hard when she gets married?"

18
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,040
Where's the punchline?

19
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,081
That's what you pay me for.

20
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,038
Speaking of marriage,
I'm married to a Polish man.

21
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,358
I don't know if you know Polish men...

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,244
...but he gave me something long and hard
when we got married.

23
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,880
- You know what?
- Yeah, a last name.

24
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,801
You heard that one, huh?

25
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,404
I hate Wilma Flintstone.
I want to talk about it.

26
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:43,687
I think she's a fucking bitch.

27
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:48,162
I'm from New York, from a large family.
There are 10 kids in my family.

28
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:51,047
That's a lot of kids, Jack.
My father has stretch marks.

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,528
There's a bunch of us.

30
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:56,119
I know you're all staring at me thinking,
"My God, look at this girl.

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,246
"She looks so much like Diana Ross.
I can't get over it."

32
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,564
I'm going to do an impression...

33
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,719
...of Gandhi's mother.

34
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:08,525
"Sweetheart, please, just a sandwich."

35
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,968
My wife bought alligator gloves.
I said, "Why the gloves?"

36
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,040
"I'll tell them I got a skin condition."

37
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,359
Have you tried Leech Off?

38
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,963
Leech Off works naturally
with hydrochloric acid.

39
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,200
Just a few drops in each eye,
you can kiss those leeches goodbye.

40
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,288
We were making love the other night.
I felt he was holding back.

41
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:30,039
So I said, "Sweetheart,
we've been married for 15 years.

42
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,121
"When we make love,
I don't want you to hold back.

43
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,848
"I want you to do
whatever you want to do."

44
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:38,887
So you know what he did? He threw up.

45
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,846
The thing about being married
to a Polish man...

46
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,881
...you'd think it would be
like being married to anyone else.

47
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,279
The first physical contact I had
with a woman came very early in life.

48
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,167
I saw a girl dancing,
I went up and bit her on the chest.

49
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,479
Slaughter? They're saving the whales...

50
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,720
...they're saving the seals
but nobody gives a shit...

51
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,846
...when they kill a baby polyester
just to make a...

52
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,558
Hollywood's newest concept for
a wax museum comes from an ear doctor...

53
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,241
...who treats the stars.

54
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,321
I don't want to argue with you, please,
with the stereotypes.

55
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,479
Chinese people are excellent drivers. Fine.

56
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,766
A lot of Jewish people pick up a check.
Fine.

57
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,238
Many Japanese tourists
have no photo equipment.

58
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,887
They have big dicks. Fine.

59
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:26,439
Listen, you'll like this.
It works in my history class.

60
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,885
Nathan Hale said, "I only have one life."

61
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,520
Listen. I can wait. I'm waiting.

62
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,600
I have all the time.

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,397
Asshole!

64
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,239
Excuse me. I'm Steven Gold.

65
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,447
Mr. Gold, how nice of you to drop by.

66
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,887
Sorry I'm late.
You know, I was up studying all night.

67
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:08,360
That's all right. Certainly seems
to be paying off for you, doesn't it?

68
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:09,478
Sir?

69
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,924
On the written portion, you got a 98.

70
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,000
It's the highest grade in the class.

71
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,078
I did?

72
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes, that's quite an accomplishment
for a student who's been...

73
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,237
...on academic probation
for the last half year.

74
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:23,883
Thank you.

75
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,767
I'd call it incredible.

76
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,962
Wouldn't you?

77
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,359
Trace the path of digestion, Gold.
Label everything along the way.

78
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,327
Was this on the prep sheet?

79
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,640
No. But for a man who scored 98
on the written test...

80
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,368
...this should be no problem.
Labels please.

81
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:47,366
If I could just say a word about labels.

82
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,963
I think that to truly function
in today's society...

83
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:54,406
...a doctor has to have an understanding
of the human being as a whole.

84
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,760
- Do you not agree?
- I would.

85
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,124
I could stand here and I could name things.

86
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,600
I could name the hard and soft palate,
the pharynx, epiglottis and oesophagus...

87
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,728
...the stomach, the spleen,
but it doesn't begin to touch on the fact...

88
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:11,768
...that the gastro-intestinal system,
which is your specialty, Dr. Wishniak...

89
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,238
...indeed the field that I hope to go into...

90
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,366
...is really responsible
for keeping the whole human being alive.

91
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,280
The heart, the lungs,
everything pales by comparison...

92
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:26,566
...because man is motivated...

93
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,443
...in everything he does by hunger.

94
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:34,681
Popular belief has it
that man is motivated by sex, Mr. Gold.

95
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,201
Let me tell you something.

96
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,849
You show a starving man
a beautiful woman and a pizza.

97
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,363
What do you think he's going to choose?

98
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,167
Make it an ugly woman and a pizza.

99
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,046
Name the parts, Gold.

100
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:50,879
If you can't get 100 percent,
you're not the man who took that test.

101
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,882
And if you sent someone else in
to take it for you, you're out!

102
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,202
Spleen inflecture of the transverse colon.

103
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,883
Greater omentum.

104
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,757
Vermiform appendix.

105
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:18,638
The intestine.

106
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,839
What part of the intestine?

107
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,682
The large intestine.

108
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,118
What part of the large intestine?

109
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,405
- Do you know it or not?
- Of course I do.

110
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,081
Then what is it?

111
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,843
The poop chute.

112
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,286
I call it that because I don't believe
in shrouding our organs...

113
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:42,441
...in mysterious names.
That's why people are afraid of doctors.

114
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,362
- We're washing you out, Gold.
- Dr. Wishniak, please.

115
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,362
I've been under something
of a time problem this semester.

116
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,440
I've been working nights.

117
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,287
Can I be frank with you?

118
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:56,681
There are people with real talent and
dedication waiting for a spot in this school.

119
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,399
One of them is going to have yours,
because it serves no purpose...

120
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,526
...to let someone like you
become a practitioner of medicine.

121
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,681
What good does it do
to allow someone with no talent for it...

122
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,966
...to treat people
with life-threatening ailments?

123
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,241
It'll cut down on the number of people
with life-threatening ailments.

124
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:18,163
- Is everything a joke to you?
- No, it's not, Doctor. I'm sorry.

125
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,638
- Please, I'd like another chance.
- Sorry.

126
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,208
I can't flunk out.

127
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:23,722
You already have.

128
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,447
What am I going to do?

129
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:32,120
This work you do at night,
is it anything you have a talent for?

130
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,123
Rectum!

131
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,248
But seriously now...

132
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,889
...if the phone rings and it's for me,
it's my father.

133
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,564
He thinks it's the number of the school
dormitory, so everyone shut up.

134
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,002
Last week he calls me up.

135
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,038
He says, "Son, I want you to tell me
that you're in the top half of your class."

136
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,561
"I'm in the half of the class that made
the top half of the class possible."

137
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,727
That sounds kind of deceptive...

138
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:16,006
...but if anyone has pulled as many strings
as my father has...

139
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,001
...you have to break it easy to him
that you flunked out.

140
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,886
- Your hair looks great.
- You think?

141
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,687
- It's going to kill.
- Thanks.

142
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,043
- Hi.
- Hi, Percy.

143
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,926
- Check it out.
- Yeah.

144
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,249
- It's Lilah time.
- Hi, Brian.

145
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,604
I love your hair.

146
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:34,722
My husband's going to kill me.
He hasn't seen it yet.

147
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:35,924
Dump the asshole.

148
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,126
It's very mango.
It's very Zulu. It's very Lucy.

149
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,961
Lilah, I talked to my manager.

150
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,724
He said that you should send him a tape.
Everybody starting out needs a tape.

151
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,482
The networks, they love housewives.
They're into them.

152
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,845
Everyone loves housewives
that's why Jesus loved Mary. A true story.

153
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,840
- Who's got a cigarette?
- Who's got a tape?

154
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,443
My friend will make you one for $100.

155
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,645
- Who's got $100?
- You need a tape, trust me.

156
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,765
- You need a tape.
- You need a tape.

157
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:02,409
- She needs a tape.
- All right, I need a tape.

158
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,885
Could someone do me a big favour
and trade places with me tonight?

159
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,847
I haven't been home all day.
My husband's really pissed off.

160
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,078
- Not me.
- Not I.

161
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,204
Why not?

162
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,326
Tonight's a first-come-first-served night...

163
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,400
...and you walked in right after Mr. Ball.

164
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,686
He gets the audience into a fractured,
frenzied, bloodthirsty state.

165
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,521
I can't follow that.

166
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,204
- Zip me.
- Who's up now?

167
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:28,760
The very genuine, the very wonderful,
the very stage-hoggy Steven Gold.

168
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,158
Who's up next?

169
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,042
The very vivacious Sister Saint Monique.

170
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,565
Brian, wouldn't you do me this favour
and trade with me?

171
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,002
I'll make it up to you.

172
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,044
Beg me.

173
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:40,318
- Please?
- All right.

174
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,639
- Thanks.
- Tell Ernie to send me down a drink.

175
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,242
Make it a scotch and soda.

176
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,202
Why, Sister.

177
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,437
I'm no New Yorker. I didn't know
about the city so I had to learn.

178
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,918
I wanted to take one of these tours.

179
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,240
I got on this tour bus run by this guy,
Tommy Chen.

180
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:01,486
And Tommy didn't know shit
about New York City.

181
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,328
Tommy Chen was making it up
as he went along.

182
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,560
"Okay, this right here,
this Columbus Circle.

183
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:12,719
"This call Columbus Circle because...

184
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,728
"...when Columbus came here...

185
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,685
"...he looked all around.

186
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,007
"You know how subway get its name?

187
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,967
"Subway originally was tunnels
filled with water.

188
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,479
"People travel uptown, downtown,
on big long submarine.

189
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,958
"Hold 300, 400 people.
But they were very slow..."

190
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,528
- Hi.
- How you doing?

191
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,008
- I'm Eve.
- I'm Lilah.

192
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,557
I know. I saw your stand-up last week.

193
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,479
Is that the week I got a laugh?

194
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,002
How long have you been doing it?

195
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:53,728
Thirteen weeks and three days,
but who's counting?

196
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,162
I know. It takes time.

197
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,841
Eve, pick it up.

198
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,397
"That over there, Central Park.

199
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:03,603
"It named after cousin
to very famous Korean Tung Sung Park...

200
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:09,808
"...who'd another cousin named Prospect,
but he live in Brooklyn."

201
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,044
How long before you get like that?

202
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,201
Steven? I'm afraid he's born that way.

203
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,924
- You know him?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,359
"And they were from Harlem."

205
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,408
That well?

206
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,317
Briefly. Asshole needed a place to stay.

207
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,004
"We don't want to see
poor people in Harlem."

208
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,841
Not a good experience?

209
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:34,881
A lot of laughs.

210
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,967
"I can't really blame them.
Nobody wants to see unhappy places.

211
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,326
"Nobody wants to see sad places.

212
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,286
"People want to see beautiful places.

213
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:48,601
"People want to see a beautiful world.
And I show it to them.

214
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,159
"Even if I have to fake it.

215
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,004
"I'm not just a tour guide.

216
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,967
"I'm a tour stylist." Thank you.

217
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:01,487
Thank you very much.

218
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,003
Thank you.

219
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:12,757
Steven Gold, ladies and gentlemen.
The comedy of Steven Gold.

220
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,564
How about that? A very lovely guy.

221
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,005
A sick guy, but a lovely guy.
You know you're at The Gas Station?

222
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,681
- Hi, I'm Lilah.
- Hi.

223
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,283
I'm a big fan of yours.
I watch you all the time.

224
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,883
Could you watch me sometime
and give me some pointers?

225
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,006
Sure. Right now I have to go clean
my fish tank.

226
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,557
I want to keep bringing them up here,
like it or not.

227
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,002
Are you ready for it?
All right, let me hear it.

228
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,683
Okay, now the next lady...

229
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,408
...is not very funny but...

230
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,528
...she does have chronic yeast infection.

231
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,481
And she has a Polish husband,
so I don't know which is worse.

232
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,005
Let's be nice to her. Let's give her
a nice big Gas Station welcome.

233
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,319
Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Lilah Krytsick.

234
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:56,038
Come on, Lilah. Come on up here.
Show them what you've got.

235
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,923
Lilah Krytsick, ladies and gentlemen.

236
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,680
Quick, get her a ladder.

237
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,403
How's that?

238
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,965
This is the first time
anybody's asked me to make it smaller.

239
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,488
Thank you, Romeo.

240
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,323
It's true, my husband is Polish...

241
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,442
...which I personally don't think
is very funny.

242
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,601
But if you think it's funny,
I'd like to tell you that to him...

243
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,647
...the term "simultaneous orgasm" means:

244
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,684
It could happen in the same room.

245
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,318
I don't understand.

246
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,526
The kids in the history classes,
they love it and think it's funny.

247
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:42,644
It is funny.

248
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,920
It is funny, but the audience goes after you
because you let them.

249
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,237
You got to fight back.

250
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,320
If a guy heckles you, heckle him back.

251
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:51,001
Use that old joke about his wife:

252
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,798
"Excuse me, sir, is that your wife?
Do you have any naked pictures of her?

253
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,880
"Would you like to buy some?
Naked videos?

254
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,925
"How about 8-millimetre
pornographic loops?

255
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,239
"Or pictures of her with me?
With farm animals?

256
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,047
"With ex-cons from New Jersey?"

257
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,405
It's an old joke, but it shuts him up
and the audience gets a laugh.

258
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,478
Attack, Jerry.

259
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:10,527
Why would he have naked pictures
of his wife?

260
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:14,119
Forget everything I just said.
Just forget everything.

261
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:15,688
- Hey, Steven.
- Yo!

262
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,202
Could I talk to you?

263
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,280
Step into my office.

264
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,007
- See you later.
- Yeah.

265
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,608
- Have a good show.
- I will.

266
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,487
- You'll kill them. I know you will.
- See you later.

267
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,083
- What do you want?
- Are you taking a bath?

268
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,445
Making a pit stop.
Been sleeping on a couch lately.

269
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,721
You could use my office.
Do you need some money? Is that it?

270
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:37,607
I can't pay you back,
if that's what this meeting is about.

271
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,361
We're friends, we're like a family.

272
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,883
I won't ask for money
when you're in a tight spot.

273
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,324
- You're a prince.
- I take care of my people.

274
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,684
- You're a saint.
- Like I took care of Robyn Green.

275
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:47,838
You are God.

276
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,921
Two years, I took him through hard times.
I did.

277
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,082
What happened? One night, a talent scout
walks in. "Goodbye, Romeo."

278
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:56,727
Not a thank you, not a postcard.

279
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,243
- No 10 percent commission.
- This isn't about money.

280
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,365
- You hurt my feelings.
- It is about money.

281
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,088
You pack this place up,
and pay us $15 a set.

282
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,399
Then you get discovered and I'm still here.

283
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,481
Where you rake it in,
while we sell our blood to the Red Cross.

284
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,480
Don't tell us about any big favours you do.

285
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,561
- I could've turned this place into a garage.
- Why didn't you?

286
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,685
I'll tell you. God help me, I love comics.

287
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,522
- Cut to the chase.
- What chase? What is he talking about?

288
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,928
You want to be my agent?

289
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,603
- You want 10 percent of my $15?
- Is that a problem?

290
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,726
The $12 I get for selling my blood?
I'm a very rich man.

291
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,767
I've been selling off my body.
Usually you wait until you die.

292
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,046
They're making a special case for me.
I got $6 for a lung...

293
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,006
...I got $2.50 for a pound of my liver.

294
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,728
I've been selling my sperm
to a fertility clinic.

295
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,767
The sperm bank has a night-deposit slot.
I'm making a fortune.

296
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:43,044
I'm just tired
of sticking my dick in a machine.

297
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,359
- Funny stuff, write it down.
- You're laughing?

298
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,928
I have written it down.

299
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,841
- I want you to remember me, that's all.
- Who's Madeline Urie?

300
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:56,443
She provides talent
for all the major networks.

301
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:59,168
She scouts for Letterman.
She scouts for Carson.

302
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,440
She saw your first show.
She wants to see you again.

303
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,367
Is this for real?

304
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:08,765
She's upstairs, right this minute,
waiting for you.

305
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,726
Why didn't you just say so?
What should I do?

306
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,919
- I'll do the subway stuff.
- No.

307
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,806
- I'll do the medical stuff.
- Yes.

308
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,119
- Do up your fly.
- Aren't we trying to impress her?

309
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,803
- Put some money in your pocket.
- I don't need your money.

310
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:26,004
It'll make you feel strong.

311
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,439
You do many interesting things
in medical school, play fascinating games.

312
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,565
There's "Name that Organ."

313
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,645
It's small, shaped like a swimming pool.
I'm going to guess kidney.

314
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:38,559
Am I right?

315
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:40,608
Of course, you do have to go...

316
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,045
You don't know his name? We've had
the same pediatrician for 8 years.

317
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,960
How could you not know his name?

318
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,528
I have to call my manager.

319
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,408
How high?

320
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,328
Is she up? Can I talk to her?
Would you put her on?

321
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,958
There's a talent coordinator here
and I want to find out who it is.

322
00:18:58,529 --> 00:18:59,848
Heidi, honey.

323
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,085
Tell me what's the matter?

324
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,637
When did it start?

325
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:06,323
"Advanced Bedside Manner."

326
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,565
This class teaches you
how not to do a shudder-take...

327
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:14,561
...when you know your patient
is going to die.

328
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,202
"Let's see,
we just got these X-rays back from the lab.

329
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,404
"Let's take a..."

330
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,758
Taxi!

331
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,484
Taxi!

332
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,407
Roll down the window.

333
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:40,524
I'm going to the garage.
How far are you going?

334
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:44,522
- Just a couple of blocks down the street.
- All right, get in. Come on.

335
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,405
I lied. I'm going to Jersey.

336
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:54,448
And I've got your name and
identification number, Mr. Hadji Gonzales.

337
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,601
Take me where I want to go
or your job goes right in the crapper.

338
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,963
Oh, lady.

339
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:04,758
"I say my prayers each night

340
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,399
"To make my soul a little cleaner

341
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:11,564
"Then I get up in the morning

342
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,085
"Try to catch me a novena

343
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,597
"I'm the envy of everyone

344
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,160
"Especially the Catholics

345
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,479
"Eat your heart out, Nell Carter

346
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:25,957
"'Cause I'm married to the fella

347
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,004
"who's on the crucifix"

348
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,959
I think this is the perfect way
to get back at this tight-assed bitch.

349
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:36,405
She'll come in, see this amputated member
from the male cadaver...

350
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,799
...stuck up between the legs
of the female cadaver. So I do it.

351
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,562
I don't care.
She comes in the next day and looks at it.

352
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,641
She says, "One of you gentlemen
left in a hurry last night."

353
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,118
I'm dead. I'm gone. I'm laughing.

354
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,086
This is the highlight of my semester.

355
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:51,966
You really did go to medical school.

356
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:55,325
Yes. In fact,
my father thinks I'm still there.

357
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:56,762
How can that be?

358
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,683
He lives in Chicago and I live here.

359
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,522
My ex-roommates cover for me.

360
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:04,999
If he calls, they leave me a message
on my service, so it all works out.

361
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:08,240
- How long has this been going on?
- All year. A full year.

362
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,889
I figure I can hold on till spring.

363
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,241
What happens then?

364
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:14,962
I don't know.

365
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,158
I was kind of hoping that something
would come along and replace it.

366
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:22,605
Like, "Dad, I'm not going to be
a heart surgeon...

367
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:25,886
"...like you or my brother after all,
but I am going to be a star."

368
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,358
Yeah, you are going to be a star.

369
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,999
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

370
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,807
And you're in a position
to know about such things?

371
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,164
That's what they pay me for.

372
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,005
So what are you going to do?

373
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:44,963
Send someone down here to see you.

374
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,204
- Who?
- Can't say.

375
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,764
Okay. When?

376
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,003
I think it's better if I don't tell.

377
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,120
It's that much of a mystery?

378
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,404
Isn't life more fun that way?

379
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,568
Lady, I've been coming down here
for eighteen months.

380
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:09,922
Eighteen months
and I have not missed a night.

381
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:14,327
I take the money that my father sends me,
I pay for a shrink and buy groceries.

382
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,287
Now, I owe my shrink
and I'm behind in my rent.

383
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:21,365
My roommate's changed the locks
on my front door. I can't get in.

384
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,440
He won't give me a key until I pay him.

385
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:26,089
You wanna play games? I can play games.

386
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,285
I can play ventriloquist with my underwear.

387
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,724
I can play darts
while maintaining an erection.

388
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,801
I can gargle dishwater
and fart O Canada at the same time.

389
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,800
I can play the piano without being popular.

390
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,926
I once dreamt I was dancing
with a jackhammer up my ass.

391
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,921
That's either a sex dream
or I need more fibre in my diet.

392
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,319
If any of this is turning you on,
just let me know.

393
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,922
Is this a joke?

394
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:52,680
If you're sending someone down,
you better send him fast...

395
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,919
...'cause funny Steve is going under.

396
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:59,243
"Here's hoping your tomorrow is grand

397
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,927
"It's been great to entertain you for a while

398
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,920
"In your book of memories

399
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:08,525
"Keep the name Billy Lane

400
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,686
"Remember this night

401
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,523
"and smile"

402
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,325
I love you, ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,240
But the love of my life...

404
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,042
...is the lady named Comedy.

405
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,128
This is a really good one, Mom.
It's really funny.

406
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,438
Really?

407
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,485
I got a knot in my hair.

408
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:40,208
- Could you help me?
- Just a second.

409
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,087
"Who is the most popular actor
in the Bible?"

410
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,397
I can't believe it.

411
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,322
Mom, it's the one day
I needed to be there on time.

412
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,240
Just tell her your mother overslept.

413
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,728
Do you want to hear it, Mom?

414
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,720
You didn't come to bed last night.

415
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,004
I sat up with Heidi.
Did Jenny even get home?

416
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:57,728
- After midnight.
- Forget the eggs, I don't have time.

417
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,925
"Who is the most popular actor
in the Bible?"

418
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,840
- Where's the coffee?
- There's no water.

419
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,965
- Why is that?
- It's on in the bathroom.

420
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,607
Guess, Mom. Take a guess.

421
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,645
You intend to cook
with bathwater tonight?

422
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,720
Did you forget we have guests for dinner?

423
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,528
Morning.
Mom, what did you do to your hair?

424
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:13,962
You forgot about tonight.

425
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,882
- You got egg in my hair.
- I think it's a grown-up one.

426
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:20,166
I told you about it two weeks ago.
Walter Robie, the church account.

427
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,524
Or has my business
become unimportant to you?

428
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,440
- Tonight?
- Something wrong with tonight?

429
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,087
- I'm eating at Susie's.
- You're not.

430
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,080
It's Friday. We're going to a movie.

431
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,888
- You're staying home tonight.
- Is someone coming tonight?

432
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,402
Give me the brush, I'll do it.

433
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,606
All right. I want you to do it anyway.
You do it much better.

434
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,725
Since Heidi's feeling better I thought...

435
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,765
You weren't planning on going out tonight?

436
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,158
No. It was this afternoon.

437
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,205
There's this guy who does videotapes...

438
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:47,008
- I'm talking about tonight.
- I'm talking about cooking.

439
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,364
- Stop arguing.
- I'll call you from Susie's.

440
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,519
I want you home from school,
you hear me?

441
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:54,282
- Cut it out!
- You do not live at Susie's house.

442
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,566
Is this going to be every day now?
And every night now?

443
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,163
When you first asked
it was to get it out your system.

444
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,762
Now look what's happening.

445
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:04,602
Three nights last week.
How many this week or the next?

446
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:05,678
Stop it!

447
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:07,288
- What do you want?
- A wife.

448
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,083
For dinner? What do you want for dinner?

449
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,600
I forgot my gym shorts.

450
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,281
No favours, okay.

451
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,764
I can take my clients out to Jumbo Jack.

452
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,841
Or we can boil bags of Stouffer's together.
I'm good at that.

453
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,647
Jumbo Jacks and Stouffer's succotash!

454
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,878
He is.

455
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:27,207
After dinner I can go to that hole and
watch my wife make a jackass of herself.

456
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:29,803
- You've never even seen me.
- Whose fault is that?

457
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,681
You said you understood about that.

458
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,248
I don't.

459
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:37,644
I couldn't be the way I need to be
if you were there.

460
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:39,481
- Which is what?
- Different.

461
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:41,480
- From what?
- From what I am right here.

462
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,605
What's wrong with what you are here?

463
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,601
- Who took my gym shorts?
- They're in Carrie's drawer.

464
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:50,159
- What are they doing in Carrie's drawer?
- Coral put them there.

465
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,683
These people I've invited
want to meet my family.

466
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:54,202
That's the way church people are.

467
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,803
If they like your family,
they do business with you.

468
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,677
They have 17 churches I could insure,
and Jerry and I need the business.

469
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,205
Now Bunny does this for Jerry.
She cooks for clients.

470
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:05,724
- What time?
- 6:30.

471
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,162
- I'll be here.
- Thank you.

472
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,648
- You're welcome.
- Carrie.

473
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,003
I need lunch money.

474
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:12,519
- I need money, too.
- My wallet, it's...

475
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:16,004
- Where is it?
- I've got $20.

476
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:18,799
I need $50 till I get to the bank.

477
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:22,481
I have $1.

478
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,638
Lilah?

479
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,361
It was my money. I saved it.

480
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,917
Where is it? Lilah?

481
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,523
I spent it.

482
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:32,678
On what?

483
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,483
Something I needed.

484
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:37,208
$500? What did you buy?

485
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,238
Jokes.

486
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,319
This is like living with a goddamn junkie.

487
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,639
Family crisis. See you later.

488
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:59,248
- Were they good?
- Not very.

489
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,122
We were going to go away
with that money.

490
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:07,963
You said you were saving it
so the two of us could get away.

491
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,247
I've got one, Mom.
You can have it for free.

492
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,568
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,927
It's not that I don't want you
to be happy, Lilah.

494
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:22,768
I just don't know what the hell to do.

495
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,323
'Bye, Mom.

496
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,439
- The answer is Samson.
- What?

497
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,999
He's the most popular actor in the Bible.
Know why?

498
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,403
No, sweetheart, I don't know why.

499
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,239
'Cause he brought the house down.

500
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:55,158
I guess it's not grown-up enough.

501
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:00,846
Look, Randy, don't be a prick.
The lady's crazy about me.

502
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,045
She's bringing the main guy
to see me tonight.

503
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:05,768
Screw the back rent, man,
I'm gonna be rich.

504
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,079
I'm going to get discovered tonight.

505
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,560
Yeah. No, I can't... I don't... What?

506
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:14,404
All right. I'm doing a nooner
in Queens today.

507
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,049
I can give you $100, but that's it.

508
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,001
I can't give you $600.

509
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:21,557
Where the fuck am I going to get $600?

510
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,163
So sell the fucking stereo, I don't care.

511
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:28,285
If you're gonna lock me out
of my own house, just do me a favour...

512
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:30,405
...feed the birds outside the window.

513
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,719
Give them some of your food.
That's what I did.

514
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,528
Don't... Fuck you! What an asshole!

515
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,919
- Do you know some guy named Arnold?
- Yeah.

516
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,806
- Sells jokes?
- Yes, why?

517
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,607
I'm looking for him.

518
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:46,165
- You want to buy some jokes?
- Sell some.

519
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,079
You've gotten that good, have you?

520
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:51,000
Back. Sell some back.

521
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,046
They didn't work.

522
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:55,127
No, not for me they didn't.

523
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:58,007
A joke's a joke, babe.
You just bought from the wrong guy.

524
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,728
Pedro, give me something awful.
Are you having lunch?

525
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,680
- Sure.
- Spaghetti special?

526
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:06,727
Sounds awful enough for me.
One for the lady.

527
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,288
- Do you recognise me?
- Of course. Why?

528
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,759
I don't know. You aren't usually this nice.

529
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,558
I'll tell you a secret about me.

530
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:24,527
I get jealous when I see somebody
who's got it up on stage.

531
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,361
I can't help it.

532
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:28,558
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

533
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,766
Five minutes of the right material,
you'd be un-fucking-believable.

534
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:34,841
You've got that thing.
People love you on stage. You know that.

535
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,039
- You mean it?
- All you need is the right gags. So...

536
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:41,643
I try to write my own jokes.
Like last night...

537
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,289
What are we here for
but to help each other out?

538
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:46,599
- You'd be willing to do this for me?
- Sure.

539
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,725
Where are you from? Jersey?

540
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,247
- Jersey?
- Yeah, I'm from Jersey.

541
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,638
- Do you have any kids?
- I've got three kids.

542
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:55,924
- Three kids, great.
- My feeling is that...

543
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,319
- What did this Arnold guy charge you?
- $500.

544
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:01,764
Okay. All right. This is the right ballpark.

545
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:04,044
Jersey, three kids,
there's something there...

546
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:06,006
I couldn't pay you right away.

547
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,924
I mean, I could pay you.

548
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,840
I just couldn't pay you right away.

549
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:14,124
How long does spaghetti take?

550
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:18,204
If I could find Arnold,
I could pay you right away.

551
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:20,598
Yeah, forget it. It's all right.

552
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:27,205
Look, I spent my vacation money.
My husband's and mine.

553
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,239
You've got your priorities then.

554
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,844
So spend your money on your vacation
and don't worry about jokes.

555
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,397
I mean, if it's not that important to you.

556
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,845
It's very important to me.

557
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,845
What do you need it for?

558
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,880
What do you need it for?

559
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,607
Ask my shrink.

560
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,205
Jeez. Cheese!

561
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,997
- You didn't mean it, did you?
- Yes, I did.

562
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:04,488
That I've got something?

563
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,606
That I would sell you jokes.
Do you want to buy some?

564
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,406
Not from you, you piece of crap.

565
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:15,162
How do you get off
treating people like this?

566
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,604
I don't see your name
up in lights over there.

567
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,088
So what if you're funny?

568
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,206
If that's all you are, so what? Jesus.

569
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,964
No wonder you're there every night.
You've nothing else to do. That's it.

570
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,641
Pedro, hold the spaghetti.

571
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:30,846
Bring this lady that testicle salad.
That ball-buster special.

572
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,840
You know, the one with the fork.

573
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,883
If they're yours, I'll need a pair of tweezers.

574
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,922
I thought you'd like that.

575
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,477
Everything's a great big joke to you.

576
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,638
Lady, nothing is a joke to me.

577
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:48,519
That's why I do stand-up comedy.

578
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:51,846
And that's why you don't. Yours is $1.50.

579
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:57,958
Wait.

580
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,198
Hey!

581
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:07,525
- What did you mean?
- Oh, lady, please.

582
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,282
You said nothing was a joke to you.
What do you mean?

583
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,041
I have to be somewhere. I'm late.

584
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:15,166
You don't like women?
I see you help Mr. Ball.

585
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,319
- Mr. Ball's got guts.
- And I don't?

586
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:20,765
You've got gall, not guts.
You stand up, you tell dirty jokes.

587
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,158
What does it have to do with you?
Are you a sexpot?

588
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,286
Give me a break. You're a Jersey
housewife with snot-nosed kids.

589
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,519
A car that won't start. Tell me about that.

590
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,679
That's what takes guts,
and you don't have it.

591
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:31,884
Am I being clear?

592
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,722
- I've gotten laughs.
- Fine. Then take them and go home.

593
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:35,924
I want to learn.

594
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,847
Lady, it takes every night.
Six clubs a night. All night.

595
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:42,638
Working stag parties and Elks Club
banquets, opening for an accordion player.

596
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,401
I don't have time for all that.

597
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:47,925
How about now? I'm going to Queens.
You wanna come learn something?

598
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,001
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious. Are you?

599
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:52,488
- I...
- I guess not.

600
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:54,967
I'm cooking for a dinner party.

601
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:57,324
Ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case.

602
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:05,642
What if it isn't funny?
You tell me to talk about my life.

603
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,287
What if my life isn't funny?

604
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,805
All of our lives are funny, babe.
We're God's animated cartoons.

605
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,163
What about your husband?

606
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,558
- There's gotta be some laughs there.
- Not mine.

607
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:17,322
- I bet there is. What does he do?
- Sells insurance.

608
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:21,640
- You win. How about your kids?
- Three girls.

609
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:24,527
Okay. All right. Big, little, what?

610
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,804
Nursery school, babysitters maybe?

611
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:29,483
God, they're gonna need one
if I'm not home by 4:00.

612
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,037
- That's funny.
- There's nothing funny in that.

613
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,120
The maid'll leave and they'll be alone.

614
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,120
Think comedy. Who's the babysitter?

615
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:37,961
This kid that lives down the street.

616
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,040
- Comedy. What's their name?
- I don't know.

617
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,882
- Comedy. What's their name?
- Charlie Manson.

618
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,358
- All right, that's funny.
- That's funny?

619
00:33:45,449 --> 00:33:48,441
You just wrote a joke. Yes.
Charlie Manson, the babysitter.

620
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,680
Yes, that's funny! Keep going with it. Go.

621
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:56,523
Honey, he's put X's
on their foreheads again.

622
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:02,761
If he's busy,
then we use this other nice boy.

623
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,045
Davie Berkowitz.

624
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:09,401
He's so good with dogs.

625
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:13,008
Who's Davie Berkowitz?

626
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,128
You know, Davie Berkowitz, Son of Sam.

627
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:19,848
You know, Davie Berkowitz.
He talks to dogs.

628
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,243
Manson is funny. Berkowitz is not.

629
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:29,285
I thought that was sort of funny.

630
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,121
Manson is funny.

631
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,128
Berkowitz is not.

632
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,638
All right.

633
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,960
Another game is...

634
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,323
Another game is
"Double up on the Medication."

635
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:47,560
You put the pill under your tongue...

636
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:49,560
...and when they return to check on you...

637
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,800
...you insist it wasn't in the cup.
"It wasn't in the cup.

638
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:56,886
"There's no pill there.
You give me my medication.

639
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,960
"I'm sick. You see?"

640
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:04,641
Those of you who are taking suppositories
might want to pass on that whole thing.

641
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:09,764
What? Do you have a question?
Your hand has been up since I got here.

642
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:12,079
This is probably a very debilitating illness.

643
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:13,522
What is your occupation?

644
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:14,962
I'm a doorman.

645
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:17,483
You're a doorman? So, like, you hail taxis?

646
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:18,843
That's what I do, yes.

647
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,045
This is like a good training device then.

648
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:23,518
You're fine.
You should get out of this hospital.

649
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:25,679
It must be painful
having this IV hooked up.

650
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,566
- Not at all.
- No pain at all?

651
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:29,958
No, that's not mine, that's his.

652
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:34,477
Son of a gun. Let me see this thing.
Good God, it is. What have we got here?

653
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,721
You're getting your lunch today.
We have some strawberry Jell-O.

654
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,959
It's that pasta salad dextrose.

655
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,609
What's your main course today?
Liver and onions.

656
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:46,999
Boy, even in the bloodstream
that's some pretty nasty stuff.

657
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:48,886
Here's a nurse. I'm just guessing.

658
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:50,402
You're right.

659
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:53,999
A sponge bath from this woman
would really be paradise.

660
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:59,446
Look, a doctor here, folks.
Son of a gun. A Jewish doctor.

661
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,321
Something you don't see very often
in a New York City hospital.

662
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,843
- You are a doctor, sir?
- Yes, I'm a doctor.

663
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,568
And what is your field of speciality?

664
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:10,839
This is my first year. I don't know yet.

665
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:13,921
Could I recommend
a career in welding, perhaps?

666
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,244
Just a suggestion.

667
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:20,083
You liked that? You liked that one?

668
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,044
- What is your name, sir?
- Sam.

669
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,567
You're a happy guy, Sam.

670
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:30,685
What are they pumping into your nostrils?

671
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,488
What is this concoction?
You're turning blue, Sam.

672
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,366
Why is that? You're turning blue.

673
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:37,758
Good God, I'm standing on his air hose.

674
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,444
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,968
You're running out of air. And so am I.

676
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:47,844
Folks, you have been a great audience.
Really.

677
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,885
You've been a good audience.

678
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,681
You've been a sick audience, folks.

679
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,125
But thank you very much, everybody.
Get well, everybody.

680
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,157
You were really good.

681
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:17,444
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

682
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,723
You were terrific.

683
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,721
- Thank you. That's very nice of you.
- Thank you.

684
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,200
What about last week?

685
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,639
I think it was 60,000.

686
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,317
45,000.

687
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:44,637
45,000?

688
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:47,524
I see.

689
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:50,283
That's good.

690
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,401
Taxi! Oh, God!

691
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,047
Taxi!

692
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:32,039
Wait! Oh, my God.

693
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:37,246
Taxi!

694
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,567
Okay, stop right here.

695
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:52,918
Hello!

696
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,078
Hello?

697
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,880
I'm home!

698
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,728
Don't come near me! I'm home.

699
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,647
- What are you doing? What's the matter?
- Where are you going?

700
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:21,163
I love you. Stay out of my way.

701
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,640
- Where's Jenny?
- At the movies.

702
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:28,880
At the movies? All right, that's it.

703
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:32,639
She's grounded.
If I ever see her again, she's grounded.

704
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:37,240
I want the two of you to go
and put your nice dresses on.

705
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,880
All right? Okay? What are you doing?
Go! Put your nice dresses on.

706
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,880
Go on, now, put them on!

707
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,117
Help me!

708
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:52,767
She said, "Hurry!" Come on.

709
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,686
Where are my shoes?

710
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,517
Oh, my God!

711
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,920
I can't find my tights.

712
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,562
Oh, my God!

713
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,401
Girls, come on! Let's go!

714
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:18,603
- Why are we running?
- I can't button this dress.

715
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,920
Will you help me with my hose?
Mom! Help me!

716
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:25,046
You two are just going
to have to help each other.

717
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,398
Oh, Jesus!

718
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,367
Out of my way! Out of my way!

719
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:15,278
Heidi, go long.

720
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:17,728
Heads up.

721
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:19,960
Bread basket! Pantry.

722
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,682
- Carry!
- Yeah?

723
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,839
No, "carry." Come here. Help me carry.

724
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,840
Take the big platter. There you are.

725
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:27,846
Somebody man the peas.

726
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,007
Heidi, the peas.

727
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:38,887
Carrie, napkins. One on each plate.
Here we go.

728
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:45,447
Heidi, break the bread.

729
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:48,366
Carrie, light a match.

730
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:52,639
Spoons. Centrepiece. Light that match.

731
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:54,877
All right.

732
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,277
Living room!

733
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:06,247
Living room!
Carrie, get your things off the planter.

734
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,559
- What should I do with them?
- Get rid of them.

735
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:10,321
Here, get rid of it.

736
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:14,961
- What happened to the fish tank?
- Don't say that again.

737
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:16,368
But the water went down.

738
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,440
I told you not to say that.

739
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:30,998
Kids.

740
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,562
Yes, dear?

741
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,283
My family.

742
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:40,484
Good evening.

743
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,159
The black goldfish is missing.

744
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:01,799
Yes, I'm still holding.

745
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,927
Why don't you just put me through to her?
I don't...

746
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,847
What restaurant?

747
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:15,326
She told me herself that she was bringing
a gentleman down to the club to see me.

748
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,759
The club: The Gas Station.

749
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:21,368
All right.

750
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:24,282
Would you give her that message...

751
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:26,999
...and have her please call me down here?

752
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:30,765
The Gas Station. Thank you.
Phone is free.

753
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:44,043
Were you born in New Jersey,
Reverend Young?

754
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,558
Yes.

755
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:51,162
So was I.

756
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,362
- So was I. We both were.
- Together.

757
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:56,844
We weren't born together.

758
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:03,204
- Care for some more wine?
- Yes.

759
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:08,760
I got a new joke, Mom.

760
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,922
You do, baby?

761
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:15,044
I think it's grown-up enough.

762
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:19,358
- I'm sure it is, sweetheart.
- She loves to tell jokes.

763
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:21,841
Coral told it to me.

764
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:23,528
Did she, dear?

765
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,282
Tell it, Heidi.

766
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:30,679
What did one cocksucker say to the other?

767
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:37,403
- Go home!
- Betsy Ross says, "I have 13 stars."

768
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,720
Would you listen to this?
This is funny. My class loves this.

769
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:43,238
Do you have any idea where she is tonight?

770
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:44,682
Is this her service?

771
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:48,284
Do you know, did she plan to come down
to The Gas Station tonight?

772
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,599
Who you got coming? An agent?

773
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:54,241
Okay, no, never...
Just tell her that Steven Gold called...

774
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:58,402
...and that I'm still expecting her
and the gentleman at the club. Thank you.

775
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:02,441
If you have a talent scout coming,
you're supposed to tell.

776
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:06,522
- I don't have a talent scout coming, Albert.
- Really? Who tried to call?

777
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:09,921
- Did somebody try to call me?
- That's what I heard.

778
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:12,287
- Did I have a call?
- Yeah.

779
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:14,564
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't find you.

780
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:17,243
- Who was it? What did you say?
- I don't know.

781
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,361
He wanted to know when you perform
and what time you go on.

782
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,087
So it is a talent scout.

783
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:24,125
He's coming down. What did you tell him?

784
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:28,202
I told him you're here every night and if
he wants to know what time, to call back.

785
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,644
- He said he'd call back?
- He said, "Thank you."

786
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,287
- But he said he'd come?
- Don't know.

787
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:35,520
- Why don't you write these things down?
- Why don't you take a hike?

788
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:39,158
Who is it? Just tell me who it is
and I'll watch for him.

789
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:40,762
Will you give me a second?

790
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:43,204
If you listen, it's going to be real funny.

791
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:45,928
Now, George Washington
gets off his white horse and...

792
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,965
George Washington sucks.

793
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,126
You, sir, do you have
any naked pictures of your wife?

794
00:45:56,769 --> 00:45:58,999
Only kidding.

795
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,687
No more than anyone else
who has a family.

796
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,327
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

797
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:04,637
What do you want?

798
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:08,642
- Just a family I can be proud of.
- A family you can be proud of. Like who?

799
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:11,562
- And don't tell me Bunny and Jerry.
- Bunny and Jerry.

800
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,048
Fuck Bunny and Jerry.

801
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:16,360
Why do you use language like that?
Don't use language like that.

802
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,360
No wonder your daughters talk like toilets.

803
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:21,088
- "Talk like toilets"?
- You know what I'm talking about.

804
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,841
What do you want?

805
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:24,601
- Just be a mother.
- I am a mother.

806
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:27,044
- Not by my definition.
- I am by my definition.

807
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:29,643
A mother stays with her children at night.

808
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:32,038
- Unless she works.
- Unless she gets paid to work.

809
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:34,723
- Unless she's lucky enough.
- Unless she's good enough.

810
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:38,119
- I am good enough.
- You're not, Lilah. You're not funny.

811
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,880
You say that to me one more time
and I'm going to leave this house.

812
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,687
- You can't stand the truth.
- I'm out!

813
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,168
I didn't say it!

814
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:47,479
- I'm out of here!
- All right, I will say it.

815
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:49,878
The woman who lives in this house
is not funny.

816
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:52,358
That woman, there in the dark,
is not funny.

817
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,838
- I'm out of here!
- No one laughs at that woman!

818
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:57,124
That woman is not funny!

819
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:56,322
I broke your deal.
Sorry. I'll have to pay for it.

820
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,603
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

821
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:08,240
There's people upstairs asking for you.
They wanna know what time you go on.

822
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:12,445
They look like heavyweights.
Who are they?

823
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:14,645
Jesus, she came through for me.

824
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:16,128
Who came through for you?

825
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:18,799
- Who are they?
- They're network people.

826
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:23,087
- "Network people"?
- Give me another 20-minute set tonight.

827
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:25,968
Calm down.
I want to have a nice talk with you.

828
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,164
- Later.
- Listen.

829
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:28,762
Leave me alone for a minute.

830
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:31,807
That's the whole point.
You don't have to be alone.

831
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:34,642
Even a prize-fighter
has someone in his corner.

832
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,124
Come on now, I know these people.

833
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,281
Use me. I can handle them.

834
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,121
Let me entertain them after the show.

835
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,040
They're only going to come in here once.

836
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,484
Let me help you make tonight count.

837
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,804
Okay.

838
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:50,121
- "Okay"?
- I said okay.

839
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:52,166
- We're talking agent?
- You're my agent.

840
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:53,443
- Permanent agent?
- Whatever.

841
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:54,678
In writing?

842
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,839
In writing. When can I go on?

843
00:48:56,929 --> 00:48:58,044
How about now?

844
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,240
- Just take it easy and relax. Relax.
- All right.

845
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:11,127
- Steven?
- Don't bother me, all right?

846
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:13,001
Don't bother him.

847
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,602
How's the house?

848
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,523
- Good crowd.
- A sensational crowd.

849
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:19,686
- Okay.
- Just relax. You ready?

850
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:22,203
- You'll point him out?
- Sure. He's down the front.

851
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:23,642
Just take a deep breath.

852
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:26,766
- You gonna get Albert off for me?
- He's almost finished.

853
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:30,407
...you blew up a sporting goods store
and you want to dust?

854
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:32,720
And I said, "Yeah, give me the Pledge."

855
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:33,924
Where are they?

856
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:38,207
Third table, left. Grey hair. Kill them.

857
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:42,519
You guys have been a nice audience
and Lenny wants to come up here.

858
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:46,477
Please see my new movie.
It's called, Goober, the Forgotten Pile.

859
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,287
Shit! Romeo.

860
00:49:49,729 --> 00:49:53,563
Albert Emperato, ladies and gentlemen.

861
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,683
I'd like to settle down
and get serious for a moment.

862
00:49:57,769 --> 00:49:59,839
I want to introduce you to someone...

863
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:04,127
...that I've had the privilege
of nurturing along on the road to stardom.

864
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:06,723
You know,
I've been in this business a long time.

865
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:09,966
I've seen comics come and go,
and sometimes you see somebody...

866
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:12,478
...that goes right to the top
and they stay there.

867
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:15,641
This young gentleman is not unlike that.

868
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:18,244
I've had him on this stage
month after month...

869
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:21,845
...because I knew one day
his star was going to shine.

870
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:25,366
There is very little else
I can say about him except that...

871
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,600
...he's like a son to me.

872
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,682
Let's have a nice warm welcome
for Steven Gold.

873
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,805
The comedy of Steven Gold!

874
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:35,802
Come on up here, Steven.

875
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:38,963
He wants to be coaxed. Come on.

876
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:41,557
Steven, come on up here. Come on.

877
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:44,924
He's a little shy. Let's give him a big hand.

878
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:46,687
Steven Gold!

879
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:52,285
That a boy, Steven! At last.

880
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:03,001
Good evening.

881
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:08,959
My name is...

882
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:10,841
You know who I am.

883
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,840
Anyone here from...

884
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:22,325
Don't you hate it when comics do that?

885
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,202
It means that they don't know
what else to say.

886
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:30,844
Anyone from out of town?
Here you go. Okay.

887
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:32,283
Yeah.

888
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:36,326
- You sir, where are you from?
- Green Bay, Wisconsin.

889
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:40,004
There's nothing funny about that.

890
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:45,482
What are you doing while you're in town?
You having fun?

891
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:47,248
Until now.

892
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,963
That's funny.

893
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:52,927
This guy's all right.

894
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,281
Is that your wife with you, sir?

895
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:57,677
My daughter.

896
00:51:58,009 --> 00:51:59,522
That's not gonna work.

897
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,248
I was going to ask if you had
any naked pictures of her.

898
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:05,639
- That won't work now, will it?
- No, that's not going to work.

899
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:08,044
No, that won't work.

900
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:15,877
I have some people in the audience.

901
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:21,600
I'm not going to kid around
with you people.

902
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,403
This is a heavy night.

903
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:26,322
This is a real heavy night.

904
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,526
I thought
I was going to get discovered tonight.

905
00:52:30,249 --> 00:52:32,558
And that is exactly what happened.

906
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:34,118
I did.

907
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:46,845
That was a private joke.

908
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:50,522
And I'm a comedian, so I'll go public...

909
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:53,039
...with these jokes.

910
00:52:55,569 --> 00:52:57,400
My father is a doctor.

911
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:01,287
When I was a student...

912
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:05,681
...I was a really bad student,
but that didn't stop my dad, the doctor...

913
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,802
...pulling a lot of strings
to get me into med school.

914
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:11,762
Even though it didn't seem
to matter to anybody...

915
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:13,840
...that I couldn't stand the sight of blood.

916
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,397
In fact, I once got yelled at because...

917
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:20,243
...during a fishing trip, I wouldn't take
the hook and put it through a minnow.

918
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:22,638
I didn't want to give it cerebral contusions.

919
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:26,085
I didn't want to give it optical poptitude,
you know.

920
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:30,318
You know what optical poptitude is?
It's bulging eyeballs, so...

921
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,921
There's something funny in here.

922
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,206
I'm gonna find something funny in here,
so

923
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,158
I don't know what's funny anymore...

924
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:45,685
...so could you just laugh any time
that you feel anything funny?

925
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,367
Just feel...

926
00:53:56,689 --> 00:53:58,919
Let me tell you about medical school.

927
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:05,083
You can't make the mistake
of letting them know...

928
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:08,878
...that you're squeamish about things
because they smell it on you.

929
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:12,001
I once made the mistake
of telling this female lab partner...

930
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:14,683
...that I couldn't stand
to see things suffer...

931
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,408
...like little frogs, that we'd have to dissect.

932
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:24,966
And she took this thing.
It's called a probe.

933
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:27,722
It's like a prong.
And she plucked out this frog's eye...

934
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:30,482
...and she flicked it at me
and it stuck on my neck.

935
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:35,922
I think that's pretty funny.

936
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:44,918
My dad is this big macho guy
and he shoots deer and shit like that.

937
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:47,443
I'm this kid who can't stand
the sight of blood.

938
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:49,440
They used to have deer in Chicago...

939
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:52,680
...until my brother and father
gunned them all down.

940
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,687
These are the guys
who killed Bambi's mom.

941
00:54:58,649 --> 00:55:01,561
Wait a minute.
I didn't tell you about the dead cat.

942
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,567
I haven't told you about the dead cat!

943
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:08,120
My fucking roommates
put this dead cat in my bed all the time.

944
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:11,122
Someone help me! Christ!

945
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:14,288
Come here.

946
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:24,480
Check it out, baby.

947
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,282
Leave me alone.

948
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:32,081
No! Go home!

949
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,844
Just leave me the fuck alone!

950
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:45,881
You're all right.

951
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:48,562
You're all right.

952
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:13,279
So my brother would be down
in the library studying...

953
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:16,725
...and I would be upstairs in the attic...

954
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:22,364
...covering myself in tin foil,
from head to toe.

955
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:27,045
Making up these superheroes of my own.

956
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,724
You know, Tin Foil Man.

957
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,079
Shingle Kid. You know.

958
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:37,087
Stuff to make my friends laugh...

959
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:40,798
...but at home, you know,
I was never funny.

960
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:49,198
I used to make everybody laugh.

961
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:51,725
Even my husband.

962
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,724
God, we used to laugh.

963
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:56,248
So?

964
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:58,487
What happened?

965
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,401
I don't know.

966
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:04,764
The kids or his job.

967
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:06,608
Me.

968
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:09,120
I don't know.

969
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:14,439
So why don't you leave him?

970
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:18,600
I've got carpool in the morning.

971
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,081
He sounds like a prick.

972
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:27,202
He works all day, comes home
and takes care of the kids all night.

973
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:29,320
He sounds like a saint.

974
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,928
He's not wrong.

975
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:36,202
I don't know.

976
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:39,444
Maybe I should quit. I don't know.

977
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:42,921
What? Quit stand-up?
No, you can't do that.

978
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,317
Why not?

979
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,086
Because you're funny.

980
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:52,003
I mean,
you don't know how to get to it yet...

981
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:55,486
...you haven't figured that out,
but you're funny.

982
00:57:56,129 --> 00:57:58,927
Look, don't kid me about this, all right?

983
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:03,162
I'll say anything to a woman
and not mean it.

984
00:58:03,649 --> 00:58:05,446
I'll say I love her.

985
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,880
I'll say she's beautiful. I'll say she's sexy.

986
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:12,118
I don't mess around with "funny."

987
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:20,640
Yeah, this is great.
This is really great, you know.

988
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:21,844
- What?
- Wonderful.

989
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:23,521
- What?
- Just wonderful. Look.

990
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:24,718
I'm a married woman.

991
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,084
- So?
- I'm 10 years older than you. I gotta go.

992
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:29,444
- So? Wait, Lilah.
- I gotta go.

993
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:31,008
Come on, be Italian.

994
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,847
What does that mean?

995
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:38,677
I was hoping you would know.

996
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:43,964
I gotta go. I really gotta go.

997
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:48,282
You're in trouble already.
So hang out with me tonight.

998
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:51,322
I'll teach you something about being funny.

999
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,801
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1000
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:55,845
You just want to talk to the crowd.

1001
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:58,045
- Pull over here. Thank you.
- I need my jokes.

1002
00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:00,359
- You talk to the crowd.
- "Talk to the crowd"?

1003
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:02,838
- I don't want to.
- They help you develop material.

1004
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:05,887
- No, I just simply can't do it...
- You're gonna learn now.

1005
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:08,405
- Come on!
- All right. God Almighty!

1006
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:11,447
You don't have to yell at me.
I have nothing to say.

1007
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,038
Yes, you do. The subway.

1008
00:59:14,169 --> 00:59:15,761
- What subway?
- Remember the subway.

1009
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:18,204
I don't remember the subway
nor what it looks like.

1010
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:22,803
Hi, I'm Lilah...

1011
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:26,646
...and I don't know what I'm doing.

1012
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:31,763
I'm not allowed to use
my jokes tonight, so...

1013
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:36,808
So I'll tell you I'm a housewife.
I'll admit to that.

1014
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,925
And I have three kids.

1015
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:42,766
And I live in New Jersey.

1016
00:59:43,089 --> 00:59:45,080
So, you see, I'll admit to anything.

1017
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,887
- Where are your kids?
- What?

1018
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:49,642
- Where are your kids?
- Home.

1019
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:52,198
- Who's looking after them?
- My husband.

1020
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:54,604
What if your husband's not available?

1021
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:58,088
Do you have a babysitter?

1022
00:59:58,449 --> 00:59:59,768
Charles Manson.

1023
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:05,924
And then if he's busy you use
that other nice boy down the street.

1024
01:00:06,009 --> 01:00:09,888
Davie Berkowitz.
He's so good with the dog.

1025
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:17,318
All right, it's not funny.
Okay. So shoot me.

1026
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,883
All right, I'm just gonna grab the...

1027
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,400
All right, this man over here is laughing.

1028
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:25,406
- What is your name, sir?
- Bob.

1029
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:28,078
Bob. And what do you do?

1030
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,399
I'm a marketing consultant.

1031
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:33,524
"Marketing consultant"?

1032
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,205
You're a marketing consultant?

1033
01:00:36,409 --> 01:00:39,367
Bob, could I consult with you
for one minute?

1034
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:46,487
Whenever I get a cart,
why is it that one wheel always goes...

1035
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:50,724
...like this, and pulls to the right,
right into the canned goods?

1036
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,045
I've wondered about it, haven't you?

1037
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:55,125
This lady is laughing here.

1038
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:58,042
You have a problem with produce,
don't you?

1039
01:00:58,129 --> 01:01:03,157
I think you must. You have your hand
in that gentleman's lap, I think.

1040
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:11,168
So, tonight it's going to be career night,
because everybody's life is funny.

1041
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:15,037
Trust me on this. We are all
God's little animated cartoons.

1042
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:16,802
This gentleman right here.

1043
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,039
- Sir, what's your name?
- Murray.

1044
01:01:19,129 --> 01:01:21,359
Murray, trust me on this one.
Your life is funny.

1045
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:23,758
- What do you do?
- I'm an insurance salesman.

1046
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,441
You're an insurance salesman?

1047
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,283
Did you ever want to be anything else?

1048
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:30,967
Think back with me.

1049
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:34,200
You're a small child.
You're dressing up. It's Halloween.

1050
01:01:34,289 --> 01:01:38,328
All the other boys, they're firemen,
policemen, they're Zorro or Batman.

1051
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:42,682
And cute little Murray,
whose mother adores him, is a...

1052
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:45,440
An insurance salesman.

1053
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:48,766
"An insurance salesman"?
Murray, this can't be true.

1054
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:52,319
You dressed up in a polyester suit
and you handed out business cards?

1055
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:00,441
This is a bachelorette party?
So, could I see what you've got here?

1056
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,601
You must have an appliance or two.

1057
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,681
It's a shower, for goodness sake.
This is what I was asking for.

1058
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:11,841
I'm not so old-fashioned.
You have appliances in today's age.

1059
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,687
You get...

1060
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,199
I hope this is for a sore shoulder.

1061
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,165
You better take this right away, honestly.

1062
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:29,161
Holey-moley, that's very frightening...

1063
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,809
I mean that's a high-voltage item, Buffy.

1064
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,844
I don't want to be intimate with anything
that has a 90-day warranty.

1065
01:03:19,249 --> 01:03:23,288
- Which one's your house?
- It's just up ahead. I think I should walk.

1066
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:27,004
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

1067
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:30,360
He doesn't beat you up
or anything like that?

1068
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:32,246
It is almost morning.

1069
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:38,842
I'll slip into bed with one of the kids.

1070
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:42,008
He'll think I've been there all night.

1071
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,208
What then?

1072
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:48,722
I don't know.

1073
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:51,839
You could run away with me.

1074
01:03:58,729 --> 01:04:00,481
Thank you for tonight.

1075
01:04:01,729 --> 01:04:06,359
- I'll never ever forget it.
- You were brilliant.

1076
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,124
Because of you.

1077
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:11,803
Now, hold that thought. Okay?

1078
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,647
- Lilah.
- I gotta go.

1079
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:18,606
- No, I want to say something.
- Don't.

1080
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:21,403
You don't know what I'm going to say.

1081
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:24,201
Just say good night.

1082
01:04:49,249 --> 01:04:51,479
You should have let me say it.

1083
01:04:53,049 --> 01:04:54,402
Good night.

1084
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:26,205
Steven! What are you doing here?

1085
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:28,763
They won't put my calls
through to your office...

1086
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:31,363
...but I figured you had to have lunch, so...

1087
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,644
I'd love to,
but I'm swamped lining this thing up.

1088
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,721
I was waiting for you down at the club
but you never came down.

1089
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:39,607
I called. You didn't get my message?

1090
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,998
I don't believe it. You don't know.
No one called you this morning?

1091
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:47,365
I'm locked out of my apartment.
I don't. What?

1092
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:51,727
Listen to this.
I'm having dinner last night with this guy...

1093
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:54,926
...major network executive, top brass...

1094
01:05:55,169 --> 01:05:58,798
...telling him how incredible you are.
Insisting he comes down to see you.

1095
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:02,723
And the whole idea just explodes
into something absolutely spectacular.

1096
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:04,288
Are you ready?

1097
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:09,718
Two weeks from today,
we're coming down with our cameras...

1098
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:12,720
...to shoot a one-hour special.

1099
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:16,643
The pilot for a weekly series
called Open Audition.

1100
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:20,364
The winner each week
gets a guest spot on Johnny Carson.

1101
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:23,319
What do you think? Brilliant?

1102
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,643
I think it's not what you promised me.

1103
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:31,245
I promised you'd be seen.
This is no aimless audition.

1104
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:33,081
The winner gets a shot at Carson.

1105
01:06:33,169 --> 01:06:36,798
- No one's coming to see me.
- Of course they will. You're the best there.

1106
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:39,449
- In your opinion.
- In my opinion.

1107
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,526
It's worth something.

1108
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:44,887
It's certainly worth a lot more
than your word.

1109
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:47,881
Steven, for your information...

1110
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,927
...the owner of your club
sent me a list of submissions.

1111
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:53,001
The name Steven Gold wasn't on it.

1112
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:56,365
He said you were emotionally unstable.

1113
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:59,642
I had to exert pressure
just to keep you in this thing.

1114
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:01,447
Don't give me heat about my word.

1115
01:07:01,529 --> 01:07:04,760
- Who else exactly is on this list?
- Why?

1116
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:08,319
Because there's someone good
you might have forgotten.

1117
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:11,522
Aren't you nice? Aren't you nice?
Hello, everybody.

1118
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:14,521
And welcome to America's
favourite noontime show.

1119
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:16,605
It's the "Lesbian Lunchbox."

1120
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,005
So many lesbians come to see the show...

1121
01:07:19,089 --> 01:07:21,887
...I thought we'd talk
to some lesbians here tonight.

1122
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:24,085
Doesn't that sound like a wonderful idea?

1123
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:25,397
- Hi, you a lesbian?
- No!

1124
01:07:25,489 --> 01:07:28,003
"Methinks the lesbian
doth protest too much." Just teasing.

1125
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:31,559
Hello?

1126
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:36,440
This is the phone company.
Is Mrs. Krytsick in? It's important.

1127
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:38,647
Mom, phone company.

1128
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:41,240
- Hello?
- Lilah, it's me.

1129
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:42,478
Steven.

1130
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:45,722
I'm at the club. What's going on?
Are you coming down?

1131
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:48,921
You shouldn't have called me here.

1132
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:51,365
- Didn't you get my message?
- Yeah.

1133
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:55,328
I did. What does that mean,
you can't come to the club for a while?

1134
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:57,082
I really can't talk.

1135
01:07:57,249 --> 01:08:00,047
Wait a minute. What about the contest?
You're on the list.

1136
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:01,398
What contest?

1137
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,409
At the club. The winner gets a shot
on the Carson show.

1138
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:05,524
I'm on the list?

1139
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:07,488
Yeah, I got you on it.

1140
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:10,244
- When is it?
- A week from Wednesday.

1141
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:12,759
Oh, God. I can't do it.

1142
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:13,799
Why not?

1143
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:17,759
I'm kind of in a holding pattern here.

1144
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:20,247
My husband wants me to quit.

1145
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,681
Jesus Christ, Lilah.

1146
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:25,565
How long are you gonna put up
with this shit?

1147
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,446
It's really not that simple.

1148
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:29,520
It is that simple.
You're with the wrong guy.

1149
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:32,479
He doesn't deserve you and you know it.

1150
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:34,764
I'm not afraid to tell that to his face.

1151
01:08:35,169 --> 01:08:37,399
You should be with me.
I'll tell him that, too.

1152
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:40,248
No, the phone is working just fine.

1153
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:42,924
You get your ass over here right away,
all right?

1154
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,519
It's a little late for that.

1155
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:47,804
- Who is it?
- It's the phone company.

1156
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,246
Tomorrow then.
Meet me at the coffee shop at 6:00.

1157
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,800
No, I couldn't make that.
I'm getting my hair done tomorrow.

1158
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:55,924
I love your hair!

1159
01:08:56,009 --> 01:08:58,477
- What's wrong with the phone?
- I don't know.

1160
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:00,048
All right, listen.

1161
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:04,124
You come and meet me
or I'll come over and tell your husband...

1162
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:06,518
...I'm crazy in love with you
and you with me.

1163
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,486
- Wednesday.
- What time? 6:00?

1164
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,766
Don't get hustled into an appointment
if the phone's okay.

1165
01:09:12,969 --> 01:09:14,925
- Give it me.
- Lilah, 6:00?

1166
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:16,158
- No.
- Give it me!

1167
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,961
No! No!

1168
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:20,525
Lilah!

1169
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:25,480
I can't talk right now.

1170
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:33,364
So that's what this has been about.

1171
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:34,803
No.

1172
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:39,447
It's just a friend.

1173
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,637
A man?

1174
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:44,844
A comic.

1175
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:49,962
I see.

1176
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,928
He believes in me. He thinks I'm funny.

1177
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:01,762
Some day, Lilah, and it may be too late...

1178
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:05,808
...you'll remember that we loved you
whether you were funny or not.

1179
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:10,522
It's 7:30. You happy? I'm home.

1180
01:10:44,969 --> 01:10:47,164
If you can't make money
selling your services...

1181
01:10:47,249 --> 01:10:49,205
...what are you going to sell? Your body!

1182
01:10:49,289 --> 01:10:53,282
You're going to go down to this hospital
to get an appraisal of your worth.

1183
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,963
"$450 for your liver. For your liver, $450.

1184
01:10:56,049 --> 01:10:58,404
"Two pints of blood?
I'll take it off your hands!

1185
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:00,957
"And I'll take off your heads.
For your eyes, $0.10.

1186
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,847
"No noses today. No noses.
Come back Tuesday."

1187
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:06,841
If you won't sell your body,
what will you sell, your dreams?

1188
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,568
Go down to one of these dream clinics!

1189
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:15,847
Can you imagine that, selling your dreams?

1190
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:22,083
So what do you want?
You know I'm a hair designer.

1191
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:24,888
I can give you anything. Glamour, punk.

1192
01:11:25,089 --> 01:11:27,967
Look at these roots. Look at that.

1193
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:32,203
- Want to go back to your natural colour?
- I just want a change.

1194
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:35,042
What, a whole new look?
A whole new thing?

1195
01:11:35,169 --> 01:11:38,002
Different. I want a change.

1196
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:41,278
Okay, great. All right. I got a great idea.

1197
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,280
You're gonna love this.

1198
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,127
This stuff looks ready. Where is she?

1199
01:11:50,249 --> 01:11:53,047
- She said she'd be home by 5:30.
- It's almost 6:00.

1200
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:54,687
She's getting her hair done.

1201
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,806
- How long does that take?
- You'd better take the roast out.

1202
01:11:57,889 --> 01:11:59,322
What do I do?

1203
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:02,323
You open the oven and take it out.

1204
01:12:02,409 --> 01:12:05,207
- Don't get smart with me.
- Sorry.

1205
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:08,438
Stop eating those.
You'll spoil your appetite.

1206
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,008
Lilah?

1207
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:21,680
I didn't mean to do it.

1208
01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:24,361
I just wanted to change.

1209
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,201
- I didn't mean to...
- Take it easy.

1210
01:12:26,289 --> 01:12:27,517
Mom, don't cry.

1211
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,327
Take it easy, Lilah.

1212
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:32,287
Come on now, honey, come here.

1213
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:34,121
Just sit down now.

1214
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:35,683
Just calm down.

1215
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,202
I didn't do it on purpose.

1216
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:40,082
- Sit down. It's not that bad.
- It's not.

1217
01:12:40,249 --> 01:12:42,080
I look like Buckwheat.

1218
01:12:42,769 --> 01:12:45,806
You're just not used to it.
We'll just have to get used to it.

1219
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:47,887
Yeah, we gotta get used to it.

1220
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:49,761
- Okay?
- Okay.

1221
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:52,928
We'll see what we got here.
Let me look at it.

1222
01:12:53,009 --> 01:12:55,443
- Okay.
- I'll take a look. Okay?

1223
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,159
- I think it's wonderful.
- You do?

1224
01:13:10,249 --> 01:13:12,763
- No question.
- You look like a movie star.

1225
01:13:12,849 --> 01:13:14,567
- You're not just saying that?
- No.

1226
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:16,367
You look like Miss America.

1227
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:19,122
You're the prettiest mother
of any kid at my school.

1228
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:21,120
It looks better than it ever looked.

1229
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,564
Mothers at my school are pigs
compared to you.

1230
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,764
Oh, you...

1231
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:27,922
They are. They're oinkers
compared to you.

1232
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:30,803
You've got the prettiest hair
of anyone in the world.

1233
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:31,878
Sweetheart.

1234
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,446
Honey, thank you.

1235
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:39,848
Thank you.

1236
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:16,883
Yo, Lilah.

1237
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:18,763
Steven.

1238
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:20,567
How's it going?

1239
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:23,047
Tough going?

1240
01:14:23,129 --> 01:14:27,202
- I like your outfit.
- Thank you. It's my Italian look.

1241
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:30,646
Married woman, single man,
scandalous affair.

1242
01:14:31,129 --> 01:14:35,088
- What happened to your head?
- It's terrible, isn't it?

1243
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:36,397
No, no.

1244
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:39,328
Did they drill holes in it for bowling?

1245
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:42,123
Thank you, Steven.
I knew I could count on you.

1246
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:45,798
Always. Coffee? Dry out a bit.

1247
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:49,407
Pedro, dos cafe con leche, por favor.

1248
01:15:00,569 --> 01:15:02,799
Did I get you in trouble
when I called the house?

1249
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:04,880
No. It's not your fault.

1250
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:06,568
What's the deal?

1251
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:09,078
He doesn't let you have friends
or do stand-up.

1252
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:11,000
I'm surprised he lets you out the house.

1253
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,319
He thinks I'm at a P.T.A. Meeting.

1254
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,284
So why don't you leave him?

1255
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:19,241
You could do that, you know.

1256
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:21,320
People do it all the time.

1257
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,163
Especially now that he knows
there's another man.

1258
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:26,205
You could pack up those kids and split.

1259
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,440
I've only got a couple of minutes.
Could we talk serious?

1260
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:32,362
Okay. You know why six
is afraid of seven?

1261
01:15:34,889 --> 01:15:37,039
- What?
- You want to talk serious. This is.

1262
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:39,563
- You know why six is afraid of seven?
- No.

1263
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:42,447
Because seven "eight" nine.

1264
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:47,685
It's a kid's joke. I do kids' parties.
Kids love me once they get to know me.

1265
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:51,842
And I think that your kids will love me,
once they get to know me.

1266
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:53,522
I'm sure.

1267
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:57,008
Mr. Carrot and Mr. Lettuce
had a terrible auto accident.

1268
01:15:57,089 --> 01:15:59,887
You know what the doctor said
at the hospital?

1269
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:01,926
They'd be vegetables all their lives.

1270
01:16:02,009 --> 01:16:03,647
- You knew it?
- No, I didn't.

1271
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:07,722
I had a girlfriend, she was so skinny.
You know how skinny she was?

1272
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:10,687
When she drank tomato juice
she looked like a thermometer?

1273
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:14,125
- Right. You know how ugly she was?
- These are so old.

1274
01:16:14,289 --> 01:16:18,567
- Tell me how ugly she was.
- How ugly was she?

1275
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:20,925
When she walked into a room...

1276
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:26,761
...all the mice jumped on chairs.
- Do you see?

1277
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:30,082
Do you see how great we would be?

1278
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:33,685
Together, I mean, married or something.

1279
01:16:36,609 --> 01:16:39,681
That's right. That's what I said.
I said "married."

1280
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:46,045
Steven, I love my husband.

1281
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:51,598
Yeah.

1282
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:59,606
If we're gonna be married,
you'll have to get over that.

1283
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:05,478
I know you don't believe it,
but he loves me, too. He does.

1284
01:17:06,249 --> 01:17:09,366
Sometimes I think he deserves a medal.

1285
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:43,239
You just took it too far.

1286
01:17:44,449 --> 01:17:47,122
We were... We are friends, we are.

1287
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:50,407
It's not like we won't see each other.
We will.

1288
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:53,083
You gonna give up stand-up comedy?

1289
01:17:54,129 --> 01:17:55,721
I don't know.

1290
01:17:56,489 --> 01:18:01,085
That's where I am, babe. I'm Mr. Comedy.
And if you kiss it off, you're kissing me off.

1291
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:03,205
So don't tell me we'll see each other again.

1292
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:04,847
They're my family. They need me.

1293
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:07,762
What if I told you
that I was going to die without you?

1294
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,204
Not that I am, but what if I told you I was?

1295
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:13,878
That I woke this morning
and you were all I had to keep me going.

1296
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:17,283
You have comedy to keep you going.

1297
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:19,608
Yeah.

1298
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:24,678
- Jesus, what do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1299
01:18:26,009 --> 01:18:28,239
Just go back to New Jersey
and clean house...

1300
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,638
...and tell jokes
into a vacuum cleaner handle.

1301
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:34,358
And when your husband comes home,
pin a fucking medal on him. Pin it deep.

1302
01:18:34,449 --> 01:18:37,282
- You think that's what I want?
- I don't know what you want.

1303
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:40,207
In the words of our own Billy Lane:

1304
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:43,407
"The love of my life
is a lady named Comedy."

1305
01:18:43,489 --> 01:18:44,808
And in the words of Kissinger:

1306
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:47,084
"A man shouldn't be separated
from his luggage."

1307
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:49,205
It's neither here nor there,
but in the middle.

1308
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,803
Right where the thalamus
joins the basal ganglia.

1309
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:55,598
And if you haven't heard basal ganglia,
you haven't heard Shakespeare!

1310
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:59,563
The basal ganglia, where something
passing through the size of just a peanut...

1311
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:01,765
- Don't do this!
...can bring silence!

1312
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:05,967
Darkness, like a comet, like a ship,
Io, passing into the night.

1313
01:19:06,049 --> 01:19:07,402
This scares me. Stop it!

1314
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:12,279
Don't be scared, because I'm funny Steve
with a lampshade on his head...

1315
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:16,005
...who is singing and dancing,
for your entertainment...

1316
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:19,526
...his own rendition of Singing in the Rain!

1317
01:21:46,169 --> 01:21:48,729
Girls, everybody, come close.
I wanna talk to you.

1318
01:21:48,849 --> 01:21:52,239
Marty, come up here.
Get Stu to give you a hand. Come on.

1319
01:21:53,329 --> 01:21:55,479
There are gonna be five judges.
Five judges.

1320
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:57,167
I want them seated at Table 7.

1321
01:21:57,249 --> 01:21:58,841
Eve, you take care of them.

1322
01:21:58,929 --> 01:22:02,239
Everything's on the cuff.
Everything's on the house.

1323
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:05,838
You guys!

1324
01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:11,127
They say that Robyn Green is coming
and he's going to be one of the judges.

1325
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:13,007
Big fucking deal!

1326
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:17,447
- You. No way, okay.
- I don't know where to park.

1327
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:20,202
- You can't park here, okay.
- I'm one of the comics.

1328
01:22:20,289 --> 01:22:21,881
- What?
- I'm one of the comics.

1329
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:24,085
Don't tell him to go, he's on the show.

1330
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:26,160
- All right. Back it up.
- He's gonna win.

1331
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:29,241
Great. Pull around back there. Park it.

1332
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:33,124
People, the show don't start for two hours.
Please get out of here.

1333
01:22:33,809 --> 01:22:35,288
That's electric that cable.

1334
01:22:35,369 --> 01:22:39,078
Rico, you're seven. Petroviak, eight.
Lilah, nine. Where's Lilah?

1335
01:22:39,169 --> 01:22:42,081
Doesn't she know there's a contest?
Where's Steven and Ball?

1336
01:22:42,169 --> 01:22:44,683
Didn't I tell everybody to be here by 6:00?

1337
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:48,199
- Tell me when they get here.
- Romeo, why do I have to go first?

1338
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:49,961
Somebody has to. Why not you?

1339
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,643
- I don't wanna go after Ball.
- What is this, a mutiny?

1340
01:22:52,729 --> 01:22:54,879
I didn't get a number.

1341
01:22:56,609 --> 01:22:59,407
Billy, what are you doing here?

1342
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:01,368
The contest.

1343
01:23:02,569 --> 01:23:04,082
Billy, I had a list.

1344
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:08,759
I mean, didn't you read the list?

1345
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:13,287
Billy, I'm terribly sorry.
I mean, I've only got ten spots.

1346
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:17,768
It's a network television audition.
It's for comics of the future.

1347
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:24,247
Come on, I need you in the audience.
I need you for laughter.

1348
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:29,087
I need everybody. Everybody's gotta laugh
at each other's act. We're a family, right?

1349
01:23:33,529 --> 01:23:35,997
Relax, I'll call you later.

1350
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:54,840
I have an announcement.
Elvis has cancelled.

1351
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:58,161
Please turn in your tickets
at the box office.

1352
01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:02,004
You want to move back a little bit, girls.
Here come the dogs.

1353
01:24:09,929 --> 01:24:13,968
Mom? Dessert's ready.
Dad wants you to come down.

1354
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:15,838
Mom?

1355
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:23,042
Dad made a special dessert.

1356
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:26,441
Where are you going?

1357
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:29,519
There's a contest at the club tonight.

1358
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:32,047
I want to be in it.

1359
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:35,281
But you promised Daddy.

1360
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:38,088
I promised Daddy I would think about it
and I have.

1361
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:43,040
Come in, I'd like to talk to you
about what I've been thinking.

1362
01:24:43,129 --> 01:24:44,448
Come on.

1363
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:47,318
Come on.

1364
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:56,167
There's three things
in this world that I love:

1365
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:58,047
I love being a mom.

1366
01:24:58,369 --> 01:25:00,246
I love being a wife.

1367
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:03,402
And I love being able
to make people laugh.

1368
01:25:03,969 --> 01:25:07,200
I've always been able to.
Even when I was a little girl.

1369
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:11,117
And it's always made me feel good.

1370
01:25:11,849 --> 01:25:13,999
It still makes me feel good.

1371
01:25:16,129 --> 01:25:17,721
The thing is...

1372
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:22,283
...when you do it right
and you make people laugh...

1373
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:26,562
...it feels like you're doing something...

1374
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:29,761
...that no one else could do quite the same.

1375
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,528
You know?

1376
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:34,884
It makes you feel...

1377
01:25:35,689 --> 01:25:37,247
...special.

1378
01:25:39,249 --> 01:25:41,399
I'd be a happy mom
if you found something...

1379
01:25:41,489 --> 01:25:45,004
...that could make you feel that way.
Make you feel special.

1380
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:47,041
You know what I mean?

1381
01:25:50,129 --> 01:25:52,040
I'd be even happier...

1382
01:25:52,249 --> 01:25:55,924
...knowing that the people who loved you
were helping you to do that.

1383
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:02,800
I want to be a wife.

1384
01:26:03,129 --> 01:26:05,006
I want to be your mom.

1385
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:07,519
And I want to be a comedienne.

1386
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,643
I know.

1387
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:15,008
People don't always get everything
they want out of life.

1388
01:26:17,849 --> 01:26:20,488
But it would feel terrible to not try.

1389
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:31,680
Could I see you?

1390
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:34,166
When I come home.

1391
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:36,207
I mean, do it.

1392
01:26:36,809 --> 01:26:39,084
I'd like to see you do it.

1393
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:42,682
Say yes, Mom.

1394
01:26:49,049 --> 01:26:50,368
Okay.

1395
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:53,008
Yeah! All right!

1396
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,648
It's Robyn Green, ladies and gentlemen.

1397
01:27:00,209 --> 01:27:03,167
Let's not get too close to Robyn, folks.
Robyn's a celebrity.

1398
01:27:03,249 --> 01:27:05,604
He doesn't want to be bothered
by scum like us.

1399
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:09,443
Look, he's got a bodyguard.
I bet you anything his name is Vic or Tony.

1400
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:12,248
How's the bone-breaking business, Tony?

1401
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:13,928
Nice hair.

1402
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:17,844
It's another limousine, everybody.
That can only mean one thing:

1403
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:20,159
A celebrity's inside. Let's see who it is.

1404
01:27:20,249 --> 01:27:22,205
It's... Some guy!

1405
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:27,282
It's some older gentleman
with some beautiful blonde babe.

1406
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:30,009
Folks, can you stop
just for a photograph, please?

1407
01:27:30,089 --> 01:27:33,684
Come on!
Just for a lively little photograph.

1408
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:36,321
Who is that guy?

1409
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:41,645
All right, stand back, please.

1410
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:45,683
You're gonna have to get off the street
and onto the sidewalk.

1411
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:51,637
Come on in, everybody.
The contest hasn't started.

1412
01:27:51,729 --> 01:27:54,243
You'll see a great show.
I had to come up on stage.

1413
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:57,406
I had to say hello 'cause I love you.
How much do I love you?

1414
01:27:57,489 --> 01:28:00,879
A hand for Robyn Green.
The wonderful Robyn Green.

1415
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,367
We don't have time for any more jokes,
ladies and gentlemen.

1416
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:06,804
Maybe a couple of punchlines.
"Ping Pong balls"?

1417
01:28:06,929 --> 01:28:09,159
I thought you said, "King Kong's balls."

1418
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:12,928
- You look great.
- So do you.

1419
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:14,567
Good to see you.

1420
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,562
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

1421
01:28:17,649 --> 01:28:22,040
Robyn Green started on this very stage
and now I can't get him off.

1422
01:28:22,249 --> 01:28:25,127
- Off, off, off.
- I gotta go. Thank you very much.

1423
01:28:27,249 --> 01:28:30,286
Very good. Very good, Robyn.
That's wonderful.

1424
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:37,044
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a big night here at The Gas Station.

1425
01:28:37,129 --> 01:28:39,279
We have a distinguished panel of judges...

1426
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:42,406
...who are going to select
one of our rising young comedians...

1427
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:46,004
...and give him an opportunity
on a major network television show.

1428
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:48,597
I'd like to have a hand
for our panel of judges.

1429
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:55,086
You remember them from Nuremberg?

1430
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:59,441
It's time to roll, ladies and gentlemen.
Here we go.

1431
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,884
- And the tape is rolling.
- Tape is rolling.

1432
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:05,848
- We are on a "go."
- We are on a "go." Okay. Now? Okay.

1433
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:12,127
Welcome to contest night
at The Gas Station.

1434
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:23,807
"Stop, stop

1435
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:26,529
"Stop what you're doing and think of me

1436
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:29,760
"Stop, stop

1437
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:32,358
"Stop what you're doing and think of me

1438
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:35,723
"I'm so successful

1439
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:38,879
"Can't you see?

1440
01:29:39,209 --> 01:29:41,769
"I love to hug myself

1441
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,887
"It brings me ecstasy"

1442
01:29:45,209 --> 01:29:48,884
You know, a lot of people
think all black men are well-hung.

1443
01:29:49,089 --> 01:29:50,886
This ain't the truth.

1444
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:54,525
You got brothers out there
with three and four inches.

1445
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:57,806
Yeah, those are the ones
that date white women.

1446
01:29:59,889 --> 01:30:01,083
Is this thing on?

1447
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:04,599
So I was at my girlfriend's house
the other day, and she was waking up.

1448
01:30:04,809 --> 01:30:06,800
She leans over to me and she says:

1449
01:30:07,009 --> 01:30:10,319
"Sweet pea, want some breakfast?"

1450
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:15,284
I am pissed off of a Japanese.

1451
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:19,562
Japanese people piss me off.
Yes, you know why?

1452
01:30:20,569 --> 01:30:23,481
- Why?
- Feel how heavy this shit is.

1453
01:30:24,609 --> 01:30:26,964
When a guy is mean to us
or if he cheats on us...

1454
01:30:27,049 --> 01:30:29,165
...we can't tell him, "You're a bastard."

1455
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:33,288
We'll call our girlfriends up, right?
And with a syllable hysteria:

1456
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:35,923
"He-hurt-me-so-much...

1457
01:30:36,089 --> 01:30:38,557
"...l- can't-take-the-pain...

1458
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:41,766
"...l- gave-to-him-my-love..."

1459
01:30:43,129 --> 01:30:46,326
- Is she almost finished?
- I don't know.

1460
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:49,686
- I'm on next.
- Fantastic.

1461
01:30:49,849 --> 01:30:52,488
- Prepare for greatness.
- All set.

1462
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:54,008
Thank you.

1463
01:30:54,089 --> 01:30:58,605
Do you know what I like to do sometimes?
I like to piss off Middle Eastern people.

1464
01:30:58,689 --> 01:31:00,884
It's called punk terrorism.

1465
01:31:00,969 --> 01:31:03,767
And what I do, right,
is I go downtown to carpet stores...

1466
01:31:03,929 --> 01:31:05,885
...and I walk into the place and I say:

1467
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:09,405
"Hi. I want carpet,
but I don't have the square footage."

1468
01:31:09,609 --> 01:31:11,600
An Iranian guy'll say:

1469
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:15,125
"You don't want carpet...

1470
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:19,038
"...you want an area rug."

1471
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:22,726
And I say, "No, I don't want an 'area rug."'

1472
01:31:23,009 --> 01:31:25,204
These people are
like newly-born bald eagles.

1473
01:31:25,289 --> 01:31:28,247
You know, it's like "area rug."

1474
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:36,565
"It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing"

1475
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:44,442
Have you seen Mr. Ball?
We can't find him up here.

1476
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:45,848
He's not down here.

1477
01:31:45,929 --> 01:31:49,683
Somebody better find him.
He's about to miss his spot.

1478
01:31:50,649 --> 01:31:53,766
Let's do a Mary:
"Mary, Mary, bo Birley, Bonana fanna

1479
01:31:53,849 --> 01:31:56,079
"fo Firley, fee fy mo Mary, Mary!"

1480
01:31:56,169 --> 01:31:57,602
A little trick with Jesus:

1481
01:31:57,689 --> 01:32:01,807
"Jesus, Jesus, bo Jesus, Bonana fanna
fo Jesus, fee fy mo Jesus, Jesus!"

1482
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:03,408
Let's do Pope John Paul.

1483
01:32:06,089 --> 01:32:07,408
Hello.

1484
01:32:08,049 --> 01:32:09,880
Is anybody in there?

1485
01:32:12,769 --> 01:32:13,884
Mr. Ball?

1486
01:32:14,049 --> 01:32:15,801
This is the men's room.

1487
01:32:17,009 --> 01:32:18,681
Are you all right?

1488
01:32:18,809 --> 01:32:20,288
I can't do it.

1489
01:32:20,449 --> 01:32:22,007
Yes, you can. You're up.

1490
01:32:22,089 --> 01:32:24,364
- I'm gonna puke.
- Take a deep breath.

1491
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:26,519
- They'll hate me.
- They'll love you.

1492
01:32:26,609 --> 01:32:27,928
They always hate me.

1493
01:32:28,089 --> 01:32:30,125
You're gonna turn it around tonight.

1494
01:32:30,209 --> 01:32:32,040
- You think so?
- Yes, I think so.

1495
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,721
I feel it. I really feel it.

1496
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:36,483
- Do it for your students.
- I got to do it for them.

1497
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:39,965
- And for the History Department.
- History Department. I got to do it.

1498
01:32:40,049 --> 01:32:42,244
- Get out on that stage and kill.
- I'll try.

1499
01:32:42,329 --> 01:32:43,444
You'll try? You'll do it.

1500
01:32:43,529 --> 01:32:45,679
- Did you notice my wife?
- She looks great.

1501
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:48,124
And she's got a good seat.
You look wonderful.

1502
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:50,245
- Thanks. Like the suit?
- Very much.

1503
01:32:50,329 --> 01:32:51,921
It's reversible.

1504
01:32:57,329 --> 01:32:58,478
Billy?

1505
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:02,925
I love travelling, because
when you travel you see a lot of history.

1506
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,647
I went to France.

1507
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:08,046
You have to know the language there,
otherwise they don't like you.

1508
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:11,166
So I bought these tapes,
where you learn while you sleep.

1509
01:33:11,289 --> 01:33:13,405
But there was something wrong
with my tape.

1510
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:16,487
Halfway through, it went into disco music.

1511
01:33:16,569 --> 01:33:18,764
I didn't know this until I got there.

1512
01:33:18,849 --> 01:33:21,522
I get off the plane, someone goes,
"Parlez-vous francais?"

1513
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:24,077
I went, "Oui, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it."

1514
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:27,400
I went to Canada...

1515
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:29,798
Steven, something's wrong with Billy.

1516
01:33:29,889 --> 01:33:32,084
Canadians want to be
so much like Americans...

1517
01:33:32,169 --> 01:33:35,798
...but they have different rules
and regulations up there.

1518
01:33:37,849 --> 01:33:40,044
Is there any pressure right here?

1519
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:41,877
No.

1520
01:33:42,009 --> 01:33:45,524
Is there any sensation in this arm
or numbness in the left hand?

1521
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:46,644
No.

1522
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:51,759
Is your stomach queasy?
Do you have a headache?

1523
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:53,238
No.

1524
01:33:53,329 --> 01:33:55,559
Are you taking any medication?

1525
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:56,844
None.

1526
01:33:58,369 --> 01:34:00,803
Seen any bad TV shows or anything?

1527
01:34:02,129 --> 01:34:05,565
Okay. Is there any pain when you breathe?
Any pain there?

1528
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,682
Any pain when I lift your arm up like this?

1529
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:14,160
I don't have any pain.
You didn't have to come down here.

1530
01:34:14,329 --> 01:34:17,162
Is there someone
who can take you home tonight?

1531
01:34:17,329 --> 01:34:19,320
I'm going to stay.

1532
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:21,605
I want to see who wins.

1533
01:34:24,129 --> 01:34:27,644
It's not a heart attack.
You've got a rock-steady pulse.

1534
01:34:27,849 --> 01:34:28,838
I'm fine.

1535
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:31,523
Okay. You'll be all right down here?

1536
01:34:31,769 --> 01:34:34,329
Okay, just relax. Take it easy.

1537
01:34:34,809 --> 01:34:37,642
You know, it's a great feeling to win.

1538
01:34:39,529 --> 01:34:43,124
I did it once in a contest in Las Vegas.

1539
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:45,885
It was bigger than this.

1540
01:34:46,809 --> 01:34:49,448
I won a shot on the Ed Sullivan Show.

1541
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:50,917
Ever hear of it?

1542
01:34:53,049 --> 01:34:54,801
It was bigger than Carson.

1543
01:34:55,409 --> 01:34:56,728
Bigger.

1544
01:34:57,489 --> 01:34:58,888
Any day.

1545
01:35:13,809 --> 01:35:16,960
I have to tell this right off, folks.
I have a drinking problem.

1546
01:35:17,129 --> 01:35:20,121
I've been drinking like a fish all night.

1547
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:29,164
Here's my impression
of a dentist's appointment.

1548
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:31,120
"This won't hurt a bit."

1549
01:35:32,849 --> 01:35:34,362
God, he's good.

1550
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:37,640
- But not good enough to take me.
- You're up for it.

1551
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:41,642
Yeah. I'm going out with a bang.
I got all new stuff. How about you?

1552
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:43,321
I've got some new stuff.

1553
01:35:43,409 --> 01:35:45,969
Good. Get up there
and beat me up with it.

1554
01:35:46,169 --> 01:35:49,081
- I'll do the best I can.
- I'll do better.

1555
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:51,922
I know what you people want now. Jokes!

1556
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:57,639
Steven, I'm sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

1557
01:35:57,729 --> 01:36:00,448
Forget about it.
You're not missing anything.

1558
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:02,241
I'm a lousy lay.

1559
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:05,121
Yeah, so am I.

1560
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:07,928
See? We'd have been perfect
for each other.

1561
01:36:08,129 --> 01:36:10,563
Jerry Petroviak, all right!

1562
01:36:17,409 --> 01:36:19,127
- What?
- I'm on next.

1563
01:36:19,209 --> 01:36:21,643
So? Take it easy, you'll be fine.

1564
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,559
God, I can't remember anything.

1565
01:36:25,849 --> 01:36:28,079
Why is six afraid of seven?

1566
01:36:29,809 --> 01:36:31,720
Because seven "eight" nine.

1567
01:36:32,529 --> 01:36:34,121
- Go kill them.
- She's married...

1568
01:36:34,209 --> 01:36:37,997
...she's "the mother that roared."
Let's have a big hand for Lilah Krytsick.

1569
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:39,920
Come on, Lilah. Come on up here.

1570
01:36:40,009 --> 01:36:42,000
Thanks, Steven.

1571
01:37:02,849 --> 01:37:03,838
Hi.

1572
01:37:06,329 --> 01:37:09,127
- How are you?
- Fine.

1573
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:12,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

1574
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:14,286
- What's your name?
- Mark.

1575
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:16,247
Mark, are you married?

1576
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:17,967
Yes. This is my wife.

1577
01:37:18,049 --> 01:37:19,641
How long have you been married?

1578
01:37:20,169 --> 01:37:21,966
- Six months.
- "Six months"?

1579
01:37:22,049 --> 01:37:23,960
- Too long.
- "Too long"?

1580
01:37:24,289 --> 01:37:28,726
Now listen, you shouldn't laugh.
It's very difficult. It honestly is.

1581
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:32,324
I mean, we all know this.
You're never on solid ground.

1582
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:34,718
I've been married to my husband
for 15 years.

1583
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:36,481
Sometimes I look at him and say:

1584
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:39,129
"Who is this man?
How did he get in my house?

1585
01:37:39,209 --> 01:37:41,086
"I've never seen him before in my life."

1586
01:37:41,169 --> 01:37:43,967
And other times our identities meld.

1587
01:37:44,169 --> 01:37:47,957
I itch. He scratches. I feel better.

1588
01:37:48,969 --> 01:37:51,881
I don't know where he ends and I begin.

1589
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:53,563
Except in bed...

1590
01:37:55,289 --> 01:37:58,486
...when he's usually ending,
just when I'm beginning.

1591
01:38:02,889 --> 01:38:06,245
You know, the thing is,
before we were married...

1592
01:38:06,529 --> 01:38:10,920
...when we used to, you know, make love,
he would say to me:

1593
01:38:11,569 --> 01:38:15,357
"Oh, sweetheart, goddamn,
you feel so good.

1594
01:38:16,249 --> 01:38:19,958
"You're so beautiful. I love you so much."

1595
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:24,802
And now he says, "Move your head,
I can't see the screen."

1596
01:38:28,129 --> 01:38:31,565
Before we were married,
my husband John always used to go...

1597
01:38:32,289 --> 01:38:33,961
And he used to go...

1598
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:36,441
And he used to go...

1599
01:38:38,929 --> 01:38:40,840
And now he just goes...

1600
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:48,998
Truly, I honestly think that men
have it very, very hard today.

1601
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:50,568
You do.

1602
01:38:51,369 --> 01:38:54,600
Not when you need it, but...

1603
01:38:58,569 --> 01:38:59,558
I'm sorry.

1604
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,329
I mean, it's hard. No!

1605
01:39:08,169 --> 01:39:11,400
You're doing this to me. Now, come on.

1606
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:15,805
I mean, really,
it's a difficult situation for men, it really is.

1607
01:39:15,889 --> 01:39:19,484
It's like women have gotten to the point
where they don't need men anymore.

1608
01:39:19,929 --> 01:39:22,363
I mean, you know, there's like these...

1609
01:39:22,649 --> 01:39:24,367
...mechanical items.

1610
01:39:24,969 --> 01:39:26,561
You know what I mean?

1611
01:39:27,649 --> 01:39:28,923
You know what I mean.

1612
01:39:29,009 --> 01:39:31,887
You use one of these things?

1613
01:39:32,009 --> 01:39:33,203
Oh, my, not for me.

1614
01:39:33,289 --> 01:39:36,918
Honestly. No offence. God bless, go to it.

1615
01:39:37,969 --> 01:39:40,961
It scares me. It really does.
It really frightens me.

1616
01:39:41,049 --> 01:39:43,279
I don't think that I want to be intimate...

1617
01:39:43,369 --> 01:39:46,566
...with anything
that has "Panasonic" written on it.

1618
01:39:56,609 --> 01:39:58,884
I'm telling you,
we have nothing to judge from.

1619
01:39:59,049 --> 01:40:02,837
All the way back in history,
I'm sure the Garden of Eden was a mess.

1620
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:07,367
I'm sure that Adam
was an insensitive lover.

1621
01:40:09,609 --> 01:40:13,158
He kept referring to their lovemaking
as "getting some rib."

1622
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:17,561
He had no clue what he was doing.

1623
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:19,002
He was completely lost.

1624
01:40:19,089 --> 01:40:21,319
One of the first things he said to Eve was:

1625
01:40:21,409 --> 01:40:25,687
"Stand back, darling,
I don't know how big this thing gets."

1626
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:35,722
Thanks. Thank you.

1627
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:37,521
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1628
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:39,922
She did good.

1629
01:40:40,049 --> 01:40:43,485
You know what? I feel so much better.
I can't thank you enough.

1630
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:45,048
Thank you.

1631
01:40:45,689 --> 01:40:46,917
Thank you.

1632
01:40:51,169 --> 01:40:54,366
Let's hear it for Lilah Krytsick. All right.

1633
01:40:56,009 --> 01:40:58,682
Incredible. Fabulous, Lilah.

1634
01:41:01,609 --> 01:41:03,804
This next comedian has been waiting...

1635
01:41:04,009 --> 01:41:06,000
- Go kill them.
- You didn't make it easy.

1636
01:41:06,169 --> 01:41:08,000
- I think you can handle it.
- Just watch me.

1637
01:41:09,049 --> 01:41:11,165
Ladies and gentlemen, Steven Gold.

1638
01:41:11,489 --> 01:41:14,208
Let's hear it for Steven Gold.

1639
01:41:16,769 --> 01:41:18,248
Thank you.

1640
01:41:20,529 --> 01:41:23,646
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Great.

1641
01:41:23,889 --> 01:41:25,402
Great!

1642
01:41:26,249 --> 01:41:29,446
I blew it already.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

1643
01:41:29,529 --> 01:41:31,759
Can you get any more trite
or boring than that?

1644
01:41:31,849 --> 01:41:33,077
I don't think so.

1645
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:37,003
Here I am, trying to impress these...

1646
01:41:38,089 --> 01:41:39,442
...judges...

1647
01:41:40,289 --> 01:41:44,077
...and I start with the oldest phrase
in the history of showbiz.

1648
01:41:44,209 --> 01:41:47,246
Something completely forgettable
when what I'm trying to do...

1649
01:41:47,409 --> 01:41:50,560
...is be remembered up here.

1650
01:41:51,049 --> 01:41:52,687
How about these judges?

1651
01:41:52,889 --> 01:41:55,084
"Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

1652
01:41:55,169 --> 01:41:58,161
"I am Spartacus! I am Spartacus!"

1653
01:41:59,409 --> 01:42:02,481
Why don't we get to know
our judges personally, shall we?

1654
01:42:02,569 --> 01:42:05,561
They are: Larry, Moe, Curly Joe...
I'm kidding around.

1655
01:42:05,649 --> 01:42:08,766
Seriously, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo.
All right, cut it out.

1656
01:42:08,929 --> 01:42:11,238
Fred, Wilma, Barney...
Will you knock it off?

1657
01:42:11,329 --> 01:42:13,604
I'm funny. Okay, Lassie, Benji, Rin Tin Tin.

1658
01:42:13,689 --> 01:42:15,486
Hey! All right! They are:

1659
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:19,000
Some well-dressed guy.

1660
01:42:19,209 --> 01:42:22,167
Next to him,
his homosexual Svengali lover.

1661
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:24,246
A woman.

1662
01:42:25,969 --> 01:42:29,439
Some guy who got thrown out of radio.
Is that the lowest?

1663
01:42:30,089 --> 01:42:31,568
And, of course, Robyn Green.

1664
01:42:31,649 --> 01:42:36,279
Robyn Green, when he appeared
right here on this very stage...

1665
01:42:36,449 --> 01:42:38,599
And what he did... Robyn was introduced:

1666
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:42,238
"Ladies and gentlemen,
the comedy stylings of Robyn Green."

1667
01:42:42,409 --> 01:42:46,368
"Comedy stylings"? What did that mean?
Like, he's not a dermatologist.

1668
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:48,879
He's a skin stylist.

1669
01:42:49,649 --> 01:42:52,243
Not a dentist, but a tooth stylist.

1670
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:56,880
Not a barber, but a barb stylist.
A hair stylist.

1671
01:42:57,089 --> 01:42:58,761
A hair stylist.

1672
01:43:00,889 --> 01:43:02,845
I guess that would be right.

1673
01:43:03,729 --> 01:43:05,560
Who wants to be a comedian anyway?

1674
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:07,879
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a superhero.

1675
01:43:08,049 --> 01:43:10,324
I wanted to live in a super fortress.

1676
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:13,082
Even though some superheroes
have pretty jive powers.

1677
01:43:13,169 --> 01:43:16,366
Aqua Man? Aqua Man can breathe
underwater and talk to fish.

1678
01:43:16,529 --> 01:43:17,848
These are super powers?

1679
01:43:17,929 --> 01:43:20,921
Wonder Woman?
Wonder Woman flew an invisible jet.

1680
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:23,721
How did she find it?

1681
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:27,838
She stumbled around the runway
until she got lucky? "Oh, here it is."

1682
01:43:27,929 --> 01:43:31,126
What did the control tower tell her?
"We think you have clearance."

1683
01:43:31,249 --> 01:43:32,921
Can anybody be a superhero?

1684
01:43:33,009 --> 01:43:34,362
Table Man.

1685
01:43:35,329 --> 01:43:38,002
He solves crimes at dinner for four.

1686
01:43:38,089 --> 01:43:42,162
The Motorcycle Guy.
His helmet has secret compartments.

1687
01:43:42,729 --> 01:43:47,166
Big Lady. Criminals flee. Who wouldn't?

1688
01:43:48,249 --> 01:43:51,400
New York cab drivers are required
to have chauffeurs' licenses.

1689
01:43:51,489 --> 01:43:54,799
Now, what is the point of this?
"Stop the honking.

1690
01:43:54,889 --> 01:43:57,483
"I brake for human beings. So shoot me.

1691
01:43:58,169 --> 01:44:00,637
"I can't just run the old lady down.

1692
01:44:00,889 --> 01:44:04,598
"Okay, people, next stop,
Empire State Building.

1693
01:44:04,889 --> 01:44:08,006
"You know how to get there?
Practice, practice."

1694
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:13,601
I don't hate taxi drivers.
I don't hate anybody.

1695
01:44:13,689 --> 01:44:18,001
The world is far too confusing
a place to hate anybody.

1696
01:44:18,369 --> 01:44:21,406
I don't even hate that clown
at the bank who tells me...

1697
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:23,320
...I can't cash my cheque for 10 days.

1698
01:44:23,409 --> 01:44:26,640
Or that jerk at the supermarket.
Or those idiots on the subway.

1699
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:29,197
Or these geniuses
who broke up the phone company.

1700
01:44:29,369 --> 01:44:32,327
Or trendsetters. I don't hate trendsetters.

1701
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:35,322
People who tell us what is "hot"
and what is "not."

1702
01:44:35,529 --> 01:44:37,804
Don't tell me what to do!
I don't hate them.

1703
01:44:37,889 --> 01:44:40,449
Don't tell me what to do!
I'm not wearing bellbottoms.

1704
01:44:40,529 --> 01:44:42,167
I am not wearing them again!

1705
01:44:42,249 --> 01:44:44,888
I don't care if the Prince of Morocco
is wearing them.

1706
01:44:44,969 --> 01:44:47,608
I know, he doesn't have to live here. I do.

1707
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:50,408
I don't hate trendsetters. Or debutantes!

1708
01:44:50,609 --> 01:44:53,203
I don't hate debutantes!

1709
01:44:53,289 --> 01:44:55,928
I don't hate young, rich, white...

1710
01:44:56,009 --> 01:44:58,682
...female debutantes!

1711
01:44:59,169 --> 01:45:01,399
I don't even care about debutantes.

1712
01:45:01,489 --> 01:45:05,243
They spend $1,000 on their hair.
So what? They're debutantes.

1713
01:45:05,329 --> 01:45:08,958
They're wearing priceless diamond tiaras.
So what? They're debutantes!

1714
01:45:09,049 --> 01:45:12,803
They have opinions on world hunger.
Who cares? They're debutantes!

1715
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:16,768
They're having a coming-out party?
They're coming out of a Rolls Royce.

1716
01:45:16,849 --> 01:45:20,637
What does this have to do
with life as we know it?

1717
01:45:20,849 --> 01:45:23,761
I don't hate debutantes!

1718
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:40,160
I don't hate anybody.

1719
01:45:40,929 --> 01:45:43,124
I'm not a hate-monger.

1720
01:45:43,609 --> 01:45:47,158
I'm more of a hate-stylist, if you will.
Thank you very much.

1721
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:56,240
Thank you.

1722
01:45:57,009 --> 01:45:58,328
Thank you.

1723
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:00,361
Thank you.

1724
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:08,038
Bravo! Bravo!
The demented world of Steven Gold.

1725
01:46:08,129 --> 01:46:11,405
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a hand for Steven Gold.

1726
01:46:11,489 --> 01:46:15,562
How about a hand for the other performers
we heard here tonight?

1727
01:46:15,649 --> 01:46:18,083
- Good stuff.
- Thanks. Give me a drink.

1728
01:46:18,169 --> 01:46:19,682
You were wonderful.

1729
01:46:19,769 --> 01:46:21,202
- You were great.
- Thanks.

1730
01:46:21,289 --> 01:46:24,201
Very convincing, very powerful,
very Shaka Zulu.

1731
01:46:24,369 --> 01:46:25,438
- Steven.
- Thank you.

1732
01:46:25,529 --> 01:46:26,564
You were great.

1733
01:46:26,649 --> 01:46:28,446
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

1734
01:46:28,569 --> 01:46:29,922
It was do or die tonight.

1735
01:46:30,129 --> 01:46:32,802
All right, you guys, let's take it downstairs.

1736
01:46:33,009 --> 01:46:34,727
We'll wait for five minutes...

1737
01:46:34,809 --> 01:46:38,245
...while this distinguished panel of judges
makes up its mind.

1738
01:46:38,329 --> 01:46:41,878
And in the meantime, to make it easier,
we'll all have a drink on the house.

1739
01:46:55,329 --> 01:46:56,478
Lilah.

1740
01:47:19,009 --> 01:47:22,160
It's just personal. It's from my husband.

1741
01:47:37,729 --> 01:47:40,527
Okay, everybody, this is it.

1742
01:47:40,809 --> 01:47:44,165
Now, I wanna tell you one thing:

1743
01:47:44,649 --> 01:47:47,959
There are no losers here tonight.
You're all winners.

1744
01:47:48,049 --> 01:47:51,121
Whoever they chose,
they chose because they chose.

1745
01:47:51,329 --> 01:47:53,968
They changed their minds three times.
You know why?

1746
01:47:54,049 --> 01:47:56,483
Cut to the chase, Romeo. Who won?

1747
01:47:56,609 --> 01:47:59,077
I can't say.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1748
01:47:59,169 --> 01:48:01,524
They want you all on stage
to get a real reaction...

1749
01:48:01,609 --> 01:48:03,281
...when they announce the winner.

1750
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:06,042
- What is this shit?
- They want to see the losers, man.

1751
01:48:06,129 --> 01:48:09,360
- Just send the winner up.
- They want it to be a surprise.

1752
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:11,644
Big surprise. We all know who won.

1753
01:48:11,729 --> 01:48:13,401
- Yeah? Who won?
- Steven.

1754
01:48:13,489 --> 01:48:17,277
Wrong. Steven didn't win.
Don't tell me there are no surprises.

1755
01:48:19,289 --> 01:48:22,042
Steven, I'm sorry.
You wanted me to cut to the chase...

1756
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:25,326
...I'm cutting to the chase.
It's anybody's ballgame.

1757
01:48:25,649 --> 01:48:30,404
Now, I'd like you to line up here.
Steven, I'd like you to set an example.

1758
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:34,762
- Why didn't Steven win?
- Because somebody else won.

1759
01:48:34,849 --> 01:48:36,805
But we all saw. He had the best set.

1760
01:48:36,889 --> 01:48:38,242
He had the second best.

1761
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:41,560
He got two votes of the five.
Someone else got the other three.

1762
01:48:41,649 --> 01:48:43,605
Now, look, don't embarrass me, please.

1763
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:47,239
I promised them you'd all be back
on stage before I announced the winner.

1764
01:48:47,329 --> 01:48:52,164
Anybody who does not get on
that staircase now is disqualified.

1765
01:48:52,769 --> 01:48:54,282
I mean it!

1766
01:48:54,729 --> 01:48:58,244
- Did Steven really come in second?
- That's what I said.

1767
01:48:58,409 --> 01:49:00,001
Then I'm out. Disqualify me.

1768
01:49:01,089 --> 01:49:04,399
Lilah, come on. What are you doing?
Really? What is she doing?

1769
01:49:04,489 --> 01:49:07,481
Just in case I won, it's Steven's.

1770
01:49:08,569 --> 01:49:10,605
What is she doing? What are you doing?

1771
01:49:10,689 --> 01:49:15,001
I'm going home. Eve, would you please tell
my husband to meet me out front?

1772
01:49:15,089 --> 01:49:16,920
Wait. Please. Lilah.

1773
01:49:17,329 --> 01:49:18,728
I'm out, too.

1774
01:49:18,809 --> 01:49:20,925
- Me, too.
- I'm in. I'm still in.

1775
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:26,526
You did win.

1776
01:49:33,809 --> 01:49:35,879
Makes a difference, doesn't it?

1777
01:49:39,409 --> 01:49:41,206
I really did win?

1778
01:49:41,689 --> 01:49:44,044
Yes. You got three out of the five votes.

1779
01:49:44,289 --> 01:49:47,326
The guy with the grey hair
was crazy about you.

1780
01:49:49,409 --> 01:49:50,842
Yeah.

1781
01:49:51,769 --> 01:49:53,487
It makes a difference.

1782
01:49:58,569 --> 01:50:01,288
- See you later, guys.
- Lilah, don't do this.

1783
01:50:01,969 --> 01:50:03,607
Listen to Steven.

1784
01:50:03,809 --> 01:50:07,768
Do you think they're gonna give it to him
just 'cause you walked out? No.

1785
01:50:07,849 --> 01:50:11,239
Three of those judges didn't even like him.
They were offended by him.

1786
01:50:11,329 --> 01:50:13,559
They'll re-vote and give it to someone else.

1787
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:17,119
Even if they did give it to him,
do you think he's going to be grateful?

1788
01:50:17,289 --> 01:50:20,167
In 10 years, when you're sitting
in your station wagon...

1789
01:50:20,249 --> 01:50:24,003
...with curlers in your hair and groceries,
are you gonna hear from him?

1790
01:50:24,169 --> 01:50:25,488
Not even a postcard.

1791
01:50:25,569 --> 01:50:28,322
Or any of these others who'll get it
because you walked out?

1792
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:29,683
Forget it!

1793
01:50:30,409 --> 01:50:34,527
Come on, you won the brass ring.
Come claim it.

1794
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:44,921
That a girl.

1795
01:50:46,089 --> 01:50:48,000
That's my girl.

1796
01:50:48,369 --> 01:50:50,599
See? See?

1797
01:50:54,969 --> 01:50:56,197
I forgot my purse.

1798
01:51:11,009 --> 01:51:13,284
Hey! You wanna work in this club again?

1799
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:14,722
Yeah, I do.

1800
01:51:18,289 --> 01:51:19,802
Nuts.

1801
01:51:20,169 --> 01:51:22,000
You're all a bunch of fucking nuts.

1802
01:51:36,249 --> 01:51:37,762
John.

1803
01:51:38,489 --> 01:51:40,161
Lilah.

1804
01:51:40,689 --> 01:51:41,724
Hi.

1805
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:46,723
Lost?

1806
01:51:49,849 --> 01:51:51,123
I won.

1807
01:51:52,569 --> 01:51:53,684
You won?

1808
01:51:54,049 --> 01:51:55,528
I won.

1809
01:51:56,649 --> 01:51:57,968
You won?

1810
01:51:58,649 --> 01:52:00,162
You won?

1811
01:52:00,849 --> 01:52:03,238
Why aren't you in there?

1812
01:52:03,929 --> 01:52:05,567
I've got time.

1813
01:52:07,649 --> 01:52:10,038
I've got you guys.

1814
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:18,241
Thank you for my note.

1815
01:52:22,729 --> 01:52:23,798
You were great.

1816
01:52:23,889 --> 01:52:25,083
- I was?
- You were great.

1817
01:52:25,169 --> 01:52:27,729
- I heard you laughing.
- Yeah. You were hysterical.

1818
01:52:27,809 --> 01:52:30,084
- I could hear you laugh.
- You were wonderful.

1819
01:52:30,169 --> 01:52:31,761
You know what I was thinking?

1820
01:52:31,849 --> 01:52:34,409
You could tell the story
of giving birth to Carrie.

1821
01:52:34,489 --> 01:52:37,526
You were in the parking lot going,
"I'm Lamaze! I'm Lamaze!"

1822
01:52:37,609 --> 01:52:38,598
That's great!

1823
01:52:38,689 --> 01:52:41,806
- You think you could do that?
- Yeah, I never thought of that.

1824
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:06,488
- Start to finish. You know what I mean?
- There are a million stories at home.

1825
01:54:06,769 --> 01:54:09,044
And Jenny with her "Round John Virgin."

1826
01:54:09,129 --> 01:54:11,404
Oh, God, no!
How can you remember that?

1827
01:54:11,489 --> 01:54:14,526
"Round John Virgin, mother and child"

1828
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:18,563
That's great. I never thought of that.

1829
01:54:18,649 --> 01:54:21,117
