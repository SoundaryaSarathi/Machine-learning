1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,300
Love, it is gentle. Love, it is pure.

2
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:14,535
And yet, he takes advantage
of such a girl's affections!

3
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:19,403
Sailor Moon will arrest you on the
charge of romantic fraud!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

5
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

6
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

7
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

8
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:22,326
Guided by the light of the moon

9
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

10
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:35,806
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

12
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

13
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,245
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

14
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:00,023
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

15
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,158
and fight against bad guys.

16
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:06,322
I'm the sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

17
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:12,127
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

18
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:15,605
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

19
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:18,301
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

20
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,776
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

21
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:31,885
Wish Upon A Shooting Star!
Naru's Pure love

22
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,673
Naru...

23
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,678
So this is love...

24
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,061
There! There!

25
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,930
Usagi, you're such a child.

26
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,697
Oh, you're too kind!
Then are you a grown-up?

27
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,400
Well, of course. Because I'm...

28
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,668
...involved in a mature romance.

29
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:35,385
Naru, you need to have
someone to love first!

30
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:39,389
Oh, please, Usagi. Of course,
I have someone.

31
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,791
What?! Then are you in
love with Umino?!

32
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,128
Oh, it better not be Tuxedo
Mask or Motoki!

33
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:46,696
They belong to me!

34
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:50,266
It's not them. I told you,
it's a mature romance.

35
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:54,396
Okay, then, I'll tell you.
It's Mr. Sanjoin.

36
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,229
What?!

37
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,538
What? You don't have
to act so surprised.

38
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,347
I know he's a bit older than me,

39
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,516
but an age difference doesn't
matter when you're in love.

40
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:07,984
Well...

41
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,421
Anyway, he's absolutely
not good for you!

42
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,322
Forget it, I shouldn't have
told you anything!

43
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:18,954
What'll we do now?

44
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,233
We need to tell Naru

45
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,635
that Masato Sanjoin is Nephrite
as soon as possible.

46
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:28,604
Maybe we can wait a little and see.

47
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,276
It's easier said than done, when
you consider Naru's feelings.

48
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:36,579
We won't know how it'll
go unless we try it!

49
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,811
Hold on, Rei. Usagi,
what do you think?

50
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,621
What? Well, I think we ought
to tell her, but...

51
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:46,723
Then, what are we going to do?

52
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:51,490
Anyway, just leave everything
concerning Naru to me!

53
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,556
Leaving it to Usagi worries
me even more.

54
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,107
Where has Nephrite gone?!

55
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:08,043
He does not appear, no matter how
many times I summon him!

56
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,914
Queen Beryl is furious!

57
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,280
How terrifying!

58
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:18,813
Nephrite, you had better be ready
to face the consequences!

59
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,428
Nephrite is already a candle
flickering in the wind.

60
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,986
How I pity him.

61
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,202
I no longer have time to worry
about stealing energy.

62
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,443
Now I must obtain what I need

63
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,468
in exchange for the celestial globe.

64
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,350
You again! What do you want?

65
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,478
My, you shouldn't treat me so coldly.

66
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:54,548
Queen Beryl is furious.
She is looking for you.

67
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:58,394
Kunzite told you to come check up
on me, did he?

68
00:05:58,394 --> 00:05:59,395
Well, well...

69
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:02,832
From your attitude, you don't seem
to have any good plans ready.

70
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,027
Mind your own business!
Get out of here!

71
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:08,438
Oh, how scary. Here's some
friendly advice.

72
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,673
Why don't you retire,

73
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,775
before you truly anger Queen Beryl?

74
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:13,743
Shut up!

75
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:17,113
I will find the Silver Crystal and
get the better of you!

76
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:20,783
You're terrible! The Silver Crystal
is my assignment!

77
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:24,187
It doesn't matter who's assignment
it is! Whoever gets it wins!

78
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:27,924
I'll get a hold of the Silver Crystal
and restore my honor!

79
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,256
Unbelievable! Just you
remember this!

80
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:37,329
I cannot believe I lost my composure
with someone as petty as Zoisite.

81
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,838
The stars know everything.

82
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,344
When the sun creates a sinister
perpendicular angle

83
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:51,177
between Neptune and Mars,

84
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,309
the guide to the Silver
Crystal shall appear.

85
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,512
And that is...

86
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:04,488
...the Black Crystal.

87
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,300
So, this is the guide that will lead
me to the Silver Crystal.

88
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,140
Is it saying that little girl has
the Silver Crystal?!

89
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:05,755
Master Kunzite, I am so upset!

90
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,024
Let Nephrite do what he wants.

91
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,860
But, Master Kunzite, what if he...

92
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,830
If Nephrite happens to get a
hold of the Silver Crystal,

93
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,231
we can just steal it from him!

94
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,722
You are a genius, Master Kunzite.

95
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,932
Zoisite, for the time being, let the
monsters keep an eye on Nephrite.

96
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:26,400
Yasha! I know you are there!
You heard what he said!

97
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:30,341
Yes, your wish is my command.

98
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:35,278
Jewelry

99
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,321
No, I can't.

100
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:41,624
What's wrong? You're the one who
volunteered for this, remember?

101
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,426
That was just a spur of
the moment thing!

102
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,291
Stuff like that happens all
the time, you know?

103
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:47,988
It only happens all
the time to you!

104
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:52,001
What should I do? Oh, I know!

105
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,236
What are you going to do?

106
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:57,263
This is a great chance! I should
go talk to Motoki for advice!

107
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,235
I wasn't expecting much, but...

108
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:02,544
Crown

109
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:03,246
Good, that's it. Jump there! All right,
that's good. Keep it up.

110
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,747
Motoki...
Good, that's it. Jump there! All right,
that's good. Keep it up.

111
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,283
Good, that's it. Jump there! All right,
that's good. Keep it up.

112
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,052
Motoki's drooling all over her!

113
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:11,687
Oh, and he's so close to her!

114
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,622
Motoki, your Usagi is right here!

115
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,318
This aura...

116
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,055
Yo, Dumpling Head.

117
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,099
Hey, Motoki!

118
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,834
If you keep ignoring her,

119
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,869
your dumpling will turn
into a puff pastry.

120
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:30,373
He's just kidding! I'm not
a puff pastry at all!

121
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:33,376
Oh, Usagi! I didn't know you were
here. Sorry about that.

122
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:35,111
Hello!

123
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:36,746
I'm almost done with my shift.

124
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,581
Usagi, you want to go out for a
cup of tea or something?

125
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,751
Yes, of course! I want to ask you
for some advice, too!

126
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,753
Oh, I'll tag along. I've got nothing
better to do anyway.

127
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:44,820
What?!

128
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,289
That's a good idea.

129
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,756
I agree!

130
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:52,694
My friend, Naru, is in love
with a bad person,

131
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,198
but she doesn't know that he's bad.

132
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,567
And?

133
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:02,204
Well... What should I do
in this situation?

134
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,365
If I tell her the truth,
Naru will...

135
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,976
I don't think you need
to be in any hurry.

136
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,568
You could wait and see a little.

137
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,379
That's true...

138
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,582
He thinks the same way as Ami.

139
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:15,107
Waiting and watching won't
change anything.

140
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,815
Telling the truth is a form
of courage, too.

141
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,620
Mamoru may be right.

142
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:25,661
Naru might get mad if
you tell her the truth,

143
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,188
but as her friend, it's something
you have to tell her.

144
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:36,238
Okay! Now that I feel better,
I'm hungry! Excuse me?!

145
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,608
I'd like a fruit parfait, mixed
sandwiches, a strawberry short cake,

146
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,142
and a glass of juice!

147
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,378
Motoki, do you have money?

148
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:43,813
I think I can manage.

149
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:46,415
Don't worry! This is my treat today!

150
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:48,883
Oh, could you bring me a
mixed pizza, too?

151
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:54,856
Courage. Courage. All right,
you gotta be brave, Usagi!

152
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,758
Coming!

153
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,463
Oh, Usagi. What's up?

154
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,930
Naru!

155
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:06,535
I'm going to say this with courage,
but Masato Sanjoin is a bad person!

156
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,905
On top of that, he's not human!
Oh, that's not what I meant!

157
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:11,395
Anyway, he's scary!

158
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,943
That's why you should never
go out with him!

159
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:17,709
So, just forget about him
completely! Okay?!

160
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,448
But I'm...

161
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,382
Okay? Just give up on it!

162
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,951
Really? So, you talked to Naru?

163
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:30,960
Yeah! I finally worked up the courage
and I told her everything!

164
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,190
So, did Naru understand you?

165
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,666
Wait, don't tell me you said all that,

166
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,066
then just came back without
waiting for a response.

167
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:43,472
I can't believe you! Then, why
did you even go there?

168
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,100
But I'm sure she understood me.

169
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,173
I should have gone with
you after all.

170
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,277
I know what Usagi said,

171
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,977
but... Oh, he's just so gorgeous!

172
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:57,884
Mr. Sanjoin...

173
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:04,621
Naru, it's for you. It's from somebody
called, Mr. Sanjoin!

174
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:08,054
Our hearts really must
be linked together!

175
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,931
Yes. The Sankaku Park close by, right?

176
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,996
Yes, I'll be there right away!

177
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:15,337
I'm going out for a bit!

178
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:16,964
What? But it's so late.

179
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:47,332
Sorry for asking you to
come so late at night.

180
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,700
No, not at all. It made
me really happy.

181
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,639
I came to say good-bye today.

182
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:56,511
What?

183
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:03,476
Oh, I see. I guess I'm a bother
to you, aren't I?

184
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,856
No, not a bother at all.

185
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:09,159
It's more about not wanting to drag
you into a dangerous situation.

186
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,093
What?

187
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:10,660
To be honest with you,
What?

188
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,895
To be honest with you,

189
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,030
I'm being threatened by
some bad people.

190
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,998
It would be terrible if you got
caught in the middle,

191
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,935
so this is good-bye. I'm glad
I got to know you.

192
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,470
Wait!

193
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:24,741
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do for you!

194
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:28,512
The Silver Crystal. If I only
had the Silver Crystal...

195
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,647
What is this Silver Crystal?

196
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,912
If I just hand over the Silver
Crystal to them, I'll be free.

197
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,545
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Please
forget I said anything.

198
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:39,688
The Silver Crystal...

199
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,953
Wow! It's beautiful!

200
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:45,657
This type of crystal is very
rare in the world.

201
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,926
Wow! It has a silvery sheen!

202
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,502
That must be the Silver Crystal.

203
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:54,671
Mr. Sanjoin, please wait here.

204
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,298
I'll bring it right away.

205
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,512
I'm pretty sure it was this key.

206
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,255
Oh, it opened!

207
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,326
This is the one.

208
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:18,260
Who's there?! What are you doing?!

209
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,190
Naru, what are you doing with that?

210
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,368
Naru!

211
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,427
Mom, I'm sorry!

212
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,473
Naru!

213
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:34,238
Naru, what's happened to you?

214
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,647
Hey, Luna, let's not do this.

215
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:38,882
What are you saying?

216
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:41,407
We're going to make sure Naru
understood what you said, right?

217
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,287
Besides, we have to do this now

218
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,256
because you didn't do it
right the first time!

219
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,458
I know that, but...

220
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,858
Oh! It's Naru's mother!

221
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:54,790
Have you seen my daughter?

222
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:57,701
Is something wrong?

223
00:14:57,701 --> 00:15:00,437
She grabbed the store's
jewelry and took off.

224
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:02,772
What?! Do you have any idea why?

225
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:05,375
She got a phone call from somebody
named Masato Sanjoin and...

226
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,538
He's a bad guy! I'll help
you look for her!

227
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,477
I can't forgive him! How dare he take
advantage of Naru's feelings?!

228
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:15,480
Usagi, transform now!

229
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,186
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

230
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,953
Luna, let's go!

231
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:58,660
Okay!

232
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,968
The Black Crystal is not responding.

233
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,629
This is just a regular crystal.

234
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,562
I'm so glad I was able to
help Mr. Sanjoin.

235
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,036
This is...

236
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,813
The Black Crystal is showing
a response!

237
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,418
Why?

238
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:27,114
This girl is worth investigating.

239
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:33,492
I want you to help me with something.
Would you come with me?

240
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:36,666
Come, shall we go?

241
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,133
Yes.

242
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,102
Wait a second!

243
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,273
How dare you take advantage
of a girl's love?!

244
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,605
I'll arrest you on the charge
of romantic fraud!

245
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:47,409
Don't interfere in my business!

246
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:52,879
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

247
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,347
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

248
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,252
Sailor Moon, what are
you doing here?

249
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:03,927
Naru, don't be tricked! Masato
Sanjoin is really Nephrite!

250
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,030
He's a member of an evil organization
called the Dark Kingdom!

251
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,796
No! It's a lie! Mr. Sanjoin
is not a bad person!

252
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:12,701
Right, Mr. Sanjoin?

253
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,270
Mr. Sanjoin?

254
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,975
O stars, grant me power.

255
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,749
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

256
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,450
Sailor Moon, get a hold of yourself!

257
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,484
No more games!

258
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,127
Starlight Attack!

259
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,195
So, you managed to just barely
dodge it. But when I strike next,

260
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,172
I will not miss.

261
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,408
Oh, you're so pitiful!

262
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,000
Sailor Moon, hang in there!

263
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,912
Sailor Mars has arrived!

264
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:57,971
Sailor Mercury has arrived!

265
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:02,547
So, the three of you are here. I'll send
all of you to Hell together!

266
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,521
Bubble

267
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:12,828
Spray!

268
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,731
Damn! Where are they?!

269
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,699
Fire

270
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,870
Soul!

271
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,546
Mr. Sanjoin!

272
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:32,710
I didn't know she was still here.

273
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:49,692
Moon Tiara Action!

274
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,600
Shoot!

275
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,965
Mr. Sanjoin!

276
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,607
She's crazy!

277
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:59,871
I will protect Mr. Sanjoin!

278
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,073
Naru!

279
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,573
Please stop!

280
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:12,414
I don't believe it. It stopped.

281
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:15,158
Please don't hurt Mr. Sanjoin!

282
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,388
We cannot let him go!

283
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,229
Get out of our way!

284
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:22,027
No, I won't! Not even if you kill me!

285
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,093
This girl cares for me...

286
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:27,995
Why do you go to such lengths
to protect him?!

287
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:29,838
Because I love him.

288
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,508
I love him with all my heart,

289
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:37,438
so I'll protect him, even
if it costs me my life!

290
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:39,781
Naru...

291
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:49,726
Does this Black Crystal respond
to a kind heart?

292
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:52,428
Sacrificing her own life
to save another...

293
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,828
Is this what human love is?

294
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:58,128
Is that the Silver Crystal?

295
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:08,542
Hand it over!

296
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,013
Naru!

297
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:15,342
Nephrite saved Naru...

298
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:19,350
Mr. Sanjoin saved me.

299
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,324
Naru!

300
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:29,264
Damn you, Nephrite! You intend
to protect a human?!

301
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:41,366
Traitors must die!

302
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:46,470
Moon Tiara Action!

303
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,757
Such regret...

304
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,975
Nephrite, why don't you be a little
considerate of Naru's feelings?!

305
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:15,979
I have returned the favor.

306
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,615
Excuse me, that is not what
I'm talking about!

307
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:21,351
Don't you have a heart?!

308
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,945
You're wasting your breath.
Of course, he doesn't!

309
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,055
Obviously, you guys know nothing!

310
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,391
Listen! Once we get
the Silver Crystal,

311
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,127
the whole universe will belong
to the Dark Kingdom!

312
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,618
The Silver Crystal? What are
you talking about?

313
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,133
The Silver Crystal...
It sounds familiar.

314
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,869
You can pretend to be champions
of justice for now,

315
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,237
but that won't last for
much longer!

316
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,374
Until then, you can keep blathering
on about your love and justice.

317
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:45,841
Good-bye.

318
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,846
Mr. Sanjoin...

319
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,615
Naru...

320
00:21:56,486 --> 00:22:00,479
Oh, shooting star, please, if Nephrite
cares about Naru,

321
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:03,116
don't let him do any more bad things.

322
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:12,758
In my dream, you and I were together

323
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:19,669
Protected by the stars

324
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,887
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

325
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,162
And we casually talked to each other

326
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:50,836
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

327
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:57,805
I want to become prettier
right here and now

328
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:05,344
Something changes when
you fall in love

329
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:11,889
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

330
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:25,773
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
