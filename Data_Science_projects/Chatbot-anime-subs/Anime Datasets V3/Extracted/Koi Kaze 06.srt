00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,260
Autumnal melancholy

17
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,450
We... still have some eggs left.

18
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,450
<i>mitsuba = white chervil (cryptotaenia japonica), japanese parsley</i>
So all we need is crab meat and mitsuba.

19
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,750
Yesterday I made rice with green peas for dinner thinking it was reminiscent of autumn,

20
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,950
but then my brother said it was like a school meal.

21
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,850
That's why I've decided to make crab porridge for dinner tonight.

22
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,650
It's because I've never eaten it for a school meal.

23
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,050
Dad would probably enjoy it.

24
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,550
Brother would probably... not be surprised.

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,850
I'm just trying to become closer to my brother, who's sometimes arrogant and mean.

26
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,150
I'm finally starting to realize that my brother does have his good points.

27
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,050
However, he's still unfriendly and grumpy sometimes.

28
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,650
Kohinata-san.

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,350
Miyauchi-kun.

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,850
I'll take those for you.

31
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,150
Thank you

32
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,550
All the executive committee does is odd jobs.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,950
Yeah.

34
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,550
Doesn't it suck?

35
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,350
No, not really.

36
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,350
Miyauchi-kun's class is doing a haunted house, right? I heard from Tamaki-chan.

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,550
Yeah.

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,350
Sounds like fun.

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,350
Our class is just doing a plain exhibition.

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,650
It's normal.

41
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,550
Did you ask anyone to come, Miyauchi-kun? Like a friend?

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,850
No.

43
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,650
Oh...

44
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,650
I was thinking of asking my brother...

45
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,250
But it's hard to figure out his days off, so he might not be free on the Culture Festival Day.

46
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,350
So the rumor about you having a brother complex is true.

47
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,450
Eh? I don't! I don't have a brother complex!

48
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,150
Who did you hear that from?

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,250
No one.

50
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,350
Don't give me that!

51
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,350
I overheard Tamaki talking with her friends.

52
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,750
Well, Tamaki-chan and Futaba-chan like to make fun of me,

53
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,050
but is going to the movies or shopping with my brother really such a weird thing to do?

54
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,050
It's true that I like my brother, but...

55
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,650
Just leave the rumors alone.

56
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
I'm saying not to worry about them.

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,550
So as for me, nothing has changed.

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,550
And as time passed, the feelings of guilt thinned out.

59
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,850
Again I...

60
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
Not that I'm taking the offensive,

61
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,350
but recently I sometimes think...

62
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,250
Is it that weird to think about my sister while masturbating?

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,650
Younger sister, younger sister, younger sister...

64
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,630

Proposal book

65
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,850
How can I say this? You never grow up, do you?

66
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,050
Not at all.

67
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,850
My admiration for the existence of a younger sister is my life long theme.

68
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,350
Right, Koshiro-san?

69
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,350
Don't try to get my consent.

70
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,850
So you say... But you were walking with Nanoka-chan last Sunday, weren't you?

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,050
What did you...!?

72
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,650
Oh how nice, a date with your sister.

73
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,050
I'd like to take a cute brother out and walk with him too.

74
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,450
Oh really?

75
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,050
But going out with your brother on a holiday, isn't that kind of sad?

76
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,950
I wonder if she doesn't have a boyfriend?

77
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,450
A childish kid like her wouldn't be able to get a guy.

78
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,850
Maybe you're the only one who thinks so.

79
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,550
A guy huh?

80
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,550
"Big brother"...

81
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,150
Now's probably the only time that she'd be attached to her brother like that...

82
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,850
Oh really?

83
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,650
Yeah. So my big brother's last name is Saeki, but mine is Kohinata.

84
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,350
Isn't it weird? That we have different last names even though we're siblings?

85
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,550
How about you, Miyauchi-kun?

86
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,050
I have an older sister.

87
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,250
An older sister? How nice.

88
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,150
How much older is she?

89
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,050
Two years older.

90
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,350
She's in high school?

91
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,350
It's nice that your ages are so close.

92
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,850
My brother and I are 12 years apart...

93
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,850
And my brother always has this grumpy look and...

94
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,950
Brother!

95
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,250
This is my brother.

96
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,150
Hi, I'm Miyauchi of class 4, first year.

97
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,050
He walked me home because we had to stay late for the Culture Festival preparations.

98
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,650
Then I'll go now.

99
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,250
Okay, thank you.

100
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,050
It's rude if you don't greet him properly too, Brother...

101
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,750
Ouch!

102
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,650
It hurts, Brother! It hurts!

103
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,750
Hey! Brother! What's your problem?

104
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,950
What do you mean Culture Festival preparations?

105
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,350
It's ten years too early for you to be going out with a guy!

106
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,350
Until you reach an age when you can take responsibility for yourself,

107
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,850
I won't allow such things!

108
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,550
Why are you misunderstanding?

109
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,350
Miyauchi-kun just walked me home out of kindness!

110
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,750
Kindness? Are you an idiot!

111
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,650
You don't know what kind of ulterior motives he has!

112
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,050
Use your brain a little more!

113
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,850
You're the only one that has such a dirty mind!

114
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,450
Fool! You're not cautious enough!

115
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,950
That's not true!

116
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,750
Yes it is!

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,810
Why would you know that kind of thing?

118
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,410
Because you're cute!

119
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,950
No... This isnt what I personally think.

120
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,650
It's what people think objectively.

121
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,950
As your brother, it's only natural to be worried about you, my younger sister.

122
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,350
This is more of my dad's opinion than mine. It's what's called a family consensus...

123
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,550
Hey, what's wrong?

124
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,750
You'll disturb the neighbors if you're being so noisy in front of the house.

125
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,150
Hey, Na... Nanoka?

126
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,830
Wh...wh...wh...what happened?

127
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,350
I dont know!

128
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,250
I was surprised...

129
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,450
God... What's up with him?

130
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,650
You should try to get along as siblings.

131
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,150
Shut up! I didn't become a brother because I wanted to!

132
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,150
Koshiro!

133
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Nanoka has already left.

134
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,500
I see.

135
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,900
Here.

136
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,100
I guess it was a bit insinuating...

137
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,600
But it's fine.

138
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,200
My brother was really mean yesterday.

139
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
"Cute" ... he said.

140
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,000
How weird.

141
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
No way! A pervert?

142
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,400
Oh god, no! No! No! It was so gross!

143
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,700
Man that sucks! Didn't your brother protect you?

144
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,700
It's not like I'm always with him!

145
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,700
First guilt, now jealousy?

146
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
I'm home.

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,800
Welcome home.

148
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,400
Dinner is ready.

149
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,400
Okay.

150
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,300
Isn't brother late?

151
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,000
Really?

152
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,000
I guess not really.

153
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
He's usually home around now.

154
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,200
That's right, I'm angry at him.

155
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,600
He always says things so arrogantly.

156
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Because you're cute!

157
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
I was just surprised...

158
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,600
I didn't think I'd hear those words from my brother.

159
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
That's all.

160
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,500
Good night.

161
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Should I make up with him tomorrow?

162
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,100
What? He left before me?

163
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Ouch...

164
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Good morning.

165
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,400
Why? Stingy! Meanie!

166
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
He could have waited for me a little bit.

167
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Kohinata-san.

168
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Miyauchi-kun.

169
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,200
The tickets for my class are ready.

170
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,500
Okay, thanks.

171
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
Come with your brother or something.

172
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm never inviting my brother!

173
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,100
With that project plan the next event will definitely succeed!

174
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah.

175
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
We have the data you gathered for us, too.

176
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
With that, the chief will agree to it.

177
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,900
Yeah...

178
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,800
What a spoilsport!

179
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,300
Yeah...

180
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,800
I'll go with you today.

181
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
It's fine, I'll go ahead.

182
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,600
You know what?

183
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't avoid me forever, just because you're brooding over something stupid.

184
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Aren't you the one who's avoiding me?

185
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
You were late yesterday, too.

186
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,000
Not that I really care about that.

187
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
What?

188
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,100
You're always so bossy, just because you're a bit older than me.

189
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,600
Saying things like you're pressing me from above.

190
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
I don't like you at all!

191
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,400
It's fine that you don't like me.

192
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I think I said too much the other day.

193
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm sorry.

194
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,100
But, I won't tell you not to go out with guys.

195
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,300
Just don't come home too late or lie about things.

196
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,000
I never lied!

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,300
I know. Not that.

198
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm talking about from now on.

199
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm saying don't worry me too much.

200
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
Does brother really worry about me that much?

201
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Damn, we missed the train because of you.

202
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
It's because of your lecture.

203
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,400
If anything happens to you the responsibility of the guardian is going to be questioned.

204
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't treat me like a kid.

205
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You are a kid.

206
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's not true!

207
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Excuse me.

208
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,800
Sorry.

209
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
The doors are closing. please be careful.

210
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
I hope you stay a child...

211
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,500

Usually she had a big boyfriend, so I couldn't get my hands on her, but...

230
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,950
I touched her once to try to comfort her!

231
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,690
Go to hell!
