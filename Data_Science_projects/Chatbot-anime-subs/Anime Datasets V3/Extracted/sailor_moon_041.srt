1
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:03,563
After all the trouble we went through

2
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:05,731
to restore the Seven Monsters
back into humans,

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,068
you want to revive them?!
You've gotta be kidding!

4
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,737
It's not like recycling cans!

5
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:15,174
You are not getting away with this!

6
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:19,406
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,907
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

8
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:01,335
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

10
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Guided by the light of the moon

12
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:28,666
We will meet again and again

13
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,807
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,747
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

15
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

16
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,246
Who are you?!

17
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:28,654
I've been looking for you,
Reika Nishimura.

18
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:32,826
Or, should I call you Rikokayder,

19
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,920
one of the great Seven Monsters?

20
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,932
What are you talking about?!

21
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:41,867
Now, come back to us once again!

22
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:11,521
That leaves three more.

23
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:21,663
I Won't Run From Love Anymore!
Ami and Mamoru's Showdown

24
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:31,451
Hello, this is Mizuno.

25
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,420
Oh, is this Miss Ami? It's me, Urawa.

26
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:37,423
Oh, Ryo. It's been so long.

27
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:40,226
Ami, do you have a TV nearby?

28
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:42,061
Yes, I do, but...

29
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,722
Please turn it on immediately!

30
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,359
Popular Illustrator
Missing!!

31
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,171
With Miss Yumeno,

32
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:57,277
five out of the former Seven
Monsters are missing!

33
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,142
Wait, Ryo...

34
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,248
And the next target is...

35
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,616
Please believe me.

36
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,219
This is something I found out

37
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,380
thanks to a residual ability
to foresee the future.

38
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:12,091
Ryo, where are you now?
I'll be there right away!

39
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,226
No, you can't.

40
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,820
If you meet me, you'll be involved
in this trouble, too.

41
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,832
More importantly, please protect
Miss Rei's grandfather.

42
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:22,232
If you don't, something
terrible will happen.

43
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:27,307
Please, stop the Dark Kingdom from
achieving their ambitions!

44
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:28,041
Bye.

45
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:28,641
Ryo?! Ryo!
Bye.

46
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:29,903
Ryo?! Ryo!

47
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,440
This is how it should be.

48
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:41,481
To be honest, I was going
to ask for her help,

49
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,357
but I can't trouble Miss Ami
and her friends

50
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:45,847
any more than I already have.

51
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,692
Oh? Wasn't that...

52
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,834
Yes, this is Makoto.

53
00:04:56,536 --> 00:05:00,370
Mako, there's been an incident!
Come to Hikawa Shrine, quick!

54
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,035
Oh, okay.

55
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,583
Queen Beryl, please tell me,

56
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:22,525
why are we gathering the former
Seven Monsters now?

57
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,667
It is true, they were purified by
the Crescent Moon Wand

58
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,862
and turned back into their
human forms.

59
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:32,372
However, by using the power

60
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,941
of our dark energy and
the Black Crystal,

61
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:37,577
we can turn them back
into monsters again.

62
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:41,581
But they were already defeated
by the sailor warriors once.

63
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,344
Are they not useless to us?

64
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:45,909
You know nothing.

65
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,762
Once the Seven Monsters
are united together,

66
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:57,764
they will merge into one being

67
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,995
and the biggest, most powerful
monster will be born!

68
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,344
And when that happens,

69
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:14,939
we will be able to put an end
to the sailor warriors!

70
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,850
Then, all the more reason!

71
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,554
Why did you assign this task,
not to me, but to Endymion?

72
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:25,547
Do you have a problem with
my decision, Kunzite?

73
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,494
No, that is not what I meant.

74
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:32,897
Then, let us sit back and watch
Endymion's handiwork.

75
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,056
Yes, my lady.

76
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,792
Hikawa Shrine

77
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:43,810
I see.

78
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,111
I don't really know,

79
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,214
but are Urawa's predictions
that accurate?

80
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:50,614
Yes, with a very high probability.

81
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:54,721
The Dark Kingdom must be gathering
the Seven Monsters

82
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:58,248
and plotting to do something terrible.

83
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,827
All right! Ami, let's go!

84
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,962
What? Go where?

85
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:07,100
Where else?! We have to
protect Urawa, right?

86
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,695
But we don't even know where he is.

87
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,473
We know he's somewhere in town.

88
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,668
If we look around, we'll run into him.

89
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:20,445
We'll leave guarding Grandpa
up to you guys.

90
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,617
What's wrong, Usagi?

91
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,787
I feel so sorry for the heroine
in this comic book!

92
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:31,057
Hey, don't read my comics
without my permission!

93
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,658
Oh, come on, just a little bit!

94
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:35,928
No, you can't! You'll make them dirty
with your tears!

95
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:36,329
These girls...
No, you can't! You'll make them dirty
with your tears!

96
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,096
These girls...
I can see you slobbered on my book!

97
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,428
The future of the sailor warriors...
I can see you slobbered on my book!

98
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,034
He should be around here.

99
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,117
Ryo Urawa?

100
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:03,478
You're Endymion of the Dark Kingdom.

101
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:07,160
That's right. Since you can
see the future,

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,029
I see making such a guess
is a piece of cake.

103
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,267
So, have you seen what is
in store for you as well?

104
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:18,294
Yes. You're going to trap me inside
the Black Crystal, right?

105
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:23,569
Very good. Now, why don't you
quietly come with me?

106
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm sorry, but someone told me
something once

107
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,207
and ever since then, I've decided
to make my own destiny.

108
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,386
What do you mean?

109
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,820
In other words, I'm not going
to just give up!

110
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,292
MURDERER! HELP ME!

111
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,157
No, I'm not!

112
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:44,360
Shoot!

113
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,210
Mako, let's go back.

114
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,544
I feel bad for Ryo,

115
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:01,180
but there's nothing we can do
in this situation.

116
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,585
What are you saying?! He's your
boyfriend, isn't he?!

117
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:09,817
Oh, no, not a boyfriend.
He's just a friend.

118
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,927
Ami, are you saying that seriously?

119
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,062
What? Yes...

120
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:19,088
Urawa loves you, you know!

121
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:24,770
I know. But we have an
important mission,

122
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,534
so I can't return his feelings.

123
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:31,443
If you keep telling yourself that,
you'll regret your youth!

124
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:35,238
Even champions of justice
should be allowed to love!

125
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,218
What's wrong with dating
a boy that you like?!

126
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,310
But...

127
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,911
Ami, you're just running away from it!

128
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,484
You're scared of being in love.

129
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,827
That's why you come up with
all kinds of excuses

130
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,057
so you don't have to deal with Urawa!

131
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:53,866
Why can't you be more honest
with your feelings?!

132
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,798
That's not...

133
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,670
Lost Cat

134
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,504
Lost Cat
Oh! There he is!

135
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:58,905
Oh! There he is!

136
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:03,308
Sure, I can understand why
you might hesitate, but...

137
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:07,246
Oh, wait, Ami! I'm not finished talking!

138
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:08,180
I saw him!

139
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,581
What?! You mean, Urawa?
I saw him!

140
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,615
What?! You mean, Urawa?

141
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:10,877
Yeah!

142
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,781
Let's go!

143
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:30,194
Miss Ami! No, Sailor Mercury...

144
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:33,139
Long time no see, Urawa.

145
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,573
You're safe, now that we're here.

146
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:39,110
What reassuring bodyguards.

147
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:45,017
Mamoru!

148
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,109
Mamoru!
Mamoru!

149
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:50,449
Mamoru? Someone else also
called me that before.

150
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:55,088
But you have the wrong person!
My name is Endymion!

151
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:35,836
Sailor Mercury, let me handle this.
You take Urawa.

152
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:38,138
No, I'll fight with you!

153
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:41,875
What are you saying?! Our priority
is to protect Urawa, right?!

154
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,876
But...

155
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,644
Come on, hurry!

156
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:47,613
Okay! Urawa, this way!

157
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,719
Mamoru... No, Endymion!

158
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:55,845
I don't really want to fight against you,

159
00:11:56,923 --> 00:12:00,193
but considering the situation,
I'm not going easy on you!

160
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:01,626
Just what I would have wanted.

161
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,862
But will you be able to handle me
all by yourself, I wonder?

162
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,958
I'll just have to give it my best shot!

163
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,660
Supreme

164
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,268
Thunder!

165
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,210
Is that it?

166
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:27,953
This is Sailor Mercury! I have Urawa
under my protection!

167
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,856
That's my girl, Sailor Mercury!

168
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:30,690
Let me read it!
That's my girl, Sailor Mercury!

169
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,124
Let me read it!

170
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:31,892
Just give it to me, Usagi!

171
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:32,592
But Mamoru showed up,
Just give it to me, Usagi!

172
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:33,860
But Mamoru showed up,

173
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,294
and Sailor Jupiter is fighting him
right now!

174
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,065
Mamoru showed up?!

175
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:40,967
Will Sailor Jupiter be
all right by herself?

176
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:41,635
Like Good Friends

177
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,937
Like Good Friends
Sailor Moon, please help us!

178
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:44,538
Sailor Moon, please help us!

179
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:46,606
The Crescent Moon Wand
is the only way

180
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:48,809
we can restore Mamoru!

181
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,106
Usagi!

182
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:54,647
Okay... Let's go, Luna...

183
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,145
Hurry up...

184
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,987
What's wrong? Are you done
attacking already?

185
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,264
I'm just getting started!

186
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,567
You have quite an admirable
fighting spirit.

187
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:16,103
But, I cannot just keep
playing this game.

188
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:18,799
So, I will go on the offensive now.

189
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,404
Here, here, here, here!

190
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,002
As I thought, you are no match
for me alone.

191
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:51,971
Polish your skills more
and fight me again.

192
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,501
Damn it!

193
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:02,508
Sailor Mercury, I have a request.

194
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,914
Look. If we're going to run,
we should go this way.

195
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:11,057
It's so cold! It'll ruin my skin!

196
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,928
Come on, run faster!
It'll warm you up!

197
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,294
Easy for you to say!

198
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:21,468
Ouch! It hurts!

199
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:22,869
Usagi?!

200
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:24,271
Sailor Jupiter!

201
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,406
I'm glad. We made it in time!

202
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:27,841
No, you didn't!

203
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:31,511
Say, Luna, Endymion didn't
come this way, did he?

204
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,213
What?

205
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,647
Shoot! Where did he go?!

206
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:41,476
We're Closed Today
Hours

207
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,665
Urawa, why do you want
to come here?

208
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:55,499
It was my dream to go to an
amusement park with you.

209
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,501
Urawa...

210
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:02,506
Now, I have nothing to regret.

211
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:05,534
Let us go in separate
directions from here.

212
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,080
We can't do that.

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,140
We don't know when the Dark Kingdom
might come back for you.

214
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,087
I've found the resolve to take them
down with me.

215
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,324
Please, I want you to fulfill
your own mission.

216
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:20,225
After all, I was never human
to begin with.

217
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,163
If the sacrifice of my unworthy life
could save the world...

218
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,035
You and I really are the same.

219
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,670
We're always trying
to avoid something.

220
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,864
What?!

221
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,809
My friend told me that I need to be
more honest with myself.

222
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,608
Miss Ami...

223
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,619
Sacrificing yourself is certainly
very admirable,

224
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:48,588
but if you're honest with
what's in your heart,

225
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,988
don't you feel that you want
to make it through alive?

226
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:52,959
Aren't you forgetting

227
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,484
that there are people who will
grieve over your death?

228
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,929
Let's both stop running away.

229
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,493
Let's take on any obstacle head on,
no matter what it is!

230
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:09,798
That sounds wonderful, Sailor Mercury.

231
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,911
You're here!

232
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,651
That's...

233
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,560
Let's go and see!

234
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,822
Yeah!

235
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,837
Mamoru, I won't hesitate
to beat you anymore!

236
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,134
Prepare yourself!

237
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,534
How promising.

238
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,344
I was planning to wait until
the Ferris wheel's lights

239
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,335
brought the other sailor warriors here,

240
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:49,337
but you are saying that
is not necessary then.

241
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,241
Bubble

242
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,619
Spray!

243
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,264
Before I fight you, I am going to
take care of my business first.

244
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,929
Oh, no! Urawa!

245
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:17,032
Miss Ami!

246
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,808
Thank you for waiting.

247
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:28,355
You're terrible!

248
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:32,985
Mamoru! No, Endymion
of the Dark Kingdom!

249
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,123
I won't forgive you!

250
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:39,257
It's time for you to take a cold shower
and reflect on what you've done!

251
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,203
If you want to get your boyfriend back,

252
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:45,671
just destroy this Black Crystal.

253
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:50,410
But, of course, that is only
if you can defeat me.

254
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,536
Come, let us fight!

255
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:07,754
Out of my respect for you,
I will fight you in earnest!

256
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,164
There is no way I can beat him
at this rate,

257
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,893
but I have no choice, I have to try.

258
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,535
Bubble Spray!

259
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,534
Is that all you can do?

260
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:26,713
Impertinent little...

261
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:28,047
I'm just returning the favor!

262
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,709
I will also fulfill my mission
before I fight you!

263
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:33,851
Take that!

264
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,231
Everyone!

265
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,602
Sailor Mercury, you look
much better now!

266
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:53,129
Yes, and it's all thanks to you,
Sailor Jupiter!

267
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:57,304
Oh, so you already shattered the
ambition of the Dark Kingdom.

268
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:02,874
Sailor Moon, you have to
restore Tuxedo Mask!

269
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:06,517
I will take care of all three
of you together!

270
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:11,391
If you're interested in recycling,
why don't you just stick to cans?!

271
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,526
Urawa and the others were
leading peaceful lives.

272
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,163
I can't forgive you for trying
to use them once again!

273
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:19,961
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

274
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:23,762
Supreme

275
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,943
Thunder!

276
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:31,808
Bubble

277
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,010
Spray!

278
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,756
Hurry, Sailor Moon!

279
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,451
I know!

280
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:58,030
Moon Healing Escalation!

281
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,238
Shoot...

282
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,789
Just a little more, Sailor Moon!

283
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,451
Increase the energy even more!

284
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:25,592
Refresh!

285
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,935
We did it! We got Mamoru back!

286
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,698
Thank goodness!

287
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,812
Good job, Sailor Moon!

288
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,490
What...

289
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,058
It's probably...

290
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,219
The Dark Kingdom's handiwork.

291
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:56,455
No...

292
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,969
So, as I feared, Endymion's
memories of his past

293
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:05,665
were still not completely erased.

294
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,007
In that case, once more,

295
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:11,144
I will transfer our great ruler's
energy into his body,

296
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,745
and make sure he becomes

297
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:15,873
a loyal servant of the Dark
Kingdom this time.

298
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,722
Let's come here again sometime.

299
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:31,523
Okay.

300
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,602
We can't let this keep going on!

301
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:38,838
If even Ami forgets about
our precious mission,

302
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:41,541
who's going to be our leader?!

303
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,169
That's technically supposed
to be your job, Usagi.

304
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:47,871
You're jealous of those two.
Right, Usagi?

305
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:49,905
So are you!

306
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,019
Now, now, there's nothing
wrong with this.

307
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,749
Let's watch over them for
a little while longer.

308
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:15,029
During the day, the
fragrance of flowers

309
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,645
During the night, the
twinkle of the stars

310
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:26,381
It's a world no one knows about

311
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:30,284
With white shoes clicking

312
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:34,094
Cross the white moon bridge

313
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:42,160
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

314
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:48,838
Offer a prayer to the moon

315
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,578
It will surely bring you happiness

316
00:22:58,051 --> 00:23:04,786
Go round and round, the
moon's merry-go-round

317
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:13,062
Make that serene dress made
of glass flutter in the wind

318
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,607
She's always watching over us

319
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:27,103
Moon, moon princess
