1
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,779
Don't touch me with your right hand!

2
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,398
This is the last cherry bomb I have.

3
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,068
I'll hold it in your place,
Nice, and set it off with care.

4
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,778
If they resist, kill them.

5
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,387
Ennis, you're kidding, right?

6
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:22,459
E-Ennis!

7
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,171
What?!

8
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,828
I'm not too sure about
the man, but the woman is all right.

9
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:03,124
I thought he was just common scum,
but he's something else.

10
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:04,626
Don't you think so?

11
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,170
Now then,

12
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:10,742
I promised that I would
kill the one who survived,

13
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:13,176
but it's not clear whether he's alive or dead.

14
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,512
What do you think I should do?

15
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:20,809
Is this Huey guy your sweetheart?

16
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:25,438
Family?

17
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,150
Your father?

18
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,030
Is it true that he's immortal?

19
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,482
Is <i>that</i> what you think?
That I might coerce Huey,

20
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:47,711
and steal away the secret of
his immortal youth from him?

21
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,839
Is he the only family you have?

22
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,202
He's the only family you've got,
so you want to do

23
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:56,344
whatever it takes to protect him,

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,762
am I right?

25
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,938
I was thinking about that...

26
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,192
If you and I got married,
I would become that Huey guy's son.

27
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,808
Then, I would be a member of your family,

28
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,489
so that wouldn't be an issue anymore.

29
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,272
You can think I'm kidding
if you want to, but I'm serious.

30
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:24,581
Unlike your buddies in there,
I will not betray you.

31
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:28,488
I won't try to pull anything like stealing
the secrets of immortality from Huey, either.

32
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,503
After all, I don't need them.

33
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,952
You see, whether I have
the power of immortality or not,

34
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:39,918
there's no way I'm going to die. I believe that.

35
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,713
So don't say anything, and believe it, too.

36
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:45,226
I am a man who will never die.

37
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,768
We'll be coming up on a river soon.

38
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:02,243
If you're not planning on
being caught by the police, jump off there.

39
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:06,498
Carve your answer to me
into the roof over there.

40
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,180
Bye, now.

41
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,334
You can throw the knife at me,
if you want to.

42
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,378
I'll just dodge it.

43
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:29,218
Jacuzzi is usually a crybaby,
but when he sets his mind to something,

44
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,106
he doesn't cry, no matter what.

45
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,762
When he got that tattoo,
he didn't complain about it once.

46
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:39,697
Then, why is he such a
crybaby the rest of the time?

47
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:47,413
So, are you ready, tattooed boy?

48
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,215
Are you mad, kid?!

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,717
What?

50
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,595
Hmm? What's wrong?

51
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:09,936
Impossible!

52
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:18,308
I was thinking, the times
when I'd want to cry are sure to be

53
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,322
the times when I need to try my hardest, right?

54
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:26,161
So I've decided to get lots of
crying out of the way, all the time.

55
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,125
<i>I'm going to shed the tears I would</i>
<i>when I'll want to cry the most, now,</i>

56
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,045
<i>so that when I have to try my hardest,</i>
<i>those tears will have already dried up.</i>

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,175
You take it from here.

58
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,412
Boss!

59
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,679
Nick, please jump off ahead of us,
and join up with the recovery team.

60
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,395
Handy, isn't it?

61
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,508
It's rigged to shoot a bullet
when I make a fist,

62
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,566
and press it against someone.

63
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,268
Now then, I may have had
a bit of an accident earlier,

64
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:03,531
but at this range,
I'm more than close enough to roast you.

65
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,993
Do you have any last words, boy?

66
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,001
What is this? What kind of monster is this?!

67
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,379
It couldn't be...

68
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:20,882
...the Rail Tracer?

69
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,770
Isaac-<i>san...</i> Miria-<i>san...</i>

70
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,022
What?

71
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,302
I'm sorry. Thank you.

72
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:42,195
I'm really glad that I got a chance
to speak to you again, at the end.

73
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,910
If you'd be willing to do
just one more favor for me,

74
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,372
then please, don't forget about me.

75
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,038
Damn it! Stay back! Stay back!

76
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,263
Stay back, damn it!

77
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,058
Die! Die! Die!

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,088
Burn! Burn! Burn!

79
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:17,272
Burn!

80
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,405
Czes-<i>kun</i>!

81
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:24,138
Are you all right, Czes-<i>kun</i>?

82
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:25,682
Stay with us!

83
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:26,739
Why...

84
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:30,702
Why don't you... eat me?

85
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,084
Boss...

86
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,344
You fool! What do you plan to do, unarmed?!

87
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,681
I've got a gun...

88
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,183
...in my heart!

89
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,388
What is that?
It keeps doing that. Is that the enemy?

90
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:08,698
Wah! Isaac!

91
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,523
What is that?!

92
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:14,568
T-This must be the Rail Tracer!

93
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:17,238
It's come to eat up what it left of Czes-<i>kun</i>!

94
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:19,334
Damn it, I won't let that happen!

95
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:26,507
Jacuzzi!

96
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,676
Nice...

97
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,538
Thank goodness you're safe.

98
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:35,308
I'm all right. Never mind me, we
have to hurry and stop this bleeding.

99
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:42,842
Yeah, about that... I used that
new type of bomb you gave me.

100
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,985
We've got ourselves a real treasure.

101
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,228
Jacuzzi...

102
00:08:54,228 --> 00:09:01,501
You know what, Nice?
Maybe I have cried a bit too much before.

103
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:05,448
So, for all that I've cried too much,

104
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:08,049
I'm going to say that I've
been crying your share, too.

105
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,372
Since I've done your crying for you, Nice,

106
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:14,055
no matter what hardships
you have from now on, don't you cry.

107
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:19,560
Jacuzzi!

108
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,638
I knew this would be coming.

109
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,978
I made several others before you, after all,

110
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:35,535
and as soon as they got too
much knowledge, they turned on me.

111
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:48,214
I won't kill you quickly.
I'm going to make you suffer abundantly.

112
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,332
Hey, you! What have you done to Ennis?!

113
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,721
What have you done?!

114
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,168
Why, you...

115
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,892
That's something I'd like to ask you, too.

116
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,147
Y-You're...

117
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,941
That hurt, you know, you dumb ass...

118
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:08,972
Guys!

119
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:12,238
Hey, Maiza, how come we're not dead?

120
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,852
I see, you're the ones...

121
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:18,494
you're the ones who drank it!

122
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:25,126
We've burned gloves and warehouses before...

123
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,797
But this is the first time
we've ever burned someone's head, huh?

124
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:35,803
Please, place your right hand
on that man's head!

125
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:37,930
My right hand?

126
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,140
Hurry!

127
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,226
Ennis! Why, you...

128
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:45,480
Out of my way!

129
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,321
Now think in your mind that you want to eat!

130
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,072
Ennis...

131
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,498
Huh? That red stuff is gone.

132
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,385
Huh? What about Czes-<i>kun</i>?

133
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,608
Jacuzzi, who was that?

134
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,746
The Rail Tracer, maybe.

135
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,542
Jacuzzi!

136
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,085
Donny!

137
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,382
<i>Well, what are you waiting for?</i>

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,386
<i>A little further... Just reach</i>
<i>your right hand out a little further...</i>

139
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,958
Thank goodness!

140
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,752
Thank goodness, really!

141
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:08,258
Really! But why are his injuries all healed?

142
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:11,399
That's easy, Miria. Ready?

143
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:15,848
The Rail Tracer starts by gobbling up
the naughty children first, right?

144
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:19,642
I'm sure that after eating him,
it realized that Czes is a good boy,

145
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:21,610
so it came back to return
the parts it had eaten!

146
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,398
That's it! That fits with what happened, huh?

147
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:25,413
You're wrong.

148
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,833
I haven't been a good boy.

149
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,501
I lied to you.

150
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,211
You lied?

151
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,408
I said that I was going to
New York to see my family,

152
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:40,265
but the truth is,
I'm just going to see an acquaintance.

153
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:44,792
I don't have any family.
I never have, and I never--

154
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,378
Is that right?!

155
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,478
Czes-<i>kun</i>, you really are a good boy!

156
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:54,218
You told that lie to keep us
from worrying about you!

157
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:57,722
And yet, Czes-<i>kun</i>, you're the one
who's worst off of all of us!

158
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:01,808
Czes-<i>kun</i>, you're an incredibly good boy!

159
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,701
Um...

160
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:07,295
All right, you just leave it to Isaac!

161
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:11,500
Good for you, Czes-<i>kun</i>!
You can rest easy, once Isaac takes charge!

162
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,546
So it's okay for you to smile now.

163
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,463
Hey! Isaac-<i>san</i>!

164
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,208
Miria-<i>san</i>!

165
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,764
Czes-<i>kun</i>!

166
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,848
I have a favor to ask.

167
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:41,690
It looks like I'm about to die,

168
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,700
so would you eat me, as well?

169
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,983
What kind of nonsense is that?

170
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:54,198
Oh, I still have so much
I wanted to tell Isaac and Miria.

171
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:59,757
So, please, eat me, and
give them a message from me.

172
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,637
If you've got something to say, say it yourself.

173
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:14,683
It's strange. I knew the way to save you.

174
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,195
That's right.

175
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:19,638
You've got all of Szilard's knowledge now.

176
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:21,987
Eating that old coot was worth it.

177
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:29,232
My name is Firo. What's yours?

178
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:30,830
Ennis.

179
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,999
Why ask? You must already know it.

180
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,003
I just wanted to hear you say it.

181
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,509
Whoo! Whoo!

182
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,418
What are you laughing at?

183
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:51,168
Whoo! Whoo!

184
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:54,186
Isaac-<i>san</i>, Miria-<i>san</i>, you, too?

185
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,610
How about telling me
where Dallas Genoard is?

186
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,118
Are you awake?

187
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,267
What is this?! How are you still alive?!

188
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,448
Who knows? According to what Firo said,

189
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:21,742
we have the same sort of
immortal bodies that you do.

190
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:27,386
Unfortunately, however, unlike you,
he says we will not die of old age.

191
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,588
With that in mind, I would like you all

192
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:35,561
to accept responsibility for what you've done.

193
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:43,277
Hey, hey, hey!!

194
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:50,812
You're going to be drowned indefinitely
at the bottom of the Hudson River.

195
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:53,568
I wanted to rub you out for good all at once,

196
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,832
but since you don't die from
being shot or clobbered, what can I do?

197
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,658
Keith, that's nice of you.

198
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:07,788
You're going to have a lot of
free time at the bottom of the river

199
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:11,639
before you die of the infirmity of old age,
so there's a parting gift for you.

200
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,088
That's awful... that's so awful!

201
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,132
I don't mean to disagree with you,

202
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:22,377
but your older brother
killed our men without pity.

203
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:24,360
Here in this room, one year ago.

204
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,182
As such, we will not apologize.

205
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:32,927
We will only offer our sincerest condolences.

206
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,538
That is all we can do.

207
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,652
The Hudson River, huh?

208
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,687
If you've disposed of him,
then I am free to pick him up, right?

209
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:46,757
Yes, but shouldn't his relative
have first claim?

210
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,975
What do you intend to do with my brother?

211
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:55,224
Examine him, comprehensively,
in a certain laboratory I have.

212
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,518
Then you will bring my brother back up?

213
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:01,258
Yeah. It should release him from the suffering

214
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,023
of continuously drowning forever.

215
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,192
Will you allow me to see him?

216
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,404
It's a promise.

217
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,188
Please go after my brother.

218
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,188
Eve-<i>chan</i>, are you sure?

219
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:18,539
That man is the one responsible
for the deaths in your family!

220
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,908
If this sounds like
I'm making excuses, so be it,

221
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:27,828
but Raymond and Geoffrey
were not killed on my orders.

222
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:30,968
This man here did it all on his own.

223
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,389
Boss...

224
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:40,144
It's you, isn't it, Boss? You came to rescue--

225
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,525
Does that somewhat help to
demonstrate the way things are?

226
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:55,153
I want to show my brother that
there are such things as miracles.

227
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:57,898
If I rescue him from
the hell of the river bottom,

228
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:59,955
I think my brother will realize that.

229
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:04,453
Pardon the intrusion, Gandor.

230
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:05,461
Eve-<i>chan</i>!

231
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:17,708
Oh! Ennis, Firo, and Maiza!

232
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,168
Long time no see, my fine fellows!

233
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,102
I'm so glad to see you're all doing so well!

234
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,268
Oh yeah, Ennis! This boy's name is Czes-<i>kun</i>!

235
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:37,608
That's right, Ennis!
Let this boy be your younger brother!

236
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,036
That would be great!

237
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,442
This is our gift!

238
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,750
Especially for you!

239
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:49,964
Hello.

240
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,715
Hello.

241
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,969
Czes...

242
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,595
Maiza...

243
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:01,183
<i>I came to this city in order to devour this man.</i>

244
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,838
Does this mean these
two know each other, Miria?

245
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,052
I'm sure that's it, Isaac.

246
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:11,485
Czes-<i>kun</i> said he was coming here
to see an acquaintance.

247
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,988
<i>He's here.</i>

248
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:19,148
<i>Now he's going to put his right hand</i>
<i>on my head, and try to devour me.</i>

249
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:21,108
<i>Devour him before he does</i>!

250
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:24,456
<i>Go on, stick your right hand out toward Maiza</i>!

251
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,322
<i>What's he doing? It's a trick.</i>

252
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,242
<i>He's pretending to be considerate,</i>

253
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:35,162
<i>but it's a scheme to devour me</i>
<i>at his leisure afterward...</i>

254
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:37,177
It's all right, Czes.

255
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,722
<i>Don't be fooled</i>!

256
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,962
It's all right. Just like it used to be.

257
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,769
<i>It's already set in motion...</i>

258
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,813
Maiza...

259
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:53,027
<i>I couldn't ever go back to that ship...</i>

260
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,487
I've missed you!

261
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,574
I've missed you, Maiza!

262
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,278
Firo...

263
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:11,712
Maiza-<i>san</i>, I understand everything.

264
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,452
Firo... In that case,
I don't need to say it.

265
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,426
You, of all people...

266
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,668
What's the matter, Maiza-<i>san</i>?

267
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:24,292
To have given the agony
of living forever to all of you...

268
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:26,537
What are you talking about, Maiza-<i>san</i>?

269
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:30,842
None of us mind one bit.
We'd rather <i>not</i> die.

270
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:32,928
We feel like saying yahoo!

271
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,262
I'm not sure I really get it, but yahoo!

272
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,738
Yahoo! Cheer up, Maiza!

273
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,238
As long as they don't say anything,
the boss and Yaguruma-<i>san</i>

274
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:51,850
can pass themselves off
as just being long-lived!

275
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,921
What are you talking about, Firo?

276
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:03,222
In celebration of the birth of a new capo,

277
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:04,878
cheers!

278
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,058
Cheers!

279
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,435
Here you go, here you go.

280
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,021
Here you go.

281
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,308
We've been invited to attend
such a happy event, and all.

282
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,237
This is the least we can do to thank them.

283
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,048
Gretto, is this right?

284
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:46,708
<i>I had noticed, but</i>
<i>I ended up not stopping them.</i>

285
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,878
<i>They would be able to</i>
<i>make their way through it.</i>

286
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:52,312
<i>That's more or less what I was thinking.</i>

287
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,648
<i>Oh, well.</i>

288
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,323
<i>"I will be waiting for you in Manhattan.</i>

289
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,018
<i>I will wait for you forever.</i>

290
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:09,482
<i>Please, please, find me.</i>

291
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:11,623
<i>I will also try to find you."</i>

292
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,908
Manhattan, she says.
That's too large a scale.

293
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:18,338
Besides, I never told her my name.

294
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,302
Well, it will have to wait until after
I've fulfilled my duties to the Gandor brothers,

295
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,222
but I'll find you. I promise.

296
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,888
That makes a whole lot of children
that have been saved, Miria!

297
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,855
From harmful radio waves, huh, Isaac?

298
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:15,048
Yeah! According to
the British <i>Sun</i> or <i>Nature</i>, whichever it was,

299
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:18,468
conversation is disappearing among families
because of radio waves from cell phones.

300
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:22,388
Children are involved in gaming,
fathers find outside lovers,

301
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,905
and mothers are going off to work.

302
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,615
It's the breakdown of the family, huh?

303
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,677
Yeah! And so, we're going to stop it!

304
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,955
And fight child depopulation, huh?

305
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,698
By the way, Miria...

306
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,752
What, Isaac?

307
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,328
I've got this feeling,
like we haven't aged at all.

308
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:44,716
Am I imagining things?

309
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,895
You're right!

310
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,037
Miria!

311
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,899
Isaac!

312
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,722
I don't know why this has happened to us,

313
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:08,478
but does this mean that
we are being constantly reborn anew?!

314
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:11,688
Refreshed!
Like every day is our birthday, huh?

315
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,608
Okay then, we have to celebrate!

316
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,898
Let's call everyone over,
and have a party, every day!

317
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:21,169
Wow, Isaac! Happy birthday!
