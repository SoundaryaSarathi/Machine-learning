1
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:07,752
Tomoyo-chan!

2
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:12,760
Are you okay?

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:14,829
It’s coming!

4
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:20,470
This is…!

5
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:34,612
[Sakura and the Last Clow Card]

6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,629
This is the card, Earthy.

7
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,463
You guys okay?

8
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,025
Both of you all right?

9
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:55,970
We’re okay.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,247
Mizuki-sensei!

11
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,246
There’s no damage around
where she’s standing at all.

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,218
Why?

13
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,928
Use magic!

14
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:22,789
But in such a place…

15
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,175
Sakura-chan!

16
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,470
Sakura-chan!

17
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:39,980
Use the Key!

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,374
But Yukito-san!

19
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:42,749
Use the Sleep card!

20
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,022
Release!

21
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,540
Sleep!

22
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,149
Tsukishiro-san!

23
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,026
How do I stop the earthquake?

24
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,071
You gotta seal Earthy.

25
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,563
I gotta do something!

26
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,209
I decided for myself that
I’d gather all the Clow Cards!

27
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,676
I gotta do something!

28
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,945
I’ll get in the air
and see what I can do.

29
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,950
Li-kun, I’ll leave the others to you.

30
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,648
Gotcha.
Thanks.

31
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,087
Fly!

32
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,198
Here I go.

33
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,400
Be… Be careful.

34
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,608
– Sakura…
– Okay.

35
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:18,912
Sakura-chan…

36
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,045
She’ll be all right,

37
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,018
Is this all Earthy’s good work?

38
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:29,856
Sakura…

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,822
Of all the scattered Clow Cards,

40
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,990
Earthy is the last one.

41
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,555
So if I get this one,

42
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,459
all the Clow Cards would be captured!

43
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:40,433
That’s as far as the cards go…

44
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,629
Kero-chan?

45
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,181
At this rate,
the whole town would be ruined!

46
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,356
Is this the disaster

47
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:05,652
that is caused by the broken seal?

48
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,927
No, the disaster isn’t
something that ordinary.

49
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,465
I told you at the beginning,

50
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,859
it’s not something like
blasting away the earth.

51
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:14,829
Then, this is…

52
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,871
This is all the good work of Earthy .

53
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,404
What should I do?

54
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,168
First, look for its true form!

55
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:34,484
That’s the true form of Earthy.

56
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,022
Watery!

57
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,197
It went back to its old form!

58
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:02,415
Alright!

59
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,593
Thanks.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,492
Kero-chan, you okay?

61
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,301
Earthy can’t be
defeated by attack magic.

62
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:22,603
I can’t deal with that.

63
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,076
What should I do?

64
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,402
You must think of a way
to seal the last card

65
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,505
by yourself.

66
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,049
Me… by myself…

67
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,051
It’s coming!

68
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:43,824
Jump!

69
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:58,570
What can I do to turn
Earthy back to its true form?

70
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,248
As I thought…

71
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,343
There’s no damage around where
Mizuki-sensei is standing after all.

72
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,849
What’s the matter?

73
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,822
The trees don’t fall…

74
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,329
Nothing’s happening
where the trees are…

75
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:31,663
Could it be…

76
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,635
Sakura!

77
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,404
What are you gonna do?!

78
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,203
I’ll try capture the card!

79
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,382
But if you use the wrong card…

80
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:42,916
Let me try it!

81
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,883
I decided for myself that
I’d gather all the Clow Cards!

82
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:47,849
This is the last one!

83
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,355
Sakura… All right, I’ll go with ya!

84
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,691
– Let’s go, Kero-chan!
– Okay!

85
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,511
Tree! Grow dense

86
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,108
and become my aid!

87
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,148
Wood!

88
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,399
Does it work?

89
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,308
No…?

90
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,311
Now!

91
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,013
Return to thy form
which thou should be!

92
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,550
Clow Card!

93
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,530
Earthy … I did it!

94
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,232
What?

95
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,444
Kero-chan?

96
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:45,198
Wh… Who… are you?

97
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,409
It… It’s me! It’s me!

98
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:49,644
Kerberos!

99
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,278
Kero-chan?

100
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:54,076
You mean, this is your true form?

101
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:55,481
That’s right.

102
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,911
Because you captured
all the Clow Cards.

103
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,221
Thanks, Sakura.

104
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:07,522
But this doesn’t feel
like Kero-chan at all.

105
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:09,323
You look pretty cool.

106
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,565
I wasn’t in time.

107
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,835
If the last card

108
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,070
wasn’t Earthy,

109
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,339
I would’ve been able
to regain my shape earlier.

110
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,876
I wasn’t of any help at all…

111
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:23,777
Don’t say that!

112
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,976
Because you were with me,

113
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,544
I was able to capture Earthy!

114
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,216
Because you’re always nearby,

115
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,119
I was able to turn all
of them back to card form.

116
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:33,919
Besides,

117
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,094
I was the one who scattered
all the cards at the beginning…

118
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,020
– Sakura… 
– Thanks, Kero-chan.

119
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,194
After this, there’s
only one person left…

120
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:57,477
Yue…

121
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,176
Tomoyo-chan!

122
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:08,889
Sakura-chan!

123
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:11,594
Are you okay?

124
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,492
Look! The last card!

125
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:15,957
All the cards have been captured!

126
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,631
This is wonderful!

127
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,539
– Who is this?
– Not again…

128
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,847
This is very cute!

129
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,987
Why do I have to get changed?

130
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,250
Today is the special day

131
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,452
for the completion
of the gathering of the Clow Cards!

132
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,822
When you do something special,
you must wear something special.

133
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,030
This is a must for filming
on a special day like this!

134
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,228
And so you called the van over?

135
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:56,764
Of course!

136
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,274
And on the way here,
we stopped by Li-kun’s,

137
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,238
and brought his costume here as well!

138
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,242
There, there, there, there.

139
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,843
This is the special filming of the two

140
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,582
who have all the Clow Cards.

141
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,692
But I’m glad that

142
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,018
all the cards have been gathered.

143
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:22,941
I guess so. And by the way,
good job.

144
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,440
Thanks!

145
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,962
Sakura-chan’s smile is so wonderful!

146
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,640
But Kerberos doesn’t seem happy at all.

147
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,574
Li-kun, do you know about Yue?

148
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,576
The other guardian of the Clow Cards.

149
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,086
The one who rules the Sun, Kerberos…

150
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,185
the Beast of the Seal,

151
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,251
and the one who rules the Moon, Yue…

152
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,453
the Judge.

153
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,796
They are the ones Clow Reed
created to guard the Clow Cards.

154
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,727
Like what things
does the Judge determine?

155
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,502
I don’t know.

156
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,628
As far as Yue goes,

157
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,132
none of Clow’s existing magic books

158
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,906
has described in detail.

159
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,109
You have the book that
stores the cards, right?

160
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,516
The golden beast on the front cover

161
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,675
is Kerberos.

162
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,280
And the moon
on the back cover is Yue.

163
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,686
There’s no moon
at the back of the book.

164
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,388
Then, like Kerberos,

165
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,458
Yue probably obtained
a physical body too…

166
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,229
Oh right!

167
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,273
Have you written your name
on the card yet?

168
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,237
No, not yet.

169
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,407
Then, right away, please do so!

170
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,814
Sakura. After you write your name,

171
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,390
all the cards are sealed away.

172
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:01,864
I believe you can accomplish anything.

173
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,732
Kero-chan?

174
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,675
– What’s the matter?
– I’ll write it now.

175
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,110
By the way,
Sakura-chan has some of the cards,

176
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,880
while Li-kun has the rest.

177
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:26,944
In this case,

178
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,551
who is the real owner
of the Clow Cards?

179
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,992
We’ll know very soon,

180
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,286
when he shows himself.

181
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,005
This is the Last Judgment.

182
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:10,154
Yukito-san!

183
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,774
Who is it…?

184
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,878
Yue.

185
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,509
Yue?

186
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,945
We would love to
have you be our Mistress.

187
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,814
But Yue will be the Last Judgment.

188
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,719
Good luck to you.

189
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,554
Yue?!

190
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,030
Excuse me… “Yue”…?!

191
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,602
Yue is close to you.

192
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,840
This is… Yue…

193
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,443
Then where is Yukito-san?

194
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,384
Tsukishiro-kun was Yue.

195
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,979
It has been a while, Kerberos.

196
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:42,715
I was careless.

197
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,657
The guardian of the Clow Card

198
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,695
had gotta be near
the owner of the cards.

199
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,590
You’ve been close
to Sakura for a long time,

200
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,229
being a friend of her brother.

201
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,005
Before you returned
to your original shape,

202
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,202
you hid all the aura of your power.

203
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:00,998
As Sakura and the brat

204
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:02,436
gathered the cards one by one,

205
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,836
I regained my magic bit by bit.

206
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,147
I sure sensed the aura of the Moon.

207
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,755
But… This lady has such
strong powers of the Moon with her,

208
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,218
so strong that I was deluded by it.

209
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,557
Even if you haven’t hidden your aura,

210
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,490
I might not even sense it…

211
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,763
Created alongside
by Clow Reed as a pair,

212
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,934
the other guardian of the Clow Cards…

213
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,462
…Yue, which means Moon in Chinese…

214
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,833
You know about him too, don’t you?

215
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,838
I was drawn to him during
the archery competition.

216
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,112
Yes, I know.

217
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,913
Wait a second, I don’t get it at all.

218
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:42,351
What’s all this?

219
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,745
The same as Kerberos.

220
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,019
Without enough magic,

221
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,884
I cannot regain my original shape.

222
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,187
Then, Tsukishiro-san is…

223
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,392
The false form of the other guardian?

224
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,230
This is the first time
I meet you in this shape.

225
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,929
The candidate chosen
by Kerberos the Appointer,

226
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,037
as Mistress of the Clow Cards.

227
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,929
Yukito-san…

228
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:08,539
But there is another who has
also obtained the Clow Cards.

229
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:15,082
Unable even to gather
all the Clow Cards by one person,

230
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,447
the Last Judgment is meaningless.

231
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,551
That’s not true.

232
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:22,188
I believe Sakura
can accomplish anything.

233
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,789
You are overly optimistic as ever.

234
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,954
You too, bad-tempered as ever.

235
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,728
Then, shall we begin… the Last Judgment.

236
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,568
What’s going on?

237
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,481
All the cards are gathered, right?

238
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,108
Doesn’t that stop the disaster
from happening already?

239
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,218
What’s this Last Judgment all about?!

240
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:53,722
That is…

241
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,022
First…

242
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,659
Li-kun!

243
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:04,226
Watch out! Li-kun!

244
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,107
I, Yue the Judge,

245
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,871
Shall conduct the Last Judgment.

246
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,843
With all the Clow Cards you have,

247
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:26,751
defeat me.

248
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,395
Li-kun!

249
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,463
What?! What’s this!

250
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:42,671
Li-kun!

251
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,703
No one can interfere

252
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:46,706
in the Last Judgment.

253
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,208
No way!

254
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,077
God of Fire, descend!

255
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,380
Did that work?

256
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,278
Things such as that cannot defeat me.

257
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,385
Dammit! Wind…

258
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,194
Useless!

259
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:31,219
It surprises me that you obtain
Clow Cards with such level of magic.

260
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:35,950
Time!

261
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,764
Wh… Where?

262
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,325
Time is a card that serves under me.

263
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,767
This is the end.

264
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,143
Li-kun!
Brat!

265
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,914
Li-kun! Li-kun!

266
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:07,484
All my cards were taken…

267
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,816
Li-kun!

268
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:16,190
Watch out. He is really powerful.

269
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,524
Next is the proper candidate.

270
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,171
Sakura-chan!

271
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,248
It’s the same… Same as the dream…

272
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,256
Cards created by Clow,

273
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,328
There is one who desires worthy
of becoming your Mistress.

274
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,840
Chosen by Kerberos the Appointer,

275
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:35,637
A girl named Sakura.

276
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,846
To find if this girl truly qualifies
to become our Mistress,

277
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:46,214
I, Yue the Judge,

278
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,456
shall conduct the Last Judgment.

279
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,556
The Last Judgment…?
