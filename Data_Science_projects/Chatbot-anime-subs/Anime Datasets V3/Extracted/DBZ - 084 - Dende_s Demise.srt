00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,390
"The Death of Dende... Come Forth! Intense,
Wide-open Power!"

2
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,390
That's Freeza's true self? He's smaller, more
simple-looking, and less formidable...

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,100
He's become an excellent example of why
you don't judge another's ability by
outward appearances!

4
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,630
Everything he's looked like up until now
has been cute by comparison!

5
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,800
D- Damn it to hell!

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,080
After all the trouble you went through to
revive me with the Dragonballs! I'm sorry...

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,850
There's simply no way I can save the rest
of you now. Damn...

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,750
Piccolo-san...

9
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,100
Freeza, you've finally shown your true form,
have you?

10
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,180
Even supposing Son Goku recovers,

11
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,580
Freeza now has the power to destroy the
universe as we know it.

12
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,150
This could be the point of no return!

13
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,200
How can this be? Freeza's Ki has risen
once again!

14
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,070
Dammit...

15
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,080
"Bang."

16
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,440
What?

17
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,460
Dende!!

18
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,270
I didn't see it coming! A- All I saw was some
kind of flash!

19
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,440
T- That's not possible!

20
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,620
Now, there will be no more revivals.

21
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,090
Dende...

22
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Someone just died. Who was it? Damn!
I can't tell what's going on any more!

23
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,120
Dende's been... k- Killed...

24
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,450
H- He...

25
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,900
He saw that we were being revived by
that Namekian...

26
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,060
That's why he was first...

27
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,070
Damn you...

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,070
H- He vanished!

29
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
Y- You fool!

30
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,750
J- Just where...

31
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,420
Over here!

32
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,760
How did he... ?

33
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,480
I made you a promise, didn't I?

34
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,010
To show you a terror even greater
than Hell's.

35
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,110
However, for that Namekian child there to
not be able to experience this...

36
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,880
it seems a shame, doesn't it?

37
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,560
I'll just have to let you guys take his share.

38
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,070
You bastard!

39
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,790
Take this!

40
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
You're not getting away!

41
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,160
Did you get him?

42
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,710
H- He's vanished again.

43
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,280
T- That's impossible!

44
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,920
You ignorant fools!

45
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,820
He's behind you!

46
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,780
What!?

47
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,110
As he said...

48
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,900
Get out of the way!

49
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,610
Worthless idiot!

50
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,590
O- Once again...

51
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,890
I couldn't see... him move... or attack...

52
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,040
But he... Vegeta saw it!

53
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,840
Why? Have his abilities gone up that much!?

54
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,910
Thanks!

55
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,910
You saved me.

56
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,920
You've got it all wrong. I didn't do it
to save you.

57
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,060
I thought I'd show you guys something good.

58
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,920
S- Something good?

59
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,650
Don't tell me you... you think you
can beat him?

60
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,890
You might say that.

61
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,210
You can't possibly...

62
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,790
You guys are in our way.
Pull back and watch very closely!

63
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,740
Such confidence, Vegeta. Or perhaps you're
so frightened, something has snapped?

64
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,570
You just keep on smirking like that, while
you still can.

65
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,910
What stands before you...

66
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,120
is that...

67
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,820
which you fear most!

68
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,080
A Super Saiyan!

69
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,590
Super Saiy... an?

70
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,100
What's this "Super Saiyan" business
he's talking about?

71
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,780
As always, your jokes go too far.

72
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:35,120
In that case, I'll show you the abilities I
possess, now that I have become
a Super Saiyan!

73
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,850
Is this Ki Vegeta's? He's had an
incredible power-up!

74
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,590
A- Awesome!

75
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,880
What's this? Why is he so powered-up?

76
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,200
It's like he's a different person!
What the hell happened to him?

77
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,110
W- When a Saiyan recovers from near-death,
their power goes up several times over!

78
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,570
What!?

79
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Gohan, let's put our money on Vegeta,
and take shelter for now.

80
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,530
Right!

81
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,000
You know, to think that suddenly, someone
could have achieved this much of
a power-up...

82
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,880
You can see it for yourself. This is exactly
why Vegeta purposely came close to dying,

83
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,810
then got himself revived by Dende.

84
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,890
S- So that's what he was doing, huh?
He was right...

85
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,350
And now, Vegeta really is incredible!
With any luck, he might actually take Freeza!
Right, Gohan!?

86
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,080
W- What? What happened?

87
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,900
They're both the same as they were before.
What...

88
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,930
No, they aren't, Gohan. Try sensing
Vegeta's Ki. It's calm now, but
unbelievably huge!

89
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,620
Incredible! I can't believe his Ki is so full!

90
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,880
Yeah. Vegeta really might be able to beat
Freeza at this point.

91
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm supposed to think that somehow you've
powered up quite a bit.

92
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,440
You dare say! Just be grateful you don't have
a Scouter with you!

93
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,580
If your Scouter were to read my battle rating
now, you would run away from here in tears!

94
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,060
The reason being, my power has now become
even greater than yours!

95
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,500
Brace yourself, Freeza. This time, for sure,
you are going to meet your end!

96
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,160
What's the matter? Are you too frightened to
say anything? Well, Freeza-san?

97
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,740
Okay, okay. I get you, I get you.

98
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,680
If you mean everything you said, then I've
decided to see for myself the power of this
so-called, legendary Super Saiyan,

99
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,150
the strongest warrior in history.

100
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,940
Don't you mock me!

101
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,900
I see you!

102
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,120
Kakarrot won't even get a turn!

103
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,910
l- Incredible!

104
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,190
He's completely got Freeza on the run!

105
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,920
No!

106
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,920
V- Vegeta's... h- Had it!

107
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,590
P- Piccolo-san...

108
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,880
What's the matter, Freeza!? You can't defeat
me by running away!

109
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,950
What? L- It can't be! Where is he?

110
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,630
There's no way I... a Super Saiyan like me
could have lost sight of him!

111
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,560
What!?

112
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,230
Im... possible...

113
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,880
I raise my speed in earnest for just a
moment, and you can't keep up, can you?

114
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,910
And you call yourself a Super Saiyan?

115
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,250
l- It can't be...

116
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,830
How can he toy with Vegeta, with all his
power and speed?

117
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,930
He really is an unthinkable beast after all!

118
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,940
F- Father!

119
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,440
A little longer... a little bit longer, and I will
have recovered!

120
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,780
Overwhelming speed and power-

121
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,950
and yet, it's still not enough to match
Freeza's ultimate power?

122
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,890
What will be the fate of Vegeta, now that he
has been shown his limits?
