1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,000
The strawberry glasses were still
being sold at the 100 yen store.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,840
But when I thought about how
importantly Hachi treated them

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,640
without buying any spares,

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,770
the cut on my left cheek that
I don't even remember getting

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,980
started hurting like hell.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,870
Blinking eyes call the wind

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:46,510
A smile clears all the noise away

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,070
The angel in your eyes whispers

9
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,250
"Everything begins now"

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,490
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

11
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,290
It's like being caught in a wave

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,460
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,930
Breath held, arms reaching out

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,170
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,810
You're the only one I can see

16
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,750
Baby my wish on a wing

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,720
This sky is torn

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,120
By a single overflowing word

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,650
That will be 105 yen.

20
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,810
Tonight, I'll return home
and apologize to Hachi.

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,660
Thank you very much.

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,960
The glass probably broke.

23
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,930
I can't remember,
but I think that's what happened.

24
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,830
It's also a mystery how
I ended up at Ren's place

25
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,270
when I was trying to be careful
not to cause a scandal...

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,140
...but I'm just glad I didn't wake up
in Yasu's room.

27
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,080
I can't rely on
Yasu's kindness anymore.

28
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,450
Because Yasu isn't mine.

29
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,660
Reira, I'm sorry, but I've gotta
get back to work right away.

30
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,860
Sorry.

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,930
I'll come home as soon as I can.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,870
Can you be here on
your own until then?

33
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,480
I'm locking the door behind me.
Don't open the door for anyone.

34
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,070
I'm sorry, Yasu,
to call you outta the blue like this.

35
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,270
I couldn't think of anyone else
I could depend on.

36
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,180
I ran away from the recording.

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,520
Takumi said he's getting married,
and I couldn't bring myself to sing.

38
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,050
But I don't know where to go.

39
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,800
No matter where I go,
I feel like everyone's watching me.

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,570
I'm scared.

41
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,100
If people found out that I ran away
from a recording,

42
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,840
they'd be disappointed in me.

43
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,640
The staff, and the fans, .,

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,220
They'd ditch me, saying I'm finished.
But I can't sing.

45
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,710
What am I to do?

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm worthless unless I sing.

47
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,380
I just heard back from Mr. Takeda!

48
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,010
She didn't go back to
the hotel either!

49
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,040
She left with her stuff, right?

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,550
Did you try calling her cell phone?

51
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,720
Several times, but she won't answer.

52
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,920
But why did she run away like that?

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,530
She was all excited until a bit earlier,
saying she's gonna sell a million copies.

54
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,600
Does anyone have any clue
where else she might've gone?

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,970
I was transferred here recently,

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,230
so there's still much I don't know
about Reira's private life.

57
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,240
Maybe she went to her secret lover!

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,410
IGNORED
Maybe she went to her secret lover!

59
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,440
IGNORED

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
IGNORED
Come to think of it,
does she have any close friends?

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,440
Come to think of it,
does she have any close friends?

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
I haven't a clue. Don't ask me.

63
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,150
But Takumi, you and Reira have been
friends since you were kids, right?

64
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,650
So what?

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,580
Nothing.

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,190
What should we do, Takumi?

67
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,330
Should we proceed with
recording anyway?

68
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,030
With all this commotion around us,
we can't concentrate.

69
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,720
We can't do it.

70
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,870
I guess.

71
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,300
It's okay, Mari.
Your job is to take care of Reira,

73
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,740
so just worry about Reira and
not about anything else.

74
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,950
Okay.

75
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,080
If you understand that,
then go find her and drag her back!

76
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,420
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Don't cry Mari. That guy is scary.
I'm scared of him, too.

78
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,240
Drinking on the job?

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,550
It's water!

80
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,680
If work is that important to you,
don't go saying something

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,850
that would upset our songstress
before the recording.

82
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,690
If it's to test her professionalism,

83
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,090
you're being too much
of an evil coach.

84
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,900
I don't know
what you're talking about.

85
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,830
Don't try to act stupid!
You know Reira's in love with you.

86
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,100
Don't put it so simply!

87
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,410
Years of acting like I didn't know
just went down the drain!

88
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,670
Acting like you don't know
won't solve the problem.

89
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,140
If you get married,

90
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,240
Reira might not be able to
sing anymore, y'know.

91
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,580
If me getting married means
she's gonna stop singing,

92
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,750
then we have big problems.

93
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,660
I have no feelings of love for her.
I can't help it.

94
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,660
Well, I guess.

95
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,590
But if Reira won't sing,
Trapnest is finished.

96
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,260
I know that!
So what do you want me to do?!

97
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,010
If the lord showed a little more love,
the princess might wanna sing.

98
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you telling me to do it
with Reira?!

99
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,640
She's like a little sister to me!
There's no way I could do that!

100
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,150
But you're not a blood relative.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,950
That's not the point!

102
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,890
But you've always been the type
to do whatever it takes

103
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,260
to achieve your objectives.

104
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,890
Compared to marrying an ordinary girl
who's only after your money,

105
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,700
you'll end up with a larger castle with
a marriage of convenience to Reira.

106
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,200
CASTLE?!
- Castle?
- It fits.

107
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,530
I never knew you were

108
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,010
FROM THE EDO PERIOD?
so ambitious.

109
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,200
I'd never do such a thing.
I'm just suggesting a way of living

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,650
for someone as greedy
and brutal as you.

111
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,040
What's that supposed to mean?!

112
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,580
Don't try to act like
you are a good person!

113
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,350
You're the man who abandoned
your woman and friends!

114
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,650
You even sold your soul,
all for your own success!

115
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,290
Although I'm the one who bought it.

116
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,390
My soul?

117
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,160
You were a punk rocker to the core.

118
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,360
You were coolest when you could play
whatever you wanted in a small hut.

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,200
Although you still...
are a pretty cool guy...

120
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,040
...like some orthodox hero.

121
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,540
I wanna hear Ren Honjo's soul shout!

122
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,390
But don't you think it's funny?

123
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,120
The bigger the castle gets,
the more confining it feels?

124
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,190
Before I knew it,
I had locked my cute little sister

125
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,290
in the top of the high tower.

126
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,140
Even though I can't love her.

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,670
That's the greatest sin of my life.

128
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,580
But she only knows how to sing,
and nothing else.

129
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,910
And I can't turn back now.

130
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,730
If only there were a prince who'd
climb up that tower to hold her.

131
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,010
Turn off your phone at least
when we're recording!

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,020
AN ANIME SONG
RINGTONE?
But we're not recording.

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,450
Yeah, but at least have it on silent.

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,850
Hello, darling! No, that's okay.

135
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,760
The Lord is in a foul mood,
so we're not getting any work done.

136
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,020
He's right beside me.

137
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,430
Who is it?!

138
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,160
The former prince.
Though he's bald.

139
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,540
Um, excuse me.
You're Takumi from Trapnest, right?

140
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm a huge fan of yours!
Can I shake your hand?

141
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,610
Thank you so much!

142
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,690
Who's that, Mommy?
Someone who sings songs?

143
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,730
Someone who plays instruments.

144
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,160
Wasn't that great?

145
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Sorry. Causing you trouble
at a busy time for you.

146
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,310
Reira will hate me again
for doing this.

147
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,330
But for her to say she's worthless
unless she sings?

148
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,590
I didn't break up with her
so I could hear her say such things.

149
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,830
Do something about it.

150
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,860
If that's how you feel,
then you do something about it.

151
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,970
Being the hated one
is my exclusive right.

152
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,470
Yasu, you traitor!

153
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,880
- That baldie!
- Reira, please calm down!

154
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,350
It's all right! I won't take you back!

155
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,480
The recording has been postponed!

156
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,260
Takumi asked that you be given time off
until you're ready to sing again.

157
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,100
He went and talked to the president
about this himself.

158
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,790
We'll have to rearrange the schedule,
but at the very least,

159
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,570
you will be able to take off
this entire week

160
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,040
that was set aside for recording.

161
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,170
Isn't that great?
Takumi may say some harsh things,

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,870
but he certainly thinks
about you, Reira.

163
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,810
You're wrong, Mari.

164
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,810
Huh?

165
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,820
Takumi has abandoned me.

166
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,090
He doesn't need a singer
who runs away from her job!

167
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,260
What are you saying?!
I'm sure that's not true!

168
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,470
I'm sorry Mari.

169
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,300
I'll return to the studio right away,
so let everyone know.

170
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,480
But you couldn't possibly sing
in this condition.

171
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,910
Please! Don't take away
my chance to sing!

172
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,410
Singing is all I've got.

173
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,360
This restaurant pisses me off.
Don't play Trapnest songs.

174
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,960
Play some Enka!

175
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,730
You're ruining our ramen noodles,
old man!

176
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,860
I'm sorry!
We'll eat quickly and leave.

177
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,440
It's only natural that the radio
would play what's popular.

178
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,140
Besides, it's a song Ren wrote.
You should like it.

179
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,240
This isn't Ren's.

180
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,050
But more importantly,
you need to see a doctor.

181
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,840
A doctor?

182
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,590
Memory loss isn't normal at all.
I'll come with you.

183
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,640
No way!

184
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,820
You know, you've been rude lately,
telling me I'm strange.

185
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,290
But you were saying that yourself, too.

186
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,150
You could have
some kinda brain disease.

187
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,790
You should get it checked.

188
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,740
I'm fine. Darn.
I shouldn't have told you.

189
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,040
Annoying, annoying, annoying!

190
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,410
Thanks for the meal.

191
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,470
Now, I'll listen to your whining
as I promised.

192
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,070
It's all right.

193
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,540
If I tell you, you might just
rub salt in the wound.

194
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,550
I wanna hear it!

195
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,850
How could things have come
to this in one day?!

196
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,160
Come to this?

197
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,550
Don't you know?
What the hell have you been doing?

198
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,630
What about you?!

199
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,290
Where have you been hiding
since last night?!

200
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,030
At such an important time for Hachi!
That's so cold of you!

201
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,000
As a friend,

202
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,540
shouldn't you have gone straight to her
and heard what she had to say?

203
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,200
She would only cry
and apologize to me.

204
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,210
She wouldn't tell me anything.

205
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,380
So you went.

206
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,880
You two are both women.

207
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,850
She might've opened up and talked
to you about her true feelings.

208
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
But when I went back this morning,

209
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,220
Hachiko wouldn't say
a word to me either!

210
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,420
She had Takumi do all the talking.

211
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,920
What did he say?

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,200
It's okay. Tell me.
Nothing will shock me anymore.

213
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,480
He said they're getting married.

214
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,940
You ARE shocked!
Of course you are!

215
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,280
It makes no sense, right?!

216
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,420
I'm sorry, Nobu.
Are you all right?

217
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,620
Well, ah... yeah.

218
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,830
I sorta knew it was over from
the way Nana was acting yesterday.

219
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,300
"Nana"?

220
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:24,080
After all, it's Takumi she loves.
I knew that from the beginning.

221
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,210
But you called her Hachi
in front of everyone.

222
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,120
But I'm part of this, so why am I
on the outside of the fence?

223
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,550
Am I that unreliable to her?

224
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,000
It's okay to cry, Nobuo!

225
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,030
Cry on my shoulder!

226
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,330
What are you doing?!

227
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,280
This is no time to be embarrassed!
It's just between us.

228
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,670
But people are staring...

229
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,180
So what?! You're too short
to be acting cool anyway!

230
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,340
Don't call me short!
At least I'm taller than you!

231
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,390
I know that!

232
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,010
I also know that you've got a heart
way bigger than mine!

233
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,750
Before I met you, I hated everyone!

234
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,430
I couldn't trust anybody!

235
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,860
But then when I met you,

236
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,420
I felt for the first time that this world
isn't all that bad after all!

237
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,900
Terashima. Thanks for these.

238
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,810
You are not unreliable, Nobu.

239
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,780
Don't get down on yourself just
because some girl dumped you.

240
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,190
Your spikes are digging
into my neck.

241
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,460
Nobu's shoulders are way scrawnier
than Ren's,

242
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,900
but they weren't shaking.

243
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,260
I was offering him my shoulder,

244
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,740
but ended up borrowing his instead.

245
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,350
I owe Nobu so much.

246
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,160
So I really can't make up
with Hachi.

247
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,530
I'll take the strawberry glass
to Ren's place.

248
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,360
WEEKLY SEARCH MAGAZINE
EDITING DEPT.
I can't use this!

249
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,770
How could you stick with them
for a full month

250
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,500
and not get a shot of them together?!

251
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,570
Because they're on
completely different schedules,

252
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,340
and never leave
the place together, you see!

253
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,540
Don't "you see" me!

254
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,550
You probably did something
to make them cautious.

255
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,910
All of you!

256
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,990
Idiots!

257
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,490
Let's just give up on that idea

258
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,120
and write an article using
two different shots.

259
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,520
I'm not compromising.

260
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,860
You want someone else beating us
to the story?

261
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,370
Kurata. Fly to their hometown
immediately.

262
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,760
Huh?

263
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,440
Trapnest is recording in the studio
every day this week.

264
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,700
Following them won't do us any good.

265
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,330
CONFIDENTIAL
In the meantime,

266
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,710
gather everything you can on Ren Honjo
and Nana Osaki's backgrounds.

267
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,880
What a drag.

268
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,650
Gaia seems to be reluctant about
giving BLAST their debut,

269
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,020
but this'll make
the greatest "Battle of the Bands."

270
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,780
I'll create a huge festival for you

271
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,420
and bring you onto the same stage
as Trapnest in a heartbeat.

272
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,020
You should thank me, Nana Osaki.

273
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,730
The curtains are about to rise
on your fateful game.

274
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,100
Miss Komatsu. Registered mail for you!

275
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,350
MISS NANA KOMATSU,
THANK YOU FOR CONSULTING WITH
OUR FIRM. WE'VE GATHERED SOME
LISTINGS OF PROPERTIES THAT FIT
THE CONDITIONS YOU NOTED
THE OTHER DAY. PLEASE REVIEW
THE MATERIAL. IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO VIEW ANY OF THE PROPERTIES,
PLEASE CONTACT ME AT
THE NUMBER BELOW. I LOOK

276
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,350
MONTHLY RENT 1,000,000 YEN

277
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,230
You know, Hachi...
I was hostile towards Trapnest

278
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,170
because I was envious of Reira
for stealing Ren's heart,

279
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,230
not as a woman but as a singer.

280
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,530
I only wanted Ren to notice me more.

281
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,570
I never wanted to
make them my enemy.

282
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,140
It's so moving, isn't it?

283
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,580
This'll sell way more than a million.

284
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,850
How much harder are you gonna
push her until you're satisfied?

285
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

286
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,460
At least let me accompany her
with my guitar.

287
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,630
Since I can't hug her.

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,480
But ever since that day when
you were taken away from me,

289
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,880
I couldn't help but feel
the need to defeat them.

290
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,950
I wanted you back... no matter what.

291
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:14,230
I can't count
how many nights

292
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,000
I wished tomorrow
would never come

293
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:25,770
To live as I am
without being fake

294
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,370
What do I need

295
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,520
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

296
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,690
The answer is
too close to see

297
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,930
Black tears are
falling down

298
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,870
I have nothing,
only sadness

299
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,970
I can't put it
into words

300
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,040
My whole body
starts to ache

301
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,460
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
