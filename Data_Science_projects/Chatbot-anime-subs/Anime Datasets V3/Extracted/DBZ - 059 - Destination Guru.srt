00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,677
W- what!? What was that!?

2
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,189
I've found you!

3
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,191
V- V- V-...

4
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,628
How dare you make
a mockery of me!

5
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:23,304
Where is the Dragon Ball!?

6
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,647
There.

7
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,548
Where is it!?

8
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,890
I- I told you...
it's right there.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,656
If you won't tell me,
then I'll just have to do this!

10
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,998
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>l've</i> been <i>telling you, haven't l?</i>

11
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,904
It's there! It's there!
Why don't you get it!?

12
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,668
It's there, I tell you!

13
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:02,169
It was a dream, huh?

14
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,470
<i>Damn it...</i>

15
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:33,812
<i>lf the device that kid was holding</i>

16
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:38,216
<i>really is something that</i>
<i>can seek out Dragon Balls,</i>

17
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:42,220
<i>then I can't be careless</i>
<i>about leaving here.</i>

18
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,223
<i>They wanted these six, too.</i>

19
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,987
<i>All I can do is wait for</i>
<i>them to make their move.</i>

20
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:18,857
<i>Freeza is starting to get</i>
<i>pretty impatient, huh?</i>

21
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:24,124
<i>That means l've destroyed the</i>
<i>spaceship's power, and he can't move.</i>

22
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:56,561
<i>Even assuming that he radioed</i>
<i>to have more Scouters brought here,</i>

23
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,230
<i>it would take three or four days</i>
<i>for them to get here, at best.</i>

24
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,167
<i>l'll have to settle</i>
<i>this before that time.</i>

25
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,170
<i>lf I can just acquire eternal</i>
<i>life with the Dragon Balls,</i>

26
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,840
<i>then depending on my strategy,</i>
<i>l'm sure I will be able to defeat Freeza.</i>

27
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,435
<i>Now, when he doesn't have</i>
<i>a Scouter, is my chance.</i>

28
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,796
That miserable Vegeta!

29
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:00,988
W- what is with all these
earthquakes lately?

30
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:16,933
That's it! I've had all I can
take of this crazy planet!

31
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:49,874
Damn, it's going to take quite a bit
of time for us to get there at this speed.

32
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:52,143
But if we use any more <i>Ki</i> than this,

33
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,880
that Vegeta bastard will find us,
no doubt about it.

34
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,151
It looked like he had
gotten even stronger.

35
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,519
Right now, even with the two of us

36
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,655
going at him together,
there's no way we could beat him.

37
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:10,261
But then, do I really have
enough power to rival Vegeta?

38
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,497
I wouldn't think so.

39
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:18,269
Well, I had <i>this</i> much latent power,
so with you having Saiyan blood,

40
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,838
I think we're okay to expect quite a lot.

41
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,772
Probably, anyway.

42
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:53,197
It's not like I have to
go in and get it, right?

43
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:55,533
Even in the water like that,
it's still right nearby,

44
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,201
the same as if it
were on shore.

45
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,139
Once Kuririn gets back,
I can just have him go get it.

46
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,697
Sure.

47
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,658
D- don't tell me it's Vegeta!

48
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:38,176
<i>What do I do? lf Si Xing Qiu</i>
<i>falls into Vegeta's hands,</i>

49
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:43,848
<i>he'll have all seven Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>and be granted eternal life.</i>

50
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:47,018
<i>lf that happens, then no matter how</i>
<i>much training Son-kun has done,</i>

51
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,686
<i>he'll have no chance of winning.</i>

52
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,188
<i>And that's not all.</i>

53
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:53,858
<i>Yamucha and the others won't be</i>
<i>able to come back to life, either.</i>

54
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:57,528
<i>And l'll never be able</i>
<i>to return to Earth.</i>

55
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,359
<i>All right...</i>

56
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,198
Let's see, as I recall,
it was this one.

57
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:16,147
Taking the fight to Vegeta, or whoever
it is, is better than waiting around,

58
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,138
rotting away on this planet.

59
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,233
Let's see...

60
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:39,329
This is for missiles,
and this is for the laser cannon.

61
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,359
Okay...

62
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,014
There it is!

63
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:09,861
I get it. You're the culprit, huh?

64
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,625
Well then, I'm not going to hold back.

65
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,803
I did it!

66
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,310
Yahoo!

67
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,576
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

68
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,009
<i>Ha!!</i>

69
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,973
S- senzu... senzu...

70
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:47,892
Whew! I have to be more careful.
I got a glimpse of the Next World there.

71
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,895
If I'm dead, I won't be able
to train worth crap.

72
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,164
I'll be there in just over two days.

73
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:56,656
Well, I guess I should keep
at it a little longer.

74
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,833
That's a good boy.
Just stay still.

75
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,116
That's a big pearl!

76
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,630
Something like that would be...

77
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:01,831
Be a good boy there for
just a little while, okay?

78
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,779
All right...

79
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:21,117
Huh?

80
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,802
Hang on a minute!

81
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,325
There it is!

82
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,262
H- hold on, here...
What is this?

83
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,776
It's almost as though they were
imitation Dragon Balls, huh?

84
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:21,178
What in the world could this be?

85
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:25,274
In any event, the first order of business
is to get the Si Xing Qiu Ball back.

86
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:04,488
My Capsule! My escape Capsule!
It's gone... it's gone!

87
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,656
You're kidding me!

88
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:08,819
It was there just a moment ago!

89
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,266
Where is it!?
Where did it go!?

90
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,264
There it is!

91
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:42,292
It will take more than that
to defeat Bulma-<i>san</i>!

92
00:16:54,538 --> 00:17:00,306
Geez, like I've been telling you,
that's my Si Xing Qiu there, not yours!

93
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,905
They were eggs!

94
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:13,313
Watch out!

95
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,655
What are you doing!? Run!

96
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,830
I'm not doing this for you!

97
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,492
I'm doing it for the Dragon Ball!

98
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:56,356
I've had it with living like this.

99
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:02,696
Where are the other Dragon Balls?

100
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,358
Where is Vegeta?

101
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:14,211
No matter. Once you go before Freeza-<i>sama</i>,
you'll talk, whether you want to or not.

102
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:16,880
Freeza?

103
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,313
Come on!

104
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,813
<i>Bulma goes from one crisis to another.</i>

105
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:37,664
<i>And has one of the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>once again passed into Freeza's hands?</i>

106
