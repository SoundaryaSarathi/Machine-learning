1
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,922
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,796
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,906
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,199
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:14,401
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:18,480
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:22,795
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,955
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:30,118
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,959
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,165
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,900
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:41,524
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,528
I can't believe I lost him.

15
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,468
You did everything you could...

16
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,349
...and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.

17
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,684
Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.

18
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,635
Okay.

19
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:22,428
It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.

20
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,541
Yip! Yip!

21
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,936
Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you,...

22
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:59,480
...but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits.

23
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:02,444
Go... away.

24
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,029
You're still here?

25
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:07,099
Yes! I need...

26
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:13,011
Perhaps that thing will help you? Chase it!

27
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,881
Finally!

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,870
Come back!

29
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,836
Hello, Aang.

30
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,641
Roku!

31
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,785
Shelter!

32
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:14,195
Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!

33
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:17,974
The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits.

34
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:24,049
They crossed over from the Spirit World to the Mortal World very near the beginning.

35
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:29,435
There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.

36
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,281
Who?

37
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:39,310
The spirit's name is Koh. But he is very dangerous. They call him... the Face Stealer.

38
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:45,215
When you speak with him you must be very careful to show no emotion at all...

39
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:52,592
...not the slightest expression or he will steal your face!

40
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:15,026
I finally have you. But I can't get you home because of this blizzard.

41
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:18,816
There's always something. Not that you would understand.

42
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:22,767
You're like my sister. Everything always... came easy to her.

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,783
She's a firebending prodigy... and everyone adores her.

44
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:32,492
My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born.

45
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,760
I don't need luck though, I don't want it.

46
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:39,113
I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong.

47
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,567
It's made me who I am.

48
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:14,169
I don't need to remind you we have a time limit.

49
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:19,943
If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises they will be undefeatable.

50
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:23,063
I assure you I have everything under control.

51
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:26,181
I intend to remove the moon as a factor.

52
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,844
Remove the moon!? How?

53
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:31,450
Admiral Choi!

54
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,070
Prepare to meet your fate!

55
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:43,511
As I was saying... years ago I stumbled upon a great and powerful secret...

56
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:47,149
...the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form.

57
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,285
What?

58
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,319
I was a young Lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...

59
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:58,887
I discovered a hidden library, underground in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll.

60
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,345
One of them contained a detailed illustration and the words "moon" and "ocean."

61
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:10,436
I knew then that these spirits could be found... and killed.

62
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,014
And that it was my destiny to do so.

63
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,470
Zhao, the Spirits are not to be trifled with!

64
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:20,649
Yes, yes, I know you fear the Spirits, Iroh.

65
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,981
I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World.

66
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:28,910
But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world...

67
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:32,781
...and now they will face the consequences!

68
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,336
Oh! Whew! You're just a curly tailed blue nose.

69
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:04,410
Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.

70
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:21,629
Hello? I'm looking for a spirit named "Koh."

71
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,936
Welcome!

72
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,644
Thank you.

73
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:44,811
My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.

74
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,165
You know me?

75
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,726
How could I forget you!

76
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:51,919
One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me!

77
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:55,084
It was eight or nine hundred years ago.

78
00:07:55,142 --> 00:08:01,249
I didn't know that. Why did he... or I... try to kill you?

79
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:07,307
Oh... it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved...

80
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,419
Of course, that's all behind us.

81
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:20,059
Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life?

82
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,473
After all, you're a different person now. You've come to me... with a new face.

83
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,958
Guess we'll be here awhile.

84
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:40,705
Don't worry! Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.

85
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:45,185
I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.

86
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,827
They're not gonna die in this blizzard.

87
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:49,798
If we know anything it's that Zuko never gives up.

88
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,232
They'll survive... and we'll find them!

89
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:58,105
It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.

90
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,342
So... how may I help you?

91
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,900
I need to find the Moon and the Ocean.

92
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:08,082
Their spirit names are Tui and La.

93
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:15,352
Push... and Pull... and that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.

94
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:18,064
Please, help me find them.

95
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,626
An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.

96
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:28,413
Oh, you think you need their help? Actually, it's quite the other way around.

97
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,333
Someone's going to kill them!

98
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:34,867
What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?

99
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:38,428
You've already met them, actually.

100
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:42,487
Tui and La, your Moon and Ocean,...

101
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,749
...have always circled each other in an eternal dance.

102
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:51,077
They balance each other... push and pull... life and death...

103
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:57,253
...good and evil... yin... and yang.

104
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,040
The koi fish!

105
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,658
I must be going now.

106
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,411
We'll meet again.

107
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,294
The spirits are in trouble. I need to get back to the physical world.

108
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:19,987
A friend is here to guide you back.

109
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,918
Hei-Bai!

110
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:15,483
We'll be following this map to a very special location.

111
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:20,142
And when we get there... we're going fishing.

112
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:27,223
This is where I came in. But how do I get back?

113
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,096
Good riddance.

114
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:42,187
Momo!

115
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,760
Momo? Oh no! Where's my body?

116
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:57,571
Look! That's gotta be Aang! Yip! Yip!

117
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,395
Welcome back.

118
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,435
Good to be back.

119
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,649
That won't be enough to escape.

120
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,394
Appa!

121
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,451
Here for a rematch?

122
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:29,436
Trust me, Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.

123
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,366
Hey! This is some quality rope!

124
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:41,817
We need to get to the oasis! The spirits are in trouble!

125
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:48,300
Wait, we can't just leave him here.

126
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,358
Sure we can. Let's go.

127
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,856
No, if we leave him, he'll die.

128
00:12:56,852 --> 00:13:02,822
Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!

129
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,542
Are you okay?

130
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,258
I feel faint.

131
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:38,633
I feel it too.

132
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,364
The Moon Spirit is in trouble.

133
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,831
I owe the Moon Spirit my life.

134
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:44,947
What do you mean?

135
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,079
When I was born I was very sick and very weak.

136
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,549
Most babies cry when they're born...

137
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:55,460
...but I was born as if I were asleep. My eyes closed.

138
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:58,584
Our healers did everything they could.

139
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:02,329
They told my mother and father I was going to die.

140
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,761
My father pleaded with the spirits to save me...

141
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:08,189
...that night, beneath the full moon,...

142
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,834
...he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond.

143
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:17,241
My dark hair turned white, I opened my eyes and began to cry...

144
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,111
...and they knew I would live.

145
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:25,240
That's why my mother named me Yue, for the moon.

146
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:33,578
I am... a legend now! The Fire Nation will for generations tell stories about...

147
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:37,438
...the great Zhao who darkened the moon!

148
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:45,810
They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao the Moon Slayer! Zhao The Invincible!

149
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,452
Huh! Get it off! Get if off!

150
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,237
Don't bother!

151
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,412
Zhao! Don't!

152
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:09,341
It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon... and the Water Tribe.

153
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:13,148
Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe.

154
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:16,541
It will hurt everyone... including you.

155
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,930
Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance.

156
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,049
You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.

157
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,881
He is right, Zhao!

158
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:31,171
General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?

159
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:35,373
I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too.

160
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,930
We all depend on the balance.

161
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:47,514
Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold! Let it go, now!

162
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:32,038
There's no hope now. It's over.

163
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,290
No, it's not over.

164
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,379
You're alive?

165
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:55,563
You tried to have me killed!

166
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:03,340
Yes, I did. You're the Blue Spirit... and enemy of the Fire Nation!

167
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,442
You freed the Avatar!

168
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:07,740
I had no choice!

169
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:15,155
You should have chosen to accept your failure... your disgrace!

170
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:18,782
Then, at least you could have lived!

171
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:33,845
It's too late. It's dead.

172
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:41,378
You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you!

173
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:49,608
Yes, you're right. It gave me life. Maybe I can give it back.

174
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,438
No! You don't have to do that!

175
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,208
It's my duty, Sokka.

176
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:57,917
I won't let you! Your father told me to protect you!

177
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,281
I have to do this.

178
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,786
No!

179
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,780
She's gone. She's gone.

180
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:23,807
Goodbye, Sokka. I will always be with you.

181
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:04,805
It can't be!

182
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:16,332
Take my hand!

183
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,671
I've decided to go to the South Pole.

184
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:37,301
Some other benders and healers want to join me.

185
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,570
It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.

186
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:44,022
What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.

187
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:50,233
Well, then he better get used to calling you "Master Katara."

188
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:55,280
The Spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born.

189
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:02,524
I saw... a beautiful, brave young woman... become the Moon Spirit.

190
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,297
I knew this day would come.

191
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:05,661
You must be proud.

192
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:10,948
So proud. And sad.

193
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,373
I'm surprised, Prince Zuko,...

194
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:19,712
...surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.

195
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:21,083
I'm tired.

196
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:27,299
Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.

197
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:45,124
You too, Momo.

198
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,044
Come here.

199
00:22:56,887 --> 00:23:07,295
Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you.
