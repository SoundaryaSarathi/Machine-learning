1
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:09,362
This castle was built
about 450 years ago.

2
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,538
The castle is now a museum,

3
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,568
but the grand hall,

4
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:21,277
the dining room, and the bedroom
were renovated to make them
look the way they were.

5
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,477
That’s so cool!

6
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:29,884
That’s so nice.
I want to live in a big house like that.

7
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:32,655
There are a lot of problems living
in a huge house like that.

8
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:34,452
Why?

9
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,525
Can you imagine how long it will take to
simply vacuum a house like that?

10
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,797
Besides, I’m sure you’ll get so lost.

11
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:41,759
I won’t get lost!

12
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:45,637
You’re not a princess to begin with.

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,536
You don’t know that!

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,336
If I live in a place like that,
I will become like a princess!

15
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,314
You’d be the last person to do that.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,179
How come?!
How do you know something like that?!

17
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:04,517
In the meantime, a princess doesn’t
act so impolitely, you know?

18
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:08,993
You’re mean!

19
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:12,461
Touya. The bathroom is yours.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,489
Okay.

21
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:24,437
But that must be nice.

22
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:31,780
[Sakura’s Mini Great Adventure]

23
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,689
Tomorrow’s a holiday. Let’s go somewhere.

24
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:43,822
Sakura, are you sure it is okay for me
to stop by your house today?

25
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:46,395
Yeah, no problem. Come!

26
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,668
Then, I will bring a cake with me.

27
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,831
Really? I’m sure Kero will be so happy.

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,031
Really?

29
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:57,802
Because the cakes
you make are really delicious.

30
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,480
Even I always wish I could have more.

31
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:04,312
I am glad that you like them.

32
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,042
Then, I will come by once I get home.

33
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,051
Okay!

34
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:15,720
Welcome!

35
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:16,854
Hello.

36
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:18,192
Come in. Come in!

37
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,669
Touya and Father

38
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,002
are coming home late today.

39
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,873
Kero, it’s Tomoyo.

40
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:31,976
Oh! You’re here!

41
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:35,242
You are very cheerful today, Kero.

42
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:40,011
He’s been like that

43
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,442
ever since he found out
you’re bringing a cake with you.

44
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,250
What did you bring?

45
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,556
Isn’t that a strawberry cake?

46
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:53,557
It looks great!

47
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,829
Hurry! Hurry!!

48
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,864
Not yet. You have to wait
until we’re done with what she needs from me.

49
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,104
So, what is it that you want me to do?

50
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:08,909
I was hoping that I can take your
measurements again for your costumes.

51
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,017
The ones you made me
have always fitted okay.

52
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,824
But you are in a period of growth.

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,024
Sakura, could you please
lift up your arms for me?

54
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:24,427
Oh, okay.

55
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,760
Sakura, you are the cutest girl,
so I must make sure.

56
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,528
Th… Thanks.

57
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,450
As I thought,
you are just too cute!

58
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:52,623
I’m so embarrassed.

59
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,158
You must not hang your head.

60
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,326
You are the world’s
only Card Captor.

61
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,434
To be able to film you
wearing this costume…

62
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:08,867
Let’s go!

63
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,340
I would be so touched!

64
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,146
Tomoyo…

65
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,514
All right, just hurry and let me eat!

66
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,616
I thought
I sensed something just now…

67
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:27,887
I did too.

68
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,904
It’s a Clow Card.

69
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:53,543
It’s here.
Inside the house.

70
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,012
Yes.

71
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,692
Key which hides
the forces of darkness,

72
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,327
reveal thy true form before me.

73
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,369
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

74
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,164
Release!

75
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,958
Kero, stay with Tomoyo.

76
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,926
Got it.

77
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,419
Please be careful.

78
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,597
It’s from Father’s room.

79
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,364
A Clow Card?

80
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:39,049
Sakura?

81
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,795
Where… am I?

82
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:02,498
Huh?
Could I be underneath a chair?

83
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:06,508
An organ?

84
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:11,343
Did Father’s room
become this big?

85
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,248
Could this be… the Key?

86
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:25,494
Then that means… 
I’m the one who has become small?!

87
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,098
It was that Clow Card’s fault!

88
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:38,509
Kero!!

89
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,175
Tomoyo!!

90
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:43,641
Sakura!

91
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,055
Sakura’s Key?

92
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:00,929
Really!

93
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,859
Leaving something
this important behind,

94
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,727
where did she go?

95
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,633
Yo… You know, I’m not food.

96
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,783
I was saved.

97
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:00,852
These are the flowers Father planted.

98
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,959
Thank you so much, flowers.
Thank you so much, Father.

99
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:11,129
It isn’t the time for this.

100
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,136
Without my wand,
I can’t use magic.

101
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,700
I can’t seal the card either.

102
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:17,240
What should I do?

103
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,157
Stay away from me!!

104
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:46,161
Where the heck did Sakura go?

105
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:47,830
I am worried about her.

106
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,808
But I have a feeling
that she hasn’t left the house.

107
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,236
I’m back.

108
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,143
Hello!

109
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,140
Oh no. It’s the brother.

110
00:10:58,518 --> 00:10:59,507
Please hide!

111
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:00,542
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

112
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:06,250
Eh!

113
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,018
Hello. Sorry to bother you.

114
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,823
Hello.

115
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:14,162
Where’s Sakura?

116
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,426
Sh… She went out to buy something.

117
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,307
What’s she doing
leaving her friend behind.

118
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:25,643
She told me she would
be back in a short while.

119
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,343
Where the heck did you go,
Sakura?

120
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:38,817
That was scary.

121
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,306
You’re a Clow Card, aren’t you?

122
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,841
It was you who turned me
this small, wasn’t it?

123
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:07,047
I was almost eaten by
the cat and the mantis!

124
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:10,755
That is not funny!

125
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:16,156
Wait!

126
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:23,131
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do?

127
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:24,729
I’ve got no choice.

128
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,735
Tomoyo, would you like cream and sugar?

129
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:35,044
I would like just cream please.

130
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:38,775
Thank you very much.

131
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:39,710
Not at all.

132
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:46,188
That’s right. I brought a cake.

133
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:49,518
It is in Sakura’s room.
I will go get it.

134
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:57,560
I feel dizzy…

135
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:00,661
I am fine now.

136
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,486
You deserve an Oscar award.

137
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:18,618
I was nervous.

138
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,454
Then, I’ll go look for Sakura.

139
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,755
Be careful, and make sure
you do not let them see you.

140
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:26,730
Okay.

141
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,939
Our bathtub was huge.

142
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:53,355
All right!

143
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,460
Ow ow ow ow ow…

144
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,734
What’s so funny!

145
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:14,744
Wait!

146
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,080
Hold on!

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,968
Where are you going already?!

148
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:50,013
Geez…

149
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:55,977
Where the heck did
Sakura go to buy stuff?

150
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:00,689
Touya looks like a monster.

151
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:05,357
That’s right! He looks so much
more like a monster than I do!

152
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,302
Where did the Clow Card go?

153
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:19,475
Touya’s here, and I can’t get out…

154
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:22,209
What should I do?

155
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:39,162
Touya, watch out!!

156
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,433
Just now… 
I’m sure I heard Sakura’s voice.

157
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,373
That’s strange.

158
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,797
That’s impossible.
It’s too high for me.

159
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,445
What should I do?

160
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,784
If only Kero is around
at a time like this…

161
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:37,718
Kero!

162
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,224
That’s the act of Little.

163
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,062
Little? As in small?

164
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,436
Even the wand returned to the key shape.

165
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,368
Little not only made you small,

166
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,970
it weakened your magical power too.

167
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:59,974
How can I turn back to my original size?

168
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,874
If you bump into Little once again

169
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:03,772
you should turn back
to your original size.

170
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,484
I see. All right.
I gotta find Little as soon as possible!

171
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:12,651
But even if I found Little,
I don’t have the Key…

172
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,584
Tomoyo has it.

173
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:16,156
Tomoyo does?

174
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,397
I hope Sakura is all right…

175
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:49,222
Don’t!!

176
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:56,761
Sakura!

177
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,331
Tomoyo, the Key!

178
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:01,305
Ye… Yes!

179
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,512
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

180
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:14,920
reveal thy true form before me.

181
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:19,223
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

182
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:22,988
Release!

183
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,799
Return to thy form which thou should be!

184
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,964
Clow Card!

185
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:53,621
I did it! I turn back
to my original size!

186
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,669
Kero! I… I’m so sorry!

187
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:06,674
Hang in there, Kero! Kero!

188
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:13,056
Here, please help yourselves.

189
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:15,156
Let’s eat!

190
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:28,019
This is good!

191
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,164
Delicious!

192
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:30,753
I am glad.

193
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,665
Tomoyo, you’re good at cooking.

194
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,699
Thank you very much.

195
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:41,131
Sakura could never make
anything this delicious.

196
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:47,104
I can! If I learn how to make it…

197
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:49,674
It is simple.

198
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:50,941
Really?

199
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,175
Yes. Let us make one
together next time.

200
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,752
But it’s really delicious.

201
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:59,016
We have two slices left.

202
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,852
Kero’s share…

203
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:09,029
Father’s share.

204
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,535
And there’s one more left.

205
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:13,702
Um… Um… I’m eating it.

206
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,548
On… Only this much?

207
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:29,282
I’m sorry… 
Many things happened…

208
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,892
My cake… That’s right! Little !

209
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,794
Huh? Little ?

210
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,130
Lucky me!

211
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,903
I guess one can use
it like this too…

212
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:06,921
This castle is built
about 300 years ago.

213
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,250
You couldn’t say it, right?

214
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:09,455
Really.

215
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,425
What’s wrong, Sakura?

216
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,496
You’ve always like the program
about European castles.

217
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,799
You like big houses, don’t you?

218
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,645
I’ve had enough already.
