1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,290
What's going on?

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,680
W-Who are you?!

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,320
Sekirei number 02. The name is Matsu.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
Se-Sekirei?

5
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,640
Now my life is blooming then falling

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I grab destiny tight

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,050
There's no more hesitation anymore

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,650
Tying our bond

9
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,650
To the sky waiting for the dawn

10
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,490
Holding you, my love, tightly

11
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,660
I present an unbreakable prayer

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,860
We all are still in the darkness

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,500
Right now I just

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Want to touch you deep in your heart

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,670
And give you all of my overflowing passion

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,180
I spread out my wings

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,350
Toward the future of our dreams

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,680
On them are engraved

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,690
The feeling you gave me that day

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,190
The words of our oath

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,360
Will make a miracle happen

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
My pounding heart, take off now!

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,390
My wish can fly high, high up

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,110
Feather 5:
"The Water Sekirei"

25
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,080
Feather 5:
"The Water Sekirei"
I'm home!

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,110
I'm home!

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,910
Welcome back...

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,720
Oh, no! Your clothes are all torn up.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,660
Something fell down from
the sky while I was shopping.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,130
Did you get hurt?

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,290
No, and I also finished shopping... Ah!

32
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,460
I was in such a hurry I forgot
to buy daikon radishes and cabbage.

33
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm going right now!

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,740
Musubi-san, that look isn't modest.

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,240
You don't need to go shopping, so
go take a bath and change your clothes.

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,480
Minato Sahashi, 19 years old.

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,820
You're part of a family of four with
your mother, sister, and grandmother.

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
No data is available about your father.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,250
You got top grades
all through elementary,

40
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,160
junior high and high school
in your hometown.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
But you never do yourself
justice in critical situations,

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,490
and now you've failed the
university entrance exams twice.

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,160
Why do you know about me?

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,770
In short, you're what we call a wimp.

45
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,640
But you are my Ashikabi.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,670
Please cool down my
hot body with your DNA.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Huh? Is there anybody in the bath?

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,350
Minato-san!

49
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,750
Musubi-chan!

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,790
Wow! I can wash your back.

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,960
No, um, actually, uh...

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,190
Huh? Who is that?

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,790
Here you are, my enemy.

54
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,870
You came back 300 seconds
earlier than I expected.

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,600
Quite impressive...
but this is within my calculation!

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,170
Where the hell is that coming from?!

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,210
Musubi-chan!

58
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,550
Special synthetic fiber net made by MBI.

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,380
It's impossible to sever.

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,780
I can't get out!

61
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,220
I've contained the obstacle, so...

62
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,220
Now let's have love's intercourse!

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,860
No!

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,890
You don't need to be scared like that.

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,860
I'll experiment on you gently.

66
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,370
I was wondering why the bath
was noisy, so I came to take a look.

67
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,410
Illicit sexual relations in the bath
are prohibited in Maison Izumo...

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,900
Matsu-san...

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,740
Please let me introduce myself.
My name is Matsu.

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,250
She's also a resident of
Maison Izumo, and lives in room 201.

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,250
Room 201?

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,260
Well, just like this.

73
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,600
Th-There was a trick door?

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,830
Then, the ghost Ku-chan saw was...

75
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes, that was me. I'm living in hiding.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,270
How come?

77
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,280
Ah... some things
happened when I left MBI, so...

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,610
To tell the truth, I'm being chased.

79
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,880
Being chased?

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,950
As I told you before...

81
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,450
My husband never
refused anyone who came.

82
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,890
This door was also made by him as a lark.

83
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,550
As a matter of fact,
my husband was a part of MBI...

84
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,970
He got acquainted with
Matsu-san because of that.

85
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,970
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,300
Oh, not at all!

87
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,570
But since she caused such trouble...

88
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:10,810
I may have to take steps...

89
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,640
"Kick out, Kick out, Kick out..."
I may have to take steps...

90
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,940
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I will never
do it again! Forgive me, Miya-tan!

91
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,650
Do you really mean it?

92
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,950
Yes, I really, really mean it.

93
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,650
Everyone, I'm very sorry.

94
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,180
Now, please excuse me...

95
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,050
Ghost...

96
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,390
How did it go?

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,340
Me too. I looked and looked, but...
To think some ordinary passerby took him!

98
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,940
What can I say to Master?

99
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,950
A Sekirei and Ashikabi
led by their fate properly...

100
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,920
are brought together even
though they don't intend to be.

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,490
You are...

102
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,960
That's why their bond is valuable.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,890
Ignoring that and making Sekireis
emerge like they're some collection

104
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,360
is nothing but bad taste!

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,870
Mind your own business!

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,960
I know that you are a
Sekirei not yet emerged!

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do it, Akitsu!

108
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,380
The discarded number... you again.

109
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,720
I missed number 107,
but maybe I can take you instead.

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,990
Master will force you to emerge

111
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,930
and become his submissive Sekirei!

112
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,400
Good grief...

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,090
You cannot beat me.

114
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll let you owe me one for today.

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,410
Akitsu!

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Wait!

117
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,420
I brought him to my room on impulse...

118
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,690
What should I do?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,500
Man, though, he really is cute...

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,600
A small face!

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,970
Slender hips!

122
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,440
And even more, he's wearing short pants!

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,780
Um...

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,980
Yes?!

125
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm sure... I'm your Sekirei.

126
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,620
Please give me your... seal.

127
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,330
I used my full power only for
a short time... Damn this body!

128
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, there's no help for it.
I gotta ask Takami-san to retrieve me...

129
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,480
If this goes on, maybe
I'll be all ash in the morning...

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,010
Self-cremation, huh? I don't like that...

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,550
For shame, Homura!

132
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,500
Tsukiumi...

133
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,830
Thou shalt be defeated by me.

134
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,170
I shall not permit thee to die thyself.

135
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,200
You are so cool, Tsukiumi.

136
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,500
But you're showing off your panties.

137
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,680
Bastard! How dare thee!

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,150
Sekireis can bring out their
true powers only when emerged.

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,520
Why don't you get emerged?

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,850
Never mind me, what about thyself?

141
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,860
Ah, I'm defective...

142
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,660
Ever since the ages of myth,

143
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,530
those who belong to fire have
been abhorrent to the gods.

144
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,730
You are trying to be
the strongest, aren't you?

145
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,530
Then, you'd better find
your Ashikabi soon, and...

146
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,870
Don't say such absurd things!

147
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,540
Ashikabis are only lowly monkeys!

148
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,540
For such a thing to co... co...

149
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,610
Co?

150
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,210
Couple with me! I won't accept it!
I will never ever accept that!

151
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,220
But... I feel a bit strange lately.

152
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,560
I keep having a blazing
feeling deep in my chest.

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
- That is...
- I know!

154
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
If this is a reaction toward
an Ashikabi, it's opportune.

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,930
I will find that human,
and execute him by my own hand!

156
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,070
"...my Ashikabi."

157
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,010
That's definitely what she said.

158
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,910
Who is it?

159
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,580
Ku-chan?

160
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,410
Whoa! You again?!

161
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,890
I made a blunder...
I forgot about the... important ceremony...

162
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,610
Next time, please let me
experiment on you properly.

163
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,610
For many years to come...

164
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,480
"Night crawling" is also
prohibited in Maison Izumo!

165
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,580
As a penalty, no breakfast for Matsu-san.

166
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,920
Eh?! Miya-tan, please forgive me!

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,590
Or for you, Sahashi-san.

168
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,120
Wh-Why me, too?

169
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,160
The treatment of the arboretum
was handled very well by number 107,

170
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,270
whom we just released.

171
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,110
The event I prepared ended
more plainly than I expected.

172
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,740
I was expecting...
more of a fierce battle to the death.

173
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,950
It seems like over 90%
of Sekireis have emerged.

174
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,620
It's the time.

175
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,960
Minaka, you bastard! You seriously
mean to make this capital into...

176
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,290
Now, how will the pages
of the next myth begin?

177
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,790
Let's look forward to
that with keen interest!

178
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,380
"Boing"

179
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,810
"Jiggle"

180
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,320
I will die...

181
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,250
If I have more Sekireis, I will die!

182
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,550
"Smirk"
If I have more Sekireis, I will die!

183
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,980
"Smirk"

184
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,180
Good morning, Mi-na-to.

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,790
Now, for a morning kiss...

186
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,000
This isn't Minato-san...

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,990
Good morning.

188
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,880
What would happen
if Sekireis paired with each other?

189
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,370
She's a pervert...

190
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,350
I no longer need to eat in hiding.

191
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,350
Having breakfast with
everyone is the best.

192
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,360
Huh? Where's Uzume-san?

193
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,020
She's still asleep.

194
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,360
She often comes home late these days.

195
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,700
Is she working?

196
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,370
Here, open your mouth.

197
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,700
I can do it by myself.

198
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,040
You can't hold chopsticks, can you?

199
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,870
Here.

200
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,410
M-Miya, I told you I don't like spinach...

201
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,710
Kagari-san, what happened to your hands?

202
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,420
Well... it's more like whole body...

203
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,010
I just got a little burned.

204
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,400
Looks like you can't read my moves yet.

205
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,070
That was interesting.

206
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,730
Do it again, please!

207
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes.

208
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,410
Who?

209
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,750
Who are you?

210
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,410
I have, at last, found thee.

211
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,040
I shall kill thee!

212
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,350
A dream...

213
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,420
Ah, I'm sorry. I woke you up.

214
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
"You've got mail"

215
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
"Inbox / One New Mail 14:35
From: Yukari
Subject: None
"I have some stuff to take care of"

216
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,370
"Inbox / One New Mail 14:35
From: Yukari
Subject: None
"I have some stuff to take care of"
It's just Yukari.

217
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,600
It's just Yukari.

218
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,940
"I have some stuff to take care of
so I may visit you later than I thought...

219
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,540
I'll write you again soon.
Say hi to Musubi-chan!"

220
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,780
She never changes...

221
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,120
Anyway, that dream I had...

222
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,450
It was the same feeling
I had when I met Ku-chan...

223
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,790
Right! Matsu-san might know something.

224
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,130
I have many more questions I want
to ask her... like about the Sekirei Plan.

225
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,470
The Sekirei Plan.

226
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,800
That's the game that releases
108 Sekireis into the capital

227
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,840
and lets them fight with their chosen
Ashikabis until there is only one left.

228
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
The game master is Hiroto Minaka,

229
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,210
a monster who rules the
giant global conglomerate MBI.

230
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,490
As long as we stay in here,
Shintou Teito, which is MBI's stronghold,

231
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,760
Sekireis and their Ashikabis cannot
escape from the Sekirei Plan's system.

232
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,830
Letting the released Sekireis emerge was
more important than fighting until now, but...

233
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,840
Most Sekireis have already
emerged at this point in time, so...

234
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,510
The main event of the game finally starts.

235
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,840
The main event?

236
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,520
In other words, the battle
royale between Sekireis to survive.

237
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,250
And the Ashikabi who's the
partner of the last one remaining

238
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,960
will be awarded a lavish reward from MBI.

239
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,190
Matsu-san.

240
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,200
Can I... do anything?

241
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,870
I couldn't care less
about the reward or whatever...

242
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,200
But...

243
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,170
Can a guy like me do anything to prevent
everyone from disappearing like that?

244
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,220
Don't worry.
I, Matsu, am here for you.

245
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,550
Matsu-san...

246
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,890
After all, Mina-tan, you're the
Ashikabi who made even me emerge.

247
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,050
Be more confident about yourself.

248
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,820
Oh, right!

249
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,240
So, that woman told you she'd kill you?

250
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Her appearance?

251
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,910
Uh... Long hair,
black dress, and a scary face.

252
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,780
You met Kusano-tan in a dream, right?

253
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,910
Yup.

254
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,950
There is nothing strange about a Sekirei
who is reacting to a specific Ashikabi like that

255
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,260
being connected with him unconsciously.

256
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,930
Especially when you are an Ashikabi
who's already made three emerge.

257
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,890
Wh-What do you mean?

258
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,970
An Ashikabi gains more
power as he gains more Sekireis.

259
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,840
Thus, it's now highly possible
that stronger Sekireis will react to you.

260
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,270
Is that so?

261
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,580
Mina-tan, can this be the
girl you saw in the dream?

262
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,280
"Tsukiumi"
Mina-tan, can this be the
girl you saw in the dream?

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,610
Mina-tan, can this be the
girl you saw in the dream?

264
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,620
Ah, yes, yes. She's the one!

265
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,950
That's bad.

266
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,290
To be frank,
this person is really dangerous.

267
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,120
The worst!

268
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,630
Number 09, Tsukiumi.

269
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,200
She's a Sekirei with water powers,

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,630
and she's infamous for
her hatred toward Ashikabi.

271
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,630
Huh?

272
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,640
If she did react to you...

273
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,640
It would have hurt her pride badly.

274
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,310
I shall kill thee!

275
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,980
What should I do?!

276
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,980
To survive the game, we
must strengthen our party, but...

277
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,320
Number 09 the
Ashikabi hater, of all people?

278
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,660
You'll be fine.

279
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Musubi-chan!

280
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Minato-san will be fine.

281
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,430
Musubi-chan...

282
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,090
What's that?

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,670
The landlady is... really strong.

284
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,960
Ouch.

285
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,670
I'll go looking for the person in the dream.

286
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,340
I'll get her to join us somehow.

287
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,050
I'll do my best.

288
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,180
"Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill..."
I'll do my best.

289
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,350
"Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill..."
But you might get killed.

290
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,480
"Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill..."
Matsu-san!

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Matsu-san!

292
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,690
Minato-san, I'm sure you can
come to an understanding with her.

293
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,020
With your words and... fists!

294
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,920
What do you mean, fists?

295
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,960
I got it.

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,090
As a start, I'll search for her with
the surveillance satellites from here.

297
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,030
"Capital Map"
As a start, I'll search for her with
the surveillance satellites from here.

298
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,700
"Capital Map"
Musubi-tan, you'll look where the satellites
can't reach, using your physical strength.

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,500
"Capital Map"
Yes!

300
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes!

301
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,710
Mina-tan, you make
yourself appear as bait.

302
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,510
Bait?!

303
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,710
Sekireis know when the
Ashikabi they're reacting to is nearby.

304
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,050
If number 09 lives up to her reputation,

305
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,390
she will come to kill you.

306
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,060
I see... she'll come to kill me, huh?

307
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,390
So, Kusano-tan, you'll guard him, please.

308
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,120
Guard me?

309
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,730
Now then!

310
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,740
It's called the "Thrilling Kill-or-Be-Killed
Sekirei Hunting Mission of Love"!

311
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,730
Now let's go!

312
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,440
Kill-or-be-killed, huh?

313
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,550
Ku-chan!

314
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,430
Good job, youngster!

315
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,260
S-Seo-san!

316
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,440
This feeling...

317
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,910
It's getting stronger every day.

318
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,250
Damn you! A plague on thee, Ashikabi!

319
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,550
I'll find thee for sure and
kill thee with my own hands!

320
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,540
What do you feel?

321
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,120
You are a pre-emerged Sekirei, aren't you?

322
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,460
I've heard of you: Twin Sekireis
who target only pre-emerged Sekireis.

323
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,660
Despicable villains!
Do ye want to win like that?!

324
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,800
What did you call me?!

325
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
No, we aren't interested in those things.

326
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,840
We only want to get Sekireis out
of this game before they emerge.

327
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,810
Very well! I was feeling irritated anyway.

328
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,580
Come on!

329
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,810
What are you so proud of?

330
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,210
Lightening bolt!

331
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,490
Thou art... at this level?

332
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,820
Crap! She's pretty strong.

333
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,260
Water Celebration!

334
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,300
Hikari! I think she's number 09, Tsukiumi.

335
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,970
What? A single number?!

336
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,170
You were looking for a cat?

337
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:18,180
Yeah, though I figured if it got away,
I could trick the client with a look-alike.

338
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh man! You saved me!

339
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Huh? You added more Sekireis, didn't you?

340
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,190
How could you know that?

341
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,520
And that feeling...
Matsu in Maison Izumo, right?

342
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,360
You knew about Matsu-san?

343
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,530
Idiot. I'm the one who
made that hidden door.

344
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,200
Takehito asked me to.

345
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,670
Takehito-san is... the landlady's?

346
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,410
Takehito Asama... He was my best friend.

347
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,740
Seo!

348
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,880
Yo! I found our money-spinner!

349
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,810
We don't need to worry about
food for the next three days or so...

350
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,080
It's not the time for that!

351
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,920
- We are being chased
by a troublesome one!
- That man over there!

352
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,790
Thou art in my way! Move!

353
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,230
Monkey!

354
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,220
I told thee to get out of my...

355
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,240
What is this ghoulish feeling
crawling around all over my body?!

356
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,470
No! This mass of heat!

357
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,170
Th-This person!

358
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,910
Thou!

359
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,510
Couldst thou be my...

360
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,920
Our meeting here spells thy doom.

361
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,590
Before thou canst violate my body,

362
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,600
I shall obliterate thee!

363
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,030
Th-This is going exactly like the dream!

364
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,400
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

365
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
This is the textbook of love

366
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,040
Don't let it go, don't get upset so

367
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,370
Without false starts, it's show time!

368
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,480
Get the funky beat!

369
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,020
First ones win?

370
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,290
No such thing in this case! No, no!

371
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,130
That's perfect for me

372
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,860
A sudden scramble!

373
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,300
But I'm a woman, I can't lose. No, no!

374
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
My feelings grow

375
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,170
No, and then a big bang!

376
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,810
Don't seduce him

377
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,840
Get away from him

378
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,310
My heart is pounding hard, so hard!

379
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,310
Secret, going off by myself

380
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,880
Big success, just two of us

381
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,720
Sweet and dazzling night

382
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,820
To tell you the truth, I want him to

383
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,100
Hold only me, just me

384
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,330
I want to monopolize him so badly

385
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,330
I wonder if I could stick a flag on him?

386
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,340
I knew it, he's so wimpy, what should I do?

387
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,340
He's just too gentle

388
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,350
I love that about him

389
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,580
So we are devoted to him

390
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,570
Dear Sweet Heart!

391
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,060
How come our Ashikabi is such trash?

392
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,360
He's undependable,
and lazy, and... I could go on and on.

393
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,370
Hey! I lost all the money I earned
today at pachinko. Ah, sorry, sorry!

394
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,040
Don't give us that crap!

395
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,870
Episode 6: "Maison Izumo Flower War."

396
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,910
Feather 6:
"Maison Izumo Flower War"
Episode 6: "Maison Izumo Flower War."

397
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,710
Feather 6:
"Maison Izumo Flower War"
Favor us again next time...

398
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,040
Feather 6:
"Maison Izumo Flower War"
Did I have to say that?
