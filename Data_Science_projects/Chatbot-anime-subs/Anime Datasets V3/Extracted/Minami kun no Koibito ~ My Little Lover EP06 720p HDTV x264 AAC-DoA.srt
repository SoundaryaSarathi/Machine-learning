What are you saying?

140
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,900
I asked her to come work here because I've known her for long and wanted to help her,...

141
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,440
Dad...

142
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,350
But, my offer to recommend him to Takasu University, which you requested, was turned down.

143
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,530

What? It'll cause you trouble if I talk about it here?

161
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,800
You care about how you appear to other people more than your daughter's feelings.

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,510
<i>I'm home.</i>

182
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,710
Grandma.

183
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,080
Ah, welcome home.

184
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
How are you feeling?

185
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,160
Onii-chan, welcome home.

186
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,670
Ah... Asuka-chan.

187
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,230
<i>Asuka?</i>

188
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,220
W-Why are you here?

189
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,610
It's so nice of her.

190
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,430
She came to see how I was doing.

191
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,670
You're better than expected. I'm relieved.

192
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:35,320
Also, I thought I would ask you to help me study, so I was waiting upstairs.

193
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,570
<i>What's she thinking?</i>

Ah... It's messy here.

196
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,340
That's okay. I don't mind.

197
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,860
Yea...

198
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,090
Let's see...

199
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,650
Which one should I get help on...?

200
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,660
Asuka-chan.

201
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,060
You know, I am a man, so...

202
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,670
It's not right for a girl to come into a man's room.

203
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,230
Does that mean...

204
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,060
You see me as a girl?

205
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,560
Eh?

206
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,440
I don't mind.

207
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,400
You can attack me.

208
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,190
Asuka...

209
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,720
Onii-chan, are you panicking?

210
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Asuka-chan! Which part do you not understand?

211
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh right. Well, let's see...

212

Welcome home.

214
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,280
<i>Okay, Sayori-chan. Come on in.</i>

215
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,920
Come this way, please.

216
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,830
Hello.

217
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
<i>What?</i>

218
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh, we have a visitor?

219
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
Nomura...

220
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,280
Hello, Minami-kun.

221
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,750
Make yourself at home. Have a seat over there.

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,760
<i>This time, it's Nomura-san...?</i>

223
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,540
<i>What a day.</i>

224
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
It's delicious.

225
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,880
- Yes, it is. <br>- it is delicious, Sayori-chan.

226
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
You cook well.

227
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,380
Really?

228
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,690
Does it taste good, Minami-kun?

229
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,320
Ah... Yeah, it tastes good.

230
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,720
<i>I am sorry I had you cook for us although you are our guest.</i>

231
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,510
Don't worry about it.

232
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,840
We don't have a mother, so I always cook myself.

233
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,920
I am sorry I intruded on you when you have not been feeling well.

234
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,500
Don't worry about it. I am completely well now.

235
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,730
She has a big appetite.

236
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,720
Yeah. It really tastes good.

237
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,810
This is nice.

238
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,720
I always eat alone.

239
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:38,080
Oh... I am sorry. I'm being weird...

240
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,730
That's okay. You should just let it out.

241
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,930
Grandma.

242
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,340
Were you shocked to hear your father was getting remarried?

243
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,900
I... I have been attached to my dad.

244
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,980
When my mom left us,

245
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,380
I thought I didn't care.

246
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,030
I disliked my mom who was always whining and crying.

247
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,670
It is opposite from our case.

248
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,200
You know,

249
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,490
It is best to forget about the person who left you.

250
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,140
But...

251
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,450
Lately, I have come to understand how my mom felt.

252
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,130
She was left alone by my dad for a long time.

253
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,870
Even when I cooked dinner and waited for him,

254
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,190
we couldn't eat together, day after day.

255
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,450
I thought " Ah...my mom was the same."

256
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,370
The one who leaves has a reason to do so as well.

257
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,820
And yet, my dad is about to make the same mistake.

258
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,850
He didn't love my mom.

259
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,120
He married her just because she was a daughter of a professor he had been obliged to.

260
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,200
Actually...

261
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,480
he loved someone else.

262
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,740
I think my mom was lonely.

263
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,830
I'm sorry to tell you this...

264
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,230
My home situation is (nothing) compared with Minami-kun's...

265
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,130
It's okay.

266
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,120
It's okay.

267
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,470
Poor girl.

268
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,200
Minami-kun.

269
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,290
I left a bath towel in the room.

270
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,190
Would you please get it for me?

271
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,200
Ah... yeah.

274
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,250
Yeah...

275
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,160
Nomura-san's home situation is similar to yours.

276
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,330

277
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,910

278
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,960
Nothing.

279
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,720
"That's why I am..." what?

280
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Forget about it. It's nothing.

281
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,330

282
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>Hey!</i>

283
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,320
What?

284
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,460
Were you asleep?

285
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,120
No.

286
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,450
I can't sleep. May I come in a bit?

287
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,510
Eh? What?

288
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,080
Ah... Hey.

289
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,750
I heard from my dad.

290
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,250
Your mom turned down my dad's offer to recommend you to the university.

291
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,850
Yeah...

292
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,450
Are you okay with that?

293
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,350
Just because you'd get a full scholorship, you're going to a school so far away?

294
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,500
On top of that, there are many restrictions after you graduate from the medical school.

295
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm applying to other national universities.

296
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,800
If you apply to Takasu Medical University, my dad will arrange a scholorship for you.

297
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,300
And, you don't have to leave here.

298
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,350
I appreciate your gesture.

299
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,970
But, I am not cut out for that kind of thing.

300
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,870

You know how I feel about you, right?

304
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,080
Eh?

305
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,810

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,850

Of course not.

314
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,610
Then... Is it okay for me to do something like this?

315
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,230

321
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,810
What kind of thing?

322
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:42,330
I am sorry but I don't want to do this kind of thing.

323
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:50,000
Rather than this, there are things I need to do now.

324
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,200
Never mind.

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,520

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,960
Let me go. Let me go, Nomura-san.

363
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,120
You are so noisy.

364
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,950
<i>Ouch.</i>

365
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,620
Minami-kun!

366
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,610
<i>Minami-kun. Let me out!</i>

367
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,000
Chiyomi!

368
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,350
<i>Minami-kun. Don't do that.</i>

369
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,400
<i>Hey, get away from him. Nooo!</i>

370
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,020
Don't worry about it. Okay?

371
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,450
<i>- Minami-kun!</i><br>- We can't do this.

372
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,390
Because Chiyomi is...

373
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,970
<i>Minami-kun! Minami-kun!</i>

374
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,500
<i>No, you can't do it. Hey!</i>

375
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,380
<i>Noooo!!!</i>

376
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,380
I am going home then.

377
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,370
Okay.

378
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,780
<i>Minami kun No Koibito <br>My Little Lover</i>

379
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,260
I'm giving back what you left.

380
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,160
Oh, how was it? It was great right?

381
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,350
Never... lend me something like this again.

382
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,700
I got it.

383
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,490
What you need is not something like this, right?

384
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,990
Ok.

385
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,150
<i>Karaoke...</i>

386
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,060
What am I supposed to do at a place like this? <br> I'm not going to sing!

387
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,960
It's a party.

388
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,730
A party?

389
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,780
Know what? You are popular but too uptight.

390
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,630
Finally, you are getting horny like a normal person, right? You need to let it go.

391
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,560
I'm leaving.

392
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,250
W, w, wait. 2 college girls...

393
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,670
are coming.

394
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,830
See?

395
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,230
Things like this doesn't happen often. Amazing.

396
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,620
-They are already close by.<br>-Let me go.

397
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,980
- I'm telling you they are here.<br>- Let me go.

398
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,490
Hey! I'm Nanami. Thank you for waiting.

399
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,190
I'm Hiroe-chan. Nice to meet you.

400
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,340
You are a real high school students.

401
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,760
Are you by chance a virgin?

402
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,870
That one maybe, but this pretty one probably isn't.

403
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,500
It's other way around. I have already... but

404
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,580
Minami... I mean he is... probably.

405
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,820
Seriously?

406
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,930
You don't have to be scared.

407
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,030
You are a virgin, right? So cute!

408
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,540
- I'll get going...<br>- Hey!

409
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,940
Minami...

410
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,960
Sorry... Yabuki.

411
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,570
Chiyomi?

412
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,800
Chiyomi.

413
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,630
Minami-kun.

414
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:14,070
Minami-kun, your grandma saw me just now.

415
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,440
What?

416
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,200
She saw you?

417
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,980
I was out during the day, and when I came back...

418
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,780
<i>Oh no. Let me go! Let me go!</i>

419
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,300
<i>Let me go!</i>

420
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,690
Oh wow.

421
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,070
Grandma, there is a reason for this.

422
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,490
Oh wow... you were right here.

423
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,610
I looked for you for a long time.

424
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,580
Grandma, aren't you surprised?

425
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,730
I figured everyone would be shocked since I look like this.

426
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,510
You are so small... you look cute.

427
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,070
Ha? That's it?

428
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,670
Then, Grandma gave me some snack, and then we chatted.

429
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,600
She said, "go home now."

430
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,830
But she didn't say anything just now.

431
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,260
She was making a meal as usual.

432
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,880
Do you smell something burning?

433
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,210
Eh?

434
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,090
What? That legless floor chair costs 30,000 yen?

435
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:40,370
<i>That is such a rip off.</i>

436
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,320
I have never heard of a legless floor chair that costs 30,000 yen.

437
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,130
<i>We are going to add another body pillow to this.</i>

438
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,980
<i>Wow, what a deal.</i>

439
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,050
Grandma, you left the gas on.

440
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,250
<i>Who would buy such legless floor chairs.</i>

441
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,420
<i>Whoever buys this is dumb.</i>

442
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,930
Grandma. Fire.

443
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,590
Eh?

444
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, Noboru.

445
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,960
Eh?

446
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,090
I found something unusual today. Do you know what it is?

447
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,590
Grandma...

448
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,720
An one-inch princess.

449
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,770
An one-inch princess came to my room to visit.

450
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,260
An one-inch princess...

451
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,210
<i>One-inch princess... One-inch princess.</i>

452
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,210
I hope she will come and visit again.

453
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,380
Onee-chan (big sister), I wish you would send emails more often.

454
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,510
<i>[From Issunhime@beeble.co.jp]<br>(Issun-hime= One-inch princess)</i>

455
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,750
This address is...

456
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:10,450
<i>What? Onii-chan's (big brother) mail address is "Issunhime"?</i>

457
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,750
<i>[From: Issunhime@beeble.co.jp]</i>

458
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,500
Issun-hime... (one-inch princess)

459
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:28,160
Does this mean Onee-chan was sending us email from that device?

460
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:34,890
So that means Onii-chan and Onee-chan are...

461
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,750
I wonder if Grandma is ok?

462
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,600
I wonder what happened all of sudden.

463
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm worried.

464
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,260
I thought you don't eat late at night.

465
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,010
It's still before 10:00.

466
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,610
What do you mean?

467
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,840
So sweet. It tastes good.

468
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,580
- Convenience store's pudding is pretty good.<br>- Yeah.

469
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,420
You got caramel on your face.

470
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,660
Eh? Where?

471
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,910
Right there. On the left.
