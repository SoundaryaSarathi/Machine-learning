00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:31,500
Summery
In the present, at Kanagawa perfecture,
In an ordinary town, this story takes place.
The main character of this story: Miyazawa Yukino
(1st year) appeared as a beautiful, smart, talented,
moral, elegant, graceful, and well educated girl.
But in reality, due to her vanity, she was keeping
apperances of a model student in front of people.

793
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:43,955
On one bright Sunday, she carelessly revealed
herself to Arima Souichiro (1st year).  He uses her weak
point to make her help him in his work.  After a while,
she explodes and he stops using her.  But, because
he was just using that as an excuse to be close to
her they reconcile.  After that, they were together
more often and formed a new friendship.  It seemed
that everything was going well.
And so...

794
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,381
July: The final exams end.

795
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:02,632
Arima Souichirou was accepted into this school
with the highest score on the entrance exam.

796
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,474
Miyazawa Yukino became the top
of the class on the following midterms.

797
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,502
The two stood out far from the others.

798
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,981
Surely, anyone would've thought they'd
become good rivals for the next three years
vying to become the valedictorian.

799
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,977
But now, there's...

800
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:17,588
...love between them!

801
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,261
Hey, you two, keep it down!

802
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,525
It's Sunday! You'll bug the neighbors.

803
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,760
But it's been so LONG since
we've gone out with you!

804
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,099
I'm so happy!

805
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,764
That's true.
I haven't been paying much attention
to them since entering high school.

806
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,638
*During that time, she was paying attention to Arima.*
I haven't been paying much attention
to them since entering high school.

807
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:40,275
I can't believe they're this excited.

808
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,608
I guess I've got to play with them more.

809
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:48,782
Hit it, Bro! Hell yeah!

810
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,157
Oh, welcome.

811
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:58,823
Sorry for dropping by on a Sunday.

812
00:01:59,265 --> 00:01:59,788
Not at all.

813
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,497
My parents are out anyway. Come in.

814
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:05,928
Hi there.

815
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:08,132
H...hello.

816
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,007
So this is our older brother...

817
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,143
So, what're they going to do with the sunflowers?

818
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,512
Well, they're in charge of taking
care of the animals in their Jr. high...

819
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,215
And their hamsters are breeding like crazy.

820
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,916
So everyone's supposed to increase the
supply of sunflower seeds to feed them.

821
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,419
But I'm really glad you're
letting us borrow your yard.

822
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,257
Our yard alone isn't big enough.

823
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,955
We're overgrown with sunflowers this year.

824
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:37,970
Well, that's okay.  Middle school is pretty fun.
*Pero-Pero, hurry up and come here.*

825
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,801
A...Asa-pin!

826
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:41,838
Yo. Well, if it isn't Miyazawa.

827
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:43,841
Oh, my god!
What the hell are you doing here?!

828
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:45,301
Damn, you look nasty!

829
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:47,006
He's been staying over since yesterday.

830
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,374
Last night, I SLEPT with Arima...

831
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:50,374
In the same room.

832
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,153
Arima got REALLY lewd last night.

833
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,245
The only thing that's lewd is your brain.

834
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:02,950
Tsukino, Kano...this pervert is dangerous,
so don't get too close to him, okay?

835
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:04,425
Arima?!

836
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:05,626
Okay!

837
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,190
Should I dig here, too?

838
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,465
By the way, are you naked under that?

839
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:19,135
*Come, Wooflar!*
*His name's Pero-Pero!*
Miyazawa?

840
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,046
How'd finals go?

841
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,985
They didn't go that well.

842
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,216
You too, huh?

843
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:30,247
Oh, really?

844
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:31,782
We were goofing off pretty hard.

845
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,023
Well, I guess that's okay.

846
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,025
We goofed off knowing the consequences.

847
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,223
That's okay, but...

848
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:43,266
I don't really like handing over the place
at the top to someone else...

849
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,430
...after I worked my butt off so hard to get there.

850
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,800
But it's okay.

851
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,809
I was much happier being with you.

852
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:55,104
Miyazawa...

853
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,393
At that time, we were the very picture of peace.

854
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,757
I thought there was nothing
that could come between us.

855
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,912
We did slide a bit, didn't we?

856
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:36,751
Oh, well.

857
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,948
Come on,
Let's go have lunch. Miyazawa?

858
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,097
How'd you come in third
when I came in thirteenth?

859
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,068
*A wide, deep gulf appears between them already.*
You've been studying behind my back!

860
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:53,567
N...no, I didn't!
I wouldn't do something like that!

861
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,399
Why're you being so defensive?

862
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,004
I've been tricked!

863
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:01,276
I didn't think Arima was some grade
grubbing nerd, who would secretly study!

864
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,443
I said I didn't do that!

865
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:03,974
Calm down a moment!

866
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:08,083
Just yesterday you said I was
more important than studying!

867
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,214
I never said anything like that!

868
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:19,993
Arima Souichirou and
Miyazawa Yukino of class 1-A...

869
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:21,989
...report immediately to
the student guidance room.

870
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:23,226
I repeat,

871
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,897
Arima Souichirou and
Miyazawa Yukino of class 1-A...

872
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:28,840
...report immediately to
the student guidance room.

873
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,505
I wonder what it is?

874
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:38,373
I really thought that
nothing could come between us.

875
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,945
How may we be of assistance, Mr. Kawashima?

876
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:44,420
It's the first-year dean.

877
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:46,854
What's with this elaborate setup ?

878
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,587
You look as though you don't know

879
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,395
why you've been called here.

880
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:53,200
That's hardly surprising.

881
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,995
You two have never had
any business in here before.

882
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,694
You two are extremely talented students.

883
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,264
Your grades and your attitudes
leave nothing to be desired.

884
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm looking forward to the
day when you become people...

885
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,135
...who will increase the
reputation of our school even further.

886
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:07,907
Now then.

887
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:09,306
Yes.

888
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:12,179
Have you two seen the results from finals?

889
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:14,213
Yes. We were just looking at them.

890
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,717
Your grades have dropped considerably.

891
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:18,550
It's not like you.

892
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,683
What could be the cause of this?

893
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:22,719
It's the result of my own negligence.

894
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,361
Is it the same for you, Arima?

895
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:25,286
Yes.

896
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:27,529
I intend not to let this happen again in the future.

897
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:29,758
I see.

898
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,695
By the way, I recently heard a certain rumor.

899
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,103
I'm wondering if there's any truth to it.

900
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,972
That you two are currently more than just friends...

901
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:42,447
...and that you "went out" a lot
during the crucial time before the exams.

902
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:44,213
That would cause you to neglect
your studies, wouldn't it?

903
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,150
Is that what you called "negligence"?

904
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:48,475
Is this an interrogation?

905
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,649
We have no obligation to answer that question!

906
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:54,891
Of course, we have no desire to meddle in
students' private relationships.

907
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:57,662
However, you two...

908
00:06:58,097 --> 00:06:59,894
You two have too bright a future ahead of you.

909
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:04,998
You are people who must
think about their future.

910
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,100
Teacher,
I want to ask...

911
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,098
In other words, you consider our
relationship to be undesirable.

912
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:10,999
I suppose so.

913
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,208
That it's harmful to our future?

914
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,203
To put it plainly, yes.

915
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:21,376
You two should understand the
foolishness of taking risks now.

916
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:24,054
As teachers, we cannot afford to overlook this.

917
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,419
This is for the sake of your futures.

918
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,992
Your futures are too important.

919
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,759
Your studies should come first right now.

920
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:40,431
Until just a little bit ago,
it was fun being the model student.

921
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:44,808
I was a crafty, scheming child to begin with.

922
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,775
That was wonderful !

923
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:49,972
Everyone,

924
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,319
let's try hard, so we can all
play as well as Yukino, okay?

925
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,811
Okaaaay!

926
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:02,518
It's a really big help
having you lead the class like this.

927
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,094
Yes. Thank you very much !

928
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,563
Ooh, how cute!

929
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,624
Okay, Yukino, see you tomorrow!

930
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:14,067
Even the teacher is ga-ga over me !

931
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:18,466
Captivating grown-ups is easier
than taking candy from a baby.

932
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,842
I loved to scheme
since way back when.

933
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,244
I wanted to make myself
look good more than anything.

934
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:28,546
No one knew how I stayed up until 1 am
practicing the recorder...

935
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:32,500
...until I coughed up blood
just to be number one in the class.

936
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,425
I said that I loved reading
things like "Momo" by Michael Ende...

937
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,500
...but they didn't know that I secretly
read things like "How to Be a Billionaire..."

938
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,793
...or "How to lncrease Your Fortune A Hundred-Fold."

939
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,291
I could care less about love,
friendship, or trust.

940
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,896
Polishing my techniques for

941
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,599
making myself appear marvelous was

942
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,065
the joy of my life.

943
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,974
I had some bizarre personality,

944
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,671
but I wasn't worried at all.

945
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,168
Because I was "gifted."

946
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:56,908
I was confident that I was doing well.

947
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,680
That I was living the smart life.

948
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,345
I was on the fast track
to be a high-ranking politician or lawyer.

949
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:04,754
I was rushing down the elite
course, the runway of life, the
main road, while everyone cheered.

950
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,051
It was great.
I had no doubts whatsoever.

951
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,359
What other wonderful life was there?

952
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:14,500
But...But...

953
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,901
I found out later that I hadn't
understood anything after all.

954
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,029
Figures.

955
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,843
After all, the two top students in the
grade both had their grades slide at once.

956
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:27,403
Crud!  I hadn't thought about this part.

957
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,439
I presume you two are sorry
about these grades as well.

958
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:33,308
Stop going out with each other and
concentrate on studying.

959
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:36,811
But, sir, I certainly
understand your concerns.

960
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:37,812
Even so,

961
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,556
I'm not satisfied that you have
sufficient reason to intervene this far.

962
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,259
I find it far more perplexing
that you don't understand.

963
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:49,429
Are you saying you'd rather waste the
three important years that decide your future?

964
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:50,324
But...

965
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,397
You can go out with each
other after you get into college.

966
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:54,797
You two need to think about your future more...

967
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,607
I refuse. I don't like to do that kind of thing.

968
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,009
Of course, I understand how you feel.

969
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:05,542
But people must sometimes
make sacrifices for their objectives.

970
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:07,944
You don't get second chances in life.

971
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:09,711
You two are gifted.

972
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,850
You can have any life
you want in the future.

973
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:13,723
Even if it seems unreasonable now...

974
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,184
...surely the time will come
when you realize it was for the best.

975
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,128
Just work on polishing yourselves for now.

976
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,929
It's only three years.

977
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,995
I know that.

978
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,397
I thought the same way until just a while ago.

979
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,995
I thought that was the smart way to live.

980
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,334
But I was wrong.

981
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,341
That's a cunning way to live.

982
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,047
I never hesitated because I thought that

983
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,176
I was being the smartest that way.

984
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,980
But then I met Arima.

985
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,914
He was the first friend
who smiled at the real me.

986
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:50,124
I found out for the first time what it
felt like to be accepted by someone else.

987
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,622
The thrill of laughing with someone else.

988
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:56,861
How important something I hadn't
even glanced at before could be.

989
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,567
Now I wonder if being the model student

990
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,302
was such a good thing.

991
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:05,176
Miyazawa!  What kind of way
is that to talk to your teacher?!
Apologize immediately!

992
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,511
I believe that's enough.

993
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,444
I'm not satisfied with your reasons either.

994
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:12,645
We'll study.

995
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,314
We'll prove that we can do both.

996
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,117
In which case, I trust there'll be no problem?

997
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:20,219
Don't forget what you've just said.

998
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:21,626
Return to your classroom.

999
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:28,622
I had no idea you two
were thinking that way.

1000
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,701
Well, the sweet talented beauty image
just went out the window.

1001
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,708
I bet the teachers were totally floored.

1002
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:47,282
But why'd they have to yell at us like that?
*Yeah, well...*

1003
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,085
There's nothing to worry about.

1004
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,215
All we have to do is get
grades they can't complain about.

1005
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:54,489
Besides, we're trying to
change into our real selves.

1006
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,253
There's bound to be a bit of conflict.

1007
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,429
I guess so. At any rate, I guess we have to study.

1008
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,924
Yeah. The security of someone being there for me.

1009
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,801
When I'm with Arima, it's nothing but blue skies.

1010
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:07,336
I can honestly feel that I'm right.

1011
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,075
That's why I feel so
fortunate that I met Arima.

1012
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:17,476
Even if I get praised by others
or even if I get first place, I
could never feel like this.

1013
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:22,049
I'm home.

1014
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:23,952
Oh, Yuki.

1015
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,656
Did something happen to you at school today?

1016
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,460
I got a phone call from
your school this afternoon.

1017
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:33,623
They said they had something they wanted
to report directly to the parents...

1018
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:34,964
...and called us in for a conference.

1019
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,493
I wonder what it could be about?

1020
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,597
But there are still many problems left over.

1021
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:03,885
Morning.

1022
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,221
Morning.

1023
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,193
Why'd they have to go this far?

1024
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,368
There was no reason to call our parents in.

1025
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,174
Arima has a complicated history,

1026
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:22,775
and he really cares about his uncle and aunt who
raised and loved him instead of his real parents.

1027
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:26,144
It must really hurt to have to worry them.

1028
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:27,642
I'm sorry.

1029
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,921
It's my fault for talking back without
thinking and making the teachers mad.

1030
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,414
Of course not...lt's not your fault.

1031
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,722
I thought the same way you did.

1032
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:37,793
How about you?

1033
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,425
Did your parents scold you?

1034
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:41,961
M...my parents...?

1035
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:43,162
Say what?

1036
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,964
We got called into school about Yukino?

1037
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,266
Thirteenth place in finals...

1038
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,571
I'll go to her school tomorrow.

1039
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,913
Me, me!  I want to go, too!

1040
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,179
Why do you want to go so badly?

1041
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,852
It's for the sake of my dear little daughter.

1042
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:02,500
And...

1043
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,022
I like having to fight for the sake of love !

1044
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:10,795
Mom and Dad had to fight in the old days,
since we married young.

1045
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:15,596
When I asked your mother's father for
her hand in marriage, he beat me up.

1046
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,934
You were a bloody pulp.

1047
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:20,799
War with the teachers, is it?

1048
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,175
I tremble with eagerness!

1049
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,340
Hey, don't make things worse!

1050
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,411
Don't worry, your father used to take karate!

1051
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:30,937
Once he gets serious...

1052
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,248
That's not it!

1053
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,977
Dear, let's take weapons!  Weapons!

1054
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,343
Good idea!

1055
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:37,944
Dad!

1056
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:40,152
Both of us will go tomorrow,
so just leave it to us!

1057
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,652
Don't worry!

1058
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,558
No, they didn't scold me. I'm fine.

1059
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:55,337
Damn!  It's still MAJOR trouble!

1060
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,343
My parents are coming!
You can never tell what they're going to do!

1061
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,145
Why can't we just do things the way we want?

1062
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:07,710
I know studying is important.

1063
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:08,942
But...

1064
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,456
...what good is studying if
emotions have to be sacrificed ?

1065
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,489
I couldn't enjoy being the best like that.

1066
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,953
Besides, there's something
I want to cherish more than that now.

1067
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,793
I was really glad when
you defied the teachers.

1068
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,335
We won't be discouraged by this sort of thing...

1069
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,412
But the world is rather annoying.

1070
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:35,777
I want to be more like myself.

1071
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:36,579
I want to stay free.

1072
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,984
They don't understand even that.

1073
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:47,888
Ah, Mr. Miyazawa.

1074
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,187
Thank you for all you've done for our son.

1075
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,163
S...she's not worthy, but please
make our daughter happy...

1076
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,762
Don't rush things !

1077
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:58,768
Nice tackle...

1078
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:00,501
I think you knocked my guts out.

1079
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,166
I can't believe you !

1080
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,505
Now now, not in public.

1081
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:14,919
Now then, the reason I have asked
your parents to join us today...

1082
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,881
...concerns a matter I judge to be of
grave importance to your children's futures.

1083
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,854
Both of them possess
incredible academic talent.

1084
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,253
Surely, you also have high
hopes for their futures.

1085
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,223
Yes Yes...
*Dad...*

1086
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,457
But now, these two have
erred in their judgement.

1087
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,994
That they were so absorbed
in their relationship before finals...

1088
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,135
...and caused their grades to suffer is unthinkable.

1089
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:36,835
Can this be seen as anything other than a mistake?!

1090
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,376
They're about to stray from the proper path.

1091
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,479
I want them to hear from their parents as well...

1092
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:45,781
...that no matter what excuses they try to make...

1093
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,480
...their relationship would
only interfere with their academics.

1094
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,980
That getting swayed by temporary emotions
is not something smart people should do.

1095
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,881
Sir, please take that back!

1096
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,355
Souichirou...

1097
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,969
They completely refuse to hear what we tell them.

1098
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:11,832
I would like you to convince them.

1099
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:21,315
But, sir...

1100
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,845
...why do you think that they would stray from

1101
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,685
the proper path if they have a relationship?

1102
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:27,491
Why...?!

1103
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,320
It's showing in their grades already.

1104
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:33,364
Aren't you worried about
your daughter's future?

1105
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,702
But you know,
Yukino's really too smart to be our daughter, right?

1106
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,165
Right...

1107
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,198
It's a bit annoying.

1108
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,899
Up until now, our daughter has chosen
everything she does by herself.

1109
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:48,912
I've never told her to do what I say.

1110
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:52,076
Of course, I understand what you're saying.

1111
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:53,207
But...

1112
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,075
...it's precisely because we're
thinking of our daughters' futures...

1113
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,852
...that we don't try to repress them.

1114
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:00,514
I feel that repressing children
and forcing them to study

1115
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,085
would limit their potential.

1116
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:09,156
I believe children have a
right to think and feel freely.

1117
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:11,295
Studying is very important.

1118
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:17,500
But a single day in
high school is far more...

1119
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,408
...important than an entire month
of life after they've grown up.

1120
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,220
So you're saying you don't mind?

1121
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,214
That you don't care if your children
come to regret it later?

1122
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,661
Does that include you, too, Mr. Arima?

1123
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

1124
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
He's already given us so much.

1125
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,733
All we could ever do is praise him...

1126
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:49,934
...and he's never caused us a single problem.

1127
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,740
And even if there will be a day
when he faces difficulty in the future...

1128
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:55,510
...I look forward to worrying about it together.

1129
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,657
It looks like even my folks
had reasons for what they do.

1130
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,725
I guess he wasn't just an overgrown little brother.
*She vaguely saw her father that way.*

1131
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,369
Yukino, Yukino!

1132
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:21,570
Mom and Dad are going for tea with the Arima's.

1133
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:22,498
Later!

1134
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,835
Yuki, soak the rice for me !

1135
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:28,405
Dad, keep it down at school!

1136
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,814
Pardon me for keeping you waiting.

1137
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:32,648
Let's go, shall we?

1138
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:37,084
What do you think?
*My wife knows of a wonderful cafe around here...*

1139
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,021
Shall we tell him?

1140
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:40,685
Well, they were doing their jobs
in being worried about us after all.

1141
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,157
Now this is the sort of thing
a true model student worries about!

1142
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:46,963
Sir...

1143
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,294
What is it?  You haven't left yet?

1144
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,068
We're sorry for saying such rude things.

1145
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:55,535
We intend to study properly.

1146
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,440
Do what you think is best.

1147
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:04,438
Students these days often have
no idea what they're thinking.

1148
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:10,319
I was happy to be up against students
with some backbone for a change.

1149
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:11,711
Be careful on your way home.

1150
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:20,721
There are things that don't go smoothly.

1151
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,957
But sometimes, you come to see things
because they don't go smoothly.

1152
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:25,126
Shall we go?
Yeah.

1153
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:34,835
We're still just small, nameless flowers.

1154
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:41,447
Just small,  barely budding things
supported by something larger.

1155
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:44,044
But we dream...

1156
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,457
...of the day we unfold our petals

1157
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,923
beneath the clear blue skies.

1158
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:12,639
What'll happen next!

1159
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:15,640
Sis finally got accepted by
the school as a couple.

1160
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,780
That day, when no
one else was around...

1161
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,879
Could this be a development
in their relationship?!

1162
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,311
Next time on KareKano:

1163
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,622
"A Day in Her Life" (plus one other)
