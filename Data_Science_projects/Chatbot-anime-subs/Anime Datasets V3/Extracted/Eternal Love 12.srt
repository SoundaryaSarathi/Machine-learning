<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,800
This was passed down from my ancestors.

4
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,000
It has been passed down
for several generations to me.

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,199
The painting on here depicts
the Kunlun Mountain of immortals.

6
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,759
This fan is an immortal's artifact,
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

7
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,639
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,199
What more do you have to say, Miss?

9
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,639
Come, take a look.

10
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,840
See if I am telling the truth.

11
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,639
- It is indeed a valuable fan.
- This Daoist priest speaks the truth.

12
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,719
I only wish to take back
my ancestor's heirloom.

13
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,919
I do not wish to fight with you, Miss.

14
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,319
You had best leave.

15
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,479
This fan does not belong to you.

16
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,759
There are so many people watching.

17
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,000
Would I distort the truth
and accuse you?

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,247
I clearly found it at Mount Junji.

19
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:02,280
Mount Junji? Isn't it a desolate mountain
that nobody ventures near?

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,479
Yes. The lady is sounding
increasingly outrageous.

21
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,520
- Give me back the fan!
- Give it back to you?

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,319
I'm already letting you off lightly by
not sending you to the authorities!

23
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm afraid you have it backwards.

24
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,479
And who are you?

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,840
This fan belongs to
an old friend of mine.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,280
It is not some ancestor's heirloom.

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,599
That is why I am more willing to believe
what this lady says.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,759
Nonsense!

29
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,759
I'll just ask you one thing.

30
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,879
Do you know how to use this fan?

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,159
Well...

32
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,800
Since this is an heirloom,
it can't be used so carelessly.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Are you afraid already?

34
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,919
You two...

35
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,159
You... You two are together!

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,080
This fan is an artifact
that can summon wind and rain.

37
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,879
What's the matter?

38
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you not have anything to say?

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,480
That friend of mine is not someone who
can tolerate anyone unconscionable.

40
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:32,160
If he were to know
a rotten Daoist priest took his artifact

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,199
I'm afraid he'd send you off some place

42
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,560
where you'll never see
the mortal world again.

43
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,199
I... I have been blind! Blind!

44
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,399
I was blind.

45
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,120
- Liar!
- Rotten Daoist priest!

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
Miss, please put away this fan.
Don't show it off in front of others.

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,240
This fan is indeed a magical artifact.
It could attract much trouble.

48
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,639
Really?

49
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,000
Just now, looking at you
was like seeing an old friend.

50
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Unfortunately, he is a man,
and you are a woman.

51
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,480
Do I look like a man?

52
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,199
Just your mannerisms.

53
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,040
Farewell, Miss.

54
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,800
- Miss.
<i>- Her Highness?</i>

55
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,199
Since this fan belongs to your friend,
why don't I give it to you then?

56
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,639
Give it to me?

57
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,959
Didn't you say this fan
is a magical artifact?

58
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,677
It's only something I found anyway.

59
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,519
I don't know how to use it
even if I keep it.

60
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,839
Since this fan holds meaning for you,
why not give it to you?

61
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,360
Thank you for helping me
out of that situation just now.

62
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,759
When that Daoist priest tried to
take it, you wouldn't yield.

63
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,519
Now...

64
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,160
He tried to take it from me by force,
so I naturally would not give it.

65
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,240
But now, I am giving it to you willingly.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,800
This... How can I thank you?

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,680
No need to. Just accept it.

68
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,680
This isn't proper.

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Miss, no need to be polite.

70
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
If you don't find it proper,
you can give me a gift.

71
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,360
All right, tell me.

72
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
Are you not going to ask me
what it is before promising me?

73
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,519
What if what I want
is a priceless treasure?

74
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,519
You do not seem like such a person.

75
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,439
Even if you ask for that,
I will surely satisfy you.

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,000
I do not care about
those worldly possessions.

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then what you want is...

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,160
What I want is simple.
Come with me.

79
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,120
<i>How is Her Highness
acquainted with this mortal?</i>

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
How come you've been sleeping ever since
we were at the bottom of the mountain?

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
It is only the ninth month of the year.

82
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,040
Are you hibernating already?

83
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Your Highness, I have finished
dressing the wound.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,079
However, I've noticed

85
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,639
Your Highness's injury is not
a result of crimson hellfire

86
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
but from the yellowseed herb
specific to the far east.

87
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,559
I accidentally touched it.

88
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,840
You may go.

89
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,639
Yes.

90
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,799
Do you not have anything to say
about Su Jin's marriage arrangement?

91
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,630
No.

92
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,230
All right, then let's move on
to official business.

93
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,933
I've looked over
today's reports for you.

94
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,071
The Mermaid Clan of Chang Sea has
always been a source of worry for Father.

95
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,311
They were mentioned again.

96
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,831
The Water King of Chang Sea is timid
and not skilled at commanding an army.

97
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,471
You may have to personally lead
the troops to quell the disorder.

98
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:27,831
I had expected it.

99
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,030
I am also prepared to go to war.

100
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,110
Good.

101
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,910
The leader of the Mermaid Clan
was once a trusted aide to Qing Cang

102
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,910
and is dissatisfied with the governance
of the current Ghost Lord, Li Jing.

103
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,230
If not eliminated soon,
he will be a source of concern.

104
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,831
There is one more thing.

105
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,110
Li Yuan's mother comes from this clan.

106
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,030
It is fortunate that Heavenly Lord
followed Dijun's advice back then

107
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,471
and helped Li Jing into power.

108
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:50,630
If Li Yuan had succeeded, matters may
have been more troublesome today.

109
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,030
Even if Li Yuan had
succeeded the throne back then

110
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,230
there would be nothing more to it.

111
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,671
Neither of Qing Cang's two sons
are fit to rule.

112
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:03,071
Naturally, they cannot compare to you,
a heir apparent at birth.

113
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,910
You have never disappointed us before.

114
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,110
<i>Presumptuous!</i>

115
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:21,610
Good timing is necessary
to handle the Mermaid Clan.

116
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,615
The best would be for

117
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,870
Water King of Chang Sea to ask
Heavenly Lord for troops.

118
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,551
Then we could deploy
our troops in all right.

119
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:30,870
The four seas are fiefdoms.
Each have their own water king.

120
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,711
If we hastily send out our troops

121
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,591
they'll think we want to
take back the fief.

122
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,311
We need a good reason.

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,711
You hold the same view on this as I do.

124
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,311
So then we've finished discussing matters
of the Mermaid Clan.

125
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,510
I've stood in for you
for a day of court business.

126
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,711
There was only this single matter,
and it's made me so weary already.

127
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:56,791
Come, let's discuss personal business.

128
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,230
It's your private affairs.

129
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,750
What is it?

130
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,230
Your engagement to Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

131
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,630
At the main hall just now Heavenly Lord
ordered Eldest Brother and other deities

132
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,831
to discuss the ceremony for
escorting the bride.

133
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,150
She is the only daughter of
the Fox King, after all.

134
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,951
Things must be handled properly.

135
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,990
The engagement was just arranged.

136
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,071
Why is there such a hurry
to hold the wedding?

137
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:24,071
I don't understand why
Father is in such a hurry either.

138
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,390
Perhaps it's because of
what your second uncle did.

139
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,110
He might be afraid of sudden changes
and offending Qing Qiu.

140
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,071
Where are you going?

141
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,110
Going to ask Star Lord Si Ming
about a matter.

142
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,350
Cousin!

143
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,910
How come he left in such a hurry?

144
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,630
Is it because Su Jin is about
to become a consort

145
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,815
so he's off to steal her back
from the Heavenly Lord!

146
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,191
How could you dare say such a thing?

147
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,471
You're becoming
more and more inappropriate.

148
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,350
Your Highness.

149
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:23,191
Su Jin, I heard Heavenly Lord is
in a rush to make you a consort.

150
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,071
I'm afraid in a few days,
you won't have to greet me anymore.

151
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,471
There are numerous consorts
in the Celestial Palace.

152
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:35,711
Even if I am married

153
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,951
I would still have to
greet Your Highness.

154
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,791
Su Jin! How come you've just arrived?
Ye Hua has already left.

155
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:50,446
Do you really want to be a consort?

156
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,220
You're the child of
a meritorious subject.

157
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,750
The Heavenly Lord treats you so well.

158
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,071
If you say you are unwilling,
he would not force you.

159
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,110
I am not forced to do it.
I am willing.

160
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,750
Didn't you always like my cousin?

161
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,510
From this day forth,
you cannot say such words again.

162
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,671
Do you understand?

163
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:16,150
All right, I know.

164
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,910
I came to check on
Crown Prince's injuries.

165
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,791
Since His Highness has already left,
I will take my leave.

166
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,150
Go on.

167
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,471
Other than Dijun,
I won't find anyone else worthy.

168
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:45,230
Nobody will be able to force me
to marry anyone else.

169
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,671
Stop thinking about Dijun.

170
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,910
You can set your sights on
anybody in the Nine Heavens.

171
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,150
Your cousin, Ye Hua, can also
make the decision for you.

172
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,030
The sole exception is Dong Hua Dijun,
whom you absolutely mustn't like.

173
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,390
So I can't. Why do you
even have to add "absolutely"?

174
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,630
Are you trying to frighten me?

175
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,390
You do not understand,
nor do you need to.

176
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,110
Just remember my words.

177
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,951
You absolutely cannot set your sights
on Dong Hua Dijun.

178
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,390
Even if you have
countless tender sentiments for him

179
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,030
you won't receive one in return.

180
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,030
He isn't a rock.

181
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,390
If I am good to him,
would he not feel it?

182
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,529
He really is a rock.

183
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,990
Have you read the Celestial Tribe's
historical records?

184
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,591
In the beginning, he was
an immortal with unknown origins.

185
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,150
Even Heavenly Father
did not know his origins.

186
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,510
That is why it is very possible
he popped out of a rock.

187
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,990
Keep trying to scare me.

188
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,910
Wait, I get it.

189
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,350
You're afraid that
if I really do marry Dijun

190
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,335
you'll have to greet me
due to our ranks.

191
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,431
Cousin of Ye Hua... I'm afraid of you.

192
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm really afraid of you.

193
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:04,990
You're saying Mo Yuan's and
Si Yin's bodies disappeared together?

194
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,390
That is correct.

195
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,630
Back then, Kunlun Mountain's disciples
were searching for them like madmen.

196
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,910
However, in the end,
they still could not find them.

197
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,551
That is why there are some who speculated

198
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,230
Si Yin and Mo Yuan
did not have

199
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,030
a relationship as simply
master and disciple

200
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,990
yet they didn't wish to be burdened by
their titles as master and disciple

201
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,580
so they feigned their deaths
in the war against the Ghost Tribe

202
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,230
and lived on as inseparable lovers.

203
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,270
How could there be something so absurd?

204
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,270
It is because it is too absurd

205
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,870
that Dijun wrote that
"the two retired to seclusion"

206
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,230
and had it written in the ancient records
for the purpose of curbing the gossip.

207
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,150
Then according to what you say

208
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,831
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
is Si Yin's artifact.

209
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,350
Why would it be in the mortal realm?

210
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,390
Si Yin's disappearance

211
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,110
remains an unsolved mystery
in the Celestial Tribe.

212
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,471
If you are to look into it

213
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:56,630
I'm afraid nobody could
give you a clear answer.

214
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,191
Even the disciples
of Kunlun Mountain don't know.

215
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,510
Perhaps during the great war

216
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,191
Si Yin dropped his artifact
in the mortal realm.

217
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:07,630
That is possible.

218
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:11,721
Is there anything questionable
about this mortal you mentioned

219
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,510
who is in possession of this fan?

220
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,471
She is just a mortal.
There is nothing unusual about her.

221
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,270
You may go now.

222
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,551
Yes.

223
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,750
You've been sleeping for eight days now.
You're still not waking up yet?

224
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,350
It's not winter yet.
Why are you already hibernating?

225
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,230
You're awake!

226
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,990
I thought you were going to
sleep until spring of next year.

227
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,390
Look at this quilt. Doesn't it look nice?

228
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,191
I was waiting for you to wake up
so I could show you.

229
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,750
<i>It's too bright.</i>

230
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,870
Although the color is a bit too vivid,
I like this bright red color.

231
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,951
Look at the clothes I normally wear.
They're all so plain.

232
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,431
Isn't a change nice once in a while?

233
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:08,070
<i>Although you don't look too pretty</i>

234
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,990
<i>your taste in clothing is not bad.</i>

235
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,510
<i>Compared to the colorful satin
worn by female immortals</i>

236
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,030
<i>these plain clothes look the best.</i>

237
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,391
<i>Where is your fan?</i>

238
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,070
<i>Did something happen while I was away?</i>

239
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,030
Although it is only the ninth month of
the year and isn't especially cold yet

240
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,191
- I heard snakes go into hibernation...
<i>- Stop taking your clothes off.</i>

241
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,471
<i>You are an unmarried woman.</i>

242
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:31,151
<i>It's inappropriate for you to
take off your clothes in front of me.</i>

243
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,790
A kind-hearted woman gave me this quilt.

244
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,671
We won't be cold anymore
when we're under it.

245
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,871
Come.

246
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,351
Now we won't be cold.

247
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,270
Sleep now.

248
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,310
That Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
is a powerful artifact.

249
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,432
Since you're unable to
use it as a mortal

250
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,230
it may be a good thing
that you've lost it

251
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,590
so as to avoid attracting any trouble--

252
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:22,830
What are you searching for,
Your Highness?

253
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,990
Mi Gu, how come Aunt
doesn't have any tokens?

254
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,631
Tokens?

255
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:29,871
The type of item that

256
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,750
someone would know at first glance
belongs to Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

257
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,990
Or something...

258
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,590
that lets others know right away
I am affiliated with Aunt

259
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,310
and they would be accommodating to me
out of respect for Aunt.

260
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,351
Aunt has always been
unconcerned about such things.

261
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,310
Other than the mountain of
luminous pearls at the bottom of the pool

262
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,790
being somewhat valuable

263
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,911
there is nothing else that can
prove her status as queen.

264
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
Forget it.

265
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,671
How come you're acting
so strangely today, Your Highness?

266
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,351
You haven't been back in days

267
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:01,671
and you're on a search
as soon as you're back.

268
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:05,391
Did you cause some sort of trouble?

269
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:09,590
There was no trouble, but I owe a favor.

270
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,471
What sort of favor?

271
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,070
A life debt. Someone saved my life.

272
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,351
What?

273
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,911
You... were you in danger?

274
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:20,790
- Are you injured?
- No.

275
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,191
Let me tell Aunt
and have her stand up for you.

276
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,750
No, that's not necessary.

277
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,510
I did not suffer any losses.

278
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,471
However, I'm thinking that
a life debt is no small matter.

279
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:34,471
That is why I want to
leave Qing Qiu for a while...

280
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:37,310
to repay that kindness.

281
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,351
- Repay that kindness?
- Yes, repay that kindness.

282
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,391
Your Highness,
you're just leaving like this?

283
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,270
Fox King and Bai Zhen are here.

284
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,711
Of course I have to leave now.

285
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,790
If they were to know,
there would be such chaos.

286
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,030
Mi Gu, you must not
let this them know of this.

287
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,871
Just tell them I am going traveling.

288
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:03,070
- In a few years, I'll--
- A few years?

289
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,790
Lower your voice!

290
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:10,510
Hold on to this.

291
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,590
This is something important
that Aunt left behind.

292
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,375
Remember, you must give it to them.

293
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,230
I'm leaving now.

294
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:27,270
I wonder what kind of person
Dong Hua Dijun is.

295
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,030
Fifth Sister hasn't appeared
in several days.

296
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,230
Did she go into seclusion again?

297
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,550
Did you really believe
she went into seclusion?

298
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,391
That was just an excuse to avoid Sang Ji.

299
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:46,310
Then it's all the more strange now.

300
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,990
Mo Yuan's body is here.
She wouldn't stray too far.

301
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,790
In her mind, isn't her master
more important than her parents?

302
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,111
You're not jealous of Mo Yuan, are you?

303
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,990
It isn't like that.

304
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,070
It's just that I still feel guilty about

305
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,070
sending her to Kunlun Mountain back then.

306
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,671
Where is Feng Jiu? How come she
is nowhere to be seen either?

307
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:19,750
Her Highness says she is going traveling.

308
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,510
She tells you all not to worry and
she'll eventually be back in a few years.

309
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,711
She is just like Fifth Sister
when she was young.

310
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,391
She really makes others worry.

311
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,391
Oh, yes.

312
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,990
There is a scroll.

313
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,711
Her Highness said Aunt left this.

314
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:36,871
It is very important.
Even I couldn't take a look.

315
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,310
This is bad.

316
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,371
What is it?

317
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,270
This scroll not only records

318
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,151
the Bell of the East Emperor's
sealing method

319
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:58,391
but also clearly states the Bell's seal
is lifted every 70,000 years.

320
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,111
Counting the days

321
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,694
it was exactly the day after
Bai Qian left the Peach Tree Woods.

322
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,191
Zhe Yan, what do you mean? Explain.

323
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,230
That means Bai Qian must have gone
to seal the Bell of the East Emperor.

324
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,550
What?

325
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,151
No wonder.

326
00:23:17,151 --> 00:23:19,590
No wonder Fifth Sister had asked me
before her disappearance

327
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,471
what the world would be like
if Qing Cang had not been sealed away.

328
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:27,510
Are you saying she knew
the Bell's seal would be lifted

329
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,191
so she went alone to seal away Qing Cang?

330
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,671
That is why she is missing?

331
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:36,510
We know Bai Qian's personality the best.
She is certain to exact a revenge.

332
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,431
Moreover, she is Mo Yuan's disciple.

333
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:41,111
She absolutely would not allow Qing Cang
to break out of the Bell

334
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,750
and bring harm to the world.

335
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,590
She must have went to Ruoshui.

336
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,790
Her intentions in leaving the scroll
is such that even if she perishes

337
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,471
the Bell's sealing technique
would not be lost to the world.

338
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:56,230
In another 70,000 years,
someone could still apply the seal again.

339
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:00,510
She was ready to face death.

340
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,431
Face death?

341
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,990
Bai Qian...

342
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,871
How could Bai Qian have the heart to...

343
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:15,871
abandon us time and time again?

344
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,151
She is a Kunlun Mountain disciple
through and through.

345
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,590
She cares for the people of the world.

346
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,471
I had divined...

347
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,671
She would have a heavenly trial
for her godly ascension.

348
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,391
But I had thought that
in these 70,000 years

349
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:35,351
she had diligently applied herself
to cultivation

350
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:36,730
so the trial would pose no issue.

351
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,790
Who knew she would go off
to take revenge for her master?

352
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,310
As a high immortal,
how could she defeat Qing Cang?

353
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,931
Mother, do not cry.

354
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:47,471
No matter how unfavorable the odds are

355
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,871
Fifth Sister still carries
half of your life's cultivation.

356
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:53,750
No matter what, she wouldn't... perish.

357
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,590
Bai Qian...

358
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,351
She is my only daughter.

359
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:06,830
I remember how free she was
when she was young.

360
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,631
But I just had to send her
to Kunlun Mountain.

361
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,431
First, she experienced the great war

362
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:16,711
and then in order to
preserve the body of her master

363
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:20,871
she gouged out her heart
every day for her own blood.

364
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:26,310
Now, after 70,000 years,
she goes to avenge her master!

365
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:33,830
It is all my fault!
It is all my fault! If...

366
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,191
If I hadn't let Zhe Yan send her off
to Kunlun Mountain

367
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:40,030
then all of these things
wouldn't have happened.

368
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,830
- It was all my fault.
- Mother.

369
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,270
I was the one who brought her
to Kunlun Mountain.

370
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,711
Going by what you say

371
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,951
I'm afraid I am not
free of responsibility either.

372
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,871
Zhe Yan.

373
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,391
She loves Bai Qian the most.

374
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:06,911
She only said those words in the heat of
the moment. Do not take them to heart.

375
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,471
Why would I fuss about this with you?

376
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,030
However, as things stand now

377
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,070
it seems our priority should be
to find Bai Qian first.

378
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,191
Yes.

379
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,590
Don't cry.

380
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,750
Bai Qian inherited half of your powers.

381
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,151
Our Nine-tailed Fox Clan,
Phoenix Clan, and Dragon Clan

382
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,151
are all clans of the ancient gods.

383
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,191
At the moment of our deaths,
there is a celestial phenomenon.

384
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:32,990
Look. The celestial bodies
show no anomalies.

385
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,191
That means Bai Qian
is definitely still alive.

386
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:39,510
That's right.

387
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,030
Mother, the situation
is not that serious yet.

388
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,510
Do not jump to conclusions.

389
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,510
Everything is fine as long as
Bai Qian is alive.

390
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:51,151
It is our fault for allowing her
to be so willful.

391
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,790
She wouldn't even discuss
such a serious matter with us.

392
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,631
What are we going to do?

393
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:02,510
Instead of letting our imagination run,
why don't we go search for her?

394
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,871
Beautiful lady.

395
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:58,990
Why are you sitting here so pitifully?

396
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,951
Have you been bullied by someone?

397
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:04,911
You are a woman, aren't you?

398
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:11,351
How could you tell?

399
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:13,750
My aunt also likes to dress as a man.

400
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,711
I've gotten used to seeing it.

401
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:17,310
Your aunt?

402
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,951
Which lady of the Celestial Palace
is your aunt?

403
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,550
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

404
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,671
What?

405
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,830
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

406
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,270
Yes.

407
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:32,550
The future Crown Princess Consort?

408
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,750
Yes.

409
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,471
And you are?

410
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,671
Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.

411
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:44,750
So you are the young princess
of Qing Qiu.

412
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,111
Did you come here with your elders?

413
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,590
Have they come to discuss
your aunt's marriage?

414
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,030
No, I came to repay a kindness.

415
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,391
Repay a kindness?

416
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:01,671
Repay what kindness?

417
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:04,151
Who is this kindness being repaid to?

418
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:08,030
Repaying... Dong Hua Dijun
for saving my life.

419
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,750
Dong Hua Dijun?

420
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:16,351
You sure are interesting.

421
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,671
Every sentence you say
is beyond my expectations.

422
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,711
Come, tell me.

423
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,270
How did you come across Dong Hua Dijun?

424
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,111
How did he save your life?

425
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:32,070
If you can bring me inside

426
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,911
I'll tell you.

427
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:36,990
These two guards have been
blocking my way for four hours now.

428
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,671
They’re not obliging at all.

429
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:41,951
That's easy.

430
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,230
Come with me.

431
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,951
You can take me inside?

432
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,911
If you had come across an ordinary deity,
it would certainly have been difficult.

433
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:53,391
However, you happened across me today.

434
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,951
Goddess Cheng Yu.

435
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:57,590
I happen to be able to get you in.

436
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,631
Come.

437
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,871
Where are you taking me?

438
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,391
This is not the place to talk.
Come with me.

439
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,070
So it's like that.

440
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,750
So you really did come to
the Celestial Palace to repay him.

441
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,391
Of course.

442
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,070
With Dijun's status
in the Celestial Palace

443
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,351
he does not lack for anything.

444
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:23,871
How are you thinking of repaying him?

445
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:28,070
I... I am thinking of
staying by his side day and night.

446
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,871
There will come a day when he needs me

447
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,270
and then I'll be able to
take the chance to repay this debt.

448
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,191
That makes sense.

449
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:42,431
However, if you want to have the right
to come and go from Taichen Palace

450
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,391
there are only three ways.

451
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:46,911
Which three ways?

452
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,911
The first way is to be
someone of high rank in this palace.

453
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,310
However, you are not.

454
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,671
The second way is to
marry into Taichen Palace.

455
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,391
That... Marry?

456
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,070
Aren't I...

457
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,631
What is it, Your Highness?
Are you really thinking of doing it?

458
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,830
No, no. I absolutely do not
have that intention.

459
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,671
- I... I mean...
- Don't explain.

460
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:13,270
I understand women.

461
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,830
However, even if you intend to,
it is too soon to say.

462
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,351
That is why you are left with
the third method.

463
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:24,310
It is also the one
most suitable for you.

464
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,191
It may just be a bit humbling for you.

465
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,351
What is it?

466
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,151
Be a maid.

467
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,310
Maid?

468
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,111
Your Highness, what are you doing?

469
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:51,990
Entering the palace.

470
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,510
This is Taichen Palace.

471
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,230
Yes, I know.

472
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,270
Don't worry, although I get lost easily,
I can recognize that sign.

473
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,510
Stop fooling around. Dijun is not
such an easygoing person.

474
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,030
If he finds out you trespassed into
Taichen Palace, he will throw you out.

475
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,990
Is Dijun such a person?

476
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,550
Who doesn't know it
in the Celestial Palace?

477
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,030
Dijun is exactly that kind of person.
He is disagreeable.

478
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,711
Look at how I am every day.
So stringent!

479
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,871
He is so interesting!

480
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,310
Your Highness is the one
who is interesting.

481
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,951
I can't talk anymore.

482
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:33,230
I had to bribe that deity in order to
have a chance to enter Taichen Palace.

483
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,790
- I can't waste this chance.
- Let me ask you.

484
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,871
Which deity in this world
has such courage?

485
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:44,631
If I tell you,
you can't tell anyone else.

486
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,310
Your Highness, don't worry.
We're considered confidantes.

487
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,070
Lady Cheng Yu.

488
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,590
You sure know how to pick them.

489
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,351
On this heaven,
only Cheng Yu would have helped you.

490
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,990
Why do you say that?

491
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,711
I saw she was pretty and thought she was
a nice person, so that's why I asked her.

492
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,471
That is judging someone by appearance.

493
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:04,590
Lady Cheng Yu is an immortal who
achieved ascension from the mortal realm

494
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,671
through cultivation.

495
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,990
At the same time,
she is also Third Prince's beloved.

496
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,151
Lian Song?

497
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:12,590
The Heavenly Lord's third son?

498
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,990
It is indeed nice to have
the protection of those in power.

499
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,391
You sure are understanding,
Your Highness.

500
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,871
Of course.

501
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,830
I really can't talk anymore.

502
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,310
Come visit me often.
I still need your help.

503
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,471
Your Highness! Your Highness!

504
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,951
Come here.

505
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,711
Is that maid new here?

506
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:59,151
Your Highness, all of them
are newly arrived today.

507
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,911
Why are there always new people
entering Dijun's palace?

508
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:07,510
Ye Hua is better. Only Star Lord
and Jia Yun linger around him.

509
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,990
They're all men.

510
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,271
These incoming maids
are all of the lowest ranks.

511
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,271
They're only responsible for chore work.
They won't be near Dijun.

512
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,831
Tell the one who picks the maids

513
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:20,911
to not allow the pretty ones
into Taichen Palace.

514
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:22,751
It will disturb the order in the palace.

515
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:23,951
Yes.

516
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,271
Over there.

517
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,190
You can sleep there.

518
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,670
That palace maid had
violated Taichen Palace's rules

519
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,574
and was just thrown to the lower realm.

520
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,070
What is it?

521
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,831
It's nothing.

522
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,831
How come there's suddenly
such a pretty one?

523
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,351
I heard she was just brought in.

524
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,030
It must be another enamored with Dijun
and insisted on coming here

525
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,670
wanting to rise in the ranks easily.

526
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,028
She should've asked around first.

527
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:08,150
There are always a few
in Taichen Palace every month

528
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,471
who are sent to the lower realm.

529
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:21,471
Xiao Jiu Jiu, you have to stay here
a long time to repay the debt.

530
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:24,231
You have to do a good job.
Don't get sent to the lower realm.

531
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,791
Stop right there.

532
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,990
Where are you going?

533
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,110
I'm going to serve tea to Dijun.

534
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,871
Who told you to?

535
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,110
Does someone need to tell me to?

536
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:56,590
Who do you think Dijun is?

537
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,791
He was the ruler of heaven and earth
in olden days, one revered by all gods.

538
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,471
Although he has now ceded his position
to the Heavenly Lord

539
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:08,030
he is someone who is respected by even
Heavenly Lord and Crown Prince Ye Hua.

540
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:15,670
A newly arrived palace maid wants to
enter his study to serve him tea?

541
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,070
Don’t you know the rules?

542
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,150
The place I lived in before
did not have so many rules.

543
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,190
Which valley ditch of the lower realm
did you someone pick you up from?

544
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,150
Qing Qiu's... nearby mountain.

545
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,550
Qing Qiu?

546
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:37,550
The border region between
the Celestial Realm and Qing Qiu?

547
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:40,871
It's said Qing Qiu is
barbaric and uncultivated.

548
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:43,190
No wonder you don't know any rules.

549
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,030
Qing Qiu is barbaric?

550
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,751
- Isn't it?
- Of course it isn't.

551
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,144
Qing Qiu customs are merely
more simple in comparison.

552
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:52,190
We don't have as many rules
as the Celestial Tribe.

553
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,990
We live leisurely.

554
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,710
That means you don't understand rules.

555
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,150
Why should I talk to a maid about this?

556
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,150
You, come here.

557
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,550
What are your orders, Princess?

558
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,710
This person doesn't know the rules.

559
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,351
Don't allow her to come near here again
so she doesn't run into Dijun.

560
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,311
Tell her the Celestial Palace's rules
in the next few days.

561
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,431
Don't let her embarrass
Dijun and Taichen Palace.

562
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:28,751
Yes.

563
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,751
Why should I listen to you?

564
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,710
Because I am a princess
and you are a palace maid.

565
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,951
If you were also a princess,
you wouldn't have to listen to me.

566
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:40,311
Unfortunately, you're not.

567
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:44,471
- Wait.
- Shut up.

568
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,231
That is the Crown Prince's cousin.
How can you be so unreasonable?

569
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:51,391
<i>The Crown Prince's cousin?</i>

570
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:52,670
<i>Wait.</i>

571
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,791
<i>Crown Prince is my aunt's future husband.</i>

572
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,670
<i>She is Crown Prince's cousin.</i>

573
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,271
<i>Then doesn't that mean she is
a rank higher than me in seniority?</i>

574
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:05,990
<i>Father and Aunt often taught me
to respect my elders.</i>

575
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,630
<i>Although this elder's personality
is not much worthy of respect</i>

576
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,710
<i>she is still an elder.</i>

577
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,311
<i>Since my elder has said so</i>

578
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:20,838
<i>then all right,
I'll learn the rules first.</i>

579
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:22,990
No wonder the princess says
you don't know the rules.

580
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,030
I said one thing to you and
you were lost in thought for so long.

581
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:29,030
Yes, you are right.

582
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,990
Then let's go learn the rules first.

583
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,471
Learn the rules?

584
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:37,871
Does a chore maid
need to learn the rules?

585
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,431
First come with me to
the laundry room to work.

586
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,391
How was it?

587
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:29,510
Did you see Dijun today?

588
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,751
Hit me a few more times.

589
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,791
I'm so sore.

590
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,550
You're this tired?

591
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,311
I'm this tired,
but I still didn't see Dijun.

592
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:44,110
Instead, I saw my aunt's
future husband's cousin.

593
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,231
She told me to learn the rules.

594
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:49,471
Then those maids seized the chance
to make me do taxing labor.

595
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,110
Your aunt's future husband's cousin?

596
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,231
Isn't that just Zhi Yue,
that little girl?

597
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,590
She's also quite bizarre.

598
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,951
What is it? Did she give you a hard time?

599
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:07,871
What little girl? She's a rank higher
than me in seniority.

600
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:13,190
If it is as you say,
based on my past with the third prince

601
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,670
then aren't I a rank higher
in seniority over Zhi Yue?

602
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,670
Then won't you have to call me Granny?

603
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,431
So why are you taking it so seriously?

604
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:27,710
Why don't you think about this?

605
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,751
If you speak of seniority

606
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:31,911
your aunt and the crown prince
also aren't of the same seniority.

607
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:35,431
After living a long time, immortals
don't care too much about these things.

608
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,190
You need not be afraid of her next time.

609
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,391
Don't forget that you
are also a princess.

610
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,271
That's right.

611
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,911
Wait.

612
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,231
You mentioned your past
with the third prince.

613
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,471
What is it?

614
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,431
It's nothing.

615
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:03,630
It was just a past relationship.

616
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,190
What is a past relationship?

617
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,550
It's nothing.

618
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,271
Anyways, we're now each doing well
and no longer tied together.

619
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,911
It can be like that?

620
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,751
Why can't it?

621
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,630
In our Nine-tailed Fox Clan

622
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,934
when we have decided on someone,
it is for all lifetimes.

623
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,311
Really?

624
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,190
THen didn't your aunt cancel
her engagement to the second prince

625
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,791
and then arrange another
to the crown prince?

626
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:36,110
That... That is because my aunt
hadn't met the second prince.

627
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,871
My fourth uncle said

628
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:41,710
the love lives of those in our clan
have been too smooth

629
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,190
so all the challenges in love
were left for my aunt.

630
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,471
However, he also said

631
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,791
since the heavens gave my aunt
such a beautiful face

632
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:54,311
it's only right that her love life
has some twists and turns.

633
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,391
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair
if she received all the advantages.

634
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,590
Now that you say that

635
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,070
I really can't wait for your aunt
to enter the Celestial Palace

636
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,590
so I can see how
the world's number one beauty looks.

637
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,271
My aunt is very beautiful.

638
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:27,351
