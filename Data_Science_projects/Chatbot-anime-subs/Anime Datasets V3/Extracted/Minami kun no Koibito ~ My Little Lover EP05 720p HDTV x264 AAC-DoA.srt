Minami-kun, what are you doing?!

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,810
Well, it won't be good to keep this pot as it is. So I got this.

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,280

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,380
Great. It is open as I expected.

172
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,460
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

173
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,790
Hey, master.

174
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,460
Welcome.

175
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,330
Gan-chan, did you tell your wife that you would be here?

176
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,370
Hush! I came here to relax.

177
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,530
Don't say that.

178
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,050
<i>I'm the one who gets in trouble.</i>

179
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,210
Although I told Minami-kun I could do it...

180
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,450
But, it is really hard after all.

181
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,590
<i>[Minami-kun No Koibito]<br>[My Little Lover]</i>

182
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,080
I made it finally.

183
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,880
This is like Mt. Everest.<br><i>(She is saying 'Chomolungma' which is Tibetan)</i>

184
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,250
There it is!

185
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,880
This is great. It is still here like before.

186
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,720
There are so many.

187
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,470
So cute!

188
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,700
This and...

189
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,040
this...

190
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
I will take them.

191
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,470
I definitely need a hairbrush.

192
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,420
It's heavy. Did I pack too much? Oh, well, it'll be okay.

193
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,920
So heavy...

194
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,550
<i>You were also against it, weren't you?</i>

195
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,910
<i>But, you shouldn't have hit her.</i>

196
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,450
<i>Don't say the same thing over and over again.</i>

197
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,320
You are the one who are making me do that.

198
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,980
Come on, you two.

199
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,400
You are always like this. You sound like you hit Chiyomi for the sake of me. But, that's not true, is it?

200
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,030
Hey, let me tell you

201
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,230
Chiyomi didn't leave the house because I hit her. <br> She wanted to participate in the workshop.

202
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,990
<i>Regardless of whether I hit or not, she would have left anyway.</i>

203
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,250
You are mistaken, Dad.

204
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,000
You always change the subject like that.

205
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,250
- Hey, let's stop it now, Ricchan.<br>- Don't tell me. Tell HIM.

206
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,700
You always look disgusted like that.

207
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,230
- I don't.<br>- Yes, you do. You have a look that says<br> "I shouldn't have married her."

208
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,410
You got a customer here, okay?

209
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,010
- That's not how I feel.<br>- You look like that because you DO feel that way.

210
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,510
Sure. You always make me the bad guy like that.

211
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,540
<i>You've always had a persecution complex to begin with.</i>

212
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,300
<i>You two, stop it! You are going way overboard.</i>

213
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,910
Hey you!

214
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,700
I knew you would be here.

215
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,450
Oh no... she found me.

216
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,830
- We're going home.<br>- Ouch, ouch.

217
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,240
You always sneak out when I am not looking.

218
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't pull my ear.

219
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,630
<i>Hey, my ear is about to get torn.</i>

220
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,130
Okay.

221
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,970
Grandma is not back yet.

222
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,830
Oof.

223
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,130
What's wrong with those two?

224
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,030
Is it my fault?

225
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,570
Grandma is back. Oh no!

226
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,410
Oh, no. Oh, no.

227
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,450
It's not her?

228
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,090
Nobody is home.

229
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,200
Eh?

<i>Actually, many people around here had their houses burglarized.</i>

232
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,270
No way... A burglar?

233
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,980
What should I do? I have to tell Minami-kun.

234
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,000
I am happy I can study with you today again.

235
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,150
It can't be late though.

236
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,130
I know.

237
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,750
Nomura... you are tall.

238
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,090
Eh?

239
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,020
You like smaller girls better?

240
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,560
Eh? Well, no.

241
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,840
But, with your height, a girl of my height would look good next to you, balance-wise.

242
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,920

348
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,130
- It might be here.<br>- Please stop it, Kanae.

349
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,920
We are going home.

350
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,190
It might be upstairs.

351
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,900
It probably is not upstairs.

352
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,870
Don't do it.

353
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,650
This is no good.

354
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,870
Kanae. We'll be in trouble.

355
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,750
Oh no...

356
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,760
Let's get out of here! Quickly! Let's go!

357
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh no...

358
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,300
There was someone there after all.

359
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,950
I did it!

360
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,060
Quickly, quickly!

361
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,650
What are we gonna do if we are caught?

362
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,730
This happened because you are so undependable.

363
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,600
Are you sure you sent her the divorce paper?

364
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,000
I sure did. When I called her the other day, <br>she said she already signed it.

365
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,150
Why didn't you send it to her sooner?

366
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,570
That was...

367
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,210
Maybe your wife is telling a lie?

368
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,290
Maybe she didn't sign it and threw it away?

369
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,760
Emiko is not that kind of a woman.

370
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,930
Gosh!

371
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,140

372
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,950
Sorry, sorry, sorry. That's wrong. That's not what I meant.

373
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,050

What's the matter? Why are you so out of breath?

377
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,760
Oh, so you were here.

378
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,410
You know,

379
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,350
I heard at school that there has been a burglar around here.

380
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,910
I was worried.

381
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,150
We are fine.

382
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,680
That's good.

383
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,030
Chiyomi!

384
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,150
Minami-kun!

385
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,380
You are home!

386
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm so relieved.

387
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,740
Chiyomi,

388
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,550
so you were safe, huh.

389
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,590
Minami-kun.

390
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,990
So, I climbed the stairs vigorously.

391
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:59,140
Then, I mailed you and <br>was almost spotted by them several times.

392
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,610
So, the burglars didn't come to this room?

393
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,850
Right. The female burglar momentarily stepped in here, <br>then her accomplice came.

394
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,910
An accomplice?

395
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,290
Right. I didn't see his face,

396
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,430
but he must be a useless guy.

397
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,110
He was indecisive for a burglar.

398
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,300
They started to have a lovers' fight.

399
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,160
So when I played a CD in loud volume,

400
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,560
they ran away in a hurry.

401
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,670
That's strange.

402
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,570
Grandma said we didn't get burglarized.

403
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,470
Grandma was not home, you know.

404
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,140
But, still...

405
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,770
That is strange.

406
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,760
They were in such a hurry to go out.

407
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,600
Onee-chan (big sister), I am borrowing it a bit.

408
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,690
Is this it?

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:08,850
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by <br>My Little Lover Team@Viki.</i>

410

411
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,980
Why is this here?

412
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:31,630
The one who hid this... was onii-chan (big bro).

413
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,380
The doll's clothes onee-chan had hid...Onii-chan?

414
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,210
Eh? For what?

415
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,530
<i>Thank you for making you wait. This is Solo Workshop office.</i>

416
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,160

418
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,980
Yes, I can't get in touch with her <br>because her cellphone broke or something.

419
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,540

420
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,250
<i>- It's Horikiri-san, right?</i><br>- Yes.<br><i>- Horikiri...</i>

421
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,360
It's Horikiri Chiyomi.

422
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:20,750
<i>Oh? We don't seem have a person named <br>Horikiri-san at our workshop.</i>

423
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,960
No way. It's Horikiri Chiyomi. Chiyomi.

424
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,520
<i>Right. We don't have Horikiri-san or Chiyomi-san.</i>

I'm so relieved a burglar got caught.

428
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,410
Yazawa-kun and Utsumi-kun were patrolling in the neighborhood,

429
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,490
and they caught him and reported it to the police.

430
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,110
Were there two burglars? A man and a female?

431
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,840
No, it was a young man in his 20's.

432
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,750
Junichi, why did you think there were <br>a male and a female burglers?

433
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,230
Ah... I just thought about it for some reason.

434
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,660
