1
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,116
I am bored to death.

2
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:41,126
I've had it. This is still
only the seventh day, too.

3
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:47,731
We've still got twenty-some days to go.
I should have installed hibernation devices.

4
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,646
Are you guys image training again?

5
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,410
Nice for you to be able
to pass the time.

6
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:58,310
Wow, you're not bad!
You sure are strong.

7
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,646
You've inherited Goku's blood, and you've
been trained by Piccolo, after all.

8
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,983
Still, I was surprised by how many
techniques you have, Kuririn.

9
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:06,985
Listen...

10
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,988
It's fine for you
to train inside your heads,

11
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:13,992
but the room is starting to get pretty
messy, so would you tidy it up for us?

12
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,926
There's a lady present.

13
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,333
B- but Bulma-<i>san</i>, you're the one
who made it messy over there.

14
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,003
We've cleaned up our own messes.

15
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:30,675
I'm busy here! I've got a lot
of things to think about.

16
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:34,612
You guys are just passengers,
so that's fine for you.

17
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,615
I thought you just got done
saying that you were bored.

18
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:42,279
You hush! I wish you would show a little more
consideration toward a delicate lady.

19
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,082
So busy, so busy...

20
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,728
As a lady, I sure wish she wouldn't
stroll around in her underwear.

21
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,231
Oh, not again.

22
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,316
Four more.

23
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,651
Son-<i>san</i>, you mustn't do that!

24
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,988
Nurse, I'm all better now.

25
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,922
Goku is immortal, you see.

26
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,665
Did I just do something? Must be my age,
but lately, I don't even know what I'm doing.

27
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,335
Oh, for heaven's sake...

28
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,670
These sponge cakes are delicious.

29
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,763
Of all the...

30
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,950
Doctor!

31
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,621
How many times must I say it
before it gets through to you?

32
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:53,958
If you keep doing that,
you'll never get to go home.

33
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,961
As you can see, I'm all-

34
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:03,968
It should hurt. You were very severely
injured, after all. Get back to bed.

35
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,970
S- sorry.

36
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,973
You there, Grandpa Glad-hands,
give him a hand.

37
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:11,976
" G- Grandpa Glad-hands" ?

38
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:16,572
My word, " Grandpa Glad-hands," huh?
My, my...

39
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:22,654
" Grandpa Glad-hands" !

40
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:23,988
At your service.

41
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,658
Where is his wife,
who is usually with him?

42
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:31,095
Oh, she probably went to the roof
to look up at the sky again.

43
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:47,278
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, are you doin' all right?

44
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:50,548
I told you over and over
to send me a letter every day,

45
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,284
but you haven't sent a single one...

46
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:56,879
Come back to me soon,
safe and sound.

47
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,634
Say...

48
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,637
By the way, I've been wondering
about this for a long time,

49
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:18,643
but about that Saiyan, Vegeta,
who ran away- where did he run away to?

50
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:21,646
What do you mean, where?

51
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:26,317
Well, the Saiyans' planet
was lost a long time ago, right?

52
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:30,421
Oh, right. He had taken
an awful lot of damage,

53
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,757
so I think it would have to be
a civilized planet somewhere.

54
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,748
Could there be such a place?

55
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,265
Earlier, Son-<i>kun</i>'s brother
mentioned something, remember?

56
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:44,269
He said that, " We exterminate those
who live on planets with good environments,

57
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:47,605
and then sell them to aliens."

58
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:51,943
Do you think that maybe Vegeta went
to one of those aliens' planets to get treated?

59
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:57,949
If he did, then when he comes back to Earth
would depend on where that planet was.

60
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,043
If it were far away,
then it would buy us some time.

61
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,557
You know something, that's one terrible
fellow who has set his sights on Earth.

62
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:23,232
<i>T</i>- <i>to think that it would come to this...</i>

63
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:38,256
--What was that just now?
--Something flashed, huh?

64
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,592
It wouldn't be Planet Namek, right?

65
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:43,254
It's too early for that,
to say the least, isn't it?

66
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,603
Huh? Something is approaching.

67
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,764
But I don't see anything.

68
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,941
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>!
Flying saucers!

69
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,632
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>!

70
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,634
Leave them to me!

71
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:23,794
Counterattack!

72
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,975
You got them!
You got them!

73
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,916
It's too soon to celebrate. Look!

74
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,930
It's a spaceship.

75
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,266
It's coming closer and closer!

76
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,600
I can see that. It's coming
straight toward us.

77
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,275
Is that!?

78
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,943
We're going to hit!

79
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,274
Do something!

80
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,772
H- how could they turn
in the same direction!?

81
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,282
W- we're done for!

82
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:31,028
Where could we be? It looks
like the inside of a spaceship,

83
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,966
but even so, there isn't a soul around.
I have no idea what's going on here.

84
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:38,302
There may be some weird
aliens hiding from us.

85
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,638
You're right.
They might suddenly-

86
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:42,974
...pop out, like this.

87
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,977
Gohan! Don't scare us like that!

88
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:49,743
I- it looks like it's safe to go
outside. Let's go have a look.

89
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,088
Here goes!

90
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:12,336
<i>Maybe I should have stayed</i>
<i>on Earth after all, like Yajirobe.</i>

91
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,672
Oh, no!

92
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:17,675
I forgot to put on
some pants first.

93
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,011
Huh? But you <i>are</i>
wearing them, aren't you?

94
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:23,681
These are my shorts.
Ah, oh well.

95
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:27,018
Let's hope you don't
embarrass mankind.

96
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,686
Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

97
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,119
All right, let's go.

98
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,919
Gohan! Don't push!

99
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:41,292
Gohan, watch yourself! It looks like
there are some booby traps in here.

100
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:46,389
Remember, you two! Men are to protect
ladies at all times! Don't forget that!

101
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:58,400
There should be a doorway
into the main room somewhere-

102
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:08,319
A wall like this will be
easy to take care of.

103
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,655
<i>Kame...</i>

104
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:13,590
<i>hame...</i>

105
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,092
K- Kuririn!

106
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:40,284
<i>Kame...</i>

107
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:45,221
<i>...hame-Ha!!</i>

108
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:56,400
Must be nice for you guys,
being able to perform <i>Bukujutsu</i>.

109
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:03,975
I get the feeling that they want to
eliminate any intruders, no matter what.

110
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,645
Is this a Saiyan spaceship?

111
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:08,646
Beats me.

112
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:12,650
Suppose Vegeta were to suddenly
appear from over there...

113
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,655
C- cut that out! Look,
I'm starting to get goosebumps!

114
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:23,327
I wonder if that man Vegeta is recovering
from his injuries somewhere right now.

115
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,922
I'd appreciate it
if he'd just die.

116
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:45,545
<i>K</i>- <i>Kakarrot... remember this... I will</i>
<i>definitely go back there to settle the score!</i>

117
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:53,891
Say, I get the feeling

118
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:57,884
that we've been walking around
the same place in circles for a while now.

119
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,891
There wasn't anything
that looked like a door, huh?

120
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,897
There's one!

121
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,316
It looks like the real
door is down here.

122
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,985
Yay!

123
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,752
Damn... They sure built
this thing to be convoluted!

124
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,660
All right, let's try going in here.

125
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,662
Kuririn, be careful.

126
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,095
I know.

127
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,379
Outer space!

128
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:22,646
I thought we were dead!

129
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,648
I- I'm getting hungry...

130
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,741
My tummy is grumbling, too.

131
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:30,654
Something smells good.

132
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,417
Y- you're right.

133
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,703
Wow, that looks delicious.

134
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,531
It might be a trap!

135
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:56,280
It sure is a spread!

136
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,874
Be careful when touching anything.

137
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:22,231
You won't catch me falling for that!

138
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,750
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

139
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,598
Help me!

140
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:50,601
Bulma-<i>san</i>, your
reflexes are so slow!

141
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,270
It's you guys who are
the unusual ones!

142
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,940
We're coming
to help you out now!

143
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,602
Please move away from the cage!

144
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:11,622
What is this!? Who set
this childish trap!?

145
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:12,611
Don't move!

146
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,781
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

147
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:20,456
Why, you!

148
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,963
Stay back!
I'll be shot!

149
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:03,274
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, they're all children!

150
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:07,768
D- don't shoot! We're not your enemy!
Is there an adult here that I could speak to?

151
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:18,956
Never mind about me! Give these
kids a good hard spanking!

152
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:20,291
B- but...

153
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,454
Don't dawdle around! Hurry up!

154
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:26,755
Okay then...

155
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:36,800
Kuririn! Don't offer
any more futile resistance!

156
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,978
Just hurry and surrender, already!

157
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,809
B- Bulma-<i>san</i>...

158
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,653
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>?

159
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,417
W- what should we do?

160
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:59,997
<i>Ominously, these children</i>
<i>have suddenly appeared.</i>

161
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:06,926
<i>What exactly is the true nature</i>
<i>of this mysterious spaceship?</i>
