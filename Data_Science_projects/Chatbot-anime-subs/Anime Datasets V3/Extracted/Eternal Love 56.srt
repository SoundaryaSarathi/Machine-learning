4
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:12,411
You didn't think of that?

5
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:17,735
My spirit might not be able to hurt you,
but this Double Crescent Halberd will!

6
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:22,078
Li Jing, I'll take your life!

7
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,532
What a good son.

8
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,788
I couldn't have left the
Bell of East Emperor so soon.

9
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,956
I owe you.

10
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:43,437
Once your life is given to me...

11
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:47,823
I'd add 100,000 years of cultivation.

12
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:54,227
This is the day I avenge myself!

13
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,431
Everyone has betrayed me!

14
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:30,133
Even you betrayed me!

15
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,861
The day my spirit returns to my body

16
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,275
is the day I break out of the bell
and torch the Eight Far Lands

17
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,711
with my crimson hellfire
to destroy Heaven and Earth!

18
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,353
It's the crimson hellfire!

19
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:38,514
The Ghost Lord has returned!

20
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:42,257
- The Ghost Lord has returned!
- The Ghost Lord has returned...

21
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,879
Jiu'er!

22
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,031
Your Lordship, what happened
to the Little Princess?

23
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,365
Quickly! Go to Kunlun Mountain
to see Mo Yuan!

24
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:10,869
- Yes!
- No, there's no time to lose!

25
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,326
Go to Qing Qiu!

26
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:13,552
Qing Qiu is the closest.

27
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,439
Bai Qian also knows how to
seal Qing Cang.

28
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,519
Yes.

29
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,213
Tian Shu, obey my command!

30
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,565
Present!

31
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,648
Auntie...

32
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,072
The Crown Prince is still
outside the Fox Den.

33
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:49,122
He hasn't moved an inch.

34
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,565
If you mention him again...

35
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,596
I'll turn you back into
your original form!

36
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,668
Why has the weather
suddenly changed, Mi Gu?

37
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,033
Auntie...

38
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,999
I don't know.

39
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,413
Is he still outside my den?

40
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,819
Yes, Auntie.

41
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,764
He's still out there
braving the sun and rain.

42
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:45,891
Lord Dong Hua...

43
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,846
If we both die here, not even
the heavens could tear us apart.

44
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,012
As long as I'm here, you won't die.

45
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,750
I'll use my spirit to pin him down.

46
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,261
But without my powers, I could only hold
him off for a while.

47
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:12,185
You have to go to your aunt
and fourth uncle immediately.

48
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:15,499
No, I won't leave.

49
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,146
Do not disobey!

50
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,704
I am not!

51
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,249
I told you that I would live
and die with you!

52
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,747
No one can!

53
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,487
I've used my life to protect all lives
and sacrificed my marriage.

54
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,192
If I insist on my relationship with you

55
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,552
it would surely cause ceaseless wars
within the four seas.

56
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,165
All shall be in misery.

57
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,166
Neither of us will meet a peaceful end.

58
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,033
Bai Feng Jiu, you're not
some common woman.

59
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,312
You're the future Queen of Qing Qiu!

60
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,101
Don't be absurd!

61
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,408
I'm not!

62
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:48,192
Dong Hua, if you live and so will I.

63
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,879
If you die, so will I.

64
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:53,964
If you could fend off Qing Cang
I'd never hold you back.

65
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,124
At most, I'd just kill myself if you die.

66
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,913
However, you're no match for him now.

67
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,807
You don't even have one tenth
of his powers.

68
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:01,714
I can't let you seek your own doom.

69
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,141
You can't go to him!

70
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,177
Step aside!

71
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:05,622
Not unless you kill me!

72
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,312
<i>Today, I'll have all living beings
buried with me.</i>

73
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,779
<i>None of you can get away!</i>

74
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,807
Jiu'er!

75
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:46,188
Jiu'er... Jiu'er!

76
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,543
Auntie, take a look at him.

77
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:51,942
Just one glance will do.

78
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,789
I can't take that step forward.

79
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,381
<i>Star Lord of Destiny seeks
audience with Auntie!</i>

80
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,881
<i>There's trouble in Ruoshui Riverbank!</i>

81
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,730
What did you say?

82
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,898
There was a weird sighting at the bell.

83
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,019
Lord Dong Hua said
only Auntie could seal Qing Cang.

84
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,523
Qing Cang broke the seal?

85
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:10,995
When I left, he was still sealed.

86
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:12,452
But it's just a matter of time now.

87
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,292
Mi Gu, send a message to Fourth Brother.

88
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,585
Get him to assist me in Ruoshui.

89
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:16,764
- Yes.
- Qian Qian...

90
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:28,971
Protect Lord Dong Hua!

91
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:41,821
Earth Deity!

92
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:44,850
Not even High God Mo Yuan
could defeat him.

93
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,686
We're just minor deities.

94
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,530
How can we tackle him?

95
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,326
I'm the Earth Deity of this area.

96
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:54,525
Even if I am no match for him
I still have to give it a try!

97
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:57,265
I'll risk my life to stand up to him!

98
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,051
- Qing Cang!
- Earth Deity!

99
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,826
I've been guarding you for 70,000 years!

100
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:06,554
Don't you dare dream of leaving
this place to harm anyone!

101
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,144
Earth Deity!

102
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,808
- Auntie...
- Step aside!

103
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,403
<i>Si Yin, is that you?</i>

104
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:33,083
Exactly! Qing Cang, it's me.

105
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,256
Who knew that I've only sealed you
for about 300 years

106
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:36,804
and you've broken out again?

107
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:43,309
I've been waiting for you and Mo Yuan!

108
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,706
It was you and your mentor
who had me trapped for 70,000 years.

109
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:52,398
I'll avenge myself today
and take both your lives!

110
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,743
How arrogant!

111
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,205
What magical artifact is this?

112
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,357
Let go of me!

113
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:08,336
You can't defeat Qing Cang
with your cultivation.

114
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,508
Leave him to me.

115
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:13,072
You've transferred all your cultivation
to my mentor so you can't defeat him!

116
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,198
Take good care of her.

117
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:15,495
Ye Hua!

118
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,924
Ye Hua!

119
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,303
Ye Hua!

120
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,539
Untie me!

121
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,159
He's seeking his own doom!

122
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,438
Don't panic, High God.

123
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,977
This magical artifact is really weird.

124
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,412
I can't undo it!

125
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,250
Get me Lord Dong Hua!

126
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,625
Lord Dong Hua has lost all his powers
so he's even worse than me.

127
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,730
Lord Dong Hua?

128
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,874
Little Princess?

129
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,683
Qing Cang, if you want to pick a fight
come out here!

130
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:53,423
Mo Yuan?

131
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,440
You've finally shown up.

132
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,133
Who are you?

133
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,788
You're not Mo Yuan!

134
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:06,120
I am the Crown Prince of
the Celestial Tribe, Ye Hua!

135
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:08,212
What?

136
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:09,644
Qing Cang broke free again?

137
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:45,422
Our Ghost Lord has returned!

138
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:49,313
Kill them all and the world will be ours!

139
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:52,048
Don't you dare act so arrogantly,
Ghost Tribe!

140
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,303
Fourth Brother!

141
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,062
- Ghost Lord!
- Ye Hua!

142
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:21,106
Young man, I lost to you today
but it's not a fair fight!

143
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,294
If I weren't still affected by
the severe injuries from 70,000 years ago

144
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:30,476
and damages to my spirit
by my treacherous son

145
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:33,332
I would never have been
defeated by you!

146
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:34,918
Ye Hua!

147
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,239
You were still defeated in the end.

148
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:42,313
Ye Hua lost so much of his cultivation,
but he still defeated Qing Cang?

149
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:47,004
- Ghost Lord!
- Ghost Lord...

150
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,504
Ye Hua!

151
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,259
Qing Cang, what have you done?

152
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:16,217
All I did was to make use
of the past 70,000 years

153
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:21,065
to connect my life to
the Bell of East Emperor.

154
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,273
Once I'm dead...

155
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:29,828
The Bell of East Emperor
will release the crimson hellfire.

156
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:35,352
it will have all of you killed
and buried with me!

157
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:57,868
Ye Hua!

158
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:01,945
- Ye Hua!
- Qian Qian!

159
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,624
- Qian Qian!
- Ye Hua!

160
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,559
- Qian Qian, you can't!
- Get back here, Ye Hua!

161
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:14,132
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

162
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,271
<i>Get back here!</i>

163
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,730
- Ye Hua!
- You can't go!

164
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,488
- Ye Hua!
- Qian Qian!

165
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,332
Get back here, Ye Hua!

166
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,442
Ye Hua!

167
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,464
Ye Hua!

168
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,236
Ye Hua...

169
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:14,597
Don't cry.

170
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,637
I'm all right.

171
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:21,167
This injury isn't serious.

172
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:29,825
Ye Hua! Ye Hua...

173
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,842
Ye Hua! Ye Hua...

174
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,652
Ye Hua...

175
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,385
Are you trying to swallow
your blood again?

176
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,488
You're still young.

177
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:46,855
It's all right to look weak.

178
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,375
Ye Hua...

179
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,602
Tell me the truth...

180
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,459
Are you going to die soon? Ye Hua...

181
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,417
Mo Yuan has returned.

182
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:19,028
Stay with him.

183
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,843
He... He'll take good care of you.

184
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:29,101
He would be better than me.

185
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,002
I'm not worried.

186
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,483
- No...
- Qian Qian...

187
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,903
Qian Qian...

188
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:48,979
All along, I...

189
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:52,059
I've loved only you.

190
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:59,131
Don't... Don't forget me.

191
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:01,604
Don't...

192
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,770
Don't... Don't forget me...

193
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:15,727
No... Ye Hua!

194
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,479
You can't die!

195
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:19,890
Hang in there, just hang in there!

196
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,355
I'll take you to my mentor.

197
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:24,354
He will be able to save you, Ye Hua...

198
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:27,410
Ye Hua...

199
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,583
Don't die!

200
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,041
I'm begging you!

201
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,565
You can't die.

202
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:34,565
You can't die...

203
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:41,673
If you die, I'll go to Zhe Yan
for that potion.

204
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,905
I'll forget you!

205
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:47,597
I'll live just fine all by myself!

206
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,948
I don't want to remember who you are.

207
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,876
Do you hear me?

208
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,093
That's good.

209
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,196
You...

210
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,182
Ye Hua...

211
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,691
Ye Hua!

212
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,190
No...

213
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:27,453
Ye Hua, open your eyes! Ye Hua!

214
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,958
Ye Hua!

215
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,058
Heavenly Lord!

216
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,997
Qing Cang triggered
the Bell of East Emperor

217
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,631
to cast crimson hellfire upon the realms.

218
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,042
The Crown Prince...

219
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,433
He used his spirit as
an offering to the bell.

220
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,772
What?

221
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,675
You said that the Crown Prince...

222
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:25,582
How could that happen?

223
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:28,815
Didn't Lord Dong Hua said that the seal
would only be broken every 70,000 years?

224
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,847
The Crown Prince seemed to
have known in advance.

225
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:33,207
Before he went to the Mortal Realm
for his heavenly trial

226
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,644
he had Tian Shu guard the bell.

227
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:38,417
Little did we know that
after he's left the Mortal Realm...

228
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,462
Le Xu! Le Xu!

229
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:16,616
Master, did you hear that bell chime?

230
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,715
It sounds so depressing
and comes from Ruoshui River.

231
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,150
That is the Bell of East Emperor...

232
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,413
Master!

233
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:25,103
Could it be that Qing Cang
is going to break free?

234
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,587
Master... you can't go!

235
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:31,631
- Send me there instead!
- It's all over now.

236
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:38,743
Someone has offered his spirit
to the Bell of East Emperor.

237
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:52,104
So what if the Bell of
East Emperor is triggered?

238
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,970
So what if the deities of all realms
are vanquished in flames?

239
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,230
At least, we'd still be together.

240
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,835
How could you leave me?

241
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,461
Ye Hua...

242
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,727
How could you leave me all on my own?

243
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,531
Qian Qian is very stubborn.

244
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:11,451
If this goes on, she might die.

245
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,743
What should we do?

246
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,992
I don't know.

247
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:23,996
First it was her mentor
and now her future husband.

248
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:30,179
Qian Qian is destined to
go through the loss of her loved ones.

249
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,768
Exactly.

250
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:34,632
She was going to marry Ye Hua.

251
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,306
What should she do now?

252
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,458
High God.

253
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,491
We're acting on the orders
of Heavenly Lord

254
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:45,526
to collect the Crown Prince's body.

255
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:48,901
Please let me know what we should do.

256
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:53,785
You should all head back.

257
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,291
I think she will sit here
holding on to your Crown Prince

258
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,342
for all eternity on Ruoshui Riverbank.

259
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,407
Auntie...

260
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:19,140
Auntie, please don't be
so hard on yourself?

261
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,108
The dead can't be revived, Auntie!

262
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:26,285
You still have me and your brothers.

263
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,675
You still have
the entire Qing Qiu, Auntie!

264
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,424
Auntie!

265
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,483
Auntie, don't behave like this.

266
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,768
You're scaring me.

267
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,064
Auntie!

268
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,657
Auntie!

269
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,807
How is she?

270
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,381
Your disciple is too emotional.

271
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,903
She can't be consoled.

272
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,798
Seventeenth.

273
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,094
Master, you're here?

274
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:43,961
You must have a way
to save Ye Hua, right?

275
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,155
You overcame the trial of
the Bell of East Emperor.

276
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:49,280
You must be able to save him.

277
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,624
Seventeen...

278
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:08,414
Get Ye Hua a coffin
so he can rest in peace.

279
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:19,221
Master, you can't make such a joke...

280
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,663
I can wait.

281
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:31,346
70,000 years or even hundreds of
thousands of years. I can wait for him.

282
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:32,939
Master...

283
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:41,109
He already breathed his last breath.

284
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:50,303
When you offered your spirit
to seal the bell

285
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:53,750
they also said that you were vanquished.

286
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,959
But I still managed to
wait until you returned.

287
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:06,594
Ye Hua will also return.

288
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:10,642
He will surely return...

289
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,759
Even if you are to wait for him...

290
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,961
You should let him rest comfortably.

291
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:25,192
You can't just keep sitting here.

292
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,064
Master, you're right.

293
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:34,569
Earlier... I promised Ye Hua...

294
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:44,943
I'd take him back to Qing Qiu
and lock him up in my Fox Den.

295
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,248
Then he could only look at me.

296
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:56,837
I'll take him back to Qing Qiu now.

297
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,800
Head back there first.

298
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,625
- What is going on?
- Auntie!

299
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,428
- What should we do now?
- Exactly.

300
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:19,118
This is...

301
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:24,931
Lord Dong Hua...

302
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,301
Go on.

303
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:41,423
- What now?
- How should we report back?

304
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,190
- How should we report back?
- Exactly...

305
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,131
What should we do now?

306
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,888
What are we to do?

307
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:05,627
Honorable deities, this is the home
to generations of Qing Qiu's rulers.

308
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:10,059
Auntie now rules one of Qing Qiu's
Five Far Lands as the Queen.

309
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,563
Although there aren't as many regulations
in Qiu Qing as in the Celestial Palace

310
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:18,599
the Queen's home is still
not to be entered freely.

311
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,537
This is...

312
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:21,784
What should we do?

313
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,531
What are we to do now?

314
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:27,236
We do know that Auntie is
the Queen of Qing Qiu

315
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:30,404
and that she is engaged
to the Crown Prince.

316
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:31,856
However...

317
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,625
The Crown Prince isn't just any immortal.

318
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,881
He is also the apparent heir
of the Nine Heavens!

319
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:42,884
Now that the Heavenly Lord has sent us
to bring him back, and yet Auntie...

320
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:49,912
Little Deity, this really
puts us in a dilemma!

321
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:51,625
- Exactly.
- Exactly!

322
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:59,147
Please try to talk Auntie around and
hand over His Highness's body to us.

323
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:05,767
When Auntie went in, she already said
that no one is to enter.

324
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,826
Please leave now.

325
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,480
This is...

326
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,990
Indeed...

327
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,672
We can't report back!

328
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:21,192
It seems that Auntie wouldn't
give His Highness to us.

329
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,996
It's already been ten days.

330
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,953
I think that we'd better
report back to the Celestial Palace.

331
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,461
This...

332
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:51,490
Auntie, A-Li is still in
the Celestial Palace.

333
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,453
Should we bring him back to Qing Qiu?

334
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:58,914
Do you not see that
I'm looking after Ye Hua?

335
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,551
I don't know how to talk you out of this.

336
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:26,051
High God.

337
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:30,688
Auntie has been behaving
like this all day and night.

338
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,444
What if she wears herself out?

339
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,696
I'll write you a prescription.

340
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:38,470
Make the decoction and
trick her into taking it

341
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,961
so that she could get some sleep first.

342
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:42,310
I'll get it done right away.

343
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,092
Su Jin.

344
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:08,411
As the guardian maid of the bell

345
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,117
you've failed in your duty to
alert the Celestial Palace in time.

346
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:14,634
Ye Hua had no choice but
to take on Qing Cang alone.

347
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:17,199
And he sacrificed his spirit
to seal the Bell of East Emperor!

348
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,900
Do you know what you have done?

349
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:24,215
I... I saw so many high gods there.

350
00:34:24,215 --> 00:34:27,407
I didn't want to cause them any trouble.

351
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:31,320
My cultivation isn't of much use anyway.

352
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:37,773
For the sake of the Celestial Tribe

353
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,960
your clan still went ahead
without any hesitation

354
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,898
even if they knew that
they were to be sacrificed.

355
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,409
But you...

356
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,119
You're nothing like your parents.

357
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,822
I'm totally disappointed in you.

358
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:58,331
Heavenly Lord, I beg you to
spare me this once!

359
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:02,047
Please spare me this once, Heavenly Lord!

360
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,597
Guards!

361
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,182
Greetings to Heavenly Lord...

362
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:24,398
According to the celestial law,
banish Su Jin from the Nine Heavens!

363
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:28,050
She's never to be given
a celestial status for all eternity!

364
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:35,625
Take her away!

365
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,625
Yes...

366
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:54,036
High God Bai Qian is
of a prestigious status.

367
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:59,505
The deities I sent over
dare not offend her.

368
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:06,864
I wonder if Lord Dong Hua is willing
to deign yourself to visit Qing Qiu

369
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:12,650
and assist my two sons
in bringing Ye Hua back?

370
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:24,032
I was also at the battle of Ruoshui.

371
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,443
Back then...

372
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:29,695
Forget it.

373
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:34,940
Since Heavenly Lord said so
I'll accompany both princes there.

374
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,666
I'm going with you.

375
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,639
Lord Dong Hua is already
coming with us so you won't have to.

376
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:50,070
I'm going to take a look at that
Su Su or Bai Qian...

377
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,846
I'll see what we have to do
to make her return my son.

378
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,786
My poor son...

379
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,313
Is it ready?

380
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:21,110
I wonder if Zhe Yan's drug would work
and put Auntie to sleep all day.

381
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:24,487
I'm worried that should this continue

382
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:27,891
they might send celestial guards
to snatch the Crown Prince back.

383
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:29,255
Who knows?

384
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:33,884
Who broke my celestial shield?

385
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:02,458
Feng Jiu greets Lord Dong Hua,
Prince Yang Cuo

386
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:05,063
Prince Lian Song, and Consort Le Xu.

387
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:09,525
Could you inform her that
we're here to retrieve Ye Hua?

388
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:12,132
Yes, please wait here, Lord Dong Hua.

389
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:13,489
I'll inform Auntie right away.

390
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:40,652
Le Xu!

391
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:47,211
High God Bai Qian, I've come to you
with an unfavorable request.

392
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:50,539
Although I know of
your utter devotion to Ye Hua

393
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:56,929
the Heavenly Lord and his parents
haven't seen him since he passed away.

394
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:59,659
The Heavenly Lord favors
his eldest grandson greatly.

395
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:02,251
Upon hearing the bad news
he has been devastated.

396
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,478
It's been more than ten days.

397
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:09,313
And the old lord has yet to see
the corpse of his grandson.

398
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,641
It's hardly justifiable.

399
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:19,980
So...

400
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:25,777
You're all here to take Ye Hua away?

401
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,353
Indeed.

402
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:32,195
Ye Hua's parents have already
prepared a basalt crystal coffin.

403
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:34,679
They intend to take him back
to the Celestial Tribe's

404
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,661
sacred Sea of the Innocence
to be given offerings.

405
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,759
You can't take him away.

406
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:49,760
He promised to have me
take him to Qing Qiu.

407
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:55,952
Since I learned that
you were that mortal, Su Su

408
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:59,623
I've been so worried.

409
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:04,614
This still happened in the end.

410
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:13,501
What sins had Ye Hua committed
to have died twice for you?

411
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:19,664
When you were Su Su
he devoted his heart and soul to you.

412
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:22,550
He would even give up
being the Crown Prince.

413
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,735
As for your conflict with Su Jin

414
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:29,215
the Heavenly Lord made you
compensate her with your eyes

415
00:40:29,215 --> 00:40:33,173
and three months of lightning torment
after you gave birth to A-Li.

416
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:40,626
You only gave her your eyes,
but Ye Hua took the torment for you.

417
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:48,112
When you jumped off the Zhuxian Terrace

418
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,777
Ye Hua jumped in after you.

419
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,623
But that was your trial for
godly ascension into high god.

420
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,501
What has that got to do with Ye Hua?

421
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:06,217
Ever since he met you,
he hasn't had one peaceful day.

422
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:12,362
He did so much for you
but what have you ever done for him?

423
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,612
You never did.

424
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:20,257
Yet you dare held on to him so defiantly!

425
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:25,840
Now that he's dead
you'd even hold on to his body!

426
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,626
I only have one question for you.

427
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:33,981
Bai Qian, who are you to do so?

428
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,264
That's enough.

429
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:49,543
My son slayed Qing Cang
and sacrificed his spirit

430
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:53,389
to the Bell of East Emperor to stop it
from engulfing the Nine Heavens.

431
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:56,067
He sacrificed himself for all lives
in Heaven and Earth.

432
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,322
The Heavenly Lord has made
his merits known to all.

433
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:01,123
Le Xu's opinion is
but that of a woman.

434
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:03,525
High God, please don't take it to heart.

435
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:07,797
However, it's indeed inappropriate
to keep my son's body with you.

436
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:12,382
Although my son is engaged to you
the wedding was never held.

437
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:16,668
It's somehow unjustifiable for you
to keep my son's body.

438
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,396
My son was the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe.

439
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:23,563
We have regulations in the
Celestial Palace that can't be broken.

440
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:27,659
Please allow us to take him back

441
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:31,548
to be buried in the Sea of Innocence
on the 36th day.

442
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,079
High God, please grant us this wish.

443
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,170
