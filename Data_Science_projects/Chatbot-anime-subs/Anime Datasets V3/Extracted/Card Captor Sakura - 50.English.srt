1
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:32,630
What’s going on?

2
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:33,802
Aren’t you getting up way too early,
Sakura?

3
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:36,336
Kero,

4
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:38,839
I was wondering if the recent incidents

5
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:40,870
are related

6
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:42,339
to these new cards

7
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:45,714
And also related to Clow…

8
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:50,019
Maybe…

9
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:53,052
If you keep feeling so gloomy,

10
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:55,155
you’re gonna start getting youself sick.

11
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,854
If strange things start happening again…

12
00:00:58,297 --> 00:00:59,821
What’s gonna happen

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:00,928
if you’re not feeling well

14
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:05,403
You’re right.
If anything’s gonna happen,

15
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,202
I gotta do the best

16
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:08,232
I can with my cards.

17
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:09,971
All right! And on that note,

18
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:11,502
cheer up and go to school!

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,909
[Sakura, Shao Lan
and the Invisible Threads]

20
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,011
I’m leaving.

21
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:37,663
Well, it can’t be helped since
I got here so early.

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,767
Come to think of it,

23
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:45,975
Touya said they’re having
a morning game today.

24
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:56,551
Big Brother!

25
00:01:58,424 --> 00:01:59,356
Yuki!

26
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:02,461
Yukito!!

27
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:05,258
Touya!!

28
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:16,039
Nice shoot!

29
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:17,576
That’s your nice pass.

30
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,139
Touya!! You are caught!

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,105
Hey you, stop it!!

32
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:25,275
I don’t mean being caught!

33
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,713
I’m in the middle of a game right now!!

34
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,653
Akizuki! I can’t move!

35
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,150
It’s starting already,

36
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:34,459
come on, Let’s go!

37
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:41,429
Great!

38
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,334
I’m glad that a new piano
is coming in today.

39
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,706
Yes, this way the choir
can resume practice.

40
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:51,872
Miss Tsujitani was glad about it.

41
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,873
It was such a mess.

42
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:04,354
– What happened?!
– The piano suddenly…

43
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,457
Watch out!

44
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,995
Why did the piano move all of a sudden?

45
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,491
I have never dreamed

46
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,990
that I would be chased by a piano

47
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,395
Me neither…

48
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,730
Do we not know
who is the one behind this?

49
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,232
I was sure

50
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:55,505
I sensed Clow’s aura,

51
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,270
but…

52
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,578
But Clow has passed away
a long time ago, right?

53
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,676
But it is no use keep thinking about it.

54
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:07,542
When anything happens,

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,487
I’ll still be cheerful

56
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,151
and everything’ll work out.

57
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:12,685
Right, right.

58
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,491
A smile suits best for you, Sakura.

59
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:18,289
Sakura! Tomoyo!

60
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,122
Hurry, hurry

61
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:22,228
Sorry to keep you waiting!

62
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,098
Let’s eat!

63
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:31,470
It testes so good!

64
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,605
Rika, this is good!

65
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:35,809
Thank goodness.

66
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,116
Let’s eat.

67
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:42,954
Really, this is good.

68
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,449
I would not believe this is home-made.

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,998
Rika, you’re
really good at baking cookies.

70
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,465
I’m glad

71
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,460
you like it.

72
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,033
Lately, you don’t seem cheerful,
Sakura…

73
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:05,670
Oh, I might have been mistaken…

74
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,646
That’s not it,

75
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,307
Rika. Thanks…

76
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:13,979
Excuse me,

77
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,647
I hope you don’t mind me
trying to finish up my sewing.

78
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,499
Cute bear!!

79
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:32,297
Rika, did you make that yourself.?

80
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,866
– That’s awesome!
– Awesome!

81
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:39,236
Rika, you really can make anything.

82
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:42,913
If you follow the instructions
in the book, it’s quite simple.

83
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,951
By the way, do you know

84
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,014
when a stuffed bear’s birthday is?

85
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,085
The day it is finished?

86
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,256
That would have been a good day.

87
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,455
But if you buy from a store,

88
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,229
you would not know

89
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:01,429
when it is finished, right?

90
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:02,726
That’s why

91
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,103
its birthday is the day

92
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,603
that you name the bear

93
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,497
and put a ribbon on it.

94
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,835
That’s quite wonderful, isn’t it?

95
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,144
Also overseas,

96
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:19,279
they said if you name the stuffed bear

97
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,446
you made with your own name.

98
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,311
And then give it to the person you love,

99
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,418
the two of you will fall in love

100
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,758
Is that so?

101
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:28,684
Fall in love…

102
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:32,861
Rika, you’re blushing.

103
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,094
No, I’m not…

104
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,733
Fall in love…

105
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:50,946
The girls are so cute talking about

106
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,246
a stuffed bear’s birthday.

107
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,651
You always look at me

108
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:03,995
with such scary face.

109
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:05,689
Did I do something

110
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:08,497
that displeased you?

111
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:11,901
No, you didn’t.

112
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:14,769
You were from Hong Kong, were you not?

113
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,867
I have just come to Japan,

114
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:22,341
would you mind
showing me various things?

115
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,883
Shao Lan Li…

116
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,689
Are you ok?

117
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,933
I’m fine!!!

118
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:53,943
So… Sorry about that…

119
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:58,175
What an interesting person.

120
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:03,484
Maybe you can help me out…

121
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:13,626
Good-bye!

122
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,363
– Good-bye!
– Take care.

123
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,634
I’m sorry, Sakura.

124
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,095
I can’t make it to the
handicraft store together.

125
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:24,033
It’s okay, Tomoyo’s coming with me.

126
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,038
Don’t worry about it.

127
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:26,673
Go home now, okay?

128
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:31,144
Then, I’ll see you later.

129
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:42,526
I wonder if Rika finished her bear.

130
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,755
Yes, during break time.

131
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,496
About bears, you know…

132
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,965
They were originally sea-animals.

133
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:52,936
Apparently, they used to swim

134
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,533
the seven seas in pursuit of salmon.

135
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,005
Is that so?

136
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,070
From Alaska and the
Arctic Ocean in the north,

137
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,843
to Antarctica in the south.

138
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,247
It was truly a great voyage

139
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,638
that spanned the world

140
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:06,878
On top of that, bears back then

141
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:10,684
used to able to dive deep into the ocean

142
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:11,617
That’s incredible.

143
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,192
Yeah. I’ve heard that
the white part on the neck

144
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,325
of a Japanese moonbear is…

145
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,759
a marking so that they 
don’t lose sight of each other 
in the dark depths of the ocean.

146
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:26,536
And the thing that caused them
to come up on land is…

147
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,830
No these lies again!!

148
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,375
…Because of the existence of a salmon

149
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,268
big enough to be mistaken for a whale…

150
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,012
Okay, okay, and?

151
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,174
They were lies?

152
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,185
So, shall we go?

153
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,485
Are you going to the handicraft store?

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,219
Yes, we are.

155
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,223
Do you mind if I come along?

156
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:52,989
No. I don’t.

157
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,231
I’m going too!

158
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,599
And the battle between the legendary
salmon and the bears…

159
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,667
was unfolded over the long time
period of fifty years…

160
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,269
Okay, okay, and then?

161
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,313
Mr.Terada…

162
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:15,148
What’s it?

163
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:17,182
Here.

164
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,664
Oh? It’s a stuffed bear.
It is very well made…

165
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,731
You really did a good job.

166
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,834
Hmm… Hm.

167
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,901
Would you minding having it?

168
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:42,810
This… for me?

169
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,177
Yes.

170
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,075
I’ll treasure it, Sasaki.

171
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:49,454
Thank you very much.

172
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,401
Are you mad at something, Li?

173
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,243
I’m not mad.

174
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,819
You are going to buy stuffed bears?

175
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,226
Did anything unusal happen that night?

176
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:41,596
If anything happens,

177
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:46,209
don’t just go alone, call me.

178
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,904
You might get caught in danger.

179
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:02,559
Let’s see. Bear. Bear.

180
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:03,986
There!

181
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:08,090
Thanks goodness,

182
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,897
I can buy it with my allowance.

183
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,035
For Tsukishiro??

184
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,535
Yes, What about you? Are you not buying?

185
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:19,833
For me,

186
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:23,972
For me, if the person I like most

187
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,510
can be happier
than falling in love with me.

188
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,782
I would like to keep this happiness
for this person the way it is forever.

189
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,188
You mean, it is okay even if

190
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:35,824
the person you like

191
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,228
doesn’t return the feeling?

192
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,725
If this person can return my feeling,

193
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:41,493
of course I would be really happy

194
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,694
But the greatest happiness

195
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,497
for me

196
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,201
is to let the person I like

197
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,798
have the most happiness

198
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,672
I’m sure this person you like most

199
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:57,474
is really happy as well

200
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,480
You think so?

201
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:01,846
Yup! I’m sure!

202
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:05,747
Thank you very much.

203
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:08,757
what did you buy,

204
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:10,092
Eriol?

205
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:12,789
These.

206
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:14,860
Threads?

207
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:17,561
Are you sewing something?

208
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,436
You can use threads in many ways.

209
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:21,902
Like what?

210
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:24,773
You can use them when roasting meat.

211
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:26,542
Is that real?

212
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,580
Yes, you can use them

213
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,912
like kite strings when
making roast beef.

214
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:34,319
Kite.

215
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,682
Oh? I see,

216
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,754
Li knows a lot too.

217
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,488
Not really.

218
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:06,442
How is it?

219
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,380
It’s hard…

220
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,389
Let me see. Let me see.

221
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,527
This is… a bear?

222
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:25,968
Somehow it looks more like Kero.

223
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,265
What?!

224
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:33,841
Is something wrong?

225
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,978
This…

226
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,376
This aura…

227
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:43,220
Clow’s aura.

228
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,660
Why did the brat come along?

229
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:03,030
Because I made a promise with him

230
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,601
that if anything happens,
I’ll call him.

231
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,541
Right, Li?

232
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,184
I guess he can be helpful sometimes.

233
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:15,810
What are you trying to say?

234
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,749
Anything’s better than nothing.

235
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,752
What??

236
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:25,820
Li?

237
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,944
– Li?
– Brat, what’s going on?

238
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,948
My body…

239
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,158
Move! Watch OUT!

240
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,162
Sakura!!

241
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,327
Something’s cotrolling him!

242
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:05,531
Like what?

243
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:15,778
This is Clow’s aura after all.

244
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:17,407
Could this be

245
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:19,374
Clow’s doing as well

246
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:20,612
But

247
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,680
Clow had passed away.

248
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:26,651
Watch out!

249
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,654
Tomoyo!

250
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,734
Get away from me.

251
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:37,759
I can’t.

252
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,663
I can’t leave you there.

253
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:45,239
Can’t we think of a way?

254
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:47,871
There should be something
controlling him.

255
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,372
If we can find out what it is…

256
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:53,114
But…

257
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,510
I don’t see anything at all!

258
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,255
Water dragon, come Forth!

259
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:17,636
Threads!

260
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,709
Cut them, Sakura!

261
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:26,513
O Key which hides the forces of stars,

262
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,949
reveal thy true form before me.

263
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,415
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

264
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:35,458
Release!

265
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:49,531
Sword!

266
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:09,152
She did it.

267
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:10,519
Li…

268
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:18,966
– I’m okay!
– Thank goodness.

269
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,200
Sakura, you okay?

270
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,534
Li, did you get hurt?

271
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:29,506
I’m fine but…

272
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:37,351
She fell asleep again.

273
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:40,757
It must be hard to create Sakura Cards.

274
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,963
I am sure that was Clow’s aura.

275
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:50,030
The aura of Clow Reed’s magic.

276
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,447
The threads can be used
for this too, Sakura.

277
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,051
Your spell was broken,
wasn’t it?

278
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,366
That was impressive.

279
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,705
The new Mistress of the Clow Cards.

280
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,504
Is that book interesting,

281
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,937
Spinel?

282
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,068
Yes, because this is a book

283
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:35,811
you left behind a long time ago.

284
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,142
A long time ago.

285
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,078
But why took all the trouble
to come to Japan?

286
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:47,416
Is it boring here?

287
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,027
No, not a bit.

288
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:54,730
It’s really fun, especially at school…

289
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,965
Besides, I found something nice.

290
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,736
You’re actually taking your time

291
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,937
instead of helping yourself
right to it as usual.

292
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:04,967
I’m suprised.

293
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:07,911
There’s someone of trouble around him.

294
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,778
Besides,

295
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,040
taking my time just makes
it even more tasty, right?

296
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,556
But…

297
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:21,391
couldn’t you just wear boys
uniform instead?

298
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:22,693
It doesn’t matter, does it?

299
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:28,187
And the girls’ uniform is so cute!

300
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,594
Beside, I’m not human.

301
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:36,038
Doesn’t matter if it is male
or female, right?

302
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,642
O Key which hides the forces of darkness,

303
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:42,605
reveal thy true form before me.

304
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:46,114
I, Eriol,
command thee under contract.

305
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:50,246
Release!

306
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:59,157
Return to your true form,

307
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,898
Spinel Sun, Ruby Moon.

308
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,853
Our creator, Eriol,

309
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:29,555
whose name from previous life

310
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,019
is Clow Reed.

311
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,833
What’s your intention
of coming here?

312
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,933
To make things interesting.
