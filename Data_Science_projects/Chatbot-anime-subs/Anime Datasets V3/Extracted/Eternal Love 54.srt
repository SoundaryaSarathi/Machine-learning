<i>[Episode 54]</i>

3
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,745
That's because I was too silly.

4
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:17,633
I thought that I shouldn't be too
concerned about his past.

5
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:27,377
But then when I saw him recognize
that woman instead of me...

6
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:38,879
I knew then that the one on
his mind isn't me, it's her.

7
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:48,413
I know that he loved that woman
more deeply than he loves me.

8
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,121
Perhaps it was because
I had my eyes covered

9
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:04,201
and resembled his deceased wife
that he fell for me.

10
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:13,585
Auntie, why don't you ask
the Crown Prince when he returns?

11
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:18,224
If he really took you for a substitute,
we'll break off the engagement.

12
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,752
I've never seen you so upset.

13
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:31,656
Fourth Uncle said that
when Mo Yuan was vanquished

14
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:33,788
you were as good as half-dead.

15
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:36,271
But you seem even worse than that today.

16
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:37,724
I can't bear to see you like this.

17
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,740
That's enough.

18
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,002
I'd like to be left alone.

19
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,776
Auntie, you really don't want
me to keep you company?

20
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:44,893
We could just chat.

21
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,497
That's enough. Don't say another word!

22
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:51,787
I'm just trapped in my own thoughts
so I'm hard on myself.

23
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:56,320
Auntie, for the sake of Qing Qiu,
you must take care of yourself.

24
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,772
For the sake of Qing Qiu?

25
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,366
Yes...

26
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,560
If I break this engagement off...

27
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,766
all I can do is return to
Qing Qiu as the Queen.

28
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,310
Leave now.

29
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,644
Yes.

30
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:31,014
Why is the light so strong...

31
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,456
I don't believe that
I can't put your light out.

32
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:52,812
<i>Since we've made our vows
to the Lakes of the Far East</i>

33
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:55,257
<i>we have to stay as
a married couple for life.</i>

34
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,288
<i>Ye Hua!</i>

35
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:02,718
<i>The Nine Heavens is not a place
for a woman like you!</i>

36
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:06,738
<i>Just jump off Zhuxian Terrace
and go back to where you came from.</i>

37
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:09,334
<i>Ye Hua, believe me. I didn't push her!</i>

38
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,714
<i>- I didn't push her!
- Su Su...</i>

39
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:14,059
<i>I couldn't protect you.</i>

40
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:17,613
<i>I'll marry you and be
your eyes from now on.</i>

41
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,891
<i>No... Ye Hua... I didn't do it.</i>

42
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,293
<i>Why do I have to pay the price for it?</i>

43
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:25,076
<i>Let me go and I'll let you go as well.</i>

44
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,675
<i>We don't owe each other anymore.</i>

45
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:49,829
<i>Su Su...</i>

46
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:56,497
<i>Ye Hua... I'm actually Su Su.</i>

47
00:06:56,497 --> 00:07:01,399
<i>Su Su is me.</i>

48
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:30,795
Auntie, you're having more wine?

49
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,547
Auntie, what's wrong?

50
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,238
Leave now.

51
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,711
Master must have been bewitched.

52
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:45,361
He kept looking for
some celestial land called Qing Qiu.

53
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,746
He rejected all the offers of marriage

54
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:51,537
and enraged Old Madam so much
that she died of illness.

55
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:56,567
I've heard from a traveling Taoist
that Qing Qiu is the den of fox spirits!

56
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,840
Could our master be bewitched
by a fox spirit?

57
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,304
You shouldn't gossip
behind our master's back.

58
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,590
Miss, all these years

59
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,869
Old Madam tried to send you
into our master's room by force.

60
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,924
You turned her down each time.

61
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,933
It hasn't been easy for you either.

62
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:21,495
Master is a faithful man.

63
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,760
The deity of Qing Qiu is the
only woman on his mind.

64
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,633
Not me.

65
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:05,066
Auntie, would you care
to wash your face?

66
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:08,971
Feng Jiu...

67
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,254
Back in the Nine Heavens

68
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:18,732
did you visit the
Hall of Beautiful Youth as a little fox?

69
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,134
Yes, indeed.

70
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:31,256
When Su Su was pregnant
and no one was there to accompany her

71
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,267
were you the only one by her side?

72
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:39,654
Su Su...

73
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:42,934
When she was first captured by
Heavenly Lord to the palace

74
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:47,072
you went to scare her?

75
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:52,926
Is that because you thought that
she stole your aunt's fiancee?

76
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,245
How did you know about that?

77
00:10:56,245 --> 00:11:01,633
No one else knew apart from me,
Lord Dong Hua, and Star Lord.

78
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:13,759
That's because I'm Riceball's
mortal mother.

79
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,940
I am Su Su.

80
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:24,647
Auntie, are you drunk?

81
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:28,072
I know that you're mad at
the Crown Prince

82
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,769
for having Su Su on his mind.

83
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,253
But you're the Queen of Qing Qiu
and Su Su was a mortal.

84
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,291
How could she be compared to you?

85
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,827
Su Su is just Su Su and you are you!

86
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:53,077
That was a heavenly trial I endured
before I ascended to High God.

87
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,186
Ye Hua and I...

88
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,669
That was my relationship trial.

89
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,013
Auntie, where are you going?

90
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,261
Auntie...

91
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:18,589
Auntie!

92
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,706
Auntie, mind your health.

93
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,613
You've been drinking
for seven or eight days.

94
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,278
There's no wine left in the cellar.

95
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,077
If you ask for more wine
I won't give it to you.

96
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:36,417
I feel just fine.

97
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,919
Was that just talk
or were you serious about it?

98
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,527
I'm certainly sure of it.

99
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,001
I just recalled another important matter.

100
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:53,818
Auntie, what can you recall
when you're half drunk?

101
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:58,054
When I was made a mortal for
my relationship trial

102
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,735
Su Jin robbed me of my eyes.

103
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:04,673
Now that I'm done with
my heavenly trial

104
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:10,562
it seems inappropriate to keep
my eyes in her sockets.

105
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:14,730
She must be uneasy
keeping those eyes of mine.

106
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,287
Shouldn't I go and get them back?

107
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,984
Auntie, that's drunk talk.

108
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:23,139
When did Lady Su Jin owe you
a pair of eyes?

109
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,350
You don't know a thing
so I won't explain it to you.

110
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,970
Xiao Jiu, tell me.

111
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,640
Shouldn't I get my eyes back?

112
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,418
If Auntie really was Su Su

113
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:36,580
you endured such grievances
in the Celestial Palace.

114
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,479
You should get your eyes back.

115
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,447
I'll be right back.

116
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,035
Don't come after me!

117
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,799
If Auntie really was Su Su
that is simply tragic.

118
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,852
What is tragic?

119
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:54,431
You don't have a clue.

120
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,563
Su Su was treated poorly
and ignored in the Celestial Palace.

121
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:58,897
She was even wronged...

122
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,533
Anyway, it was just tragic!

123
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,227
If it were that tragic
it's only right to take her eyes back.

124
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,028
Exactly.

125
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,821
No, it's too dangerous.

126
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,936
I can't let Auntie be
at a disadvantage again.

127
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,789
If she's picking a fight in
the Nine Heavens

128
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,889
how could I not assist her?

129
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,912
Auntie!

130
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:18,941
Auntie!

131
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,460
Who are you to keep out
the Queen of Qing Qiu?

132
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,731
Greetings to Auntie!

133
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,731
Don't stand on ceremony.

134
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:04,298
You can't recognize me?

135
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,854
It's my fault that I'd only stayed
in Taichen Palace

136
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,222
so you can't recognize me.

137
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,567
Step aside! Let me in!

138
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,101
The Nine Heavens isn't just
any place you can barge in.

139
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:18,924
You mentioned Taichen Palace
to scare us off with Lord Dong Hua?

140
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,504
Step aside now!

141
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,989
I'm the princess of Qing Qiu
Bai Feng Jiu!

142
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,254
If you had introduced yourself first
we might have believed you.

143
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:32,221
Yet now the Queen of Qing Qiu had
just entered and here comes the princess.

144
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,865
How could there be such a coincidence?

145
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,908
This is so frustrating!

146
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:38,722
Listen up!

147
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:41,014
Should any mishap befall
upon the future Heavenly Empress

148
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:43,067
the Crown Prince will
have you punished!

149
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:56,931
High God!

150
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,779
High God, my mistress is...

151
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,272
Su Jin is surprised
by High God's sudden visit.

152
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:30,442
I suppose that you're here to ask me
about His Highness's recent news.

153
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,563
Speaking of His Highness...

154
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:39,272
That fake Su Su gets along with him
and takes good care of him.

155
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,317
That's very good.

156
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:52,153
I'm much relieved that
you've attended to Ye Hua.

157
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:57,635
Therefore, today I'm here
to attend to you.

158
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:09,401
Su Jin, you've been using
my eyes for 300 years.

159
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,355
Are they any good?

160
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,277
You...

161
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,570
What did you just say?

162
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,163
What is it?

163
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:25,653
You've been using this pair
of eyes for so long

164
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,961
that you forgot where you got them from?

165
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:32,448
300 years ago...

166
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,673
I had a relationship trial.

167
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:37,384
My eyes were lost here.

168
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:42,525
It dawned on me,
so I've come to retrieve them.

169
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,152
You...

170
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:51,446
You're Su Su?

171
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:55,933
Will you do it yourself?

172
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:00,205
Or will you have me do it for you?

173
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,248
That's impossible...

174
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,182
How could you be...

175
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,300
That's impossible...

176
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,909
That's not possible...

177
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,579
It's impossible...

178
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:22,832
Will you dig them out yourself
or will you have me do it?

179
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:26,749
That woman...

180
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:29,717
She was just a mortal!

181
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,902
She couldn't be you...

182
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,531
She was just a mortal...

183
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,451
She couldn't be you... She can't be...

184
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,843
What does it matter if she's a mortal
or a deity?

185
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:46,193
Just because I acted cowardly
as a mortal 300 years ago

186
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:50,631
doesn't mean that a puny deity
like you can dig my eyes out

187
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,832
and trick me into jumping off
the Zhuxian Terrace!

188
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,304
I...

189
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:06,067
It seems that you can't
bear to do it yourself.

190
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:15,159
There have been a couple of
joyous occasions lately

191
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,926
so I drank a bit too much.

192
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:19,405
My hands now tremble slightly.

193
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,224
It might hurt a bit more
when I dig them out.

194
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,067
Do bear with me.

195
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,534
Don't dig out my eyes!

196
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,115
Don't dig out my eyes!

197
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,701
Fine.

198
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,711
300 years ago, you were
just as pretentious.

199
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,269
Whenever I saw you
you were always acting frail.

200
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,396
Could you not impress me
by showing me

201
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,917
how you are when you're not a weakling?

202
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:57,212
When Ye Hua took my eyes away

203
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:03,826
he told me that we all have to
pay for what we owe.

204
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:14,463
We both know very well how
you lost your eyes in the first place.

205
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,836
We also know very well how my eyes
ended up in your eye sockets.

206
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,922
I've been meaning to ask you.

207
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:38,604
Why can't I take back
what was originally mine?

208
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,604
How did my eyes become yours

209
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:43,001
just because they were kept
with you for 300 years?

210
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:05,604
The Heavenly Lord concluded
this case quietly 300 years ago.

211
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,818
I'll get this done quietly.

212
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:20,377
You owe me two times.

213
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:23,079
Once for my eyes...

214
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,916
Then there was that accident
at the Zhuxian Terrace.

215
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:32,405
The debt of my eyes is now paid.

216
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:38,026
As for the accident
at the Zhuxian Terrace...

217
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:46,084
It's either you jumped off
the Zhuxian Terrace properly...

218
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:57,163
Or you could tell the Heavenly Lord that
you're willing to use your feeble powers

219
00:21:57,163 --> 00:22:00,369
to guard the Bell of East Emperor
that imprisoned Qing Cang.

220
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,500
You are never to step
inside the Celestial Palace again.

221
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,916
No...

222
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,828
No... Never!

223
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,919
Well done.

224
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,826
You finally acted tough for once?

225
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:32,954
You mean you'd rather
I speak to the Heavenly Lord myself?

226
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,678
You should know how I am.

227
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:41,700
I change my mind quickly.

228
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,155
I might not suggest the same punishment
to the Heavenly Lord.

229
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,654
What goes around comes around.

230
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,861
Go to the Medicine King.

231
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:03,241
Your Highness!

232
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:06,645
Your Highness!

233
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,491
Your Highness...

234
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:10,340
Your Highness...

235
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:15,839
Bai Qian!

236
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,769
I won't let this go!

237
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:33,573
While Ye Hua is away
from the Celestial Palace

238
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:38,134
he has his guard, Tian Shu
watch over Ruoshui.

239
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,327
Could it be that
there's some sort of a problem?

240
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:45,103
I reckon that since His Highness's
wedding is coming up soon

241
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,425
he's worried about
any disturbances in the Ghost Tribe.

242
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,824
After all, Ruoshui River is the border of
the Celestial Tribe and the Ghost Tribe.

243
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:52,451
It's best to keep it guarded.

244
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,433
It can't be that simple.

245
00:23:57,545 --> 00:24:00,611
Your Lordship suspects that
it concerns the Bell of East Emperor?

246
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:04,417
If you're right, then it is a huge issue.

247
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:07,354
The Crown Prince shouldn't
keep it from anyone.

248
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,280
If Ye Hua kept it to himself
he must have his reasons.

249
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,609
Come with me to Ruoshui.

250
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:19,689
Yes.

251
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,813
This is really annoying!

252
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,928
How could the both of you
not know who I am?

253
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,953
I'm such good friends with
Star Lord of Destiny and Lady Cheng Yu!

254
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,689
If you don't believe me
you can bring them here.

255
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,448
I'm Bai Feng Qiu of Qing Qiu!

256
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:33,953
The Little Princess of Qing Qiu!

257
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,801
That seems to be the Little Princess?

258
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,414
<i>You can't barge into
the Nine Heavens.</i>

259
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,060
<i>Miss, stop insisting.</i>

260
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,086
Go and take a look.

261
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,217
Yes.

262
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,655
Little Princess.

263
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,867
What brings you
to the Nine Heavens today?

264
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,450
Star Lord, tell them who I am.

265
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,992
The Little Princess of Qing Qiu.

266
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:59,000
Gentlemen, do let her through.

267
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,932
Lord Dong Hua is waiting for
Her Highness in Taichen Palace.

268
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,287
Don't try anything silly.

269
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:10,634
The celestial law is very rigid.

270
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,488
Even Lord Dong Hua can't help you.

271
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,078
I'm not!

272
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,693
My aunt came here for Lady Su Jin.

273
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:17,224
I can't let her lose!

274
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,336
What?

275
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:26,663
My aunt is actually the mortal
Su Su whom the Crown Prince loved deeply.

276
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:29,970
High God is Su Su?

277
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:32,087
Do not deceive me.

278
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,626
I am not! Seriously!

279
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:38,166
My aunt broke the Soul-gathering Lamp
and remembered her forgotten past.

280
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:42,744
She said that she became Su Su for her
godly ascension trial into High God.

281
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:48,343
I see... I get it now.

282
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:50,633
Yes, now that my aunt recalled her past

283
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,310
she's come to get her eyes
back from Lady Su Jin.

284
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,829
Do you remember back then when
Lady Su Jin fell off the Zhuxian Terrace

285
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:58,659
she said that Su Su pushed her?

286
00:25:58,659 --> 00:25:59,659
That's right.

287
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,431
After my aunt recalled her past
she knew that Su Jin had framed her.

288
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:05,723
That's why she has now come to
get her eyes back from Lady Su Jin.

289
00:26:05,723 --> 00:26:08,391
Wouldn't that stir up a huge commotion?

290
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,457
Exactly!

291
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,170
I can't stay to chat much longer.

292
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,894
I'm worried that my aunt will lose.
I have to go to Xiwu Palace now!

293
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:15,108
Little Princess!

294
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:16,647
Little... Little Princess!

295
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,211
Quickly, Xin Nu!

296
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,931
We'll be there soon, Your Highness.

297
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:23,106
Quickly!

298
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:24,134
Quickly!

299
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:25,416
Su Jin!

300
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,048
What happened to your eyes?

301
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:28,078
Uncles!

302
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:31,401
Uncles, you must uphold justice for me!

303
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,271
Quickly, take me to the Grand Hall!

304
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,396
- Quickly!
- Su Jin!

305
00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:35,993
Stop right there!

306
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:40,101
Where is my aunt?

307
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,381
Your aunt?

308
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:44,267
She robbed me of my eyes!

309
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm just about to report her
to the Heavenly Lord!

310
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,993
You're such an evil woman.

311
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:51,785
First, you framed my aunt for
pushing you off the Zhuxian Terrace

312
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:53,767
and made the Crown Prince
dig out her eyes.

313
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,586
My aunt was devastated and
jumped off the Zhuxian Terrace.

314
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:59,490
Those eyes are my aunt's
so they should be returned to her!

315
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,922
Don't falsely accuse me!

316
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:04,692
How would I know that
Su Su is actually your aunt?

317
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,269
So what if I knew that she is your aunt?

318
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:10,217
She pretended to be frail
and pushed me off the Zhuxian Terrace!

319
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:12,569
She had to compensate me
with her eyes for blinding me!

320
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,703
She has to do so even if
she is a high god!

321
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:15,703
You!

322
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,482
Women of Qing Qiu are born prestigious.

323
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:21,326
Every one of you are born a princess.

324
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:22,673
So?

325
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:25,615
Are women of the Celestial Tribe
born to be bullied?

326
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:27,645
Why are you so evil?

327
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,788
How dare you slander Qing Qiu!

328
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:32,396
Your aunt pushed me off
the Zhuxian Terrace

329
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:34,434
so she had to give me her eyes.

330
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:37,172
Could she do whatever she wants
just because she's a high god?

331
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,968
Where do you think you are?

332
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,657
This is the Nine Heavens!

333
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,545
Listen up, Bai Feng Jiu!

334
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:48,068
Don't assume that you and your aunt
can cover up the truth!

335
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,099
Whatever you say today

336
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,055
your aunt has to pay
for what she did to me!

337
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:54,955
Give me back my eyes!

338
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:56,200
- You...
- Su Jin.

339
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,599
Why don't I understand
a word of this?

340
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,994
What happened?

341
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:03,000
Why would you be in a conflict
with the immortals of Qing Qiu?

342
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,392
Uncle, it's Qing Qiu's Bai Qian!

343
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:08,775
She dug out my eyes!

344
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,883
What?

345
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,624
Why would she dig out your eyes?

346
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:12,711
She...

347
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,598
She was Su Su.

348
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:17,167
High God Bai Qian was that mortal?

349
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,284
Exactly.

350
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:19,788
Don't believe a word she says!

351
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,134
She's so full of nonsense!

352
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,519
- How dare you!
- Your Highness...

353
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,605
Do you not know what this place is?

354
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,915
You think that you can
raise your voice here

355
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,596
just because Qing Qiu has your back?

356
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:30,569
You have no manners at all.

357
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:34,353
Uncles, take me to the Grand Hall.

358
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:37,796
I have to report it to the Heavenly Lord.

359
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:43,381
Even if I'm forced to give in
to Qing Qiu, I must explain this matter.

360
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:45,983
My eyes don't matter.

361
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:48,424
What matters is the integrity
of the Celestial Tribe!

362
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:49,836
Su Jin, don't worry.

363
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,522
Whatever the truth might be
the Heavenly Lord will sort it out.

364
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,666
Fear not. We'll go with you.

365
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,277
- Yes.
- Let's go.

366
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,277
Let's go.

367
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,906
I can't let her bewitch
the Heavenly Lord!

368
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:10,896
She's the one lying...

369
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,299
Don't hold me back!

370
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,073
Come with me.

371
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,508
Greetings to High God.

372
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:53,797
<i>Ye Hua...</i>

373
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:58,978
<i>Do you know that the pain
I endured 300 years ago</i>

374
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:00,662
<i>ached as if it were just yesterday?</i>

375
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:07,156
<i>Whatever theory or reason it was
you had for doing what you did</i>

376
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:08,886
<i>to protect my mortal self</i>

377
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:11,109
<i>I couldn't care less
and I don't care about it.</i>

378
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,496
<i>All I remember is
the numerous lonely nights</i>

379
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:16,691
<i>I spent in the Hall of Beautiful Youth</i>

380
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:22,855
<i>while my last glimmer of hope
slowly died away...</i>

381
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,730
Ye Hua...

382
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:31,440
How could I still marry you?

383
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:02,094
I heard you finished all the wine
that Bai Zhen stashed away in the cellar.

384
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:05,519
You're not here to ask me
for more wine, are you?

385
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,934
You still managed to get this pair
of eyes back after 300 years.

386
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,275
That's quite a miracle.

387
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:27,642
It's an even greater miracle
that you could still recall

388
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:31,689
your past after taking my amnesia potion.

389
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,296
Once eyes are taken from
an immortal's body

390
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:40,576
they have to be used within
49 days or they will expire, right?

391
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,599
I thought that your eyes were gone.

392
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,309
Who knew that they had
been planted into someone's sockets?

393
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,538
You've even brought them back now.

394
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,510
Put my eyes back for me.

395
00:31:54,054 --> 00:32:01,069
That's not a problem. First, I have to
cleanse the foul aura off.

396
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:03,358
Then I can put them back for you.

397
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,089
There's no rush.

398
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:11,442
Qian Qian, you still haven't told me
who took your eyes from you.

399
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,474
It was just a relationship trial.

400
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:16,923
It's not worth mentioning.

401
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:37,022
Su Su...

402
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:43,067
Master...

403
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:59,019
Do you know...why I named you Su Su?

404
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,250
You've never mentioned it.

405
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:07,871
It's because when I first met you

406
00:33:07,871 --> 00:33:11,021
you were in
a plain (Su in Chinese) outfit.

407
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:20,328
Su Su...

408
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:30,309
I've been waiting for
one person my whole life.

409
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:38,558
I know that you've been waiting
for a fairy from Qing Qiu.

410
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,326
Yes.

411
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:47,477
She came to me when I was 11 years old.

412
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:54,840
She said that she'd marry me when
I'm grown up.

413
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,448
Sadly, she never came again.

414
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:06,439
It's said that deities
live for a long time.

415
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:16,072
My short life is but
a ten some days of her life.

416
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:26,447
It seems... that I won't be
able to wait any longer.

417
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,422
Master...

418
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,563
You've stayed single all your life.

419
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:40,023
You've never been
unfaithful to that fairy.

420
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,117
Will she blame me for
breaking our promise?

421
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,096
After my death...

422
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:12,356
Burn me to ashes and bury
this string of beads with me.

423
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:35,268
Master?

424
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:39,280
- Master!
- Master!

425
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,559
- Master...
- Master...

426
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:51,407
- Master...
- Master...

427
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,563
<i>Kunlun Mountain?</i>

428
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>Why am I here?</i>

429
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:14,387
Ye Hua.

430
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:22,672
High God Mo Yuan?

431
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:34,351
Ye Hua...

432
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,056
Perhaps you should address me
as your older brother instead.

433
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:43,208
My older brother?

434
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:49,960
You're Heavenly Father's son
and my younger twin brother.

435
00:36:54,818 --> 00:37:00,239
It was because of an accident
that your spirit went into deep slumber.

436
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,588
Hence, our father had you
placed into a golden lotus.

437
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,833
Before he went into
the realm of nothingness

438
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:11,903
he entrusted you to me
and I took you back to Kunlun Mountain.

439
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:15,478
I kept you in this lotus pond
to await your awakening.

440
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,751
When Bai Qian was training here

441
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:28,746
she loved to look after you,
her golden lotus.

442
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:35,722
Perhaps, it was destined.

443
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:44,496
It's a fated romance that
you should both cherish.

444
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,050
I was actually in meditation.

445
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,914
However, I wished to see you.

446
00:37:54,914 --> 00:37:59,603
After all, I've waited for this day
for some hundred thousands of years.

447
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,420
Heavenly Lord...

448
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,983
- Heavenly Lord!
- Su Jin!

449
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,518
- Heavenly Lord.
- Heavenly Lord.

450
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:21,219
Heavenly Lord!

451
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,695
<i>Lord Dong Hua.</i>

452
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:26,461
Heavenly Lord, you must
uphold justice for me!

453
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:30,077
You knew what happened then.

454
00:38:30,077 --> 00:38:33,295
You must uphold justice
for me, Heavenly Lord!

455
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:45,505
Get up.

456
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,327
No, I can't get up.

457
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:54,027
If I do, it means that
I admit to this accusation.

458
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:59,490
High God Bai Qian not only
dug out my eyes, but also...

459
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:04,503
But she also wants me to apologize for
her fall from the Zhuxian Terrace.

460
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:06,753
She asked that I'm to be
stripped of my celestial status

461
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:10,945
and stand guard at Ruoshui Riverbank
to watch over the Bell of East Emperor.

462
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:13,443
Never am I to return to
the Celestial Palace.

463
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:18,373
Although the Celestial Tribe is
indebted to Qing Qiu because of Sang Ji

464
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:23,405
we mustn't allow that high god
to accuse our tribesman at will.

465
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,771
Exactly.

466
00:39:24,771 --> 00:39:29,400
If we were to let anyone bully Su Jin
how could we face our deceased brother?

467
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,507
You...

468
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:33,059
You can't take Su Jin's side
of the tale seriously.

469
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,376
You have to hear me out!
And my aunt as well!

470
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:38,519
You aunt left after
digging Su Jin's eyes out!

471
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,612
She's the Queen of Qing Qiu.

472
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,913
She's also addressed as Auntie

473
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,860
by all in the four seas and
the Eight Far Lands.

474
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,407
How could we possibly ask her here?

475
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,771
If she wishes to explain herself
to the Celestial Tribe

476
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,811
she shouldn't have done
this deed quietly and fled!

477
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:54,251
My aunt left quietly to
save the Celestial Tribe some dignity.

478
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:56,297
Would you rather have her announce
to the four seas

479
00:39:56,297 --> 00:40:00,202
that your Lady Su Jin was already
very evil as a heavenly concubine?

480
00:40:00,202 --> 00:40:02,918
She bullied a helpless mortal
snatched her husband away

481
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:05,731
robbed her of her eyes and forced her
to jump off the Zhuxian Terrace?

482
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:07,789
How could such a young lass
be so ruthless?

483
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:12,291
Your aunt dug out my eyes
and you're still lying for her!

484
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:17,438
The Celestial Tribe is such a bully!

485
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,773
Why would you only believe in her?

486
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,655
Isn't it enough to frame my aunt once?

487
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:23,981
You have to do it twice?

488
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:25,045
Atrocious!

489
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,275
I...

490
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,364
Atrocious indeed.

491
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,525
Lord Dong Hua, aren't you
here to help me?

492
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,731
Why are you now standing up for Su Jin?

493
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,737
This is one mysterious case.

494
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,891
Everyone tells a different story.

495
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:50,728
I have some words to say
that might offend Heavenly Lord.

496
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:54,193
But I think that there's a need
for me to speak my mind.

497
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,123
Do tell, Lord Dong Hua.

498
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:59,614
This matter concerns
the Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu.

499
00:40:59,614 --> 00:41:02,599
Su Jin was once your concubine.

500
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,702
You shouldn't get involved in it.

501
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,902
Otherwise, tongues will wag.

502
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:13,039
Qing Qiu will deem us unjust
in trying this case.

503
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,851
You mean...

504
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:22,001
Everyone knows that I was once
the God of Heaven and Earth.

505
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm not related to any clans.

506
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,711
My harem is vacant and
I distance myself from worldly affairs.

507
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:33,371
It's best to leave the hearing
of this case to me

508
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,222
so as to appease all parties.

509
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:40,927
Your Lordship and
Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu...

510
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,005
What now?

511
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,766
Have I not made myself clear?

512
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:48,219
<i>He's trying to make me
withdraw from this matter?</i>

513
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,003
<i>Is this so we could answer to Qing Qiu?</i>

514
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:53,398
<i>Judging by the circumstances
I can't defend her anymore.</i>

515
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:55,521
<i>She's on her own now.</i>

516
00:41:56,385 --> 00:42:02,257
I think that Lord Dong Hua has a point.

517
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:06,710
I'll only attend the hearing
without voicing any opinion.

518
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,831
Su Jin, do you think that
I will favor Qing Qiu?

519
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,635
I... I wouldn't dare doubt Your Lordship.

520
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,943
How about you?

521
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:27,543
Do you think that I'd favor Bai Qian?

522
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:31,288
We wouldn't dare think so.

523
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:36,242
Su Jin, take your time.
