00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:40,565
Huh? When did I happen
to get down from that cliff?

2
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:46,060
Last night, I was looking
at the moon, and then...

3
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:54,846
And then, I don't remember anything.

4
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,515
Oh, well.

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,506
I need to wash my face.

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,556
Something sure is weird!

7
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:15,533
Huh? Wha-? Huh?
It's gone! My tail!

8
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,366
I wonder if it got pulled off
while I was asleep.

9
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,206
Huh?

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,541
My clothes have changed!

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,374
Huh? That's strange.

12
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,201
Don't come over here!
Huh? A sword?

13
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,172
Stay back!

14
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,663
Don't! I don't want
to do this, you know!

15
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:06,613
Why are they just after me!?

16
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,953
I don't taste very good!

17
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,885
Help!

18
00:02:57,168 --> 00:03:00,604
Oh, I'm so hungry!
Ain't there anything to eat?

19
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,306
That's a picture of a <i>vimana</i>,
from the Nemurian civilization!

20
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:46,680
It's just like the one
that tried to catch me.

21
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:18,014
A 3-S Series prototype. This is
an incredibly old capsule robot.

22
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:29,861
Who's there? I was
sleeping so pleasantly.

23
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,529
I- it spoke!

24
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:34,199
Who is it that's there?

25
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,536
M- my name... is Son Gohan!

26
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:44,270
Don't talk so loudly. Sand will fall down
here at even the slightest vibration.

27
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,545
I'm Son Gohan.

28
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,547
Son Gohan...

29
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:53,151
Mister, what are you doing here?

30
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:58,384
That's no business of yours. Turn off
my switch and leave here at once.

31
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,494
Leave here?

32
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:05,395
There is an exit behind me.

33
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,503
All right!

34
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,171
I'm saved!

35
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:16,841
Wait! Turn off my switch before you go.

36
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,206
Sorry about that.

37
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:23,541
Thanks, mister.

38
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,263
Mister!

39
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,872
It's no good going that way!

40
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:51,209
Y- you fool!
Don't talk so loudly!

41
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,145
I can't get down from there.

42
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,481
Is that any of my concern?

43
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,815
But...

44
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:02,820
I told you not to turn on my switch,
didn't I? I wish to remain asleep.

45
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,489
But still...

46
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,158
Hurry up and go.

47
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,829
I can't get down from there! I'll die!

48
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,694
Don't cry!

49
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,637
Don't cry. That exit is the only one.

50
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,507
If you want to survive,
jump down from there.

51
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,841
You don't mean it!

52
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,177
Why are you acting like such a baby?

53
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,442
If you stay here,
you'll just be buried in sand.

54
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,483
Hurry up and go.

55
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,520
Are you gone?

56
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,548
Ah, Son Gohan! My switch!
Turn off my switch before you go!

57
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:48,866
He left without turning off my switch.
I'm just wasting my energy like this.

58
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,535
Mister?

59
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,470
Y- you're still there?

60
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,341
Mister, your visual sensors
are damaged, huh?

61
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:57,603
I'll fix them for you.

62
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,478
S- stop it!

63
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:09,182
Stop! Mind your own business! I don't
need visual sensors any more! S- stop!

64
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,157
Can you see now?

65
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:19,163
There's no point in you doing this.
Hmm, you're still a child, aren't you?

66
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:23,167
I'm surprised that someone like you
would be in a dangerous place like this.

67
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:28,537
Right, see? There's no way I could
jump down from that place, you see?

68
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:33,177
Unless you want to die here,
you should be able to.

69
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:36,340
But Mister, if you'd
just cooperate with me!

70
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:39,248
Do not turn to me!

71
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:45,679
And don't turn on my switch again.
You got that?

72
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:58,970
Now, turn off my switch, and then get
out of here. I wish to sleep quietly.

73
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,302
Hurry now, turn off my switch.

74
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,928
Mother...

75
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:31,361
Is it okay if I eat all of this?

76
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,859
I can still eat more and more!

77
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:51,082
Mister!

78
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,416
Wake up!

79
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,686
Again? I told you not to wake me.

80
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,355
T- there's a scorpion!

81
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:01,291
There's bound to be one
or two scorpions around.

82
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,695
I'm scared.

83
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:08,699
Turn off my switch. Don't make me
say the same thing over and over.

84
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,894
--But...
--Hurry up.

85
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,639
Oh, I am so hungry!

86
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,440
I wonder if I can eat these clouds.

87
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,387
It's me. I'm hungry.

88
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:34,725
Cut it out already. Don't turn on
my switch over such trivial things!

89
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,060
But...

90
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,860
There's no reason for there to be
anything to eat here, is there?

91
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:45,832
Scorpions and snakes are about all
the things you <i>can</i> eat around here.

92
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,307
Don't cry!

93
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm hungry!

94
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:01,379
Don't use such a loud voice!
You'll be buried too.

95
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:05,652
A- all right, but just this once.

96
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:12,330
Let's see. At this time of year,
inside this cave...

97
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,032
Go search all the deeper corners.

98
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:16,124
Right.

99
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,772
Ah, I've eaten! I've eaten!

100
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,715
I found some, I found some!

101
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,716
All of this.

102
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:35,386
Then you don't need me anymore, right?
Turn off my switch.

103
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:38,389
But I can't eat these raw.

104
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,727
You won't be able to survive
in these plains like that.

105
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:46,322
Mister, you have a cooking system, huh?

106
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:49,400
I read so in a robot picture book.

107
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,338
You're a 3-S type all-purpose
capsule robot C-6, right Mister?

108
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,331
It says in my picture book
that you're quite a superior robot.

109
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,505
W- well, I guess so.
Shall I fry those up for you?

110
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,685
Open up my head.

111
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,687
Right.

112
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,022
Set it down inside.

113
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,023
Right.

114
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,957
--Close it.
--Right.

115
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:21,032
What kind of flavor do you want?
Chinese-style? Western-style?

116
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,034
My mother's style!

117
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,502
How should I know what that is?

118
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,966
It's done.

119
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,709
Yow-ow-ow...

120
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,377
Mister, it's too hot.

121
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,380
Am I to blame for that as well?

122
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,211
" I humbly accept this food."

123
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,720
How is it that you're
in this sort of place?

124
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,055
This is yucky.

125
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,726
I'm lost. I want to go back
to my mother's place,

126
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,728
but I don't know what I should do.

127
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,431
That is rough, huh?

128
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:58,459
It's not possible for a little kid
like you to cross the desert.

129
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:05,833
Having said that, it will be even harder
for you to live in this desert.

130
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:10,348
Mister, what is it
that brought you here?

131
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:11,682
An accident.

132
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,351
An accident?

133
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:16,120
It was an investigation
into excavating these ruins.

134
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,024
No sooner had I found this place than,
hmm, I ended up like this.

135
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:24,795
The ground around here is not very firm,
so earthquakes are constantly occurring.

136
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:27,698
I've been here in the sand ever since.

137
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:31,035
This Nemurian temple was
a great discovery, wasn't it?

138
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,371
How do you know about that?

139
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,842
It said so in a picture book.
Anyhow, there might be someone else

140
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:41,045
who comes searching the area
that helps us out, huh?

141
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:45,505
It's been eighty years now
since I've been buried in the sand.

142
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,719
Hey, what are you doing!?

143
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:51,389
I'm going... to get you...
out of here, Mister!

144
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,292
Stop that! I want
to stay with this city!

145
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,728
Mind your own business!
Leave me alone like this!

146
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,668
You can leave here together with me!

147
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,804
Don't worry about me.

148
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,008
I can store up energy and leap
out of here all at once. Stop!

149
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,344
I'm losing my balance!

150
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:14,709
Watch out!

151
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:26,087
Get out of here, quickly!
The cave is collapsing!

152
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,460
--But...
--Hurry and get to the exit!

153
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,028
You don't want to die, do you?

154
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,364
You come with me too, Mister!

155
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:39,437
That's all right. I will turn out okay.
I'm a superior 3-S type, after all.

156
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,704
Hurry and get going!

157
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:44,708
There, it's settled down.
Go now, while you can!

158
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,539
Don't cause me any more trouble!

159
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,538
Right...

160
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:54,711
Now, summon up your courage
and jump with all your might.

161
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,016
What's the matter? Son Gohan!

162
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:03,354
Jump! Jump, I say!

163
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:06,891
All right!

164
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,673
I have to turn off your switch!

165
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:18,039
You fool! Don't come back!

166
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,146
Mister!

167
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,314
Son Gohan...

168
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,693
It appears you're okay, right?

169
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,184
The exit has been blocked.

170
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:42,366
Son Gohan... listen to me...

171
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:48,038
Open up my head and connect
the blue wire to the red wire.

172
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,869
--Do it quickly.
--Right.

173
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,837
If you don't hurry,
the ceiling is going to come down!

174
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:02,653
Dammit, my energy is
beginning to leak out...

175
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,143
I've connected them!

176
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,767
Damn it all!

177
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,173
Mister!

178
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:41,317
Power at full!
Now, Son Gohan!

179
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,624
Mister!

180
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,027
Take care of yourself.

181
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,724
Mister!!

182
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,475
Mister!

183
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,363
Mister...

184
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,298
This is all my fault!

185
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,635
Son... Gohan...

186
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:01,305
Thank goodness!
You're still alive!

187
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:09,178
More or less. But it appears
that my energy is all used up.

188
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:18,452
Never mind about that,
hurry up and go on.

189
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:21,325
Mister!

190
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,161
Don't cry, even when you're all alone.

191
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:29,333
You can't rely on anyone else
around here if you're going to survive.

192
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,766
No!

193
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:40,740
Hush, would you? I can't
take any more. Be... quiet...

194
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,115
Mister?

195
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:51,348
Mister!

196
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:00,698
Wake up! Mister!
Mister, wake up!

197
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:04,395
Mister!!

198
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:26,724
<i>Goku and Gohan</i>- <i>what sort</i>
<i>of adventures await them next?</i>

199
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:30,387
<i>The Saiyans are closing in</i>
<i>with every passing moment!</i>
