1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:04,821
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:06,700
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,811
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,100
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:15,304
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:19,384
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,701
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:26,866
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:31,029
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,868
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:38,811
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:42,438
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,553
Great, you're back! What's for dinner?

15
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:11,112
We've got a few options.

16
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:15,099
First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts,...

17
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,684
...and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks.

18
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,154
Dig in!

19
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,783
Seriously, what else ya got?

20
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,263
What was that!?

21
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:42,998
It's coming from over there!

22
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:48,046
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms... not toward them?

23
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,198
An earthbender!

24
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,489
Let's go meet him!

25
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,206
He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.

26
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,412
Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?

27
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,130
Nice to meet you!

28
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,927
We just wanted to say "hi".

29
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,504
Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere,...

30
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:25,489
...maybe we're near a village
and I bet that village has a market!

31
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,566
Which means no nuts for dinner!

32
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:34,160
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeh, I hate'em too.

33
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,936
Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.

34
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,713
Hey!

35
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,314
Hi, mom.

36
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:55,788
Where have you been, Haru?
You're late! Get started on your chores.

37
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:59,723
Hey, you're that kid!
Why did you run away before?

38
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,850
Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.

39
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:06,644
No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.

40
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,430
They saw you doing what?

41
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:13,752
They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!

42
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,408
You know how dangerous that is!

43
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:20,195
You know what would happen
if they caught you earthbending!

44
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,547
Open up!

45
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:27,711
Fire Nation! Act natural!

46
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,266
What do you want? I've already paid you this week.

47
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:45,317
The tax just doubled.
Wouldn't want an accident, would we?

48
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:50,865
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

49
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:00,641
You can keep the copper ones.

50
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,820
Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?

51
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:12,351
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses
our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.

52
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,669
They're thugs, they steal from us,...

53
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,888
...and everyone here is
too much of a coward to do anything about it.

54
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,457
Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.

55
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:23,307
But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.

56
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,300
Earthbending is forbidden.

57
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:30,289
It's caused nothing but misery for this village.
He must never use his abilities.

58
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,776
How can you say that? Haru has a gift.

59
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,689
Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.

60
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,156
It's a part of who we are.

61
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,869
You don't understand.

62
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:43,924
I understand that Haru can help you fight back.

63
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,032
What can the Fire Nation do to you
that they haven't done already?

64
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:54,311
They could take Haru away!
Like they took his father.

65
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:03,586
My mom said you can sleep here tonight,
but you should leave in the morning.

66
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:08,663
Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

67
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:16,330
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
I didn't know about your father.

68
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:17,775
That's ok.

69
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:23,626
It's funny, the way you were talking back
in the store, it reminded me of him.

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Thanks.

71
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,615
My father was very courageous.

72
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,116
When the Fire Nation invaded,...

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,908
...he and the other earthbenders
were outnumbered ten to one,...

74
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,572
...but they fought back anyway.

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,249
He sounds like a great man.

76
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:36,444
After the attack,...

77
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:40,752
...they rounded up my father
every other earthbender and took them away.

78
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,632
We haven't seen them since.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,084
So, that's why you hide your earthbending?

80
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeh. The problem is that the only way
I can feel close to my father now...

81
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:58,282
...is when I practice my bending.
He taught me everything I know.

82
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:02,180
See this necklace?
My mother gave it to me.

83
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,345
It's beautiful.

84
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,438
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid.
This necklace is all I have left of her.

85
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,360
It's not enough, is it?

86
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,299
No.

87
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,722
Help!

88
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,291
The mine!

89
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,433
Help me!

90
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,141
It's not working, we have to get help.

91
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,296
There's no time... pull harder.

92
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,213
Haru, there's a way you can help him.

93
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:40,328
I can't.

94
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:44,980
Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.

95
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:59,139
Haru, you did it!

96
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,601
It was so brave of Haru to use
his earthbending to help that old man.

97
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,765
You must have really inspired him.

98
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:13,899
I guess so.

99
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,793
Everyone should get some sleep.
We're leaving at dawn.

100
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,727
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

101
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:22,093
Absolutely not!
This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops.

102
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,890
If they discover you're here, Aang,
we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.

103
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:29,173
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

104
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,930
Good night.

105
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:59,197
That's him! That's the earthbender!

106
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:29,026
They took him! They took Haru away!

107
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:29,813
What?

108
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,823
The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation.

109
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,909
It's all my fault,
I forced him into earthbending.

110
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,664
Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?

111
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,228
Haru's mother said
they came for him at midnight.

112
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,264
Then it's too late to track him,
he's long gone.

113
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:45,529
We don't need to track him.
The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.

114
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,856
...and why would they do that?

115
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:52,663
Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.

116
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:57,450
I thought you were crazy at first,
Katara, but this might work.

117
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,472
There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines,...

118
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:03,190
...all Aang has to do is send an air current
from that vent to this one right here.

119
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:06,905
The boulder levitates and...
tada! Fake earthbending.

120
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:08,288
Aang. Did you get all that?

121
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,696
Sure, I got it.

122
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,320
Do you remember your cue?

123
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:16,176
Yeh, yeh, just relax.
You're taking all the fun out of this.

124
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:18,825
By "this" do you mean intentionally getting captured...

125
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,841
...by an army of ruthless firebenders?

126
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,597
Exactly! That's fun stuff.

127
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:27,581
Here they come! Get in your places!

128
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,976
Get out of my way, pipsqueak!

129
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:35,490
How dare you call me
"pipsqueak" you giant-eared cretin!

130
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,392
What did you call me?

131
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,200
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things.
Do herds of animals use them for shade?

132
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:46,584
You better back off!
Seriously... back off.

133
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,649
I will not back off!

134
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,042
I bet elephants get together
and make fun of how large your ears are!

135
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:55,568
That's it... you're going down!

136
00:09:55,695 --> 00:10:01,613
I'll show you who's boss...
earthbending style!

137
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:09,101
I said, "earthbending style!"

138
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:15,622
That lemur! It's earthbending!

139
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:18,155
No, you idiot! It's the girl!

140
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:21,752
Oh, of course.

141
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:28,854
I'll hold her! You've got 12 hours to find Haru,
we'll be right behind you.

142
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,331
Momo, you have some big ears!

143
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:20,864
She'll be fine, Aang,
Katara knows what she's doing.

144
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:33,222
Earthbenders, it is my pleasure
to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard.

145
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,672
I am your warden.

146
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:41,463
I prefer to think of you not as prisoners,
but as honored guests,...

147
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:47,678
...and I hope you come to think of me
as your humble and caring host.

148
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:52,700
You will succeed here if you simply abide...

149
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,428
What kind of guest dishonors his host
by interrupting him!? Take him below!

150
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:05,949
One week in solitary will improve his manners.

151
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:13,666
Simply treat me with the courtesy
I give you and we'll get along famously.

152
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:19,498
You will notice earthbenders,
that this rig is made entirely of metal.

153
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:25,995
You are miles away from any rock or earth,
so if you have any illusions about...

154
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:31,850
...employing that brutish savagery
that passes for bending among you people,...

155
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,930
...forget them. It is impossible.

156
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:40,105
Good day.

157
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:05,206
Katara?

158
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,341
Haru!

159
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:08,209
What are you doing here?

160
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,902
It's my fault you were captured.
I came to rescue you.

161
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,116
So, you got yourself arrested?

162
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,013
It was the only way to find you.

163
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,759
You got guts, Katara, I'll give you that.

164
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:22,936
Come one,
there's someone I want you to meet.

165
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:28,967
Katara, this is my father, Tyro.
Dad, this is Katara.

166
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:32,166
It's an honor to meet you.

167
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,556
Have some dinner, Katara.

168
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,398
It's not as bad as it looks.

169
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:44,080
It's still pretty bad though.

170
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:47,439
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining
there aren't enough blankets to go around.

171
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:52,047
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime,
make sure the elderly are taken care of.

172
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:55,018
The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.

173
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:57,891
If you don't mind me asking,
what's your escape plan?

174
00:13:58,012 --> 00:13:59,048
Excuse me?

175
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:03,559
You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig?
What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?

176
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,400
The plan? The plan is to survive... wait out this war.

177
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:12,168
Hope that one day some of us
can get back home and forget this ever happened.

178
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:15,878
How can you say that?
You sound like you've already given up.

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,036
Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth,...

180
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,591
...but people's lives are at stake here.

181
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:28,479
The Warden is a ruthless man,
and he won't stand for any rebellion.

182
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:32,034
I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

183
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:35,202
We'll see about that.

184
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:41,540
Earthbenders!
You don't know me, but I know of you.

185
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:46,020
Every child of my water tribe village
was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave...

186
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:51,033
...Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders
who guard its borders.

187
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:54,875
Some of you may think
that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.

188
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:57,957
Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend,...

189
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:02,902
...but they can't take away your courage
and it is your courage they should truly fear!

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,654
Because it runs deeper than
any mine you've been forced to dig,...

191
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:09,568
...any ocean that keeps you far from home.

192
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,051
It is the strength of your hearts
that make you who you are,...

193
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:17,886
...hearts that will remain unbroken
when all rock and stone has eroded away.

194
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:23,807
The time to fight back is now!
I can tell you the Avatar has returned!

195
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:31,009
So remember your courage,
earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!

196
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,141
Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru?
We've got to get out of here.

197
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,497
I can't.

198
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,378
We don't have much time,
there are guards everywhere. Get on.

199
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,297
Katara, what's wrong?

200
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm not leaving.

201
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:25,350
I'm not giving up on these people.

202
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,309
What do you mean you're not leaving!?

203
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:34,184
We can't abandon these people.
There has to be a way to help them.

204
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,107
Maybe she's right.
What do you say, Sokka?

205
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:40,211
I say you're both crazy!

206
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,336
Last chance, we need to leave... now!

207
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:44,686
No.

208
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:50,279
I hate when you get like this.
Come on, we better hide.

209
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,995
Look!

210
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,829
Tell me exactly what you saw.

211
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,933
Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.

212
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:03,497
What?

213
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:07,069
It was a giant flying buffalo,
Sir, with an empty saddle.

214
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:10,088
Which was it?
A buffalo or a bison?

215
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:14,914
Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is,
but that's not really the point is it, Sir?

216
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:19,435
I'll decide what the point is, fool!

217
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:25,653
You! Wake up the Captain.
Search the entire rig!

218
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:26,245
Sir?

219
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,034
What!?

220
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,658
That... was the Captain
you just threw overboard, so...

221
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:34,125
Then wake up someone
I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig!

222
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:39,191
There's something going on here and I don't like it.

223
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,866
We don't have much time.
What are we gonna do?

224
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,405
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

225
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,173
The Warden would run away
and we'd steal his keys!

226
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,371
Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?

227
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,514
I'm just tossing ideas around.

228
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,286
I tired talking the earthbenders
into fighting back, but it didn't work.

229
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,400
If there was just a way to help them help themselves.

230
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:10,970
For that they'd need some kind of earth,
or some rock... something they can bend.

231
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:15,095
But this entire place is made of metal.

232
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:24,902
No, it's not. Look at the smoke.
I bet they're burning coal... In other words, earth.

233
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:31,792
It's almost dawn, we're running out of time!
Are you sure this is gonna work?

234
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,777
It should. These vents reminded me
of our little trick back at the village.

235
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,113
We're gonna do the same thing,
but on a much bigger scale.

236
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,796
There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo,...

237
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,871
...and the whole system is ventilated.
Aang closed off all the vents except one.

238
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:50,514
When he does his airbending,
the coal only has one place to go... right back here.

239
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,563
There's the intruder!

240
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,489
Stay back, I'm warning you!

241
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:59,467
Katara stop! You can't win this fight!

242
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:09,135
Listen to him well, child.
You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.

243
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:35,027
Here's your chance, earthbenders!
Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!

244
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:42,708
Foolish girl!

245
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:49,046
You thought a few inspirational words
and some coal would change these people?

246
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:56,403
Look at these blank, hopeless faces.
There spirits were broken a long time ago.

247
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:59,875
Oh? But you still believe in them?

248
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:10,848
How sweet. They're a waste of your energy,
little girl. You've failed.

249
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,096
Show no mercy!

250
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,532
For the Earth Kingdom, attack!

251
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:09,192
Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!

252
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:12,232
Do not let them escape!

253
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,380
Guys, throw me some coal!

254
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,522
No, please! I can't swim!

255
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,835
Don't worry, I hear cowards float.

256
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:50,618
I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.

257
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,794
All it took was a little coal.

258
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:56,705
It wasn't the coal, Katara, it was you.

259
00:21:56,832 --> 00:22:01,290
Thank you for helping me find my courage,
Katara, of the water tribe.

260
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,939
My family and everyone here owes you much.

261
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:08,468
So, I guess you're going home now?

262
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:13,529
Yes, to take back my village.
To take back all of our villages!

263
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:18,905
The Fire Nation will regret the day
they set foot on our land!

264
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,166
Come with us.

265
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:26,857
I can't. Your mission is to take back your home.
Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

266
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:30,528
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

267
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:34,843
Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me.

268
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,204
I never thought I'd see him again.
I only wish there was some way...

269
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:44,935
I know. My mother's necklace! It's gone!
