1
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:08,932
Something seems off.
It just somehow felt that way.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:09,582
One out, with the score
still seven to zero.

3
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,282
One out, with the score
still seven to zero.
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

4
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:11,342
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

5
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,482
The gap between the
scores is big,
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

6
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:13,582
I had absolutely no interest in the

7
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:14,382
but Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

9
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:17,452
But Kumamoto still has a chance

But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

10
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,112
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

11
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,822
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

12
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:22,952
The passionate voices cheering from the
third base bleachers have not died down.
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

13
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:25,922
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

14
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:27,752
That's true.
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

15
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,232
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

16
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,002
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.

17
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,272
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.
You're not doing anything today, right?
We're meeting at 2PM in front of the station.

00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:33,372
You're not doing anything today, right?

21
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,502
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

25
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:40,242
After last year's summer tournament, he was
chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

26
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:42,272
After last year's summer tournament, he was

I didn't even say anything...

27
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:42,382
I didn't even say anything...

28
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:43,112
In the fourth inning,
he hit a three-run home run.

00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:45,212
What?

31
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:45,852
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
What?

32
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:45,952
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...

33
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:48,382
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

34
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,922
I forgot to mention this - bring
a swimsuit and plenty of money.

35
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:50,782
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

38
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:52,082
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

39
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,052
That was a good pitch.
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

40
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,222
That was a good pitch.

41
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:56,662
That was a good pitch.
And again, I had the feeling that I
knew what Haruhi was going to say.

42
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:56,762
And again, I had the feeling that I
knew what Haruhi was going to say.

43
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:00,132
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.
And again, I had the feeling that I
knew what Haruhi was going to say.

44
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:00,232
And again, I had the feeling that I
knew what Haruhi was going to say.

45
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:01,192
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
And again, I had the feeling that I

47
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,362
Perhaps he feels like

No, not quite.

48
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:02,532
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.

49
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,002
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

50
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:03,102
To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

51
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:06,902
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...

I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

54
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,332
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

55
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,642
It's a hit!
And it's a big one!

56
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,932
It's headed for
left field...
Summer's almost over.

57
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,342

00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,692
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,172
Sorry I made you wait.

78
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,642
I just got here, too.

79
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:02,372
- Okay, we're all here, so let's go.
- Where are we going?

80
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:05,012
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

81
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,452
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

82
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:11,552
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

83
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,122
We can never get back the time
that we've lost!

84
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:20,462
And so we're going to do them now, in our
one and only summer as tenth graders.

85
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,972
By the way, we're going
to the pool by bike.

86
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,162
Did you ride
your bikes, too?

87
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,372
No, the only two bikes we have
are yours and mine.

88
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,942
Kyon, you'd better not lose
to Koizumi.

89
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,642
This train is leaving
the station!

90
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,682
No psychic powers allowed!

91
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,752
Hurry up and park your bikes,
you two.

92
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,882
Kyon, we're about to go have fun.
This is no time to be exhausted.

93
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,762
Whose fault do you think
this is?

94
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:53,832
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

95
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:02,012
Hurry up and get in!
The water's warm so it feels fine!

96
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,702
Can't she read the "no diving" signs
posted everywhere?

97
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,802
That looks like fun.

98
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:12,482
She has some rather normal ways of
enjoying her time, don't you think?

99
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:16,682
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

100
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,782
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

101
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,982
I hope that's the case...

102
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,352
What's wrong?

103
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:25,992
Oh, it's nothing...

104
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,432
It's probably just
my imagination.

105
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:34,202
Let's get ready
to go in, too.

106
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:56,422
It's so bitter.
One more cup, please.

107
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,442
It feels like I've seen
this scene once before.

108
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:11,132
Where Nagato kind of looks
like she's bored...

109
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:12,942
Kyon!

110
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:17,512
Right, and then Haruhi
says this...

111
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,352
These two are my
brigade members.

112
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:23,392
They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!

113
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:27,522
Okay, let's have some fun!
We're going to play water dodge ball.

114
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,292
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,822
Well, deja vu isn't
all that uncommon.

116
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,402
I thought about what we'll be doing
from here on. What do you think?

117
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:41,972
What is that?

118
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:42,142
"Things we have to do
during our summer vacation"
What is that?

119
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:42,242
"Things we have to do
during our summer vacation"

120
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,782
"Things we have to do
during our summer vacation"
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

121
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:46,142
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

122
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:50,982
I realized that we only have two weeks
of summer vacation left.

123
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,212
That fact
blew me away.

124
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:59,022
We still have so much left to do, but
we've only got this much time left!

125
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:01,292
We're going to pick up
the pace!

126
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:03,622
All this in just
two weeks?

127
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,862
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

128
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,762
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

129
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:13,702
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

130
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,442
Pardon me
for a moment.

131
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,582
- Thank you.
- We're starting tomorrow!

132
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:28,582
Is there a place nearby with a Bon festival?
A fireworks show works, too.

133
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,052
I'll check around.
I'll contact you when I find out.

134
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,022
Don't forget about
the goldfish scooping!

135
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,652
It's Mikuru's one request,
after all.

136
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,322
Roger that.

137
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,132
All right, then,
we're done for today!

138
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:44,542
- If you'll excuse me.
- I have to go, too...

139
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:57,642
Nagato.

140
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,822
No, it's nothing important.

141
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,292
How have you been?
Everything fine?

142
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,282
Fine.

143
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:07,522
I see. That's good
to hear.

144
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:18,702
What the heck?
Why did I talk to her?

145
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:27,042
Your attention please, we have a lost child.
Five-year-old Takashi Satou is...

146
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,982
A Bon festival, huh?

147
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:32,482
I guess it makes sense
for there to be this many people.

148
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,652
That tower,
those vendors...

149
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,922
It's been a while since I've come to one,
but it feels like I have recently.

150
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,222
Mikuru!

151
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,992
They have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

152
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,932
- Be sure to catch a bunch!
- Okay!

153
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:52,132
Shall we play, too? How about
seeing who can catch more?

154
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,472
I'll pass.

155
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,942
What about you, Nagato?
Want to eat something?

156
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:02,472
You're interested
in that stuff?

157
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,412
- Which one?
- It's all right.

158
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:08,112
- This one.
- Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.

159
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,582
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

160
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,292
so I thought it would be appropriate
for me to at least buy her that, but...

161
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:14,862
Hamster Fishing

162
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,302
Hamster Fishing
Thirteen!
Wow, what a haul!

163
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,492
Thirteen!
Wow, what a haul!

164
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,722
But I don't need so many,
so I just kept one.

165
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,232
And one
for Mikuru, too.

166
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:28,302
You can have one,
but only one.

167
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,812
Thanks.

168
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:33,782
Huh? What's with
the mask, Yuki?

169
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,352
I bought it.

170
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,212
I see.

171
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:50,802
No Obtrusive Fireworks Allowed

172
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:51,262
No Obtrusive Fireworks Allowed
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

173
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:53,062
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

174
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,072
That's why I wanted
to forget about it,

175
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,732
...but there was one thing
lingering in my mind.

176
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,272
Haruhi.

177
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:03,242
It's fine to want to play around, but are you
finished with your summer homework?

178
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:08,242
What? You can finish homework
like that in just three days.

179
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,642
Three days!?

180
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:15,282
You get that stuff out of the way so you can
have fun without having to worry about it.

181
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,852
Why is she
so smart?

182
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,932
It seems like the guys up in
heaven that were divvying up...

183
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,992
the stats for us were being
pretty lax about it.

184
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,892
Everyone, tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

185
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,092
Whoever catches
the most bugs...

186
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:33,032
Okay, they'll get to be the
brigade leader for a day!

187
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,642
- No thanks!
- That sounds interesting.

188
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:37,612
Are any bugs okay?

189
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,582
Hmm... only cicadas!

190
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:45,052
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

191
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:50,652
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

192
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,392
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

193
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,222
That's sour!
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

194
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,232
That's not a cicada.

195
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,492
A yanbaru
long-armed scarab!?

196
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,662
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

197
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:07,032
but of course, or something to that effect,
the winner ended up being Haruhi.

198
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:11,272
A catch and release attitude
is important, right?

199
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,442
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

200
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,712
What could a cicada do,
even if it did come back?

201
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,422
There you go! Go back
to the mountains!

202
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:33,162
For some reason, I kind of feel like
Pandora opening her box.

203
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,362
W-Welcome!

204
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,442
The next day, we met up, even though
we had no idea what was going on.

205
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,562
And we remained in the dark even as we
were made to wear frog costumes...

206
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:47,942
and then pass out balloons in front
of a supermarket as our part-time job.

207
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:55,582
I really understand how Unit-o felt
when it got hit by that beam.

208
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,992
Good work, everyone.

209
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,522
What's with this difference
in how we're being treated?

210
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:02,962
Thanks for the hard work.
The manager is thankful.

211
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:06,002
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

212
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,032
This is it.

213
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:12,702
I've wanted this
for a while.

214
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:17,062
We worked, sweat pouring down
our foreheads, for that?

215
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,732
Let's hang this up in the
clubroom as a memento.

216
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:24,412
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

217
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:25,782
Okay...

218
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,612
What?

219
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:30,852
- Oh, nothing.
- Don't look at me.

220
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:34,892
- Come on, Mikuru!
- M-Maybe later!

221
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,962
Your popsicle is going
to fall down.

222
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:46,172
That night, a single phone call
stole me away from my slumber.

223
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:48,602
The number you have
called is...

224
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,872
What in the world!?

225
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:54,772
Kyon...

226
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,072
Miss Asahina?

227
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:58,842
Yes, it's me...

228
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:03,952
Something... very not good has...
At this rate, I...

229
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,252
- Umm...
- Hello, this is Koizumi.

230
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:11,792
Why are you with Miss Asahina
at this hour?

231
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,492
Certain circumstances
came up.

232
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,192
Would it be possible for you
to come join us right now?

233
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:27,082
What in the world happened,
Miss Asahina?

234
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:34,782
Kyon... I... can't go back
to the fu-

235
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:39,182
In other words,
this is what's going on.

236
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:42,822
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

237
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:47,492
Even if you say something as impossible
as that with a smile on your face...

238
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:51,072
Koizumi, do you realize
what you're saying?

239
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:55,002
I do. Much more than
I wish I did.

240
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,872
I had just been speaking
with Miss Asahina.

241
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:00,172
Call me too, when you
have talks with her.

242
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,112
And as a result, what we realized
was that recently,

243
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,722
the flow of time
was a bit strange.

244
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,792
You might want to credit this
to Miss Asahina.

245
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,652
Thanks to her,
I was able to confirm it.

246
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,222
Confirm what?

247
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:19,892
That we have experienced the same
span of time numerous times.

248
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,792
You said that earlier.

249
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:26,372
To be precise, we've been repeating
the time from August 17th to the 31st.

250
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:31,072
We're in the middle of an
endless summer vacation.

251
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:34,112
Well, it is summer
vacation, but...

252
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,742
It's a never-ending
endless summer.

253
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:43,342
This world has lost all time
after September 1st.

254
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,592
Who'd believe that?

255
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:49,322
We'd like for you
to believe it.

256
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,622
Umm... I'll explain, too.

257
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,872
Well... because of
"classified information",

258
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:01,912
I'm always contacting the future
and "classified information"-ing,

259
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:08,482
but I hadn't received any "classified
information" for about a week or so,

260
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,282
which I thought
was strange.

261
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:13,122
And so I
"classified information"

262
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:18,422
I was so surprised I tried to
"classified information",

263
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,592
but it was completely
"classified information."

264
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:25,492
Oh, what do I do?

265
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:30,992
Are we trapped inside one of
those closed spaces?

266
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,972
That's not it.

267
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:36,542
A single portion of time
has been torn away.

268
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:40,632
At exactly the point when it becomes
midnight on August 31st,

269
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:45,512
everything resets, and we go back
to August 17th. That's the process.

270
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:49,552
So what about our...
no, humanity's memories?

271
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:54,692
Those are reset as well.
Everything starts over from the beginning.

272
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:58,402
So you mean that time does
that thing that you mentioned.

273
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:02,302
Well, we do have someone from the future
here, I guess it can't be helped.

274
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,592
Oh no, Miss Asahina
isn't involved in this.

275
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,862
Okay then,
what's the culprit?

276
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,472
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

277
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:14,482
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but somewhere inside of her...

278
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,982
...is a desire to not let
summer vacation end.

279
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:20,552
What the heck? Do you mean she
feels regret over something?

280
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,712
That's what I believe.

281
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,392
Perhaps she feels that
there's something left...

282
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:29,362
that she wants to do during
our summer vacation?

283
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,992
I've been wondering this since I got here,
but you seem awfully cheerful about this.

284
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,042
It's because we've finally been
able to solve the mystery

285
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,542
of the frequent feelings
of deja vu that I've had recently.

286
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,542
Now that I think about it, those inexplicable
feelings may have been

287
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,742
remnants from when our memories
have been reset.

288
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:52,052
Is it possible that other people
across the world feel this, too?

289
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:56,982
It doesn't seem that way.
You and I are a special case.

290
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,282
It appears that the people who
are closest to Miss Suzumiya

291
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:02,662
are able to sense
this strangeness.

292
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:06,762
What about Haruhi? Does she
sense any of this at all?

293
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:12,232
Not at all, it seems. It would probably
be bad for us if she did.

294
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:17,342
However, I believe that there is one
person who remembers everything,

295
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,742
more than the deja vu
that we do.

296
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,612
- Is that right?
- It is.

297
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:31,052
- You remember all of it?
- Right.

298
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:35,422
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

299
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:40,662
This is the 15,521st time.

300
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:44,672
15,521?

301
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:50,572
What do you mean
by 15,521?

302
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,942
Are you serious?

303
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,212
I am.

304
00:16:56,352 --> 00:17:00,982
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

305
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:03,552
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

306
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:08,922
Out of 15,521 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

307
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:13,792
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

308
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,422
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

309
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:20,602
but did not go to a goldfish scooping
stand, occurred 437 times.

310
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:24,172
We had a part-time job 9,048 times,
and when we did,

311
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,612
there are six different kinds
of jobs that we did.

312
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,872
In addition to handing out balloons,
we also worked as movers, cashiers,

313
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,182
handed out flyers, worked as call center-

314
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,152
I got it, that's enough.
Handed out flyers, worked as call center-

315
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:43,262
15,521 times,
that's what Nagato said.

316
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:52,032
Times two weeks, hmm,
that's around 595 years.

317
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:59,872
She alone has memories of all that time,
repeating it all over and over...

318
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:05,772
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that
same period of time over and over again?

319
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,022
I've heard yet another
crazy story.

320
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:17,062
- I wonder if they exist.
- If what exist?

321
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,932
- Martians.
- I kind of don't want them to.

322
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,432
It doesn't look like anyone's
on the surface,

323
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:26,202
so they're probably a reserved
people, living underground.

324
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:28,602
When man finally
sets foot on Mars,

325
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,272
I'm sure that they'll come out from
under their cover and welcome us,

326
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,402
saying, "Welcome to Mars!"

327
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,742
How about if they just
appear normally?

328
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:41,382
Oh, I'm bored of this.
UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.

329
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:44,082
The next day,
we went stargazing.

330
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,392
The location was Nagato's
apartment,

331
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:49,582
and the telescope was one
that Koizumi had gotten for us.

332
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,832
Exactly what does
she want to do?

333
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,832
Now what could
that be?

334
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,632
If we could figure that out,
this would all be solved...

335
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,412
How about trying
this out?

336
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,732
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden embrace
from behind

337
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:07,472
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

338
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,742
And who would
be doing that?

339
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,852
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

340
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,692
No, I refuse.

341
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,082
All right, how about
if I do it?

342
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:24,332
I'm kidding. I'm lacking a certain
something for the role.

343
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,392
And all that would do is cause unnecessary
confusion in Miss Suzumiya.

344
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:37,542
Hey, Nagato,

345
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:42,412
you were aware of this loop before
Miss Asahina said anything, right?

346
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,212
Yes.

347
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,452
If that's the case, why didn't
you say anything?

348
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,692
SOS Brigade Test of Courage Challenge
Leave the doll here as proof!

349
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,592
SOS Brigade Test of Courage Challenge
Leave the doll here as proof!
It's my job to observe.

350
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,652
I see...

351
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:59,362
We continued to run through a torrent
of summer vacation events.

352
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,962
We went to a real
fireworks show,

353
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,162
and we even took part in
a goby fishing tournament.

354
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:08,702
We also went to a batting center,
watched some movies,

355
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,312
went to the beach, went bowling,
and even sang karaoke.

356
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,272
We were always
doing something.

357
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,512
Of course, I knew that this wasn't
going to satisfy Haruhi.

358
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:22,122
Even so, there wasn't anything
I could do about it,

359
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:28,212
and the last days of our
summer vacation ticked away.

360
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,962
And so we ended up
at August 30th...

361
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:44,462
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

362
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,712
Hey, no scribbling.

363
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:51,982
I wonder if this was
good enough.

364
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:56,382
But, hmm...
I guess this works.

365
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,152
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

366
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,892
That's fine, then.

367
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,492
We were able to do a lot this summer,
so that's enough, right?

368
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:16,372
No, it's not.
You're still not satisfied.

369
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,942
Okay, we're done
for today.

370
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:24,412
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

371
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,952
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

372
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:37,222
Wait... Haruhi...

373
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,522
Okay, we're done
for today.

374
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:45,862
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

375
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,902
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

376
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,782
I can't let Haruhi leave.

377
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:59,952
If she goes, we'll end up repeating
these past two weeks

378
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,782
for the some-thousandth time.

379
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,362
Okay, we're done
for today.

380
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:08,482
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

381
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:11,122
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

382
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,132
What should I do?
What should I say?

383
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:19,772
There must have been a hint
somewhere in what Haruhi said.

384
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,142
But what was it?

385
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:24,902
What has she said
up to this point?

386
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:29,302
I don't know...
I can't remember...

387
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:31,542
Okay, we're done
for today.

388
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:35,882
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

389
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:39,092
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

390
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,792
Whatever, it doesn't
matter anymore.

391
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:51,672
August 31st. I haven't
touched my homework.

392
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:53,272
Oh, forget it.

393
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:59,402
If we're just going to do it all over again,
then there's no point to doing it.

394
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:08,382
Whether tomorrow comes or not, I'll leave
it to the me at that time to deal with it.

395
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:46,352
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

396
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,092
subete no negai wo nosete
With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

397
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:54,062
hitotsu no hoshi niwa
chotto omokatta kana
Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

398
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:56,962
yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

399
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,572
kokoro no kimi ga kieta
The image of you in my mind
has vanished

400
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:03,872
tashika ni oboeteru tte

Can I say that
I remember you clearly?

401
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:05,372
Tomare!
Stop!

402
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:09,172
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs
to me

403
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:13,682
touzen daretomo torikaetakunai
Of course I don't want to trade it
with anyone else

404
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,052

That's because

405
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:20,252
basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

406
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:23,092

We could see
the first dream

407
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,532
hajimete no yume ga mieru
That we had when
we were born

408
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:30,502
doushiyouka tte

Worrying about
"what do I do?"

409
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:34,332
Ima omoeba waraeru hodo

Is laughable when I
think about it now

410
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:36,672

I've already forgotten it

411
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,632

Let's search
