1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,600
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:29,700
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,700
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,800
<i>kowareru omoi wa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,700
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,500
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:33,700
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
First Flower

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,500
It's been a while since I've stopped caring about the changing of the seasons.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Shirasugi...

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Last stop, Wakase...

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,500
Please wait for the express train, it will come after...

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,600
How much meaning is there to the fact that it is spring right now?

22
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,900
There's someone else I've fallen in love with.

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh... Really?

24
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,300
Tsubana. Tsubana.

25
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,100
Please wait until the train comes to a complete stop.

26
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,800
Excuse me, I'm getting off.

27
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,200
Hey... Excuse me.

28
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Hey, you there!

29
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey, student!

30
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,600
Umm?

31
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh... here...

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh no... I'm so out of it.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,900
Thank you very much.

34
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
You're welcome.

35
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,700
That's all I have about the next arranged marriage party.

36
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
If you don't have any particular questions, then I would like to end the meeting.

37
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,400
Yes!

38
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Odagiri?

39
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,800
This party is restricted to members in their late 20's to early 30's.

40
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
However, someday I hope to bring down the membership age to mid-teens,

41
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
and have a party restricted to women in their teens...

42
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
That's all!

43
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,000
Good work guys.

44
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,200
Let's go eat!

45
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Where do you want to go?

46
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
Didn't a new restaurant open up in Kanami?

47
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Really?

48
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Koshiro.

49
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,100
Huh?

50
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,000
You're sorting the membership data files in the back today.

51
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Why?

52
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,600
That face... that smell!

53
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
I can't show that to customers.

54
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,100
There should definitely be a demand.

55
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,600
You think so?

56
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,100
From experience, even men my age can only meet teenage girls in an unlawful way.

57
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
A demand for you?

58
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Aren't there any opportunities to meet a female high school student?

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
You just keep working.

60
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm ho...me...

61
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,300
I didn't hear about this!

62
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
Anyway, you're going to live with Nanoka starting tomorrow night.

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Be prepared!

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,300
So suddenly...

65
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,600
I wanted to show you Nanoka.

66
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
You don't remember her, do you?

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes I do... I do, but I don't remember her face.

68
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
She's a freshman in high school now.

69
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,800
She's 15 years old. She is so cute!

70
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,500
Everyone commutes from far away nowadays.

71
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,200
She can cut her commute time from two hours to one!

72
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
Isn't it natural that you let her stay?

73
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,900
Just because you got dumped by your lover,

74
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,600
you don't intend on getting back together with mom, do you?

75
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,600
That's not how it is!

76
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,100
It's not?

77
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,000
No!

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,900
She's my daughter!

79
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,800
She's a relative!

80
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
Your younger sister!

81
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,600
With my carefree life living with pop,

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
sometimes there's something I forget about.

83
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,100
I have a mother and a sister who's 12 years younger.

84
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,000
Please introduce her to me!

85
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,300
What the hell are you thinking?

86
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,500
Why were you hiding such an important thing from me?!

87
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I wasn't hiding.

88
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
It's basically like I don't know about it.

89
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
My parents got divorced.

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I met my mom, who took custody of her, a couple times.

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
But I haven't seen my sister at all.

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Customer!

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

94
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
And...

95
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,600
What kind of partner are you interested in?

96
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
Don't get mad.

97
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry I came while you're working.

98
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,400
It's all right.

99
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,300
It's my lunch break anyway.

100
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,000
I came to get the keys to my place back.

101
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,500
I thought it'd be better during the day.

102
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,900
Wait a little.

103
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Bye.

104
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Yeah.

105
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,400
You're really letting me go easy.

106
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,000
Sorry...

107
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,300
But...

108
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
You dismissed it so lightly.

109
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,700
I just felt like...

110
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Oh, this is all I meant to you.

111
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,700
Koshiro, have you ever loved anyone from the bottom of your heart?

112
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,900
Koshiro, have you ever loved anyone from the bottom of your heart?

113
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,700
Then what should I have done?

114
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,800
During the party, we're planning to have three events,

115
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,700
so if we could divide the food and have it brought out to match the timing...

116
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,200
Next, concerning the audio equipment...

117
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,300
Thank you for your business.

118
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
Same here.

119
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
Oh yes

120
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,800
Here. If you'd like it, it's next door.

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, thank you very much.  Don't mind if I do.

122
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,600
What do I say to a woman that says she has another man...?

123
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,500
What should I have done?

124
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
What a great view.

125
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
It's a place that kind of hurts for a bachelor.

126
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,300
So you broke up?

127
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Yeah.

128
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
You're so cool about it...

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
That's what she dislikes about me.

130
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Here, I'll give these to you.

131
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,300
I don't need them.

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Why don't you try inviting that girl you broke up with?

133
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,800
Maybe you guys will get back together?

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Who the hell's going to get back together with...

135
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,500
Ah! Hello.

136
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,500
Ummm...

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Do you remember me?

138
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,200
Yesterday morning.

139
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Yeah, I remember!

140
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
I remember you.

141
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
Ah, I'm glad.

142
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,700
What a bad man!

143
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,000
Asking out high school girls?

144
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
That's not what it is!

145
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Thank you for yesterday.

146
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
Then, I'm sorry I'm interrupting your date.

147
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,000
That's wrong too!

148
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Hey!

149
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,600
Eh?

150
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Umm...

151
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes?

152
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,100
Here.

153
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Please have these.

154
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,700
Idiot.

155
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Umm...

156
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm glad. I was waiting to meet a someone,

157
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,800
but I came too early and I needed to kill time.

158
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,100
Meeting someone?

159
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
Yes. My father.

160
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,400
Hey. What would you like to ride?

161
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Are you all right?

162
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,200
Are you all right?

163
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,300
Are you all right?

164
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,300
What the hell am I doing?

165
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Here.

166
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,500
Wow! Thank you very much.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,700
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It must be boring with me.

169
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
That's not true.

170
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
Don't you have a boyfriend?

171
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
I just broke up with him.

172
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,000
Wow! It's so beautiful!

173
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
This...

174
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,700
I received it during my junior high graduation

175
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,900
from the person I liked.

176
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,900
But it wasn't his second button.

177
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,800
I liked him since I was a first-year.

178
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,700
It's not like he's really handsome or anything...

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
but I really liked him.

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
I gathered up all my courage and confessed to him but...

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,500
He said he's going out with a junior at school.

182
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I didn't know that at all.

183
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,600
If the window could open, I could throw it out from here...

184
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,900
How disappointing.

185
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,500
Don't say you're going to throw it away.

186
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
You still like him, don't you?

187
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,800
Then don't say that you're going to throw it away.

188
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,500
But...

189
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
I have to forget about him.

190
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,100
He has someone that he's going out with.

191
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,000
We go to different high schools,

192
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,800
and it's not like I'll ever get to see him again.

193
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,900
So why?

194
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Why do you say such things?

195
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,700
You're so straightforward.

196
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,800
Then how...?

197
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,700
How can you love someone so straightforward like that?

198
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,300
I...

199
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I just got dumped too.

200
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, it's really different from your situation.

201
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,700
My feelings totally cooled off...

202
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:05,200
and I don't really know if I really loved her anymore.

203
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,700
But...

204
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
That's why...

205
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
You should definitely treasure...

206
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,100
the feelings that you have inside you.

207
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Why...?

208
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
Why am I...?

209
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,800
I was so surprised.

210
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
The cherry blossoms.

211
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Ever since I got rejected, I kept walking with my head down,

212
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,300
so I didn't notice the flowers blooming at all.

213
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,900
When you called me back at the train station,

214
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
I noticed it for the first time.

215
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,600
I was really surprised!

216
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,500
The petals were falling like snow,

217
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,500
and for a moment I couldn't tell where I was.

218
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
That's the same for me too.

219
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,800
Where is this...

220
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
this place that I've always been at?

221
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
Is being here unforgivable?

222
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Thank you very much.

223
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
Same here.

224
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,900
Umm...

225
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,300
It's nothing.

226
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Well, I have to...

227
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey!

228
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,700
Sorry for making you wait!

229
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Dad!

230
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Father?

231
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Huh?!

232
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,800
Oh, you're here too, Koshiro?

233
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,100
It's been a while since you siblings have gotten together.

234
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
Did you guys notice right after you met each other?

235
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey, what's wrong with the two of you? Let's go!

236
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey...!

237
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,700
What should we have for dinner?

238
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,900
Nanoka, what do you want?

239
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Wait...

240
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,900
Daddy...

241
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Brother?

242
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,300
Yes...

243
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,500
I have...

244
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,100
A little sister.

245
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,100
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

246
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,100
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

247
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,000
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

248
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

249
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

250
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,900
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

251
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,500
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

252
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,800
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

253
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

254
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

255
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

256
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,800
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

257
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,300
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

258
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,400
<i>shizuka na sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

259
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,200
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

260
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,900
<i>shizuka na sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

261
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,500
A girl that I got dumped by came to my office, so I was kind of apprehensive.

262
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,600
I went on a date with my younger sister without knowing.

263
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,300
I cried in front of a high school student at my age.

264
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,700
Is this all right?!

265
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Your punishment is Sumaki Nagashi!

266
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,500
WHY?!
