<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:49,467
Impudence! How dare you try to trespass
into the Crown Prince's chambers?

4
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,849
Let me see His Highness!
My lady is about to give birth!

5
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,788
Quickly summon someone
to help my lady deliver!

6
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:57,707
The Crown Prince issued strict orders
that nobody is to enter.

7
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,948
Sisters, my lady cannot afford to wait!
Please allow me inside!

8
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:16,747
- Third Prince.
- Third Prince.

9
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,548
Nai Nai, what has happened?

10
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,948
Third Prince, my lady is
about to give birth!

11
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,508
What did you say?

12
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,027
Quick, get up.

13
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,307
Take me there.

14
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:29,427
What about His Highness?

15
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,627
Don't worry about him. Get going!

16
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,707
Yes.

17
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,268
- Quick!
- Your Highness.

18
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:53,268
Medicine King, quick! You must ensure
the safety of both mother and child!

19
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,548
Yes. Greetings, Your Highness.

20
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:57,520
Forget about those formalities!

21
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,627
Remember, you must ensure
the safety of both mother and child.

22
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:01,747
Yes.

23
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:05,228
A woman in childbirth mustn't
be subjected to the wind.

24
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,788
Quick, pull down the curtains.

25
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,108
- Yes..
- Quickly!

26
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:11,388
- Third Prince, please step back.
- Your Highness, you will be all right.

27
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,828
Your Highness, Medicine King is here.

28
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,387
You must stay safe and sound,
Your Highness.

29
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,747
Ye Hua.

30
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:24,187
Your Highness, trust me.
The Crown Prince will surely come.

31
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:27,067
Ye Hua! Ye Hua...

32
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:46,747
Is it a boy or a girl?

33
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,947
Your Highness, it...

34
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,267
Speak quickly!

35
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:56,627
Your Highness, this baby
really is a sick child.

36
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:59,627
Your Highness, spare my life.
Spare my life!

37
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,947
It was you! You harmed my son!

38
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,908
Xuan Nu, you just gave birth.
Why are you out of bed?

39
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,747
Get back in and rest.

40
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:16,108
Your Majesty, it was this shaman.

41
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,747
I don't know what
antiabortifacient medicine he gave me.

42
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,708
It not only caused me
to go into premature labor

43
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,427
but... but also caused our child
to be unconscious when born!

44
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,067
What did you say?

45
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,067
Your Majesty, I'm wrongly accused!

46
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,307
Your Majesty, signs of
the baby's condition

47
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,387
appeared half a year ago
from Ghost Queen's womb.

48
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:36,507
Ghost Queen forced me to use black magic
to aid in the delivery of her baby.

49
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:38,867
This is not my fault, Your Majesty!

50
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,067
You dare accuse me?

51
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,108
You were clearly the one who
cruelly plotted against my son's life!

52
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:47,708
Guards! Drag him out.

53
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,148
Behead him at once!

54
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,468
- Yes!
- Yes!

55
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:54,627
Your Majesty, I've been wronged!
Your Majesty!

56
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:58,028
Your Majesty! I've been wronged!
Your Majesty, this is unjust!

57
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,028
Go!

58
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:01,028
Ghost Queen, may you die
a terrible death!

59
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,427
Your Majesty, I've served
three generations of Ghost Lords!

60
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,348
I am loyal and devoted!
I've been wrongly accused, Your Majesty!

61
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:10,187
<i>Your Majesty, you should not
be treating me this way!</i>

62
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:11,548
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

63
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:15,947
My son.

64
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,108
I will definitely save you.

65
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,788
Your Majesty!

66
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:58,908
In ancient times, there were some
who sinned too deeply

67
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,867
and would thus meet with
the wrath of heaven.

68
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,108
For example, there was someone
by the name of Jie Yu.

69
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,827
Because she had sinned too greatly

70
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:08,588
she had three successive pregnancies
that resulted in sick children.

71
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:11,747
- Really?
- Of course it's true.

72
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,588
My mother told me this when I was young.

73
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:17,708
That's why retribution
follows unfailingly.

74
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:22,307
After you follow me, you must not do
anymore bad things, all right?

75
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,067
I shall do as you command.

76
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:10,267
Si Yin, you're actually attempting
to break my seal?

77
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,067
That is impossible.

78
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,788
Unless I die.

79
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,307
Or if you die.

80
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,708
Your Highness.

81
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,947
Third Uncle, is Su Su all right?

82
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,707
I don't know the situation inside,
but Medicine King is here.

83
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,508
Don't be too worried.

84
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,988
It's born. It's finally born.

85
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,307
<i>Congratulations, Your Highness,
on the birth of your son.</i>

86
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:56,227
<i>Congratulations, Your Highness,
on the birth of your son.</i>

87
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:00,947
Congratulations, Your Highness,
on the birth of your son.

88
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,868
Congratulations on giving birth
to a son, Your Highness.

89
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,707
He looks very much like you.

90
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:53,988
Feel him.

91
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,988
<i>I won't be staying in the Nine Heavens.</i>

92
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,148
<i>You are a young prince.
They won't give you trouble.</i>

93
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,668
Nai Nai.

94
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,148
Your Highness.

95
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,707
Is he hungry?

96
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:42,587
Heavenly Lord had a nanny sent over.
I will bring him out to be fed.

97
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:46,388
Go on. I'm tired. I'll be sleeping.

98
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,707
Rest soon, Your Highness.

99
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,748
What?

100
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,868
She actually gave birth to a prince?

101
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:19,227
Yes, Your Highness.

102
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:23,388
The mortal sure has a lucky life to give
birth to a prince on her first pregnancy.

103
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,827
Now she will be able to
rely on her precious son.

104
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:29,388
In the future, they are certain to be
obstacles for Your Highness.

105
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,388
Why?

106
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,707
Why would she have such a good life?

107
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,947
She is merely a mortal.

108
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,868
She married the one I couldn't marry.

109
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,187
Her first child...

110
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:54,028
is a prince!

111
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:03,427
Xin Nu, tell me why!
Why would she have such a lucky life?

112
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:07,868
I am a princess of the Celestial Tribe,
a child of a meritorious subject!

113
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:13,628
How am I inferior to her?
In what way am I incomparable to her?

114
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,908
Your Highness, please don't be like this.

115
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:23,347
I know you are heartbroken,
but do not panic.

116
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:27,628
Hasn't Heavenly Lord already bestowed you
in marriage to the Crown Prince?

117
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,788
Once you are married into Xiwu Palace

118
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:32,988
would you still need to fear that you
won't have a child with the Crown Prince?

119
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:37,148
No matter what, Crown Prince is a man.

120
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,307
You will be his side consort
in the future.

121
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:41,028
As time passes

122
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,988
the Crown Prince will surely understand
your deep affections for him.

123
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,707
I can't accept this.

124
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,227
I don't deserve this.

125
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:55,067
I grew up with Ye Hua.

126
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,788
He has always been
the only one in my heart!

127
00:12:58,587 --> 00:12:59,868
Why?

128
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:04,107
Why was she allowed to claim him first?

129
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:35,347
Last night, you maids took advantage of
the fact that His Highness wasn't present

130
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,307
and denied entry to one from Xiwu Palace

131
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:40,988
nearly causing Her Highness, Su Su,
and the young prince to be in danger.

132
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,707
His Highness is merciful,
and won't sentence you to death

133
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,988
but punishment is inevitable.

134
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:48,587
Go accept your punishment today

135
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:51,388
and experience the hardships of
the mortal realm for a hundred years.

136
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:55,788
Yes. Thank you, Your Highness,
for sparing my life.

137
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:33,028
I believe it must have
a very beautiful color.

138
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,268
It is a plain color you like.

139
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,827
However, when the time comes, the
wedding outfit can't remain with you.

140
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,748
Wedding outfit?

141
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,187
Didn't I say before
that I would marry you?

142
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:50,748
Your Highness.

143
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,868
Crown Prince.

144
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,508
I'll be going now.

145
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:07,388
Your Highness, were these all
bestowed by the Crown Prince?

146
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,227
As expected, it is true.

147
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:12,307
Your Highness,
everybody in Xiwu Palace is saying

148
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,947
the Crown Prince will be
marrying you soon.

149
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,508
Your Highness, are you not delighted?

150
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:31,668
His Highness marrying me now
is merely out of pity for me.

151
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:35,067
Your Highness, don't think such nonsense.

152
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:39,067
I am jesting.

153
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,868
Help me put away these clothes.

154
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:46,628
Nai Nai, walk with me to Zhuxian Terrace.

155
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:53,227
Your Highness, how come you have been
going to Zhuxian Terrace so often lately?

156
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:57,347
It is... an inauspicious place.

157
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,908
I want to smell the fragrance
of flowers along the way.

158
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,107
No need to hold on to me.
I can't rely on you all the time.

159
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:21,307
Were we taking this same path yesterday?

160
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,707
Yes, Your Highness.

161
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:26,307
This is the shortest path from
Xiwu Palace to Zhuxian Terrace.

162
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:31,788
The fragrance of the flowers here
is most comforting.

163
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:34,427
From now on, I'll walk here by myself.

164
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,227
You can just follow behind me.

165
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:40,908
Taking care of the young prince
is tiring enough for you.

166
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:43,508
I can come out for a walk
by myself once in a while.

167
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,107
All right, Your Highness.

168
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:49,467
Crown Prince has lifted the restrictions
on the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

169
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,628
Your Highness has also given birth
to Crown Prince's first son.

170
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:58,748
Your Highness can now go wherever
you wish in the Celestial Palace.

171
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,347
Is that so?

172
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:02,788
Nai Nai.

173
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,428
What orders do you have, Your Highness?

174
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:08,188
Has Ye Hua chosen a name
for the young prince yet?

175
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:09,627
No.

176
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,468
I've asked His Highness.

177
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:15,028
He said the young prince
is to be named by Your Highness.

178
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:21,667
I want to call him A-Li.
Is this a good name?

179
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,827
It does sound nice

180
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,667
but which "Li"
is Your Highness speaking of?

181
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,188
The "li" of separation.

182
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:34,708
That's... That doesn't seem
very propitious.

183
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:39,867
Didn't you say I am in favor now?

184
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:43,268
I want to call him A-Li.
Is that not allowed?

185
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,147
I have made an indiscreet remark.

186
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:56,188
Nai Nai, ever since I lost my eyes

187
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,788
my mood has constantly been unstable.

188
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:02,627
If I cause you discomfort,
do not take it to heart.

189
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,667
I know most clearly
the suffering you have endured.

190
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,307
Why would I blame Your Highness?

191
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:09,988
Good.

192
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:14,387
Follow me. I want to walk to
Zhuxian Terrace by myself.

193
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,468
Yes.

194
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,748
<i>Zhe Yan?</i>

195
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:04,107
<i>He isn't... here to talk me back, is he?</i>

196
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:15,548
Thank you.

197
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,347
You are too polite.

198
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:22,667
Have you come to ask about
the sealing of Qing Cang?

199
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,067
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu sealed Qing Cang.

200
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:28,107
You are so close with Qing Qiu.

201
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:31,587
Why have you ignored what is
close at hand and come instead to me?

202
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:40,748
Would it be possible for...
this lady to step out?

203
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,748
I have been impolite.

204
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,827
Which palace is she from

205
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,067
for her to not step out even when
Dijun discuss matters with someone?

206
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,867
Could she be...

207
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:12,268
She is Ye Hua's cousin.
She comes here often.

208
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:15,548
She is a junior. I can't
bring myself to say anything.

209
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,147
Please continue.

210
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:20,147
Actually, there isn't much to say.

211
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,667
There are hidden circumstances
regarding this incident

212
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,228
but I cannot speak of them
in detail to you yet.

213
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,708
I came today to try my luck

214
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,627
and see if I can find here from you
something that I do not know.

215
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,107
Since you are unwilling to reveal
the truth's entirety

216
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,268
then I shall not force you.

217
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:47,548
I just had a speculation that

218
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:50,587
Bai Qian is the Si Yin of
Kunlun Mountain of the past.

219
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:54,587
The rest should be
about the same as what you know.

220
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:59,428
I truly did not expect that
you would have guessed so.

221
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,347
It was Feng Jiu who said it.

222
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,188
Feng Jiu?

223
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,147
If you hadn't mentioned her,
it really had slipped my mind.

224
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:16,587
Feng Jiu, that little girl, has left
Qing Qiu for quite some time now.

225
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,907
It's said she came to
repay your kindness.

226
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:25,147
That is correct.
She has indeed been here.

227
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,448
Has she finished repaying her debt?

228
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,667
I do not need her to repay any such debt.

229
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:39,907
Are you saying... she has caused
complications for you?

230
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,268
It has been a little inconvenient.

231
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,228
<i>In his eyes...</i>

232
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,307
<i>I am but an inconvenience.</i>

233
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:48,827
Don't come any closer!
I... I am Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu!

234
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:51,948
No!

235
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,428
Thank you for the tea, Dijun.
I take my leave now.

236
00:22:58,428 --> 00:22:59,788
You are too polite.

237
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,988
Your Highness, there are steps here.

238
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,708
Be careful.

239
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:25,387
Miss, you...

240
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:28,468
<i>The uncovered half of this lady's face
looks extremely similar to Bai Qian.</i>

241
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:31,748
<i>And this faintly discernible
peach blossom scent is highly familiar.</i>

242
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:36,228
High God Zhe Yan.

243
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,067
Crown Prince.

244
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:44,468
Has Su Su offended you?

245
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:49,307
Su Su? Her name is Su Su?

246
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:52,228
Yes. She belongs with Xiwu Palace.

247
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,347
So she belongs with you, Crown Prince.

248
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,307
Just now, I had nearly
taken her for an old friend.

249
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:03,667
She is just a mortal. She has never been
to Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods.

250
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,307
I'm afraid you are mistaken.

251
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,028
Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods?

252
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,228
Miss, do you know of
Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods?

253
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,951
So in the future

254
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,428
I won't be able to see
this Ten Mile Peach Tree Woods again.

255
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:20,548
In the future, I will plant
a grove for you.

256
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,708
Then I want ten miles as well.

257
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,387
I don't know of it.

258
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,708
The name just sounds unique.

259
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,228
You can visit when you have the chance.

260
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,748
Visit?

261
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,307
I hope there will be a chance.

262
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:53,428
Be careful.

263
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:10,107
Ye Hua.

264
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:14,788
I just wanted to go out
for a walk by myself.

265
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,708
The scent of the flowers
along the path smells very nice.

266
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:21,067
Su Su, you don't have to explain to me.

267
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:24,587
From now on, you are the Crown Princess
in the Nine Heavens.

268
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:26,827
Nobody will dare to question
your whereabouts again.

269
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:31,508
Ye Hua, don't worry.

270
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:36,548
I won't be going anywhere in the future.
I won't cause trouble for you again.

271
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,708
Are you thirsty?

272
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,307
I'll pour a cup of tea for you.

273
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,387
Su Su.

274
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,548
We'll be getting married in ten days.

275
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:02,347
Married?

276
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:17,428
- You...
- Ye Hua.

277
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,907
I can't see anything.

278
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:25,028
There must be many protocols
during the wedding.

279
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:26,788
I will probably be made fun of.

280
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:28,988
You won't be.

281
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:31,508
You have me.

282
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,948
That's good.

283
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,667
- Eldest Prince.
- Eldest Prince.

284
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,907
You may go.

285
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,387
Yes.

286
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,708
Your Highness.

287
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,307
- Father.
- It's as you can see.

288
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:31,587
Ye Hua will announce to the four seas
that he is marrying the mortal.

289
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:34,468
He has also fought against the decree
to allow Su Jin into Xiwu Palace.

290
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:39,548
I have been incapable of
disciplining my child.

291
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:41,067
Please punish me, Father.

292
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,647
After he received the Crown Prince's seal

293
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,827
he first replaced
the maids of Xiwu Palace

294
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:49,468
then he selected his own soldiers
to guard Xiwu Palace

295
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,988
and now he is taking a side consort.

296
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:57,067
He has made meticulous arrangements.
Even I cannot do anything about it.

297
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,548
What would you be able to do?

298
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,548
Father.

299
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:09,307
Ye Hua just received
the Crown Prince's seal.

300
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,627
He is the heir apparent chosen by heaven.

301
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,468
Even I have to salute him
as a heir apparent.

302
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:18,067
I cannot do anything to him now.

303
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:23,508
Let him be.

304
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:29,827
I simply do not believe he will focus on
this woman his whole life.

305
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:33,228
It's just that Qing Qiu...

306
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:36,748
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu is
the number one beauty of the world.

307
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,788
When she marries into
the Celestial Palace

308
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:41,867
she will certainly sway Ye Hua's heart.

309
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:47,708
I can only hope so.

310
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,627
You know I most dislike women crying.

311
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:56,387
If I ask you a question, you will answer.
No need for unnecessary talk.

312
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:58,988
I...

313
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:03,228
I locked the fox in Evil Sealing Pagoda.

314
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,708
Don't come any closer!

315
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:37,948
<i>Why does Dijun's power look so strange?
It is crimson in color?</i>

316
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:43,211
How dare a mere Pagoda Guardian
act so atrociously in front of me?

317
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,307
My tails!

318
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:11,708
<i>Oh no!</i>

319
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,708
Why is she bleeding so much?

320
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,667
I'm afraid she can't be helped.

321
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,548
Fool, you have it wrong.
The blood on Her Highness is from Dijun.

322
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:35,387
Dijun has suffered severe injuries?

323
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:48,147
Who in this world
is capable of injuring Dijun?

324
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:50,548
A few days ago, Dijun spent
a great amount of his powers

325
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,147
to save the Little Princess.

326
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:55,268
Today, he killed the Pagoda Guardian
of the Evil Sealing Pagoda.

327
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:58,107
These injuries were caused by
the Pagoda Guardian.

328
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,307
Pagoda Guardian?

329
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:03,147
That is the monster king
that Heavenly Father left behind

330
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,107
that terrifies the Nine Heavens.

331
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:08,428
All right, enough.
Treat Dijun's injuries first.

332
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,867
Yes.

333
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:06,587
I didn't die?

334
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:11,667
What is this place?

335
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,667
This is Dijun's chambers.

336
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:16,228
Chambers?

337
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:19,307
This is my first time in here.

338
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:33,907
Where is Dijun?

339
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,067
He is resting.

340
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,867
Is he heavily injured?
Have I caused him trouble again?

341
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:40,508
No, he really is resting.

342
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:43,827
Dijun said you have caused
too much damage.

343
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,748
You should return to Qing Qiu.

344
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:49,827
As for repaying his kindness,
he never expected it.

345
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:56,548
Little Princess, don't cry.

346
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,748
When you cry, I don't know what to do.

347
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,548
Dijun...

348
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,428
Is he throwing me out?

349
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,588
Your Highness has been
at Taichen Palace for a while now.

350
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:13,907
Do you still not know
Dijun's temperament by now?

351
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:18,827
He is an immortal made out of a rock.
He possesses no emotions or desires.

352
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,068
Don't waste your efforts any longer.

353
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:29,188
Bid farewell to Dijun for me.

354
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:45,588
I have asked the Little Princess to leave
the Nine Heavens as you wished.

355
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,027
Your Highness!

356
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:24,307
Didn't you set out to repay a kindness?

357
00:35:24,307 --> 00:35:25,907
How come you're in this state?

358
00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:32,507
Where is Aunt? I want to
discuss some things with her.

359
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:35,387
Aunt is not in Qing Qiu.

360
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:39,547
How come Aunt left Qing Qiu?
Has something happened?

361
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:44,188
Let's head back first.
I'll tell you all about it.

362
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,027
I remember now.

363
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:14,307
Did Aunt tell you anything?

364
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:18,987
Ever since Aunt's battle with Qing Cang,
she hasn't been seen.

365
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:20,427
What?

366
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:23,628
How come nobody told me
while I was in heaven?

367
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:25,148
Don't panic, Your Highness.

368
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:28,748
Fox King and Zhe Yan have said that
according to the stars, Aunt is fine.

369
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:30,347
We just don't know where she has gone.

370
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:34,268
You know Aunt's personality as well.
Perhaps she is just wandering around.

371
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,507
That is true.

372
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:40,427
Aunt and the Crown Prince
have an engagement.

373
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:42,027
For fear of alarming Celestial Tribe

374
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:45,262
and to avoid making this disappearance
known in every household around the world

375
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:47,827
Zhe Yan has told us
not to speak of this to others.

376
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:56,108
So has nobody taught Shao Xing a lesson
for stealing Aunt's marriage?

377
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:58,228
Who has the time to be concerned
about the snake?

378
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,108
No.

379
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:04,507
I have to stand up for Aunt.

380
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:07,588
Dijun stopped me when I wanted to teach
her a lesson in the Celestial Palace.

381
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:09,068
There's nobody to stop me today.

382
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:10,628
Your Highness.

383
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,188
How can you be so extreme?

384
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:16,347
You were so distracted when you returned.
How come you are out for revenge now?

385
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:20,307
I just want something to do
to temporarily forget about Dijun.

386
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:23,987
Just let me go, all right?

387
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:29,268
What... What's wrong, Your Highness?
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

388
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:33,268
Why would I cry?

389
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:35,788
I am going to teach a servant
a lesson for Aunt's sake.

390
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:37,467
Why would I cry?

391
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:50,027
Your Highness already
confronted Shao Xing once

392
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:51,547
back in the Celestial Palace.

393
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:55,268
Seeing as you are from Qing Qiu,
I made a concession.

394
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,668
Why have you come today
to stir up trouble again?

395
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:00,228
For someone like her
who betrayed her savior

396
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:01,507
how is one scolding enough?

397
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:02,907
You!

398
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,588
Do not go too far!

399
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,788
My lord, calm down.

400
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:13,867
You have already yielded to her once
in the Celestial Palace.

401
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:17,347
Are you going to allow her
to humiliate you again?

402
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:20,228
These all are what I deserve
to go through.

403
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:30,228
Your Highness has come at a good time.

404
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:34,228
I wanted to take this fan to Qing Qiu
to humbly apologize to Aunt.

405
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:40,507
Apologize? You aren't lying to me?

406
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:41,987
I was Aunt's maid.

407
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,628
I did something to betray her.
Of course I have to beg for forgiveness.

408
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:50,827
Since Your Highness has come today,
I will make the trip with you

409
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,748
and settle this matter.

410
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:57,947
You want to return to
the Fox Den with me?

411
00:38:57,947 --> 00:39:00,827
That's correct. We'll go right now.

412
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:07,628
<i>Wait. Aunt is not at Qing Qiu right now.</i>

413
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:10,867
<i>Nobody in the world knows.</i>

414
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,188
<i>I can't let this snake go.</i>

415
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:17,588
<i>I only came to scold her to vent. I
must not ruin things because of this.</i>

416
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:24,867
You don't need to go to apologize.
Aunt said she does not want to see you.

417
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,507
- But--
- No but.

418
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:28,041
Although Aunt doesn't want to see you

419
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,827
the Cloud Clearing Fan
still belongs to her.

420
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,467
You still need to return it to her.

421
00:39:33,347 --> 00:39:37,427
Please take it, Your Highness.
I don't dare keep it for myself.

422
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,347
Although you betrayed Aunt
and I shouldn't forgive you

423
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:53,947
ever since you left, you indeed have not
told outsiders about Qing Qiu's matters.

424
00:39:53,947 --> 00:39:56,788
You also returned the Cloud Clearing Fan
to me of your own accord.

425
00:39:56,788 --> 00:40:00,907
You have just narrowly gained
my forgiveness.

426
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:03,148
Qing Qiu's matters?

427
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:10,068
Is Your Highness referring to
the one in Yanhua Cave?

428
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:11,947
Yes.

429
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,027
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

430
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:18,427
I will not breathe a word of it
in my entire life.

431
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,748
I hope you will remember your own words.

432
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:26,467
Should I go against my word,
I shall be struck by lightning.

433
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,228
That puts me at ease then.

434
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:31,228
I will take this Cloud Clearing Fan.

435
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:35,387
However, I cannot say whether
Aunt will forgive you.

436
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:38,507
I understand.

437
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:55,307
Mi Gu! Mi Gu!

438
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,668
Your Highness.

439
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,427
Bai Feng Jiu!

440
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,188
Father.

441
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:19,188
Kneel!

442
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,907
Father, I know I was wrong.

443
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:25,547
I should not have gone to
the Celestial Palace to repay my debt.

444
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:46,467
