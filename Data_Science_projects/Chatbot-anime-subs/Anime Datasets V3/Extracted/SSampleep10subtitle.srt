. </font>no problem</font></font>

163
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,790
. </font>I thought that "Gates" is something that has got out of Ica-sama</font></font>

164
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,620
. </font>No "Gates" is something that is doing more than 781.000 around the world</font></font>

165
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,420
! </font>781.000 people? </font>unbelievable</font></font>

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,140
. </font>So your hands</font></font>

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,100
. </font>Yup</font></font>

174
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,360
. </font>Well, Tabaana</font></font>

175
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
! </font>Certainly</font></font>

176
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,280
Gates</font></font>

177
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,070
So salutes commoners each other, what can I say?</font></font>

178
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,030
! </font>This is a great freedom</font></font>

179
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,580
is not it ?</font></font>

180
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,620
! </font>We can not stand here so</font></font>

181
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,040
! </font>Let us see this wonderful colloquial greeting others</font></font>

182
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,750
! </font>great idea</font></font>

183
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,300
! </font>Of! </font>Ica</font></font>

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Damn, where did you go?</font></font>

185
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,970
! </font>Ica</font></font>

186
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,180
Ah, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

187
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,520
! </font>He, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

188
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,230
! </font>Oh</font></font>

189
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,150
! </font>"Kemeto-sama has just finished teaching the others," Gates</font></font>

190
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,360
! </font>We have done Kemeto, all of us can make friends with commoners</font></font>

191
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,490
! </font>Flannery Kemeto-all of you poison the fruits of our efforts</font></font>

192
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,290
! </font>In order for Flanflha</font></font>

193
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,830
! </font>great idea</font></font>

194
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,870
! </font>Well, here we</font></font>

195
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,870
... Astt, and</font></font>

196
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,250
! </font>Gates</font></font>

197
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,850
! </font>Oh, Hattori</font></font>

198
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,600
. </font>I did not hear you for a long time</font></font>

199
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,900
. </font>There is nothing here only girls</font></font>

200
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,070
At the beginning, I thought that in the hands down is the best, You know what?</font></font>

201
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,900
. </font>But since I came to this school, I realized something</font></font>

202
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,160
. </font>Best Men</font></font>

203
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,370
... When you are dealing with the girls you have to Ttroy</font></font>

204
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,040
But with the guys you can simply take it</font></font>

205
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,380
. </font>Really I miss the smell of men and fat fitness that build a good feeling</font></font>

206
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,670
. </font>I began to feel nostalgic</font></font>

207
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,090
- This e-</font></font>

208
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,390
! </font>This is bad</font></font>

209
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,520
Kemeto wants to go home?</font></font>

210
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,940
.. Yes, I have said to stay in the whole environment is claustrophobic girls</font></font>

211
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,690
. </font>He longed for the other men</font></font>

212
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,900
Does this mean that he longs for the muscles?</font></font>

213
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,740
. </font>In fact, nothing has been said in this regard</font></font>

214
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,660
Are you going Kemeto away?</font></font>

215
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,460
. </font>Let us think all of us in something so as not to make this happen</font></font>

216
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,750
But, what can we do?</font></font>

217
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,590
! </font>I got it</font></font>

218
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,090
! </font>We can become men</font></font>

219
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,010
what do you mean ?</font></font>

220
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,680
... We will give ourselves a little male</font></font>

221
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,010
! </font>And bees replace other men</font></font>

222
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,440
. </font>We got you, we will play a desire Korzaka in the presence of other males here</font></font>

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,230
.. Well, then, Flanqom as far as we have to become more masculine</font></font>

224
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,030
. </font>Even Kemeto-sama remains in this school</font></font>

225
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,570
! </font>Yup</font></font>

226
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,860
. </font>So again</font></font>

227
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,820
Ica-sama, what we have to do starters?</font></font>

228
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,960
... huh? </font>A-Yeah, let's see, let's see</font></font>

229
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,620
. </font>Flantsrv as it does Kemeto</font></font>

230
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,260
. </font>This is true, Kajorzaka is the only male who Talva with him</font></font>

231
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,880
. </font>Tradition is the beginning of all the art</font></font>

232
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,050
! </font>A-order! </font>That's right</font></font>

233
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,100
.. copy Kemeto huh? </font>Mm no specific thing comes to my mind immediately</font></font>

234
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,810
. </font>This is true, after I pointed out to him Valomr difficult</font></font>

235
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,070
SAL A, there is a way to copy Kajorzaka</font></font>

236
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,660
! </font>So</font></font>

237
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,120
K-Karen-sama?</font></font>

238
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
.. When Otusband with Kajorzaka</font></font>

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,420
. </font>It always lowers his gaze</font></font>

240
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,330
! </font>It looks specifically here</font></font>

241
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,750
This is true, huh?</font></font>

242
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,340
. </font>Kemeto-sama lowers his gaze vectorial So, too</font></font>

243
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,630
. </font>Let us try this</font></font>

244
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,680
! </font>Right</font></font>

245
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,520
! </font>I got it ! </font>I thought about a way to copy Kemeto</font></font>

246
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,360
! </font>I love muscle</font></font>

247
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,240
! </font>Oh</font></font>

248
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,400
! </font>This is like Kemeto-sama, true</font></font>

249
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,110


250
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,030
! </font>In this case, also Vsontaleg</font></font>

251
00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:01,750
! </font>I love muscle</font></font>

252
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,540
! </font>I love muscle</font></font>

253
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,210
! </font>I love muscle! </font>I love muscle! </font>I love muscle! </font>I love muscle</font></font>

254
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,720
! </font>I love muscle! </font>I love muscle</font></font>

255
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,130
! </font>I Djaltona angry now</font></font>

256
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,840
Take your time!</font></font>

257
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,510
This is not like Kemeto in fact, is not it?</font></font>

258
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,430
. </font>Ah, you're right, I am sorry</font></font>

259
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,480
. </font>Djaltona angry now</font></font>

260
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,240
. </font>Djaltona angry now</font></font>

261
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,740
. </font>Djaltona angry now</font></font>

262
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,450
. </font>Djaltona angry now. </font>Djaltona angry now. </font>Djaltona angry now. </font>Djaltona angry now</font></font>

263
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,250
. </font>Kemeto do so, for sure</font></font>

264
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,590
. </font>But I have a feeling that this is something useless this</font></font>

265
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,420
What is, Arzogaoa?</font></font>

266
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,470
. </font>I do not know, I do not know what is</font></font>

267
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,390
. </font>But I have a feeling that something different</font></font>

268
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,220
! </font>that's it</font></font>

269
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
Do you know what is it?</font></font>

270
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,350
.. muscles! </font>The men in the video who built themselves</font></font>

271
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,770
But we are still young women, is not it?</font></font>

272
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,940
! </font>This is true! </font>This is the crucial difference</font></font>

273
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,400
! </font>Kemeto likes muscles, which means we also have to do with them</font></font>

274
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,280
! </font>This is certainly true! </font>Let us go the strategy of muscles at once</font></font>

275
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,200
. </font>thanks for waiting</font></font>

276
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
It is made well, is not it?</font></font>

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,460
. </font>Muscle</font></font>

278
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,550
. </font>With this, there is one of them</font></font>

279
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,300
! </font>Well, Sortdaha</font></font>

280
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,390
! </font>What about me, I want to see me Kemeto-sama muscular way</font></font>

281
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,430
 Let me do it</font></font>

282
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,200
. </font>No other choice but to report stone paper scissors</font></font>

283
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,320
. </font>A-order</font></font>

284
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,620
! </font>Stone Paper Scissors</font></font>

285
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,910


286
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,620
! </font>I am the actress is</font></font>

287
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
! </font>Okay</font></font>

288
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,830
Okay ?</font></font>

289
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,670
Huh?</font></font>

290
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,960
. </font>Error</font></font>

291
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,180
. </font>Do not you look more than a young lady boasts Badilaha so</font></font>

292
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
What you expected more Menhma?</font></font>

293
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,140
. </font>Hairstyle</font></font>

294
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,680
. </font>It's right, you'll at least have to have such hairstyle Kemeto</font></font>

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,020
... No, we have to have the ultimate male, which means</font></font>

296
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,520
Hairstyle Samurai hair?</font></font>

297
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:39,200
. </font>Yes, Calcamuray, I heard Kajorzaka say once</font></font>

298
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,080
"The samurai was a model for Japanese men"</font></font>

299
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,250
E.-this makes us leave our clothes and I can not wear a skirt</font></font>

300
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,540
. </font>You are right in this regard</font></font>

301
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,130
. </font>When it comes to masculinity, there is nothing more than a noble man</font></font>

302
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,000
. </font>Let's put this</font></font>

303
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
. </font>In this case, also with walking sticks</font></font>

304
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,210
. </font>mustache</font></font>

305
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,630
. </font>Amazing, this will be it</font></font>

306
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,220
! </font>T-loveable Potency</font></font>

307
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,100
. </font>Hard to move Balorjae and I wear this Sokhalaha</font></font>

308
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,520
What else ? </font>Have you forgotten something?</font></font>

309
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,440
. </font>I forgot the smell of men and fitness mast, built a good feeling</font></font>

310
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,740
! </font>I am owned by me</font></font>

311
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,740
. </font>Kemeto-sama said he longed for the smell of men</font></font>

312
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,660
The smell of men?</font></font>

313
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,370
. </font>Smell the task, it is true</font></font>

314
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,960
What is the smell of men exactly?</font></font>

315
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,380
the meat ?</font></font>

Is this not the sky which was seen Kemeto-sama?</font></font>

361
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,790
I thought I understood the ethics of all this world expanding</font></font>

Feelings that can not be predicted, and the usefulness of the guide</font></font>

365
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:50,480
The dividing line between the cheek mixing red, dark blue</font></font>

366
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:01,910
And before I know about it, it made it hard to say inside or outside my heart</font></font>

367
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:09,790
Do not disappear in the twilight, near to see what it all I</font></font>

368
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:17,050
I'm sure that everything will be an opportunity to love</font></font>
