1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,227
Okay,
for today’s homeroom period,

2
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,028
Let’s talk about

3
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,399
this year’s Literary Fest.

4
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,997
I wonder what we’re
going to do this year.

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,342
I am looking forward to it, you know?

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,535
So Japanese schools have
Literary Fest too.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,209
Every class and club

8
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:25,709
does something different.

9
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:27,879
Last year, we did an ensemble.

10
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:37,893
[Sakura, Shao Lang, and a Sea of Sand]

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,795
We all voted yesterday,

12
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,901
and the result for Class 5-2 is a play.

13
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:47,794
It’s a play!

14
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,395
It’s a play!

15
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,733
I wonder what the story is going to be.

16
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:02,148
Class 6-1 is also doing a play,

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,052
But they will be doing

18
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,448
an ancient Japanese story,

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,586
So I thought,

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,122
how about let’s do a western play?

21
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:10,984
What do you think?

22
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:22,437
The dream that the card showed me…

23
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,202
That was Mizuki-sensei after all.

24
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,577
Besides, Kero said

25
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,711
what Dream showed was a prophetic dream.

26
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:40,756
Does it mean

27
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:43,026
something like what’s
in the dream will happen some day?

28
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,360
But

29
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,058
whenever I’m looking at Mizuki-sensei…

30
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,460
I always feel so schweeet!

31
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,099
So, the title of the play

32
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,770
you have all been waiting for…

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,342
SLEEPING BEAUTY

34
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:08,446
Then we will decide who play the role.

35
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,414
In order to let everyone

36
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,087
have a fair chance to play any role,

37
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,419
We will use the method of amidakuji.

38
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,356
Now then come up here

39
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,992
in the order of your class number.

40
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,329
Yes!

41
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,499
I wonder what role I’m getting…

42
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:33,769
Whatever role you are playing,

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,013
I will make the costume for you for sure!

44
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,343
To… Tomoyo-chan…

45
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,153
You don’t need to be so alert like that.

46
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,055
It will be very soon.

47
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,125
Let’s get back to our seats.

48
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,338
Shao Lan?

49
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,144
What’s wrong?

50
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,512
Mizuki-sensei said,

51
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:14,809
“It will be very soon.”

52
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:16,014
What will be?

53
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,184
I don’t know.

54
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,949
But she does have
something in her mind after all.

55
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:23,355
Okay, let’s reveal the results!

56
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,133
Sleeping Beauty is the story

57
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,229
of a sleeping princess…
who was woken up

58
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:33,730
by the kiss of a prince, right?

59
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:34,934
That is correct.

60
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:38,808
Then if I get to play the Princess,

61
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,806
and Shao Lang gets to play the Prince…

62
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:50,077
Oh, what a beautiful Princess!

63
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:56,957
I will wake her with my kiss…

64
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,374
Oh my!

65
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:14,906
I don’t wanna be the Prince.

66
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:17,713
Let’s see…

67
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:22,579
The Princess and the Prince are…

68
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,670
You’re playing the Prince?

69
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,540
I am sure you will play
a very cute prince!

70
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,168
I will ask the teachers

71
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,344
to let me make your costume!

72
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,276
I am really looking forward to this!

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,545
The play is the Sleeping Beauty, right?

74
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,021
Then the main character is the Princess.

75
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:00,654
Who is it?

76
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:02,256
Li-kun…

77
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,985
What’s up with that?!

78
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,260
But it’s all decided by amidakuji.

79
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,926
I will work hard on Li-kun’s costume too!

80
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:12,527
Because he is Sakura-chan’s co-star!

81
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,101
But now a girl plays a boy’s role

82
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,339
and vice versa.

83
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,808
Mizuki-sensei said everyone

84
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,376
has a fair chance to play any role…

85
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,008
Mizuki-sensei?

86
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:28,515
She appeared in what
Dream showed you, didn’t she?

87
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,056
Even that brat’s alert around her.

88
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:35,950
Who is she?

89
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,328
I’m sure I could sense power in her.

90
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:40,922
She has something real

91
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:42,494
powerful with her.

92
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,534
And so…

93
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,203
I’m going to the Literary Fest too.

94
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,107
What’s that all about?!

95
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,783
I’m going to check out that Mizuki-sensei

96
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,450
and watch you in action!

97
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,919
Kero-chan! You just wanna
go to the fest, don’t you?

98
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,151
That is so true!

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,590
So it is.

100
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,407
“I have this sword and courage in me!…”

101
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,007
“…I promise…”

102
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:29,542
“…I will break the curse
for the Princess!…”

103
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,206
This is so hard!

104
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:36,310
I wonder if I can do this right…

105
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:41,822
“O… Oh my!
I… I wonder what… this is…”

106
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,223
Li, you’re practicing too?

107
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,535
Are you okay?

108
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,739
You’re practicing over here.

109
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,477
Me too!

110
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:09,480
I’ve never played
a princess or a prince,

111
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:12,813
So I’m nervous.

112
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:14,658
Me too.

113
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,691
So, have you done anything
in Literary Fest in your school
in Hong Kong before?

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,822
Like twice…

115
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,697
What did you play?

116
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,389
I sang…

117
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,066
What song did you sing?

118
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,434
Sing it!

119
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:28,964
I don’t like singing

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,138
in front of people.

121
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:31,700
I see…

122
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,468
Sing it one of these days, okay?

123
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,608
Hello!

124
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,510
Yukito-san!

125
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:45,452
You guys having lunch break?

126
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:46,282
Yes!

127
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,719
Our teacher is absent today,

128
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,687
so we have a self-study period.

129
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,494
I was thinking of eating a little…

130
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:54,760
Why don’t we eat together?

131
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:55,958
Sure!

132
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,225
Okay, let’s eat!

133
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:01,237
Th… This…

134
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,701
All of these…

135
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,700
I hope it’s enough for three people…

136
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:05,965
May be not enough.

137
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,884
Come to think of it, isn’t it the time
for your school’s Literary Fest?

138
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:25,320
Th… That’s right.

139
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,288
What is your class doing?

140
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,023
A… A play.

141
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,263
Which play?

142
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,569
Sle… Sleeping Beauty.

143
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:33,926
Both of you are going to be in it, right?

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,134
What roles do you play?

145
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:42,843
Whatever roles you play,

146
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,739
I’ll make sure I won’t miss it.

147
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,945
Umm…

148
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:47,476
You coming…

149
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,110
Yeah. As usual of course!

150
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,882
Good luck!

151
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,050
Yes!

152
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,492
Yukito-san is coming to watch.

153
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:01,429
I gotta practice harder.

154
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,128
Li-kun.

155
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:06,565
Do you want to practice together?

156
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,974
There’re many scenes
I get to play against you…

157
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:12,871
I thought practicing together

158
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,111
might be a good idea.

159
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,047
But you don’t have time, do you?

160
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:22,844
When?

161
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:24,951
To practice…

162
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:26,485
Are you sure?

163
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,587
I don’t want to do bad either.

164
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:30,590
Thanks!

165
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:34,963
How about tomorrow morning
before school starts?

166
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,380
What’s going on?

167
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,889
Why are there so many alarm clocks?

168
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,025
They’re Father’s and Touya’s.

169
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:46,932
I’m practicing for the play with Li-kun

170
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:49,433
from today on…

171
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,170
I can’t be late.

172
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,042
It’s rare you are
practicing on your own…

173
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,336
I respect you.

174
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,440
Because…
Yukito-san’s coming to watch!

175
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,851
Since I’m not bringing lunch today,

176
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,286
I wonder what to eat for breakfast!

177
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:20,869
Onii-chan?

178
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,603
You don’t have morning practice
today, right?

179
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:30,916
Why are you up so early?

180
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,482
I happened to have woken up.

181
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:44,285
Is this mine?

182
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,318
Don’t eat it if you don’t want to.

183
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,459
I’ll eat it!

184
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,508
I wonder if he’s up early

185
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,745
in order to make breakfast for me…

186
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,446
Sakura…
When you caught a cold that one time…

187
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:13,681
Mirror!

188
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:29,566
This way I’ll be okay…

189
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,304
Wh… What about it?

190
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,247
You’re done?

191
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,679
Save some so that
I can have more later.

192
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,051
I’ll just make more later.

193
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,390
What about the medicine?

194
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:52,663
You don’t need to take it

195
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,053
unless you’re sick.

196
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,495
You aren’t Sakura, right?

197
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,169
Don’t do crazy things like that again.

198
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,415
What was he trying to say?

199
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,559
Could it be that

200
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,091
he knows I’m gathering the Clow Cards…?

201
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,564
It can’t be. If he knows,

202
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:32,927
he’d be scolding me already.

203
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,899
Mizuki-sensei…

204
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,073
I gotta hurry up to school!

205
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:30,918
Good morning!

206
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,292
Good morning!

207
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:34,928
You got here even before I did!

208
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:35,995
You’re so early!

209
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,768
Hey, since the weather’s so nice,

210
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:40,969
how about practicing outside?

211
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,904
I wonder what this is…

212
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,568
And like that,
the Princess walked towards the spindle…

213
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,636
…and tried to touch it with her finger.

214
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:30,550
Awesome!

215
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:32,254
You remembered almost all the lines!

216
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,358
The Princess doesn’t have many lines,
that’s all.

217
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,353
Okay, let’s skip

218
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,356
the scenes with the fairies.

219
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,697
Oh! What a beautiful Princess!

220
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,100
If I can wake the Princess

221
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,102
with my kiss…

222
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:58,576
I swear by this sword!

223
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,577
I will love this beautiful princess

224
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,286
of the forest of thorns
with all my heart.

225
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,759
And with this kiss…

226
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,039
L… Li-kun!

227
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,411
What?!

228
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,312
Wind Descend!

229
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,132
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,608
Reveal thy true form before me.

231
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,773
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

232
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,505
Release!

233
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:18,790
Fly!

234
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:45,814
What’s going on?!

235
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:47,347
It’s the act of a Clow Card!

236
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,017
But I didn’t sense it at all!

237
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,430
What card is this?!

238
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:02,070
I’m afraid, it’s Sand,

239
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,235
the card of the sand.

240
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,601
How do I turn it back?

241
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,271
First, we need to stop it from moving!

242
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:18,818
Li-kun!

243
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:28,994
Li-kun!

244
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,191
Don’t come!

245
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:30,991
But!

246
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:32,196
Do what I say!

247
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,432
Yes.

248
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,233
Use Watery and envelop this area!

249
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,672
But it’ll fill this place up,
and besides,

250
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,070
that won’t stop it from moving!

251
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,407
Just do it!

252
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,258
Water, pour over the sand!

253
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,362
Watery!

254
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,851
Freeze!

255
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:34,729
Freeze!

256
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,091
Now!

257
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,826
Return to thy
form which thou should be!

258
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,098
Clow Card!

259
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,589
Li-kun!

260
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:07,225
Are you okay?

261
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:08,993
Yeah. Kinda…

262
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,272
Here.

263
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:27,406
It’s yours.

264
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:28,747
Why?

265
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,746
You were the one who thought
of how to capture it,

266
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,657
And earlier

267
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:36,186
you let me have the card, Cloud.

268
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,785
But you do understand

269
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:39,763
I’m fighting you

270
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,458
over the Clow Cards.

271
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,868
But this card is yours.

272
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:48,496
Here.

273
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:52,438
I’m not gonna give it back

274
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:53,743
if you regret later.

275
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,445
It’s almost time the others come in.

276
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:06,585
Thank goodness, the card was active

277
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:07,882
before school starts…

278
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:09,848
I wonder if it’s a coincidence…

279
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,021
Maybe it knows

280
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,193
only the two of us
are here at this hour…

281
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:16,730
Why?

282
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,503
Nothing.
I hope I’m just thinking too much.

283
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,894
It will be very soon.
