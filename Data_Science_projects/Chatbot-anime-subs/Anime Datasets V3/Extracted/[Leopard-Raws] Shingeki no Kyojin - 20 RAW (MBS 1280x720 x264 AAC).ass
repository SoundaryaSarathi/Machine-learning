Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.88,0:07:45.93,Default,,0,0,0,,a spy managed to slip in amongst us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.16,0:07:48.57,Default,,0,0,0,,And he narrowed down the possibilities from there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.03,0:07:52.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Then, this spy killed Sawney and Bean?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.82,0:07:58.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Back then, the Commander asked me about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.55,0:08:02.24,Default,,0,0,0,,What do you see?

Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.41,0:08:18.33,Default,,0,0,0,,I knew.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.33,0:08:21.45,Default,,0,0,0,,But I didn't say anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.45,0:08:23.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you know why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.15,0:08:25.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.06,0:08:28.70,Default,,0,0,0,,What, can't you tell?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.70,0:08:31.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I guess I shouldn't expect much from the likes of you.
