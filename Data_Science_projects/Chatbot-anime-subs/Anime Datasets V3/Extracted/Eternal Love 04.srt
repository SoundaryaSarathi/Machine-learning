4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
But listen to me.

5
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Ever since you left Grand Ziming Palace

6
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,520
from the day Father had me
imprisoned in the dungeons...

7
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,960
I thought of you day and night.

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,479
I know my heart will have
no other from now on.

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
Although I am friendly with Your Highness

10
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
I do not have any
romantic feelings for you.

11
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,159
I am sorry.

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,159
A-Yin, listen to me.

13
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,000
I really am serious.

14
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,120
I just want to be with you
like how we were in Grand Ziming Palace

15
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,879
drinking, teasing,
and talking about everything.

16
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,879
But you are the Ghost Realm's
Second Prince after all.

17
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
Why don't you stay in
the guest room tonight?

18
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,120
It seems to be getting late.

19
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,960
I will escort you off the mountain
tomorrow morning.

20
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,719
I did not come here from afar
just to hear you say that.

21
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,759
I am sorry to
disappoint you, Your Highness.

22
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,159
How dare you of the Ghost Tribe
come to Kunlun Mountain?

23
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,080
Seventeenth, stand back.

24
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,840
Are you going to defend him?

25
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,919
Have you forgotten your identity?

26
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:45,280
Leaving aside that your father tormented
Ninth to the point he was traumatized

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,479
you even dared come to Kunlun Mountain
to harass Seventeenth.

28
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,599
I will not let you off lightly.

29
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,879
You are A-Yin's fellow disciple.
I will not fight you.

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
So what if you do?

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,479
Back in Grand Ziming Palace

32
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,159
my junior disciples were
at a disadvantage

33
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,840
only because their powers
were suppressed.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,000
Today, I'll show you
Kunlun Mountain's swordsmanship!

35
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,656
No! Senior, let it go!

36
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:33,985
If I don't beat him half to death

37
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,839
I'll worry that he'll return
to harass you!

38
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,680
Senior!

39
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,439
Even you are defending him?

40
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,920
Just let him go.

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,235
Why should I?

42
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:44,720
Have you forgotten how
his father humiliated you?

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,480
When we were at Grand Ziming Palace,
he took good care of us.

44
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,120
Moreover, if not for the sake of
returning to apologize to Master

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
I would have already committed suicide.

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,519
On the day we escaped,
if he hadn't protected Seventeenth

47
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,040
Seventeenth would have
been disabled, if not dead.

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,120
Is that the truth?

49
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Even so, he a prince of Ghost Realm.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Don't forget that it was his father
who first captured you.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,399
Hurry and leave.

52
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,079
A-Yin, wait for me. I will be back.

53
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,480
Leave quickly.

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,600
- Don't go!
- Senior!

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Zi Lan!

56
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
- Senior.
- Chase him!

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,000
- Yes!
- Senior, let him go.

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
You two...

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,459
I don't care anymore!

60
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,199
Senior.

61
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,399
I couldn't catch up to him.

62
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,759
Judging from the direction he went

63
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,271
he was headed towards
the cave that has been sealed off.

64
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,639
That cave?

65
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,800
Senior, are we still going after him?

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,079
No need to.

67
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,199
Ninth is someone
who knows right from wrong.

68
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,959
Yet, he spoke up for Li Ming.

69
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,199
He must not be a bad person.
It's good enough that he left.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,240
Senior, I could feel a sinister aura
coming from that cave from afar.

71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,560
Master has also told us to stay away.

72
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,040
What is sealed in there?

73
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,879
The Lord of the Numinous Treasures
borrowed that cave from Master.

74
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,439
It's said something with
a strong demonic essence is kept there.

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,000
If the Ghost Prince is lucky,
he will avoid it.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,560
If not, that is his fate.

77
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,839
Si Yin, how come you were in the mood
to come down from the mountain with me?

78
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,139
I happen to have free time today,
so I'm taking you around.

79
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,839
I heard Senior Disciple had
a fight with someone today.

80
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,680
I heard that person is a prince.

81
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:01,572
Ever since you returned
from the Ghost Realm

82
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:04,279
you've been studying texts on
immortal powers and Daoism every day.

83
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,800
Is it because the Ghost Realm
is really going to rebel?

84
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,079
Why would you suddenly ask that?

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,519
When I lived at Qian Qian's Den

86
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,519
I would sometimes hear her say that

87
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,000
the current Ghost Lord has
a rebellious heart

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,879
and there will end up being a big war.

89
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,879
That is indeed the case.

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,720
However, they won't be able to revolt.

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,560
My master's formation spells are
enough to decimate their tribe.

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
Formation spells?

93
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,000
Who is it?

94
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,334
Immortal.

95
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,944
Where did you come from, little monster?

96
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:41,564
Don't you know
this is Kunlun Mountain?

97
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:44,839
Immortal, follow me quickly
to save my Second Prince.

98
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,319
Are you speaking of Li Jing?

99
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,879
Go, I'll follow you.

100
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,839
Si Yin!

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
Li Jing!

102
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,879
Li Jing, let's go.

103
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,240
Li Jing!

104
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,278
Your Highness, Your Highness!
Are you all right?

105
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,679
Have mercy!

106
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,759
Lord of Numinous Treasures.

107
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,279
You have so quickly gloriously risen
to the rank of high immortal.

108
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,799
Your Highness.

109
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,519
It only happened a few days ago.

110
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,080
Are you here to see Master, my Lord?

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
No.

112
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
I had set a seal on this phoenix.

113
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,720
Just now, I sensed unusual activity,
so I came to take a look.

114
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Is this phoenix your mount?

115
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,639
Not exactly.

116
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,522
The demonic essence in this phoenix
has yet to be removed.

117
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,961
I planned to have the spiritual influence
of Kunlun Mountain

118
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,960
rid it of its demonic essence.

119
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,200
I did not expect it would
injure the two of you.

120
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,039
Will you allow me to
deal with the phoenix?

121
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,159
Since it is your phoenix,
then of course you can.

122
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,399
This is the Cloud Clearing Fan.

123
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,120
Although it cannot compare to
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun

124
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,600
it still has its uses.

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,679
Consider it a gift of apology
to the two of you.

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,879
How can I accept it?

127
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,000
There's no need to be polite.
Please accept it.

128
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,960
Thank you, my Lord.

129
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,919
Bear this in mind.

130
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,519
The amount of power this fan can produce

131
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,919
depends entirely on
the power level of the user.

132
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,440
Rest assured.

133
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,320
I will not allow this fan to fall into
the hands of someone evil and powerful.

134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Farewell now.

135
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,600
Your Highness!

136
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,639
Come.

137
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,159
- You're awake?
- A-Yin.

138
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,759
It's good you are awake. Rest now.

139
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,120
Thank you for shielding me
from the phoenix today.

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
Shield? It was no use.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,559
I cannot believe it's been twice today
that I needed you to save me.

142
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,240
This is Kunlun Mountain.
You are the Ghost Realm's Second Prince.

143
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,039
Your powers would naturally
be suppressed.

144
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,759
There is nothing to be embarrassed about.

145
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,399
A-Yin, thank you for coming to see me.

146
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,559
After being imprisoned by Father,
although I braved the chance to see you

147
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,120
when I think of it

148
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,759
even I look down on myself.

149
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,919
You are the 17th disciple
of Kunlun Mountain

150
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,000
and also a high immortal
respected throughout the world.

151
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,000
Who am I to deserve
another chance to see you?

152
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,279
Don't think about those things now.

153
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,519
The phoenix has been taken away.
You can recuperate here.

154
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,159
I'll go get some more hot water for you.

155
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,399
A-Yin.

156
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
What do I do if I want to see you again?

157
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,960
See me?

158
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,000
You have to at least give me a way
to enter Kunlun Mountain.

159
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,519
With this talisman, you'll be able to
freely come and go from Kunlun Mountain.

160
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,159
By the way, nobody on Kunlun Mountain
knows I am a woman.

161
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,960
So, you have to be careful.

162
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,799
Don't let my fellow disciples know.

163
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Xuan Nu, you came at the right time.
Come with me.

164
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,600
Look, your mother has come to visit you.

165
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,039
Unfilial daughter.

166
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,840
You actually came to Kunlun Mountain
to flee your marriage.

167
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,240
Come back with me.
Don't embarrass your sister any longer.

168
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm not going back! I'm not going to
marry that black bear spirit.

169
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Do you think you are your sister?

170
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,639
She was born from the legal wife

171
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,120
so naturally, she could marry into
Qing Qiu's Bai family.

172
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Your mother is a concubine.
Do you understand?

173
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,879
If you are so arrogant, you will only be
causing yourself harm in the future.

174
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,519
Senior, please help me!

175
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,039
If I don't find someone I like,
I would rather not marry!

176
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,159
You...

177
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,080
Madam, look at how opposed to
this marriage your daughter is.

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,559
Why don't you just let it go?

179
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,879
You...

180
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Daoist priest, I am her mother.

181
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,519
It is in my right to
take her home and marry her off.

182
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,480
Although you are Mo Yuan's disciple

183
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,759
a high immortal revered
throughout the four seas

184
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,559
isn't it unreasonable
for you to interfere?

185
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,240
I...

186
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,080
If this marriage arrangement is delayed

187
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,960
I wonder if you would be able to
bear the consequences?

188
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,159
I...

189
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,720
May I ask what your identity was
before you came to Kunlun Mountain?

190
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,159
I...

191
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,600
My senior had
quite the influential status.

192
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,799
He is the second prince of West Sea.

193
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,279
Does he have a marriage arrangement?

194
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,720
No.

195
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,159
So your interference just now means
you are interested in my daughter?

196
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,679
- Who can say?
- Who knows?

197
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,080
You two stop the nonsense.

198
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,039
- Madam, listen to me--
- Madam.

199
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,039
Madam, look. It has just started.
You can't tear them apart.

200
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,200
- Let them have some time together.
- That's right.

201
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,679
Senior is one of respected stature.

202
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,159
It's inappropriate to
ask him directly. It's not good.

203
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,519
When the two really become a pair

204
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,320
are you afraid Senior wouldn't come
asking for her hand in marriage?

205
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,799
That's why I say you should let
Xuan Nu stay here a bit longer.

206
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,240
- Then...
- There will eventually be good news.

207
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,679
Yes.

208
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,399
That sets my mind at ease then.

209
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,759
- Madam, take care.
- Madam, take care.

210
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,200
Madam, take care.

211
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,399
Have you two had enough?

212
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,480
It was an urgent situation, Senior.

213
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,759
Yes.

214
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,816
Xuan Nu, don't entertain
any foolish ideas.

215
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,754
I don't harbor any
improper thoughts about you.

216
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,039
They just made it up.

217
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,440
I did not think too much into it.

218
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,000
I apologize to you
on behalf of the two of them.

219
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,840
As senior disciple
of Kunlun Mountain

220
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,960
how can I think of marriage
when practicing Daoism?

221
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,440
I'll be returning to West Sea
when I finish my discipleship.

222
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,960
As second prince of West Sea, my marriage
will naturally be arranged by my father.

223
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,840
How can it be made
the subject of your ridicule?

224
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,922
It was only to get out of
that emergency situation.

225
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:34,990
That's right, Senior.

226
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,171
Don't be angry. We obviously know
you don't have feelings for Xuan Nu.

227
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,159
We also know that with
your identity and status

228
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,063
your marriage will be arranged.

229
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,080
All right, get back to studying.

230
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,360
Yes.

231
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,799
"A-Yin."?

232
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,119
"My only wish is to make you smile
with this sincere parting poem."

233
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,160
"This poem carries a vow--"

234
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,519
I gave him a talisman so he could come
bid farewell after he was healed.

235
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,640
How come he sent this sappy poem?

236
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,640
A-Yin, is this from
the Ghost Realm's second prince?

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,880
"When will the day come
when we love each other dearly?"

238
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,839
"In this very moment--"

239
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,279
Nonsense.

240
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,400
Qian Qian, I envy you so much
for having such a beautiful face.

241
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,719
If I had your looks, I'd be content
even if I only a few hundreds years.

242
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,692
You've said that for
a few hundred years already.

243
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,480
I really do envy you a lot.

244
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,119
I like your looks and your appearance.

245
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,359
However, my parents made me so ugly.

246
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,880
How are you ugly? I don't think so.

247
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,519
But since you like my face,
I'll give it to you.

248
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,960
Give to me?

249
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,559
Zhe Yan has the ability to
change appearances.

250
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,079
I'll talk to him for you.

251
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,240
- I'll have him teach you.
- You mustn't lie to me.

252
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,519
After I learn it,
will I be able to look like you?

253
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,839
It will probably be able
to last a few hours.

254
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,559
It's just a temporary change?

255
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,361
Why would you want to
look like me all the time?

256
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,759
You are from the Fox Clan
and already look similar to me.

257
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,640
You'll look even more like me
when you grow up.

258
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,599
Don't take such a minor spell
so seriously.

259
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,799
By the way, you must not use
this magic for evil purposes.

260
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,200
Karma has a cause.
Evil actions will be punished.

261
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,440
Come with me.

262
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Why would I do something bad?

263
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,920
<i>Why?</i>

264
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,079
<i>Why is it that we are all the same</i>

265
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,440
<i>but I have to marry
a lowly black bear spirit?</i>

266
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,799
A-Yin.

267
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,200
<i>Today's poem will be
somewhat melancholic.</i>

268
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,160
<i>You might understand.</i>

269
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
<i>I rather pretend to
seek drunkenness with wild abandon</i>

270
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,920
<i>for feigned cheer from
drink and song holds no joy.</i>

271
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>Clothes hang loose on my body,
yet regret I have not.</i>

272
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,039
<i>For her, I wither away willingly.</i>

273
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,920
How is it melancholic?
It's clearly sappy.

274
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,200
I have to go to my lesson.
Don't get in my way.

275
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,599
All right, I'll take it.
Can you go now?

276
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,359
<i>A-Yin, I'll see you again
in the next life.</i>

277
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,400
He's going to commit suicide?

278
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,759
Li Jing!

279
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,799
Li Jing! Li Jing!

280
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,119
Using that artifact
will only hurt his body.

281
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,160
Why don't you try stimulating his heart?

282
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,480
Perhaps he'll wake up then.

283
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,359
Li Jing, if you wake up,
I'll give you my promise.

284
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,619
Once you promise me,
you can't go back on your word.

285
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,799
Liar!

286
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,240
What if I go back on my word?

287
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,119
Then I'll really go and die.

288
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
Go ahead then. I'm leaving.

289
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
A-Yin.

290
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I've been at Kunlun Mountain
for half a month now.

291
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,119
I've only seen you once.

292
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,920
It hurts my heart to think of it.

293
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Stop it.

294
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,720
Putting aside you and I

295
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,440
what do you plan on doing with
the wives in your harem?

296
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,279
They'll be immediately disbanded.

297
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,759
Really?

298
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,880
In this lifetime, I, Li Jing,
will only be with A-Yin.

299
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,920
If I break this oath

300
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,240
I shall have no posterity,
and live a life of loneliness.

301
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,319
Don't say that kind of thing. Sit down.

302
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,799
A-Yin...

303
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,319
Can you give me a massage? It hurts.

304
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,119
Your fiery qilin never spoke before.

305
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,279
How come he suddenly spoke today?

306
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
He talked too much in his early years

307
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,119
so I told him to stop talking
and be a mute.

308
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,559
I see he knows you very well.

309
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,799
He must have won
the hearts of many women for you.

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,039
My bones... my bones...

311
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't move.

312
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,119
Do not move.

313
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,599
Why are you staring at me like that?

314
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,759
I really want to be with you.

315
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,480
What goes on in your mind all day?

316
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,039
You're avoiding me again.

317
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm not talking anymore.

318
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
I am a disciple of Kunlun Mountain.

319
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
How can I stand your constant sappiness?

320
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,119
- But--
- I can't talk any longer. I'm going now.

321
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,839
You can stay here.

322
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,519
Don't let my fellow disciples see you.

323
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,472
Cloud leaping isn't allowed
on Kunlun Mountain.

324
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:48,720
Don't come again.

325
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,079
<i>About Master's
Bell of the East Emperor...</i>

326
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,400
<i>They all speak of it
without going into detail.</i>

327
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,839
<i>Forget it. I'll wait for Master
to come out of seclusion.</i>

328
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,759
A-Yin, you've been disappearing
right after morning lessons lately.

329
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,240
I can never find you.

330
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,839
Have you found someplace fun
to pass the time?

331
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,440
There's no such thing.

332
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,000
I have just been going to feed
the red-crowned cranes with Senior.

333
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,799
I know you are starting to avoid me,
just like Senior.

334
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,880
I don't have that intention.

335
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,319
If not, then why are you lying to me?

336
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,079
The cranes have always been
taken care of by Sixteenth Disciple.

337
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,920
He said you were bullied by the cranes
and you are most afraid of them.

338
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,599
Why would you go to feed them?

339
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,839
I...

340
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,759
Forget it. I don't want to hear it.

341
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,519
All right.

342
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,720
I went to see a friend.

343
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,279
Friend?

344
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,079
Is it the one who sent the love poem?

345
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,039
That wasn't a love poem. It wasn't.

346
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,799
Then can you take me with you?

347
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,799
Take you?

348
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,680
Your friend is also my friend.
Of course I want to meet him.

349
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,720
His identity is a bit unusual.

350
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,359
I know you don't trust me,
and mind my lowly status

351
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,319
and are afraid I'll be
an embarrassment to you.

352
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,279
All right, don't say anymore.
Come with me.

353
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,920
A-Yin, look. This is
a bamboo flute I made for you.

354
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,799
You spend all day making
these knickknacks to please me.

355
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,720
You made those tiny animals before.

356
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,559
Thank you.

357
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,519
Oh, right. My relation with her
is a bit complicated.

358
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,559
You can say she is a distant cousin.

359
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,359
She is of the Fox Clan.
Her name is Xuan Nu.

360
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,319
This is Li Jing, second prince
of the Ghost Realm.

361
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Where did this little Si Yin come from?

362
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,599
How can I compare to Si Yin?

363
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,319
But you are just so similar to Si Yin.

364
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,119
When you don't have the free time

365
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,880
you can have her come down here
so I won't be bored.

366
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,680
All right, then.

367
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,759
Any company you can get will do.
You're just afraid of being bored.

368
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,279
Of course not.

369
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,920
Do you have free time the next few days?

370
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,880
No, I just wanted to tell you

371
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,640
Master will be coming out
of seclusion soon

372
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,039
so it may not be easy for me
to come down to visit you.

373
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,839
You'll have to return to
Grand Ziming Palace to pass the time.

374
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm absolutely not going back.

375
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,140
The women of the palace
have been sent away already.

376
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,279
From now on

377
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,119
I'll be at Kunlun Mountain
to be near you.

378
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:21,240
You should take this back.

379
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,880
My room has too many new trinkets.
Senior is starting to be suspicious.

380
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,400
All right.

381
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you know?

382
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Master had endured
a heavenly trial for me

383
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,599
and suffered severe injuries.

384
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,519
I'm very worried about him.

385
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,200
A-Yin.

386
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,319
When you are with me

387
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,440
why are nine out of ten sentences
about Mo Yuan?

388
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,799
Are they? I just have
a good relationship with my master.

389
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,559
- Isn't it normal?
- A-Yin.

390
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,720
You finally came to visit me.
Yet, you brought someone along.

391
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,980
Now I can't even talk to you properly.

392
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,279
Xuan Nu is watching.

393
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
Xuan Nu, is that the sound of
the cranes at the back mountain?

394
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,440
It seems to be.

395
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,839
I have urgent business. I need to go.

396
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,615
You just arrived.
You're leaving already?

397
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,079
Yes, Senior and the others
are keeping a close watch.

398
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,000
If you are bored, then go exploring.

399
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,119
A leisurely stroll?

400
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,200
Am I not afraid of coming across
your Senior and getting beaten up again?

401
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,559
If you're afraid of being beaten up,
then be careful.

402
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,599
I can't talk anymore. I'm going now.

403
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,119
Let's go, Xuan Nu.

404
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,519
- Senior.
- Senior.

405
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
You're well-behaved today.
You're back so early.

406
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,480
I heard the cranes calling.
I thought Master came out.

407
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,599
Who knew it turned out to be just
Zi Lan playing with them.

408
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,160
Don't worry. I will tell Master
all about your filial heart.

409
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
That isn't my reason.

410
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,640
I do sincerely hope
Master will come out soon.

411
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,759
After all, if it weren't for me,
he wouldn't be so heavily injured.

412
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,039
Let's return to the main hall.

413
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,640
<i>So you left me because you thought
Mo Yuan was coming out of seclusion.</i>

414
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
<i>A-Yin, you are so anxious for his return.</i>

415
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,240
<i>Do you hope day and night
to see him?</i>

416
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,759
Xuan Nu?

417
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,920
Why are you dressed as a man?

418
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,577
It would be more convenient to
come and go from the mountain like this.

419
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,559
That is true.

420
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,920
Kunlun Mountain is full of men.

421
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,960
It is inconvenient for a lady.

422
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,799
Just now, I nearly thought
you were A-Yin.

423
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,160
Although I look similar to A-Yin

424
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,319
the difference in our statuses
is like heaven and earth.

425
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,559
He is Mo Yuan's most favored disciple.

426
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,000
And I am just the most
unnoticeable immortal in Qing Qiu.

427
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,000
You have your own charm.

428
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,000
Did A-Yin tell you to come?

429
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,279
No.

430
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,960
I came specifically to see Your Highness.

431
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,480
There are some things
I want to ask you in person

432
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,559
but I was afraid it would be
hard for you to hear.

433
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,720
Speak freely.

434
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,119
Is Your Highness and A-Yin a pair now?

435
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,079
I had that feeling, but I did not dare
think too much into it.

436
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,400
However, why are you staying
at Kunlun Mountain?

437
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,463
Aren't you afraid of
the Ghost Tribe knowing?

438
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,000
In the end, it is impossible for

439
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
one from Ghost Tribe to be with
one from Celestial Tribe.

440
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,279
Are these words
what A-Yin want you to tell me?

441
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,000
No, do not misunderstand, Your Highness.

442
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,599
How can I not have thought of
what you just said?

443
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,759
If A-Yin is not from Celestial Tribe

444
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:00,920
I would surely disregard everything and
have Si Yin marry into my palace.

445
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,200
However, I can only take things
one step at a time now.

446
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,200
I don't dare consider too much.

447
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,480
If there is someone she does adore,
I'm afraid it would be Mo Yuan.

448
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,079
Don't say anymore.

449
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,720
Your Highness.

450
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,519
You are Si Yin?

451
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,759
Seventeenth, don't try to hide.

452
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
Senior.

453
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,359
Xuan Nu?

454
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,640
Why are you wearing Si Yin's clothes?

455
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,319
I was down at the foot of
the mountain for a walk.

456
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,319
I was afraid women's clothing
would be conspicuous

457
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,920
and put Kunlun Mountain under scrutiny

458
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,319
so I took Si Yin's clothing.

459
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,519
You and Si Yin look
so similar from the back.

460
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,960
Senior, if there is nothing else,
I'll be going now.

461
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,440
Go on.

462
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,960
<i>[Yunji Teahouse]</i>

463
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,320
Tea is served.

464
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,400
Does Your Highness visit
the mortal realm often?

465
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,440
I used to come often in the past.

466
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,519
Your Highness said

467
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,679
you had sent away all the beauties
in Grand Ziming Palace for A-Yin.

468
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,719
If I could have

469
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,023
a tiny fraction of the sway over
Your Highness's heart that A-Yin has

470
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,159
I would be content.

471
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,480
Xuan Nu, that night...

472
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,480
That night was a moment
of confusion for me.

473
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,000
Doing such a thing
was not only wrong to A-Yin

474
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,639
but also wrong to you.

475
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,079
If Your Highness would like me to forget

476
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,039
then I will forget it
and pretend it never happened.

477
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,119
Do not blame yourself, Your Highness.

478
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,320
I was willing.

479
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,440
- Good!
- Splendid!

480
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,679
Upstairs, please.

481
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,199
A-Yin.

482
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,239
Who is this gentleman waiting for?

483
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,679
Waiting for you.

484
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,159
Frivolous.

485
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,360
You must have been
waiting for four hours now.

486
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,400
I was held back by Senior

487
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,199
so that is why I had Xuan Nu
sneak out to keep you company first.

488
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,320
What is four hours?

489
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,119
I haven't seen you in ten days.

490
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,000
Has it been ten days?

491
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,559
It's been ten whole days.

492
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,000
A-Yin, when exactly will you be able
to finish your discipleship?

493
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,119
For someone as
tactless and impulsive as me

494
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,679
it would probably take at least
another 70,000 to 80,000 years.

495
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,760
Then...

496
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm afraid you wish to continue
to be close to Mo Yuan.

497
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,119
Li Jing, what shameful words
are you saying?

498
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,775
Did you listen to someone's nonsense?

499
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,559
Is it really nonsense?

500
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,119
Who was it and what did they say?

501
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm heading back now.

502
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,320
I just got here. You're leaving already?

503
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,159
What is the matter with all of you?

504
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,039
Did you bully her?

505
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,000
I wouldn't dare bully your people.

506
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,679
This is for you.

507
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,679
Did you make this?

508
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,920
Thank you.

509
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,719
Have you ever been to
Mount Junji of the Far East?

510
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,079
Mount Junji of the Far East?

511
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,559
Sometimes, I'll go to the mortal realm
with my fellow disciples to play.

512
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,840
We would go there.

513
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,280
There are no signs of mortals there,
but many animals.

514
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,639
It's very fun.

515
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,559
Let's go together next time.

516
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,199
Yes, let's go together next time.

517
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,760
What did you say?

518
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,119
The war is near at hand.
Li Jing has disappeared?

519
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,480
That is right.

520
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
I am guessing he is probably...

521
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,079
- Probably...
- Speak.

522
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,880
He has probably gone to Kunlun Mountain.

523
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,880
Kunlun Mountain?

524
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,159
When Li Jing was
still at Grand Ziming Palace

525
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,143
he had a tryst with
the immortal named Si Yin.

526
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,079
According to my understanding of him

527
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,420
he must have followed that Celestial.

528
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,199
If that is the case

529
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,639
then is no longer my son.

530
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,119
Your Highness.

531
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,320
I still do not understand.

532
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,639
You are of such a respectable status.

533
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,320
Why do you still waste your time
waiting at Kunlun Mountain?

534
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,480
I do not understand either.

535
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Your Highness, you clearly know

536
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,280
the one A-Yin likes the most is Mo Yuan.

537
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,679
Why must you still torment yourself.

538
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,679
I know Your Highness still minds that
A-Yin is from the Celestial Tribe.

539
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,239
I am not part of the Celestial Tribe.

540
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,800
I am willing to follow Your Highness
to the Ghost Realm.

541
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,360
That is right.

542
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,760
You are correct.

543
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,199
Nothing will come out of
a relationship between

544
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,423
one of the Ghost Tribe
and one of the Celestial Tribe.

545
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,199
Master has been in seclusion for so long.

546
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I wonder when he will come out.

547
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,679
<i>Fourth Brother, after much thought</i>

548
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,686
<i>there is something I want to tell you.</i>

549
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:36,746
<i>The Ghost Realm's second prince
and I met by chance</i>

550
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:39,690
<i>and have become well acquainted and
have mutual affection for each other.</i>

551
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,199
<i>He and I have not broken any rules,
but I have already set my mind on him.</i>

552
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,840
<i>But now that resentment grows
between Ghost Tribe and Celestial Tribe</i>

553
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,440
<i>I'm afraid the Ghost Lord will eventually
wage war on the Celestial Tribe.</i>

554
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,199
<i>He and I...</i>

555
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,920
- Seventeenth.
- Senior.

556
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,880
In my fight with Li Jing last time,
you had blamed me for injuring him.

557
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I really regret not killing him.

558
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,079
He hasn't taken you,
but he has taken Xuan Nu.

559
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,559
What did you just say?

560
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,639
I left the mountain just now and
saw them from afar, walking hand-in-hand.

561
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,920
They looked quite intimate.

562
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:14,280
But speaking of which,
it is quite strange.

563
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,480
Xuan Nu is a female immortal.
Li Jing is truly improper.

564
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,360
Why would they pair up together?

565
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
Seventeenth!

566
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
Immortal!

567
