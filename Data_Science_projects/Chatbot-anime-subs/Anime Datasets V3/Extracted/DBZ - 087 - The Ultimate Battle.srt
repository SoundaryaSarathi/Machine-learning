"The Curtain Rises Over the Ultimate
Battle!! I Am Going to Defeat You"

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,790
For all the Saiyans who were killed by you...

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,140
...as well as for the Namekians here...

4
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,720
I am going to beat you!

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,660
Such drivel.

6
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,000
It utterly sickens me how you worms can
share this consciousness among yourselves.

7
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,330
A worm is a worm.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,840
Your legend will not be fulfilled.

9
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,850
I don't have anything to do with this
Super Saiyan stuff. Still...

10
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,680
I am going to defeat you!

11
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,530
How is the situation on Namek?

12
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,030
Vegeta has died.

13
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,370
W- What's that!?

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,530
Vegeta, did you say?

15
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,040
That's right. He was killed by
Freeza, and easily so.

16
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,940
Even though he served as Freeza hands
and feet, working exactly as ordered,

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,850
in the end he was betrayed and killed by
him. What a shame!

18
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,050
It was his pride as a Saiyan, I suppose.

19
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,320
So that's how terrifying a guy this
Freeza is, then?

20
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,900
They touched that which must not be
touched. That which must not be touched!

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Damn it all! Not even Goku is a match
for a rat like that!

22
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,000
So, what about Goku?

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,840
He intends to fight. It seems that, no matter
what, he's determined to defeat Freeza.

24
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,350
Goku!

25
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,910
G- Goku...

26
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,850
Goku!

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,330
He's got such power under wraps.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,830
Goku, when did you find all that power?

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I implore you, Son Goku, defeat him, and
give me another chance to challenge you!

30
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,020
You guys, get away from this place!
We're in the way here!

31
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,680
Gohan! Hurry up!

32
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,680
Gohan!

33
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,690
Father!

34
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,360
Father, don't die! Let Freeza have it!

35
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,340
- So fast!
- Father...

36
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,780
I get it. He can't sense Ki!

37
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,020
- Father!
- Gohan!

38
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,700
It's incredible! It's too incredible!

39
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,230
That got him for sure.

40
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:51,970
T- This is a Saiyan? So many of these
insects have overestimated their own
power, and defied me up until now.

41
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,740
I've never seen a Saiyan able to take
things this far!

42
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,040
Over there!

43
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,000
H- Has something happened?

44
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,430
D- Don't tell us Son has... ?

45
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,100
He's putting up a good fight.

46
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,450
These Saiyan are strange ones. Or perhaps
this is limited to Goku,

47
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:04,020
There's no limit to his strength. He's a
different person from when he trained here.

48
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,120
He really is impossible to understand, indeed.

49
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,290
- Such an unusual guy...
- Such an unusual guy!

50
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,080
Ah, that was good!

51
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,080
But it's no use. I can't walk any more!

52
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,090
I'm going to die here. Without ever
getting back to Earth...

53
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,090
...without anyone to watch
over me... quietly...

54
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,260
It's true what they say, beautiful women
do die young.

55
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,070
That's enough! Who would ever expect
me to die here among all these frogs!?

56
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,060
Oooh, yow.

57
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,390
Now, then...

58
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,730
He's not that bad...

59
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,070
You're an impudent one!

60
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,100
What's this?

61
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,730
l- It's an eruption! What's it doing there?

62
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,080
- Father!
- Gohan!

63
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,240
If you go, you'll just get in the
way. Have faith!

64
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,410
Goku isn't as green as all that!

65
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,430
- Father...
- Son...

66
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,080
That's far enough.

67
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,430
I wonder if he's burned up. What a
disappointing way to end the scene.

68
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,090
Goku!

69
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh dear, you didn't have to come all
this way. I would have come to you.

70
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,380
I'll kill you quickly.

71
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,080
That was close, that was close!

72
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
If I'd fallen in there, I would've died!

73
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,770
Here goes.

74
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,780
Son!

75
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,810
Son! Behind you!

76
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm not going to keep falling into the
same trap like that!

77
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,420
Don't go messing up other people's
planets so much!

78
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,430
What will you do once you break it!?

79
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,270
Frightening powers tear the land
and rend the sky.

80
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,350
However, Goku and Freeza display
nothing but confidence on their faces.

81
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,220
Is this decisive battle just getting underway?

82
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:04,220
