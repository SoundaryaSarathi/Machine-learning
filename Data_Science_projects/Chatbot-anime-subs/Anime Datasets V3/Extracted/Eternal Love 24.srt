<i>[Episode 24]</i>

3
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
As far as he is concerned

4
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,824
your eyesight didn't hold
much significance to begin with.

5
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Su Jin?

6
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,719
It is me.

7
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,680
Su Su, how is your injury?
Does it still hurt?

8
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,879
I trusted you.
Why did you harm me in this way?

9
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,240
Leaving aside
that you hurt your own eyes

10
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,360
you have also caused me to lose my eyes.

11
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,919
What good does this do for you?

12
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,639
It is true you don't have your eyes.

13
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,520
But now, I can already see.

14
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,919
I came today to tell you

15
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,599
your eyes are quite handy.

16
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,919
You're using... my eyes?

17
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,919
Did Ye Hua not tell you?

18
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,960
He took out your eyes to give to me.

19
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,199
When Medicine King changed my eyes for me

20
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,439
Ye Hua stayed by my side
the whole day and night.

21
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,039
How could you understand
what is between me and him?

22
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,479
You can continue to stay in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

23
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,479
You just have to remember...

24
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,400
This is Ye Hua's future consort,
Su Jin's charity to you.

25
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,120
This was originally between
the two of them.

26
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,800
I was just a passerby...

27
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:41,480
who was dazedly drawn in,
and became an obstacle for them.

28
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,720
<i>This is preposterous!</i>

29
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,199
Guard this hall well.

30
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,160
She may not have a proper title,
but she's still the Crown Prince's woman.

31
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,622
Should there be any mishap,
you will have to answer to me.

32
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,480
- Yes, Consort Su Jin.
- Yes, Consort Su Jin.

33
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,639
Your Highness, are you all right?

34
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,120
The things this mortal keeps
are all just wild at heart.

35
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,360
Beat that evil creature to death.

36
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,120
Yes.

37
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,600
Consort Su Jin.

38
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Didn't you already leave for
the lower realm's Deity Mountain?

39
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,720
Your Highness, Consort Le Xu
just graciously permitted me

40
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
to be demoted back
to the lower realm's Deity Mountain

41
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,384
after the imperial child
reaches one year of age.

42
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,399
Is this little fox a pet kept in
your Hall of Beautiful Youth?

43
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,959
Your Highness, this little fox indeed
comes often to Hall of Beautiful Youth

44
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,160
but it is not my lady's.

45
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I clearly saw it coming out of
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

46
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
You would dare tell a lie
over an evil creature?

47
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,600
Your Highness,
this little fox really isn't--

48
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,783
Impudence!

49
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,759
Dijun.

50
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,560
A little fox of mine has gone missing.
Has Your Highness seen it?

51
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,839
Little fox?

52
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,360
It's the one your servant is carrying.

53
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,519
Tell me. Who hurt it?

54
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,759
Dijun.

55
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,759
It bit my lady's wrist.

56
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,639
Her Highness only flung it aside
out of defense.

57
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,160
It was so disobedient?

58
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
How could it be?
It must have been unintentional.

59
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
So was it intentional or unintentional?

60
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,879
Unintentional.
It must have been unintentional.

61
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,800
I may have been in its way. It has
an unstable temper and was vexed.

62
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,879
It isn't a big injury.

63
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,959
Since it is your fox,
I will return it to you.

64
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,920
Since you say it injured you,
I mustn't discriminate in its favor.

65
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,319
Why don't you tell me
what happened just now?

66
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,560
It...

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,079
Isn't this where
the Crown Prince's mortal wife resides?

68
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,560
I heard a tiny incident happened
a few days ago

69
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
that caused a lot of unpleasantness.

70
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,759
Come inside with me
to ask the mortal woman...

71
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,079
why this little fox suffered
such a provocation

72
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,360
as to dare bite someone.

73
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
You must be jesting, Dijun.

74
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,480
This small bite is not worthy of you
personally inquiring about it.

75
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,600
It bit me, I also injured it.

76
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,240
This matter has been balanced out.

77
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Balanced out?

78
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,960
I see that it is hurt
more severely than you are.

79
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,759
How is it balanced?

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,519
Dijun, please calm your anger.
I have done wrong.

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
What did you say?

82
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,759
I was in a bad mood because I visited

83
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,360
the mortal in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

84
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,799
And this little fox
happened to be playing here

85
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,039
yet, it was harmed by me for no reason.

86
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,840
Harmed for no reason?

87
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
Dijun, please calm your anger.

88
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,039
I was boiling with fury,
and hurt Taichen Palace's fox.

89
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,519
I am willing to kneel here
for two hours in apology.

90
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,600
That is very well.

91
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,039
You grew up here in the Nine Heavens.

92
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,919
You must have heard I am
accustomed to leading troops in the past

93
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,360
so I am both protective of my own,
and impervious to reason.

94
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,960
You had best stay away from
the people and fox of my palace.

95
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,360
Yes.

96
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
- Your Highness, get up.
- Do not help me up.

97
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Otherwise, if someone tells Dijun,
there would be more trouble.

98
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,960
Regardless, Your Highness is
an imperial consort.

99
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Why would you have to
humble yourself in such a way?

100
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,519
What do you know?

101
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,639
Dijun might never involve himself
in the affairs of the Celestial Palace

102
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,360
but if he says the word,
nobody would dare disobey him.

103
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,080
Just now, he was obviously angry.

104
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,759
Even if Heavenly Lord were here,
he wouldn't help me.

105
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,960
He may even sentence me
to kneel here for the whole day.

106
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,759
Xin Nu.

107
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,080
It was not easy for me
to reach this point.

108
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,679
I will endure whatever grievances I can.

109
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,799
As long as I can get into Xiwu Palace,
nothing else is a concern for me.

110
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,200
Your Highness.

111
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,559
It would be nice if the Crown Prince
knew of your devotion to him.

112
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,440
He will know sooner or later.

113
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,080
This is a report submitted by
the water kings of the four seas

114
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,840
the various clan leaders,
and the vassals of every sea altogether.

115
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,559
The Far North war has won
many people's hearts for Ye Hua.

116
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,720
They are all requesting

117
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,159
to allow the Crown Prince
to officially accept the seal.

118
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,360
Congratulations, Brother and Father.

119
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
Once Ye Hua receives
the Crown Prince seal

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,080
the two of you will have someone to
share the burdens of official matters.

121
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,220
He has not betrayed my expectations.

122
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,960
In this world, there are trials in life.

123
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,879
Whether you are an immortal or a human,
you have your own trials.

124
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,000
You can't help her.
She can't help you either.

125
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,279
- Heavenly Lord.
- Heavenly Lord.

126
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,480
Dijun.

127
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,039
Something good seems to
have happened to you.

128
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,279
I have received numerous reports
in the past few days.

129
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,919
They are all asking for the Crown Prince
to complete his investiture.

130
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,753
Is that so?

131
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,759
Congratulations are in order,
Heavenly Lord.

132
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,240
The Crown Prince has not disappointed you

133
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,799
and has won the hearts of
all those around the world.

134
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,759
Yes, I am also very pleased.

135
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
Haven't you been sending official affairs

136
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,583
to Zichen Hall starting from
20,000 years ago?

137
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,840
After the Crown Prince receives
his seal, you can be like me

138
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,360
free of all matters and no longer
concerned with palace affairs.

139
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
You are right.

140
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,759
In the past dozen years

141
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,960
I have deeply felt myself to be
less capable than I wish to be.

142
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,519
Start preparations for
Ye Hua's investiture early next month.

143
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

144
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,200
Rise.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,440
Ye Hua.

146
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,279
I have to congratulate you.

147
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,639
Thank you, Third Uncle.

148
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,720
Ye Hua.

149
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,159
Father has always had
high expectations of you.

150
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,240
After your investiture, you must be
prudent with your words and actions

151
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,480
and carry on
Father's principles as a ruler.

152
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,279
I shall sincerely obey
Father's instruction.

153
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,120
Nai Nai, the lotuses are so fragrant.

154
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,960
If Your Highness likes it, I will
come with you every day to enjoy them.

155
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,559
Your Highness,
Heavenly Lord has recently ordered

156
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,360
that Your Highness is not to step out
of the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

157
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,240
Your Highness has slept
for a long while again.

158
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,720
Nai Nai.

159
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,320
What day is it?
How come I am always so drowsy?

160
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,039
It must be because you are pregnant,
so you are exceptionally sleepy.

161
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,759
Your Highness, the Crown Prince
has come to visit you.

162
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,080
Ye Hua has come?

163
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,519
Are the stars bright tonight?

164
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,320
Su Su, have you forgotten there is
no day and night in the Celestial Palace?

165
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,399
I will soon be officially conferred
the title of Crown Prince.

166
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,000
We will be able to marry very soon.

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
Once you are Crown Princess

168
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,159
we will no longer have to
consider other people's opinions

169
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,480
and we can begin living the life we want.

170
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,120
I know you are very busy.
Go attend to your affairs.

171
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm a bit sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

172
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,000
I heard from Medicine King that
you have been feeling lethargic lately.

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
Yes.

174
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,279
Go to sleep then.

175
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:28,559
I will be receiving
the Crown Prince's seal in a few days.

176
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,720
I will be struck with 36 sacred blazes
and 9 holy lightning bolts.

177
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,839
If Su Su hears the thunder,
don't tell her the truth.

178
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm afraid she will worry.

179
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,519
Yes.

180
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,599
Not eating is counter-productive.

181
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,279
I will order someone to extend your life.
I guarantee you won't die.

182
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,559
If I had known this day would come,
I wouldn't have--

183
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,720
Wouldn't have what?
Wouldn't have let me off?

184
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,559
Or, when you killed my mother,
would you have killed me too?

185
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
That's correct.

186
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
The mistake I regret the most in my life

187
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,640
is not tearing you to pieces
70,000 years ago!

188
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,079
Let me tell you.

189
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,200
Don't think that Father
loves you so very much.

190
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,279
You are just a worm he kept.

191
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
What do you mean?

192
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,880
You, Yan Zhi, and I

193
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,559
are his children,
the Ghost Realm's princes and princess

194
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,759
as well as his lifesavers.

195
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,480
Regardless of whichever of
the three of us dies

196
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,759
his powers increase.

197
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
The three of us are just vessels of kin
used for cultivation of his powers.

198
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,640
When my mother gave birth to me,
she discovered this secret.

199
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,039
That was why she was banished
to the Cold Palace.

200
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,119
That is how you had
the chance to kill her.

201
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,240
Trust me.

202
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,960
If you rescue Father,
we are the first ones he will kill.

203
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,759
Then his powers will greatly increase

204
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,771
and he will seek revenge
from the Celestial Tribe.

205
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
Impossible.

206
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,960
Father absolutely would not
do that to me!

207
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,519
What is impossible in
Grand Ziming Palace?

208
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,000
That is why as long as I am alive,
I will surely keep you alive.

209
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,799
From this day forth

210
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,400
you will be locked here day and night

211
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,039
never to see the sky again.

212
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,519
I will take your life!

213
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,359
- Ghost Lord.
- Ghost Lord.

214
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,200
Li Jing.

215
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,839
It's so late. You're not sleeping yet?

216
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,839
I want to leave the Ghost Realm
to go to the mortal realm.

217
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,799
Yan Zhi.

218
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,599
I only have you, my sister.

219
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,160
I can pardon all your past betrayals.

220
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,960
I only want you to stay
in Grand Ziming Palace

221
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,359
and be the princess.

222
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Don't think about saving Li Yuan,
or Father.

223
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:31,319
Li Yuan, you, and I all grew up
together in Grand Ziming Palace.

224
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,559
Both sides of this feud are my family.

225
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,519
If you ask me to pay no heed,
I cannot do it.

226
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,160
However, I don't want
to betray you a second time.

227
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,640
So please let me go.

228
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,640
Let me leave this place.

229
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,720
Go.

230
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,319
Remember.

231
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,680
No matter where you go...
you must stay safe and sound.

232
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,319
All of you, listen up.

233
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,839
Follow the princess.

234
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,480
From now on, you are her men.

235
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,440
Ensuring her safety
is your only mission in life.

236
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

237
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,880
Your Majesty, wine can be unhealthy.
Don't drink so much.

238
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,640
My child.

239
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,680
You are the only family I have left.

240
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,240
Your Majesty.

241
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,160
Aside from our child, you also have me.

242
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,240
A-Yin.

243
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,079
A-Yin.

244
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
- A-Yin.
- A-Yin?

245
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,759
Why do you only have A-Yin
in your heart?

246
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,200
Si Yin, do not appear again.

247
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,559
Otherwise, I will pull out your tendons
and tear off your skin.

248
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,960
- Water King of North Sea.
- Water King of Eastern Sea.

249
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,279
Water King of West Sea.

250
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,839
Water King of North Sea.

251
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,759
Ghost Lord.

252
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,799
It seems all the rulers around
the world have gathered here today.

253
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,659
Yes, yes.

254
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,599
The Celestial Tribe Crown Prince
being awarded his seal is a major event.

255
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,104
Of course they would attend.

256
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,559
Ghost Lord.

257
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,480
I heard Your Highness was
bestowed marriage to the Crown Prince.

258
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,759
Ghost Lord, you sure are well-informed.

259
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,480
I have to deliver these clothes to
Consort Le Xu, so I won't stay to talk.

260
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
Your Highness.

261
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,920
What is it?
Is there something else?

262
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,240
I just want to ask

263
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,559
is the lady that was at the
Hall of Beautiful Youth doing well now?

264
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,680
Are you asking about Sister Su Su?

265
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,079
Yes.

266
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,920
She...

267
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,960
She was the one who made
Her Highness's eyes blind.

268
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,240
Ghost Lord, I'm afraid you are
asking the wrong person.

269
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,559
Shut up. Who allowed you to
speak in front of Ghost Lord?

270
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,079
Your Highness's eyes?

271
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,559
It is a long story.

272
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,039
I believe it was
unintentional on her part.

273
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,519
She's currently waiting for labor
at the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

274
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,599
She will be giving birth very soon.

275
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,759
It was my fiery qilin
who caused her injury.

276
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,920
I have had a guilty conscience.

277
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,480
Since I came to the Celestial Palace,
I thought I'd ask after her.

278
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,119
Do not take it to heart, Your Highness.

279
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,799
Look at how decorous Consort Su Jin is.

280
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,720
Yes, yes. No wonder Heavenly Lord
bestowed her to the Crown Prince.

281
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Only a woman like this

282
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,624
is worthy of assisting
our Celestial Tribe's heir apparent.

283
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,160
Fiery qilin.

284
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,599
Go search around.

285
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,960
See if she is still in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

286
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,519
Yes.

287
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,839
Your Highness,
why did you sneak out again?

288
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,559
Medicine King said you have been
in weak health lately.

289
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,200
You must be careful not to catch a cold.

290
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,480
I just wanted to bask in the sun.

291
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,039
The sunlight feels warm on the back of
my hand. It feels particularly nice.

292
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,039
It is as if I can see the light again.

293
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,920
Your Highness.

294
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,720
Go.

295
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,200
<i>With these regalia bestowed upon
imperial grandson Ye Hua</i>

296
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,359
<i>he is conferred the title of
Imperial Crown Prince</i>

297
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,680
<i>to preside over the East Palace</i>

298
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,240
<i>and to place
the unity of the four seas</i>

299
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,104
<i>and the hearts of those
around the world above all else.</i>

300
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
<i>To preside over the East Palace</i>

301
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,880
<i>and to place
the unity of the four seas</i>

302
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>and the hearts of those
around the world above all else.</i>

303
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,480
- Congratulations, Crown Prince.
- Congratulations, Crown Prince.

304
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,519
Your Highness!

305
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,090
Your Highness,
Crown Prince's investiture is today.

306
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,440
I heard the maids of Xiwu Palace say
Heavenly Lord had already issued a decree

307
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,320
that after the investiture,
Consort Su Jin is to be...

308
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,800
bestowed to Crown Prince.

309
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,519
It was to happen sooner or later.

310
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,119
But Consort Su Jin and Your Highness
have an outstanding grudge.

311
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm afraid if she enters Xiwu Palace,
she will make your life difficult.

312
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,280
It won't be difficult.

313
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,480
I don't have much to do with
Xiwu Palace anyway.

314
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,559
Your Highness, if Crown Prince
heard that, he would be displeased.

315
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,679
Don't say it in the future.

316
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,519
Nai Nai, why do I hear thunder?

317
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,599
That is... in celebration for
the Crown Prince.

318
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,840
Your Highness, what is the matter?

319
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,079
I might be going into labor.

320
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,679
I'll find the Crown Prince.

321
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,239
- I'll find the Crown Prince!
- Don't go, Nai Nai.

322
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,239
Don't go. Don't go...

323
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,280
What should I do?

324
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,639
It is three months early,
and there is such severe bleeding.

325
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,320
Your Highness, you mustn't force labor.

326
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,079
If my child cannot be saved,
then don't think of living!

327
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,617
Your Highness, please spare me.

328
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,679
The imperial family is
the root of the Ghost Realm.

329
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,000
If His Majesty learns I used taboo magic

330
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,920
to extend the life of the prince
inside Your Highness's womb

331
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,400
and kept it from His Majesty

332
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,679
I would surely lose my life.

333
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,480
This magic was banned

334
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,932
because it is overly dangerous
and defies the natural order.

335
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:09,710
Now that Your Highness is
in premature labor

336
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,199
it is sufficiently clear that
you must not defy nature!

337
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,039
Do not save this child. Let it go!

338
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,800
Deliver this baby for me.

339
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,400
No matter what method you use,
you must deliver it from my womb!

340
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,079
He lives, you live.

341
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,679
He dies, you die!

342
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,679
Your Highness!

343
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,199
Congratulations to Crown Prince
on officially receiving the seal.

344
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,440
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

345
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,239
Congratulations, Your Highness.

346
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,920
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

347
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,559
What has you two in such a panic?

348
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,233
You speak first. Has something happened
in the Ghost Realm?

349
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,480
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Ghost Queen is in labor.

350
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,599
Is that true?

351
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,083
Last night, Ghost Queen ordered me
to come to Celestial Palace

352
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,344
to ask Your Majesty to return.

353
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,320
Let's go!

354
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

355
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,206
What has happened?

356
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:21,119
Ghost Queen suddenly went into
premature labor. It's highly dangerous.

357
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,079
Shaman has given orders that
nobody is to enter.

358
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,159
All right.

359
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,840
I will wait here.

360
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,800
Congratulations on receiving
the seal today, Your Highness.

361
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I think Your Highness
can return tomorrow.

362
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,599
No need.

363
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,039
Nobody is to defy Heavenly Lord's orders.

364
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,920
Very well. Please step up to
the punishment platform, Your Highness.
