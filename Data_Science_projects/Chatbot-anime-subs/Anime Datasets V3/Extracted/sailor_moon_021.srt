1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,198
Anime is being targeted now.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,338
The shadow of evil is closing in

3
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,238
on the trendy members of
the anime industry.

4
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:14,138
Anyone who tries to take advantage
of youthful passion...

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,245
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

8
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

9
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:14,751
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

10
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

12
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:36,148
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

13
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,149
I believe in it, miracle romance

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,961
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like
a super heroine, but I am!

16
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,773
As you know, I transform myself
by using a peculiar brooch

17
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,909
and fight against bad guys.

18
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,073
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

19
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:12,119
And my friends are the smart
and sweet Ami Mizuno,

20
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:15,355
and a slightly quick-tempered
psychic girl, Rei Hino.

21
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:18,051
Both of them are so dependable,
I feel like I'll fall behind.

22
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,527
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

23
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,533
Protect the Children's Dreams!
Friendship Linked By Anime

24
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:37,009
Sailor V!

25
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:38,245
Sailor V

26
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,481
Sailor V
A great theatrical anime masterpiece!

27
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,149
Sailor V
Sailor V!

28
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,548
Big opening coming soon!

29
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:47,852
Sailor V is so lucky.
She's getting turned into an anime.

30
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:51,592
I wish someone would make
an anime about me.

31
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:54,194
If there's someone willing to
make such a silly anime,

32
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:55,957
I'd have to see it to believe it.

33
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:03,937
I'm so depressed.

34
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:06,540
Did you understand what
Director Asatou said?

35
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,772
Not at word! Because he talks
in such abstract terms!

36
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,478
It's a little different from
what I had in my mind.

37
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:19,019
How is it different?

38
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,317
Well, I don't really know
how to say it, but...

39
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:25,058
For example, this
posture of Sailor V's...

40
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,628
I just don't feel the love.

41
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,697
And the line of this leg is lacking
a certain passion.

42
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,867
Are you basically saying we should
make her look more sexy?

43
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,938
Don't be ridiculous! I'm a father!

44
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:40,634
I would never say such
an indecent thing!

45
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:51,151
I just have no talent.

46
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:54,018
Maybe I should quit the
anime industry.

47
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,352
What are you saying, Hiromi?!

48
00:03:57,124 --> 00:04:01,060
I was only kidding!
I won't give up so easily!

49
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,599
Good! That's the Hiromi I know!

50
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,868
All right, let's sprint to the studio!

51
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:08,735
Hey!
Oh, wait. Wait!

52
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,270
Oh, wait. Wait!

53
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,793
Juban Bookstore
Oh, wait. Wait!

54
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,901
Kazuko!

55
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,202
Excuse me!

56
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,276
What shall I do now?

57
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:21,548
Studio Dive
170 X-XO Asabu Juban, OX Ward, Tokyo

58
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,184
Studio Dive
170 X-XO Asabu Juban, OX Ward, Tokyo
"Studio Dive"? Oh, it has the address.

59
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:24,718
"Studio Dive"? Oh, it has the address.

60
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,455
What shall I do? I have to go
to cram school now.

61
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,320
I guess I'll return this later.

62
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,389
The stars know everything.

63
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,570
Tying a dream together
in light and shadow,

64
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,206
time is spun and remains in the eye.

65
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,175
The next provider of energy
that the Twins,

66
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,143
the constellation of Gemini,
points to is her.

67
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,145
Castor and Pollux.

68
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:55,945
It seems the time has come for me
to use my strongest monsters.

69
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,674
Seven Mart

70
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:04,413
Let's see, for Hiromi... Oh, right!
She likes fried noodles.

71
00:05:06,193 --> 00:05:07,922
It should be around here...

72
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,108
Masato Sanjoin...
That was Nephrite!

73
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,264
It's no good.

74
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:48,428
I can't depict Sailor V's
love and passion at all!

75
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,228
Oh, darn it!

76
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,666
Kazuko's drawn so much already.

77
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:02,041
Sailor V!

78
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:11,858
I didn't know Kazuko was this good!
It's amazing!

79
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,361
Sailor V is so lively,

80
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,489
and her love and passion
are depicted perfectly!

81
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,696
I have to try harder!

82
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,268
I guess I'll have to use this again.

83
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,308
Mommy, please buy this for me!

84
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:31,675
Thank you for coming to the
XX Department Store.

85
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:36,450
Wow, pencils for pro animators.

86
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,509
It's a limited item.

87
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:41,722
We'll also be pro animators
starting this spring.

88
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:45,522
Wouldn't it be nice to draw main
characters with pencils like these?

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,794
Maybe we should buy these!

90
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:48,829
What?!

91
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,598
But, these are incredibly expensive!

92
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,658
That's why we'll buy one together!
Excuse me!

93
00:06:57,904 --> 00:07:02,242
And like this, we'll divide them
into matching pencil boxes.

94
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,231
Here!

95
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,610
See? This way, we can both
have half of them.

96
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:12,042
But these pencils are to commemorate
us becoming pros this spring,

97
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,022
so we'll only use them for
special occasions.

98
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:16,456
Yes.

99
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,092
Only when we draw the finest anime

100
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:21,261
that will never disappoint
the dreams of children!

101
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,195
That's right!

102
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:26,188
We have to get each other's
permission to untie that ribbon!

103
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,467
Okay?

104
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:28,661
Okay!

105
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,437
It's a promise!

106
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:31,802
It's a promise.

107
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:39,042
I made that promise, but...

108
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,213
I've already used quite a bit
without telling Kazuko.

109
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:52,517
But I kind of get fired up
when I use this.

110
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:57,191
Besides, I'm going to get left behind
by Kazuko at this rate.

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,935
Who are you?!

112
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:05,063
Pardon me.
You are Miss Hiromi Matsuno, correct?

113
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,936
I'm a fan of yours.

114
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,344
And I really wanted to see
where you worked.

115
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,813
Excuse me...

116
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:14,178
You can't be here.

117
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,188
DIVE

118
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:33,033
Now, I just need to lure those
sailor warriors here.

119
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:36,059
Nephrite! You're up to something
again, aren't you?!

120
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:39,239
Sailor Mercury isn't going to
let you have your way!

121
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:41,707
Well, you've saved me the trouble.

122
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:50,309
I've prepared my best monsters
just for you guys.

123
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,776
Make sure to train yourself until
the time comes to fight them!

124
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,281
What?!

125
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,122
Shoot...

126
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,057
Hiromi!

127
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,795
I bought us dinner!

128
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,394
Excuse me!

129
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:12,063
Yes?

130
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,807
I found this.

131
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,442
Thank you so much!
This is very important to us.

132
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,416
Oh, Hiromi, you should
thank her, too...

133
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,782
Hiromi!

134
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:31,391
Oh, I'm sorry. She has a lot of work
piled up, so she seems a bit dazed.

135
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,058
That's all right.

136
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:32,726
Please come and see us again.
That's all right.

137
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,528
Please come and see us again.

138
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,363
You'd be welcome here and
I'd like to thank you properly.

139
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:38,765
Of course, I'd love to!

140
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:39,933
I can't believe Hiromi.

141
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,667
What in the world did
Nephrite do in here?
I can't believe Hiromi.

142
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,760
What in the world did
Nephrite do in here?

143
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,867
I have to find out, no matter what!

144
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:50,076
That isn't like you, Ami.

145
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:53,346
Trying to take on Nephrite by yourself!

146
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,447
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:57,250
That's right! I would've come right
away, if you'd just called me!

148
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,387
I never expected to hear that
coming from you, Usagi.

149
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:03,823
Well, it's the place where they're
producing the Sailor V anime, right?!

150
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:07,756
If I got lucky, I might've gotten
a cel from them!

151
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:11,531
She is such a groupie.

152
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:14,989
Okay. Then let's all go to
Studio Dive after school.

153
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,638
After all, we have to find out
why Nephrite was there.

154
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,874
Yes! Of course!

155
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:24,867
We can't just ignore it, since
Nephrite showed up there!

156
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:34,154
Finished

157
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:34,955
Finished
Hiromi, did you draw all those
in just one night?

158
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:37,753
Hiromi, did you draw all those
in just one night?

159
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,082
This is nothing.

160
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:43,257
Kazuko.

161
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,698
I'll be using this room by myself today.

162
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,193
That's fine, but...

163
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:52,205
Hiromi...

164
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:52,572
Sailor V
Opening Soon
Hiromi...

165
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:54,699
Sailor V
Opening Soon

166
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:58,445
Kazuko will never be better
than me again,

167
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,379
as long as I have this pencil.

168
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,449
An anime studio?

169
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:39,886
Anime is for kids, right?
I have no interest in going there.

170
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,549
Then, you're not going?

171
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:46,761
Oh, no! It's so late already.

172
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,429
Honestly!

173
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:49,630
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:49,997
Well, it can't be helped.

175
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,932
Juban Municipal Junior High School
Well, it can't be helped.

176
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:51,999
Juban Municipal Junior High School
You're late!

177
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,200
You're late!

178
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,599
Kinchu!!

179
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,270
Rei!

180
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,040
What have you been doing
all this time?!

181
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,531
Someone was kept behind
to do some studying.

182
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,705
But earlier, you said you
weren't interested...

183
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:11,619
Well, we can't just ignore it if Nephrite
showed up there, right?!

184
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,921
That line sounds familiar.

185
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,912
Anyway, let's hurry!

186
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:23,731
What are you going to do with
so many sheets of velum?

187
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:24,298
Juban Municipal Junior High School

188
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:27,601
Juban Municipal Junior High School
Oh, no, my friends
asked me to get autographs...

189
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:31,238
Juban Municipal Junior High School
You're a liar! You want to get those
autographs for yourself, don't you?!

190
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:31,499
You're a liar! You want to get those
autographs for yourself, don't you?!

191
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:36,410
Rei, we're going to be in the
9th grade next year.

192
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,478
So?

193
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,673
Nothing, that's all I wanted to say.

194
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,878
Is she trying to pick a fight with me?

195
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:52,759
My! You seem quite composed.

196
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:55,329
You again.

197
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,321
I wonder, is your plan
going well this time?

198
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,702
Everything is proceeding nicely.

199
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:06,073
Really? You seem extremely confident.

200
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,906
I shall see how well you do.

201
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,885
Wow! She's so cool!

202
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,353
So, this is Sailor V!

203
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:20,121
I'm sorry for really taking you
up on your offer to visit.
So, this is Sailor V!

204
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:20,988
I'm sorry for really taking you
up on your offer to visit.

205
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,189
I'm sorry for really taking you
up on your offer to visit.
Hey, don't you think
Sailor V looks like me?

206
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,090
It's okay, please make
yourself at home.
Hey, don't you think
Sailor V looks like me?

207
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,291
It's okay, please make
yourself at home.
What?! Something must be
wrong with your eyes!

208
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:24,892
There's something I'd like to ask you.
What?! Something must be
wrong with your eyes!

209
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,595
There's something I'd like to ask you.
What did you say?!
Take a good look at these legs!

210
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:28,162
Go right ahead, ask me anything.
What did you say?!
Take a good look at these legs!

211
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:29,764
Go right ahead, ask me anything.

212
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:32,927
Has anything unusual
happened here recently?

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,869
Unusual?

214
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:36,203
She's so cool!

215
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:37,204
Shut up!
She's so cool!

216
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:37,568
Shut up!

217
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:40,470
Hiromi...

218
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:45,076
Everyone is still working!
Why don't you keep it down a little?!

219
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:45,479
Company Precept
Due to the noise, keep private
conversations under 10 seconds.

220
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,248
Company Precept
Due to the noise, keep private
conversations under 10 seconds.
You're so loud, I can't stand it!

221
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:48,949
We're sorry!

222
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,485
Hiromi! How could you say that?!

223
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,121
They're here because
they like our work!

224
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,858
Baloney! They just want
autographs and cel art!

225
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,349
That's not what these girls
have in mind!

226
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,985
Studio Chibili

227
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,835
Hello, this is Studio Dive. Yes.
Please wait for a moment.

228
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:10,638
Anyway, don't let outsiders in here!
Hello, this is Studio Dive. Yes.
Please wait for a moment.

229
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:12,538
Miss Hiromi, it's from the director.

230
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:16,177
Hello?

231
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,667
Oh, Hiromi?

232
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:24,218
I just saw your work over here.
They're just amazing!

233
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,083
Keep up the good work for
the last scene, too!

234
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,457
This is perfect.

235
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,651
What?!

236
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:36,197
Director, in the last scene,
Sailor V will be killed!

237
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,824
What?!

238
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:44,535
That's the kind of thrilling story that
children want these days.

239
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,334
Hey, wait a second!

240
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,839
Hello?! Hello?!

241
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:53,145
Hello?! Hello?!

242
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:57,384
Hiromi, are you serious about
what you just said?

243
00:14:57,384 --> 00:15:02,122
I'm serious, Kazuko. The director
asked me to do the last scene.

244
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:04,158
So, it's up to me how I want to do it.

245
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,922
Hiromi, what's going on?

246
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:10,531
You know everyone has to work
together to create an anime!

247
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:15,059
That's what you always used to say!
"Making anime is about teamwork!"

248
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,804
I understand how you feel.

249
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:23,541
But it's just an anime.
Teamwork is pointless!

250
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:25,439
Hiromi!

251
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:27,648
I feel the aura of a monster.

252
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:28,115
What?!
I feel the aura of a monster.

253
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:28,682
What?!

254
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,417
This is a waste of time!

255
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,986
Hiromi, where are you going?!

256
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:32,853
Hiromi, what's wrong?!
Hiromi, where are you going?!

257
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:33,754
Hiromi, what's wrong?!

258
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:36,018
Wait! Let me handle this!

259
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:42,285
Hiromi! Hiromi!

260
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,658
Miss Hiromi!

261
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,131
She's on the roof!

262
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,669
Hiromi!

263
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,480
Hiromi!

264
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,848
Kazuko,

265
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,578
you think I have no talent, don't you?

266
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,386
No...

267
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,422
You're so uppity, just because you
have a little more talent than me!

268
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:11,592
But, I'll be better than you
from now on!

269
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,651
As long as I have this pencil!

270
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,424
That pencil...

271
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,001
The energy level has peaked!

272
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,231
Go! Castor! Pollux!

273
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:28,604
Hiromi!

274
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,798
Everyone, transform!

275
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,095
Okay!

276
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:55,035
Moon Prism Power!

277
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,837
Mercury Power!

278
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:59,273
Mars Power!

279
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,298
Makeup!

280
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,090
The strongest monsters?

281
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,526
That's right.
Those two monsters are like twins,

282
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,229
bound together by a strong friendship.

283
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:58,632
And that power is several levels
greater than the sailor warriors!

284
00:17:58,632 --> 00:17:59,900
Really?

285
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,800
They will meet their end today.

286
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,775
How dare you take advantage
of anime, which nurtures
children's dreams

287
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,210
and the passion of a young woman?!

288
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,373
The girls who like anime are mad!

289
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:16,812
In the name of the moon,

290
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,015
we will punish you!

291
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,889
We shall see

292
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,914
if you can beat us.

293
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:25,826
What?!

294
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,259
Behold!

295
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,165
We are bound

296
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:33,000
by a strong friendship!

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,635
In other words,

298
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:37,035
you cannot defeat us!

299
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:40,340
Go around and around...

300
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,638
How about this?!

301
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:50,774
Go around one more time...
And how about this?!

302
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:58,514
Did you see, our teamwork?!

303
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,160
Oh, no...

304
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,924
How come they're using the
same techniques as us?

305
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,234
I'll finish off you guys!

306
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,636
No! That's my job!

307
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:12,339
No, I will...

308
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,641
No! I will do it!

309
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,844
Back off!

310
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,245
No! You should back off!

311
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,849
This is the end of our friendship!

312
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,942
Just what I wanted!

313
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:27,309
Now! Their teamwork has broken down!

314
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:31,024
Okay! We'll show them what
real teamwork is!

315
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,286
Yeah!

316
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,837
Fire

317
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:49,710
In the stormy city

318
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,444
Bubble
In the stormy city

319
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:51,578
Bubble
A mysterious enemy closes in

320
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:52,446
A mysterious enemy closes in

321
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:53,781
Moon Tiara
A mysterious enemy closes in

322
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:54,414
Moon Tiara
Temptation, trickery, betrayal

323
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:55,516
Temptation, trickery, betrayal

324
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:57,117
Soul!
Temptation, trickery, betrayal

325
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:57,384
Their evil reaches out
in search of prey

326
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:58,786
Spray!
Their evil reaches out
in search of prey

327
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,454
Action!
Their evil reaches out
in search of prey

328
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:01,853
Their evil reaches out
in search of prey

329
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,588
Ooh, ooh

330
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:07,594
They're dreamy pretty boys

331
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,129
Oh, no!
They're dreamy pretty boys

332
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:09,830
They're dreamy pretty boys

333
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,398
So, what about it?

334
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:12,399
This is no time to hesitate

335
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,967
We should have valued
This is no time to hesitate

336
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:14,368
our friendship more!
This is no time to hesitate

337
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:17,037
our friendship more!

338
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:22,810
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

339
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,911
We did it!

340
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:24,444
We did it!
The sailor warriors of love and justice

341
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:27,047
The sailor warriors of love and justice

342
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:27,247
Impossible!
The sailor warriors of love and justice

343
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,149
Impossible!
Will punish you in the
name of the moon

344
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:30,083
Will punish you in the
name of the moon

345
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,319
I enjoyed the show.
Will punish you in the
name of the moon

346
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,320
Will punish you in the
name of the moon

347
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,622
We're in a bad mood today

348
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:38,759
Those sailor warriors are
better than I had thought!
We're in a bad mood today

349
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,783
We're in a bad mood today

350
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,729
Come on. Cheer up, Hiromi!
We're scary if you get too close

351
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:43,730
Kazuko, the truth is, those pencils...
We're scary if you get too close

352
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:43,964
Kazuko, the truth is, those pencils...

353
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:47,301
Kazuko, the truth is, those pencils...
If all our hearts

354
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,002
Come together, love will win

355
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:52,105
Hiromi, there's something
I've been hiding from you.
Come together, love will win

356
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:53,373
Hiromi, there's something
I've been hiding from you.
Bubble Spray

357
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,908
What?!
Begone, evil spirit

358
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:55,309
Here.

359
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:56,310
Here.
Moon Tiara Action

360
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,710
Moon Tiara Action

361
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,979
That's your...
Moon Tiara Action

362
00:20:58,979 --> 00:20:59,536
Moon Tiara Action

363
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,381
Oh!
If you make fun of girls

364
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:03,984
I'm sorry for breaking our promise.
If you make fun of girls

365
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,919
I was frustrated because you always
did such a great job,
We won't forgive you

366
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,354
I was frustrated because you always
did such a great job,

367
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:09,690
so I used these to motivate myself.

368
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,317
You, too?

369
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,819
I felt like I would get left behind,
if I didn't do anything about it.

370
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:19,366
But that's how I felt!

371
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,856
Say, Hiromi...

372
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:25,730
I think in the end, it wasn't wrong
of us to use these pencils.

373
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,909
Because everything we create
should be anime

374
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,436
that doesn't disappoint
the children's dreams!

375
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:35,279
Kazuko. You're right!

376
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:38,585
Then let's make a promise!

377
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:39,653
Then let's make a promise!
If you make fun of girls

378
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:42,089
Let us continue to work hard,
If you make fun of girls

379
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:43,924
We won't forgive you

380
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,858
so we never disappoint
the children's dreams!

381
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:50,194
Looks like the finished Sailor V anime
will be something to look forward to!

382
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,792
Yeah!

383
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,908
It's a promise?

384
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:02,341
It's a promise.

385
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:12,709
In my dream, you and I were together

386
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:19,585
Protected by the stars

387
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,839
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

388
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:42,078
And we casually talked to each other

389
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:50,684
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

390
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:57,725
I want to become prettier
right here and now

391
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:05,261
Something changes when
you fall in love

392
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:11,841
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

393
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:25,725
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
