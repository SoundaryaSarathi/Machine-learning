...go to the trouble of
putting together piece by piece...

...it takes on the spirit of the builder.

is the logic of those who build...

128

...but that doesn't mean
it's completely correct.

Aren't we all having fun.

181
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:13,668
Well, um...

182
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:18,708
The mono-eye... fulfills the
duty of being the main camera...

183
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,608
Was that by any chance for my benefit?

184
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,808
No, I'm just talking to myself.

185
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:25,248
I see.

186
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,648
...without a fifth person.

187
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,188
Scary story, part 2.

188
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,918
What's with these bad vibes?

189
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,918
Am I some kind of nuisance?

190
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:48,938
I liked how today's Kujiun was
bursting with minor characters.

191
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:53,698
Maybe that's why, but Tokino
seemed livelier than usual...

192
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,208
You could say that.

193
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,268
This b-being the second season...

194
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,408
...it's n-nice to be able to
see a filler episode like this.

195
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:00,278
I agree.

196
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,908
The staff would have their hands full
trying to pull it off in 13 episodes.

197
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:06,218
Anyone else?

198
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,388
Saki, were you watching it?

199
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:09,388
Huh?

200
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:13,388
Uh, that's...

201
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,158
Oh, this?

202
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,228
I was just checking it out.

203
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,728
T-That's still in the
test fitting stage!

204
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,598
I mean, it's easy to
lose track of the parts.

205
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,938
Fine, fine, I'll give it back.

206
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,268
Sorry about your precious head.

207
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:30,178
No, I'm sorry.

208
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:41,718
I wonder if K-Kasukabe
wants to make one too...

209
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,788
There's no way.

210
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:44,858
No chance.

211
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,358
Not a one, no.

212
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:51,228
But you know, maybe we should ask
her.

213
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,398
W-Well...

214
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:54,798
I don't know.

215
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,268
She's not interested.

216
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:57,468
Oh...

217
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:01,008
Making models is so much fun though.

218
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:06,978
I think maybe I'll take the
one-shoulder challenge this summer.

219
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:08,878
One-shoulder?

220
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,778
Outfits that show off
one of your shoulders.

221
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:11,978
Huh.

222
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,008
Speaking of one-shoulder...

223
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,818
...I like the Zako better than
the Goaf that Ohno's building.

224
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,658
The one with spike armor
just on one shoulder...

225
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:24,928
Is something wrong?

226
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,598
No, what should we do after this?

227
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,528
What would you like to do?

228
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,328
Let's see...

229
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,978
Sorry, I think I'll split.

230
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:38,378
I'm kinda tired.

231
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:49,848
Say what?

232
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,588
Ohno, are you doing a manicure?

233
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,018
A new color?

234
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:56,718
Pardon?

235
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,528
Of course not...

236
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,038
U-Um...

237
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:07,768
What?

238
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:12,378
Would you like to build with me?

239
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:13,808
What?

240
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,938
I mean, you've been here a lot lately...

241
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,748
I thought maybe you were
interested in models.

242
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:24,078
Yeah, right.

243
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,728
Try again.

244
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:31,058
See? There's no way.

245
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:36,368
A-Anyway, let's continue
smoothing out the seams!

246
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:40,068
It goes without saying that this
one task yields tremendous results.

247
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:40,938
Yes sir!

248
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,578
Yes sir...

249
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,948
Hey, Genshiken!

250
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:53,778
What's up?

251
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,448
Don't give me that!

252
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,488
We've got complaints about
the smell of paint thinner...

253
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,028
...coming from your neck of the woods!

254
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,728
Paint thinner?

255
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,088
Ahhh...

256
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,488
And what does "ahhh" mean?

257
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:09,868
Well, it is spring, you
get all types showing up.

258
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:10,738
Huh?

259
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:13,868
You see that you do whatever it
takes to keep those bozos in line.

260
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,848
Why'd this have to happen now?

261
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,458
I'm worried about any dust.

262
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,958
There's no way to get
rid of it in the end.

263
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,058
You just have to block the wind with
your body as much as possible.

264
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:39,768
What are you doing?

265
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,968
Well, there were complaints about a
paint thinner smell in the club room...

266
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,128
To be honest I resent this...

267
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,698
...but hey, don't give up until the end!

268
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:49,708
Yes sir!

270
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:08,928
Are you tired?

271
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:11,558
I don't exercise much, so...

272
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,028
Just one more push.

273
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:15,458
Yes sir, I'll try.

274

<i>Beginner Upgrade Courses

275
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:42,698
Hmm.

276
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:47,468
How are they?

277
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,508
Good job...

278
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,838
That just leaves the
finishing touch, matte paint.

279
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:56,878
Yes sir!

280
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,718
This is something where
mistakes are irrevocable...

281
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,718
...so you have to be earnestly
steady and careful with your painting.

282
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:06,618
Yes sir!

283
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:07,808
We'll start with Ohno.

284
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,588
Yes, please.

285
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:13,788
See?

286
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:17,458
It's a snap of the wrist like this...

287
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:21,238
So you don't end up with unevenness.

288
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,168
L-Like this?

289
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:25,258
Ah, nice, that's the way.

290
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:27,908
All right then...

291
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,738
The wind's messing me up!

292
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,178
You have to time it right.

293
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:38,218
Uh, for now dry it off!

294
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,188
Then sandpaper it again!

295
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:41,088
Y-Yes sir!

296
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,988
First carefully strip
it off. Carefully...

297
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,988
Y-Yes sir!

298
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,528
Something's on my JM too!

299
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,028

<i>My JM!</i>

00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:55,768
Hey!

308
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,498
Genshiken!

309
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:01,268
I don't know what the hell you're
doing, but don't pollute the courtyard!

310
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:02,768
No, we're just...

311
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:06,308
What's that stink?

312
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,578
Clean it up immediately!

313
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,958
That tension.

314
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,518
Huh?

315
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,928
To be frank, it's a drag.

316
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:20,788
Huh?

317
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,658
All you do is scream your head off!

318
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,658
And just when have I done that?

319
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:26,788
You're doing it now!

320
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,968
All I did was give those
three the warning they deserve!

321
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,938
Dammit, that's why it's a drag!

322
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,068
What's a drag?

323
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,668
Here it is, springtime, don't
you have anything else to do?

324
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,318
That's none of your business!

325
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,118
Hey, Ohno.

326
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:49,988
What's this about?

327
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,948
I finished the Goaf.

328
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,828
Huh?

329
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:58,798
Wow, you finished it...

330
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,258
It's not that good though...

331
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:06,268
Oh well, right? I wouldn't really know...

332
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,348
I'm impressed that
you made it to the end!

333
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,708
Yeah, yeah!

334
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,248
Um... can I touch it?

335
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:23,918
Uh, um, um...

336
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,788
Sure.

337
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,098
Uh, it's okay this time.

338
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:33,668
If you aren't rough with them,
they don't break so easily, right?

339
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:37,238
Y-Yes, of course...

340
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:41,368
Carefully, then.

341
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,038
Hmm, it bends easier than I expected!

342
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:50,118
Y-Yeah...

343
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:54,218
Wow, so that's how this works.

344
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,648
It moves pretty well!

345
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:02,088
Huh?

346
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:04,898
Oh, hold the joint when you move it?

347
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:07,158
That's right, as smoothly as possible...

348
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,238
Like this?

349
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:10,698
Huh?

350
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:22,448
"Snap?"

351
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:27,708
S-Sorry! Looks like
the leg came off...

352
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:31,118
I-It's okay! Chances are
the polycap just came off...

353
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,798
It's broken...

354
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,328
For real?

355
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,858
It was on purpose! I know it!

356
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,938
No it wasn't, I didn't mean to!

357
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,408
But you said "Hnn!"

358
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:50,108
What the hell was that all about?
They don't usually break this easily!

359
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:50,748
Huh?

360
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,368
<i>But... Huh?</i>

00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,748
Ohno, I'm sorry...

363
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:05,018
No, it's all right...

364
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:08,198
I'm okay, totally...

365
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:10,988
I'm just fine!

366
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:13,858
What?

367
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,438
What? Huh? This...

368
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,438
Sorry! I'll make it up to you!

369
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:20,268
We'll go shopping, okay?

370
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,308
No, you don't need to...

371
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,148
Well, there you have it.

372
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:32,878
It's unfortunate, but making it up
to her won't bring her Goaf back.

373
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,118
That Goaf isn't just a
thing that was bought.

374
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:40,788
Ohno spent a week putting
it together herself.

375
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,158
The accumulation of each
and every effort involved...

376
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:47,068
...is the reason behind her tears.

377
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:51,158
It's not something that can be
healed by buying the same kit.

378
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,738
Do you understand?

379
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:54,828
Ohno's tears are in and of themselves...

380
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:59,138
...the difference between a
model and a toy you simply buy.

381
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:03,208
I'm sorry, Ohno...

382
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:06,918
No, I'm really alright now.

383
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:10,248
Then, I'll do any one
thing for you as an apology.

384
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,518
What would you like?

385
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:14,058
Seriously, anything you say.

386
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,558
Oh, okay...

387
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,358
Please cosplay.

388
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,828
Huh?

389
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,578
B-By the way, how much
was that originally?

390
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,408
About 3000 yen.

391
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:40,848
3000...

392
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:43,928
That's not much for full-body cosplay.

393
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:46,218
How about just one part?

394
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:49,128
One part...

395
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,958
Then maybe that would work.

396
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:57,238
T-This, huh?

397
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,538
Isn't it a bit much
compared to last time?

398
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,508
You think so?

399
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:07,108
I think the maid effect
makes it that much cuter.

400
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:15,618
Please, meow.

401
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,188
Meow?

402
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,258
I won't let you trick me!

403
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:29,108
Hey, that's no fair, you promised!

404
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:42,638
What?

405
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

406
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:09,098
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

407
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:18,378
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

408
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:28,118
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

409
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:38,498
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

410
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:49,978
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

411
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:59,458
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

412
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:09,438
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

413
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:18,308
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

414
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:26,988
Kasukabe the cat-eared maid...

415
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:31,178
I'm sure she'd be uppity at first,
but she'd turn obedient before long...

416
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:33,558
Oh, I like...

417
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:37,968
<i>Right now, their
imaginations are running wild!</i>

418
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:44,508
When a character gets upset,
a huge droplet of water appears.

419
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,728
You mean the sweat drop.

420
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:48,378
Don't you think it's
gotten a little too old?

421
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:51,408
Just like blinking lines over their
heads when they realize something.

422
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:53,178
Or when they're on a cheek.

423
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:55,378
Sometimes they're even over b-breasts.

424
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:58,748
I guess even symbols like
those can become fads.

425
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:01,558
T-The most embarrassing
things these days are...

426
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,558
...split-screens and
trendy theme songs.

427
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,388
Yeah, I like the kind
where you can shout out the...

428
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,328
...name of the robot or its
attacks in the song during karaoke!
