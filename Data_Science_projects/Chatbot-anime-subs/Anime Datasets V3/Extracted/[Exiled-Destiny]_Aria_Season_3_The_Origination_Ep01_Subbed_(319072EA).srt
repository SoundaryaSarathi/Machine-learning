1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Spring is almost here, isn't it?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,170
Yeah, spring...

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,940
It's really spring.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,810
When spring approaches,
we tend to mellow out, don't we?

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,710
You're always mellow, though.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,910
It's more unusual when you're not mellow.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,780
Now that you mention it, you're right.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,590
"Dear Ai, this year's Carnevale
brought more visitors than usual."

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,390
"Things were really lively right up
until yesterday, when it ended."

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,870
"During Carnevale, we had many opportunities
to work onboard our mentors' gondolas."

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,970
"It gave us the chance to watch them up close
as they worked with all sorts of customers."

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,680
"It was a great hands-on
learning experience. But..."

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,090
"...on the other hand, it also made me
very aware of my shortcomings."

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,780
"I guess I still have a long way to go
before I can become a Prima."

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,160
"I'm sure you'll be just fine, Akari."

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,260
"In fact, by the next time I visit Neo-Venezia,
you might already be a Prima."

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,990
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

18
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:44,290
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

19
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,810
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,580
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

21
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,090
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

22
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,490
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,930
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

24
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:23,390
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

25
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:33,410
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

26
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,420
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

27
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:47,200
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:56,340
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

29
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,840
That Imminent Spring Breeze...

31
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,160
Gondola coming through!

32
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,600
Wow, Junior! You're really
projecting your voice today.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,160
That was amazing, Alice!

34
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,240
I had a revelation.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,430
Oh?

36
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,230
While watching Athena work,
I thought about a number of things.

37
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,500
From this day forward, I'm Neo-Alice!

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,720
Sounds like you were inspired by
your mentor during Carnevale, too.

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,520
Yes.

40
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,660
You too, Aika?

41
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah, I guess so. But...

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,960
...I've been working nonstop these
past few days, so I'm really... sleep... y...

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,630
Oh, Aika.

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
You're both really sleepy-heads...

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,210
Well, it is spring, after all.

46
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,360
Say, why don't we get some coffee
at the café up ahead?

47
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,260
Agreed!
Agreed!

48
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,060
It's Al.

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
Huh? Al?

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,670
You're right.

51
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,940
I wonder if he's having tea by himself...

52
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,780
No... He's with Pony-boy...

53
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,210
Yay!

54
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,550
Al, Akatsuki!

55
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,860
How nice to see you all! Good morning.

56
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,590
Good morning.

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,530
It's unusual to see you both
having tea at this hour.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,770
We're having a study session today.

59
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,900
Indeed.

60
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,780
If I can't defeat this fiendish promotion exam,
I won't be able to complete my training.

61
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,010
But what's with all these
difficult words, one after another?

62
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,750
It's a pain just reading it.

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Now, now, don't say that.
It's a pain just reading it.

64
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,220
Now, now, don't say that.

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,980
It's important for Salamanders to learn
the workings of Aqua, Akatsuki.

66
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,880
I know that!

67
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,900
This doesn't look like a study session...
It's more like Al's just tutoring you.

68
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,130
What did you say, Gachapen?!

69
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't call me Gachapen, Pony-boy!

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
I'll go buy us some coffee.

71
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,900
Sideburns.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,340
Get another cup for us, too.

73
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,610
Okay...
Get another cup for us, too.

74
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,010
Okay...

75
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,850
Well then, study hard!

76
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,480
Will do.

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,820
Take care.
Will do.

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,940
Take care.

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Promotion exam, huh?

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,390
You two will probably have yours soon, too.

81
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,160
Eh? You think so?

82
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah, I do.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,960
I guess... we might?

84
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,200
Why are you being so doubtful?

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,100
We're practicing hard like this to prepare
for when that day comes, aren't we?

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,700
Yeah.

87
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,410
I can't lose to Pony-boy, that's for sure!

88
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,690
Akari, President Aria, let's have lunch.

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,810
Yes!

90
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,260
I heard the involtino from
this shop is really delicious.

91
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,590
Oh?

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,830
You're right! They look delicious!

93
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,230
My, my.
You're right! They look delicious!

94
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,030
My, my.

95
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,200
Let's eat!
Let's eat!

96
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,640
The salmon is delicious!

97
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,640
We don't have any bookings for this afternoon,
so maybe we can call it a day.

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,590
There aren't many people around after Carnevale,
so it feels a little lonely, doesn't it?

99
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,260
Oh, no! President Aria!

100
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,490
Oh, my! Water, water!

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,730
Here's a glass of water, Akari.

102
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay.

103
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,620
Here, President Aria.

104
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,840
Looks like he'll be okay.

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,900
Please eat slowly, President Aria.

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,000
Delivery for the Aria Company!

107
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,770
Coming!

108
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,350
Woody, thank...

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,470
Huh?

110
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,750
Akari!

111
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,590
Spring is almost here in Neo-Venezia.

112
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,760
Spring is?

113
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,730
From the sky, you can see...

114
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,530
...that the city is gradually changing its colors.

115
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,070
Sounds wonderful.

116
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,100
Hmm...

117
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,470
Here you go, this is your package.

118
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,270
Thank you very much!

119
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,710
Well then, see you later.

120
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,540
Yes!

121
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,420
It's addressed to you, Alicia.

122
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,910
My, my. I wonder what it is?

123
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,090
"Bringing you spring a little early."

124
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,550
My, it's from a customer
we had during Carnevale.

125
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,500
Do you remember? It's the lady
who came with her daughter.

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,400
Ah, I remember.

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,460
They were from the south, right?

128
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,230
It's cherry tea and cherry jam.

129
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,200
Might as well... Why don't we
invite everyone over?

130
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,510
What a great idea!

131
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,850
It's slow this time of year, so Akira
and Athena might be able to join us, too.

132
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,880
I'll try calling them.

133
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,050
My, my.

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Seeing Neo-Venezia after Carnevale...

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,740
...is like seeing it after it has
taken off its mask, isn't it?

136
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,540
It's the true face of Neo-Venezia.

137
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,780
I see...

138
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,210
If I think of it that way,
it doesn't feel lonely at all.

139
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,550
My, my.
If I think of it that way,
it doesn't feel lonely at all.

140
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,450
My, my.

141
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,700
We're back!
We're back!

142
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,940
How did it go, President Aria?

143
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,130
Did you catch any fi...

144
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,470
Oh, no!

145
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,340
What happened, President Aria?

146
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,400
Please pull yourself together!

147
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,090
President Aria, could you
help us with this next?

148
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,370
Alicia, I'll make the cookies.

149
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes, please do.

150
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,330
Hello!
Hello!

151
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,660
Coming!

152
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,630
Oh, something smells delicious.

153
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,390
Welcome!

154
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,630
Please come upstairs.

155
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,400
Coming in!

156
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,710
Thank you for inviting us today.

157
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,440
My, my. Welcome.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,810
Athena's still working, but she said
she'd come when she's done.

159
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,360
President Maa, President Aria's
pudgy-wudgy tummy isn't a snack.

160
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,300
Okay everyone, let's have a seat.

161
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,940
Akari, could you bring the tea, please?

162
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,300
Okay!

163
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,510
So that's the cherry jam?

164
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,510
I'm really looking forward to it.

165
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,840
My, my.

166
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,450
We've made a bunch of things,
so have as much as you like.

167
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,390
Yay! Alicia's homemade cooking!

168
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,860
We brought walnut bread, too.

169
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,460
Thank you, Akira!

170
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,490
Smells like spring...
Thank you, Akira!

171
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,220
Smells like spring...

172
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,290
All right! First, we need to
wash our hands and gargle.

173
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,750
For Primas, keeping in good health
is an important part of the job.

174
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,730
Right!
Right!

175
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,790
All right, me first!

176
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,170
You're really a cheater!

177
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,810
I can't lose to Pony-boy,
but I can't lose to Junior, either.

178
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,910
Aika...

179
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,750
Yes?
Aika...

180
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,620
You're so childish.

181
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,670
Wha-?!
You're so childish.

182
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,090
It smells great.

183
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,230
It makes it feel like spring, doesn't it?

184
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,200
This is the first time I've had cherry jam.

185
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,760
My, my. Did you want some
more tea, President Aria?

186
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,010
Ah, you'd like more bread, too? Sure.

187
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,310
My, my.

188
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,450
Alicia, what kind of person was the customer
who sent you this cherry tea?

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,310
It was a mother and daughter
who were very close.

190
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,580
Right, and also...

191
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,530
The building on your right is Palazzo Ducale.

192
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,470
And straight across is the
Piazzetta of Piazza San Marco.

193
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,610
Once we leave this canal, the wind will
become colder, so please be careful.

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,450
Neo-Venezia really is
a wonderful place, isn't it?

195
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,550
You've always wanted to come here, Mother.

196
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,320
But I guess I should have brought you
when the weather was a little warmer.

197
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,530
I chose a bad time to come.

198
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,000
Not at all, I'm happy we came.
We hardly ever see snow back home.
I chose a bad time to come.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,370
Not at all, I'm happy we came.
We hardly ever see snow back home.

200
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,340
Ma'am.

201
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,850
Your daughter and Neo-Venezia
have a wonderful gift for you.

202
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,080
My, what it could be?

203
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,170
Please hold out your hand.

204
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,410
My hand?

205
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,210
Like this?

206
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,650
Oh, my!

207
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,380
Snow!

208
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,860
It's snowing!

209
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,630
It's beautiful.

210
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,460
Yes, it sure is.

211
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,690
What a wonderful gift!

212
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:45,470
The cold snow brought warmth to our
customers' hearts, as well as our own.

213
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes.

214
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,850
No sa... pp... y...

215
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,090
You're too amazing, Alicia.

216
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,550
My, my.

217
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,220
Alicia's amazing, but so is Akira.

218
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,790
Huh? Did something happen?

219
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,030
How do I look? It suits me, right?

220
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,130
Hey, cut it out!
How do I look? It suits me, right?

221
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:05,730
Hey, cut it out!

222
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,890
It's not safe!

223
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,840
It's fine, it's fine!
I have good sense of balance!

224
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,780
If Akira wasn't balancing you out,
you'd already be at the bottom of the canal.

225
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,340
Akira should scold him.

226
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,050
Sir, that's a woman's mask.

227
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh?

228
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,850
My beloved prince, please marry me!

229
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,190
Ah! I said it, I said it!
I proposed to Himeya's Akira!

230
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,090
Listen, would you just...

231
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,560
Whoa!

232
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,040
Excuse me!

233
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,810
That was close...

234
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,000
Princess, acting like a troublesome
tomboy won't help to win me over.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,550
Y... Yes...

236
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,490
Oh, that.

237
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,560
It's not like I don't understand
wanting to cut loose on vacation.

238
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,340
You're too cool.

239
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,830
My, my.

240
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,850
If I had snapped then, they probably wouldn't
have remembered their vacation as fondly.

241
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,650
Something similar happened
with Athena, as well.

242
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,790
No! I want ice cream!

243
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,360
Honestly...
No! I want ice cream!

244
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,960
No! I want ice cream!

245
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,900
You can't, it's cold. You'll get a tummy ache.
No, I want some! I want it, I want it!
No! No! Buy me ice cream! Ice cream!

246
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,160
No, I want some! I want it, I want it!
No! No! Buy me ice cream! Ice cream!

247
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,000
Come now, be a good boy.
No, I want some! I want it, I want it!
No! No! Buy me ice cream! Ice cream!

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,370
No, no, no, no!

249
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,910
What's with him all of a sudden?

250
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:10,160
Even though Athena looked
pretty dopey, it was really cool.

251
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,330
Dopey...

252
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,760
Alice...

253
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Eh? What?

254
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,730
Were you just talking about me, Alice?

255
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, about how you're really clumsy.

256
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,160
Ehh?

257
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,940
Welcome, Athena.

258
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,110
Good work today!
Good work today!

259
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,870
Thank you for having me!

260
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,240
Which clumsy story?

261
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,280
When I put mayonnaise on our pudding?

262
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,880
Or when I slammed into the
glass door in the bathroom?

263
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,120
No.

264
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,530
Actually, we were talking about how
amazing the Three Great Water Fairies are.

265
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,200
Sounds like the three of you realized
that you still have a long way to go.

266
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,270
We sure did. I feel kind of
depressed because of it.

267
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,440
Let's do our best, Aika.

268
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,810
Of course we will.

269
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,380
It's true that the three of you
have a long way to go.

270
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,440
Alicia.

271
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,950
But... so do I.

272
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,290
Akira and Athena, too.
We all have a long way to go.

273
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,260
Right?

274
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,100
Yeah. You're right.

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
Eh?
Eh?

276
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,170
That's really a shocker.

277
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,100
You're already so amazing,
we could never catch up to you.

278
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,470
She's right!

279
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,010
So then, when are you going
to be satisfied with yourself, Akira?

280
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,470
Probably... never,
no matter how much better I get.

281
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,110
No matter how long I continue this job.

282
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,350
If you believe you've reached the top and
become complacent, you can't move forward.

283
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,160
That's why I think it's really important
to believe you still have a long way to go.

284
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,620
Yes.

285
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,140
"Tomorrow, I'll shine much
brighter than I did today."

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,000
That's something you want to
believe about yourself.

287
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,110
That feeling will probably never change,
even if you become Primas.

288
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,270
Even after you step off your gondolas for the
last time, that feeling will still be there.

289
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,710
Maybe that's how everyone
finds their own brilliance?

290
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,520
Their own brilliance...

291
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,460
In other words, it's only natural
that you still have a long way to go.

292
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,960
That's right.

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,720
And that's something very wonderful.

294
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,690
Maybe it's best to just cherish yourself and the
long journey ahead, and have fun along the way?

295
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,430
Yes.
Yes.

296
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,610
Hey Alicia, pour me another cup
of cherry tea, will you?

297
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,910
Ah! Me, too.

298
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,940
Yes, yes.

299
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,980
I feel so relaxed after today.

300
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,660
Yes.

301
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,960
Alicia and the others will keep on chasing
after their own brilliance, won't they?

302
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,560
I'm really motivated!

303
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,410
Do you remember?

304
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,970
"If you can praise yourself honestly, and make
everything in this world something to enjoy..."

305
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,040
"...then becoming the brightest
star Undine isn't a dream."

306
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,350
Grandma taught us that, didn't she?

307
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,020
I remember it.

308
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,020
It's somehow...

309
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,130
Yeah?

310
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,460
Um...

311
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,000
What is it?

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,720
How should I put it?

313
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,100
Our mentors, who we love so much,
teach us many precious things...

314
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,570
...and always watch over us, just like the sky.

315
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,770
Yes.

316
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,400
I was thinking, maybe that's
something really special?

317
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,850
Yeah.

318
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,020
But we can't depend on it.

319
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,860
Someday, we have to become the brightest stars,
so our own apprentices can say the same about us.

320
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,360
Oh!

321
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah... you're right...

322
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,330
What's with that tone?
No being doubtful allowed!

323
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,740
Huh?!

324
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,870
You're Alicia's only apprentice!

325
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,840
Yes...

326
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,110
You need to be more self-conscious
and feel the pressure!

327
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,080
O-Okay.

328
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,910
You're really strict, Aika.

329
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,450
We're definitely going to
become the brightest stars!

330
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,580
Yeah!

331
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,190
I can't hear you! Louder!
We're going to be the brightest stars!

332
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,260
I wonder what kind of Primas they'll become?
I can't hear you! Louder!
We're going to be the brightest stars!

333
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,820
I wonder what kind of Primas they'll become?
Yeah!!

334
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,260
I wonder. But I'm looking forward to that day.

335
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm looking forward to it too,
but that'll also be the day they leave us.

336
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,360
It's kind of lonely.

337
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,170
I'm sure Akira will cry.

338
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,440
Wha-?! Who's going to cry?!

339
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,940
My, my.

340
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,570
Good grief.

341
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,980
Though I'm sure each of them will be unique...

342
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,720
...and become a new kind of Prima Undine
that we've never seen before.

343
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,620
That's right.

344
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,960
They'll become fairies, bringing
new wonders to Neo-Venezia.

345
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,330
And then, the torch will be passed, won't it?

346
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,870
Yeah.

347
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,030
"Akari, it seems like spring in Neo-Venezia
helps bring out everyone's true colors."

348
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,370
"But Akari, your true colors are..."

349
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,890
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

350
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,790
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

351
00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:00,440
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

352
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,580
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

353
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:22,800
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

354
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,900
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

355
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:45,120
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

356
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,660
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

357
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,990
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

358
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,400
And my day begins
Hajimaru
