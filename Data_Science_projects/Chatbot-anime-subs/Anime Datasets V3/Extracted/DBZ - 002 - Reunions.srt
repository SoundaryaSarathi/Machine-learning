00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:12,137
Have you lost sight
of your pride as a Saiyan,

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,041
the mightiest warriors
in the universe, Kakarrot!?

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,475
Kakarrot!?

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,392
Good afternoon!

5
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,394
It's been so long!

6
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,728
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

7
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,731
You said to come visit you, so I came.

8
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,335
Wow, it really has been a long time!

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,004
This house hasn't changed
at all in the meantime, huh?

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,306
You sure have been cold to us, huh?

11
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,207
Unless someone tells you to come over,
you never come, after all.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,011
Here!

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,774
I brought some <i>manju</i> buns as a present.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,017
You didn't need to go to that trouble.

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,010
If you'd just let me touch
your boobs a little bit, I'd-

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,025
You just don't appreciate my gags,
the same as always!

17
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,960
You're just a lecherous jerk,
the same as always!

18
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,712
By the way, Bulma-<i>san</i>,
what's happening with Yamucha-<i>san</i>?

19
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,715
Yamucha? That idiot?

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,151
How should I know about that guy?
I'm so mad at him,

21
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:37,389
I didn't tell him that everyone
was getting together here today!

22
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,725
Let's have ourselves a blast
without him being here!

23
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,994
You guys sure do fight a lot.

24
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:44,663
They sure do.

25
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,331
So then, where's Lunch-<i>san</i>?

26
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:50,131
She went out somewhere, chasing after
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>, five years ago.

27
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:04,175
<i>The position of this power is</i>
<i>moving at considerable speed.</i>

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,342
There! That's Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>'s house!

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,353
Miserable Kakarrot!
You're not getting away from me!

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,055
Yoo-hoo!

31
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,701
It's stopped!

32
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,036
--Son-<i>kun</i>!
--Goku!

33
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,038
Huh? What's up with the boy?

34
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:30,709
Have you taken up a job
baby-sitting, Goku?

35
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,869
He's my boy!

36
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:35,046
Y- yours, Goku!?

37
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,536
Yeah, that's right.

38
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,052
Go on, say hello.

39
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:42,988
Good afternoon.

40
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:46,324
--Yes, good afternoon.
--Yes, good afternoon.
--Yes, good afternoon.

41
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:49,661
His name is Son Gohan.

42
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:54,666
Son Gohan? So, you've given him
the name of your late grandpa?

43
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,001
Yeah.

44
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,670
Still, this is a surprise!

45
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,006
To think that Goku would
bring a child along!

46
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,736
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, how old might you be?

47
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:06,344
I'm four years old.

48
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:09,681
Wow. He's got good manners,
considering he's your boy, Son-<i>kun</i>.

49
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:12,047
Chichi is fussy about that.

50
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,356
Say, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, what are you
going to be when you grow up?

51
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:20,692
A great scholar.

52
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,990
S- scholar?

53
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,699
A tail?

54
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,827
Yeah. Just like I had before, right?

55
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,231
You're right!

56
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:41,046
S- say, does anything happen to your
boy that's strange in particular?

57
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,981
Strange?

58
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:47,319
F- for example, does he undergo any
changes on nights when the moon is full?

59
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,086
Nights when the moon is full?
Well, we all go to sleep early and all...

60
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:56,328
How come?

61
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:00,332
It's nothing, it's nothing!
In that case, it's all right!

62
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:04,462
S- say, Goku, is your boy strong,
like you?

63
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,340
About that...

64
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,676
I think he has quite a bit of power,

65
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:15,680
but Chichi gets mad
when I try to train Gohan.

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,016
Rock scissors paper!

67
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,352
How come? That's such a waste,
isn't it?

68
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,020
Ain't it, though?

69
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,692
She says the world is at peace now,
so we don't need martial arts anymore,

70
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:30,092
and that from now on,
it's time for studying.

71
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:37,627
So that tomboy of a girl turned out to
be an education-minded-mama-<i>san</i>, huh?

72
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:44,309
Say, is that thing on top
of Gohan-<i>kun</i>'s hat a Dragon Ball?

73
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,045
Yeah. It's <i>Si Xing Qiu</i>,
the Four-Star-Ball.

74
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,980
It's a keepsake from my grandpa,
you know?

75
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,983
I searched it out and stuck it on there.

76
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:55,854
I also found <i>San Xing Qiu</i>
and <i>Liu Xing Qiu</i> while I was at it.

77
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:56,980
I keep them at home.

78
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,289
That sure takes me back.
Dragon Balls, huh?

79
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:10,533
Are you going to gather the Dragon Balls
together and wish for something else?

80
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:17,736
I ain't got anything special
that I want to wish for.

81
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:26,985
<i>And here I thought that now</i>
<i>that Goku has a family,</i>

82
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,353
<i>his power might have diminished...</i>

83
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:31,447
You've got incredible power,
the same as ever, huh?

84
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:34,693
W- what is that!?

85
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:35,694
What's wrong?

86
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:38,663
S- something's coming this way!

87
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,305
Something's coming?

88
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,273
I wonder if it's Yamucha.

89
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:55,443
<i>A</i>- <i>awesome! I feel an</i>
<i>awesome power! What is it!?</i>

90
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,995
It's here!

91
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,331
Here it comes!

92
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,424
W- what is that!?

93
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:19,970
Who is it?

94
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,107
<i>What kind of ferocious bloodlust is this?</i>

95
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:58,605
So, we finally meet.

96
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:02,981
You've grown, huh?

97
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:06,212
But I still recognized you
at first glance, Kakarrot.

98
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:09,654
Kakarrot?

99
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:12,657
You look just like Father.

100
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:14,325
What does that mean?

101
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:17,328
What is this? What is this guy saying?

102
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:21,366
Kakarrot! What is with the
condition of this planet!?

103
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:26,004
You were supposed to have been under
orders to dispose of humanity!

104
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,972
What the hell have you
been goofing around for?

105
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,979
Now look here, you. I don't know
who you are or where you're from,

106
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,207
but go on back, go on back!

107
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:40,618
Shoo, shoo! You know,

108
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,621
it won't do for you to be out drunk
this early in the afternoon.

109
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:44,956
Go on back, go on back.

110
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,719
Kuririn! Don't get close to him!

111
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,122
Kuririn!

112
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,224
Why, you-!

113
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:24,587
A- a tail! This guy has a tail!

114
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:30,335
Looks like you've finally
learned my identity.

115
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,768
Your identity?

116
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,673
What do you mean!?

117
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:36,341
Over here!

118
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,009
Kakarrot!

119
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,346
Have you even forgotten about that!?

120
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:47,352
My name ain't that funny
Kaka-whatever nonsense! It's Son Goku!

121
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,149
How can this be?

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,028
Hey, go on, now!

123
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:02,193
Hey, have you ever taken any strong
shocks to the head in the past?

124
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,035
What?

125
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:07,971
Back when you were a child or sometime,
did you ever hit your head hard!?

126
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,042
Answer my question!

127
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,044
I did!

128
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:17,048
I don't remember it, but when I
was good and little, I hit my head!

129
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:18,383
W- what!?

130
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,718
I still have the scar, even now.

131
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:23,054
So that's it after all, huh?

132
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,390
But what does that have
to do with anything!?

133
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,755
Goku!

134
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:33,160
Long ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, told me something.

135
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:37,402
One day, deep in a valley,
he found something unusual,

136
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,405
like it had fallen from the sky.

137
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:44,375
When he got closer and looked at it,
there was a round capsule,

138
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,139
and inside it was a baby that had a tail.

139
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:53,784
He took him home,
and tried to raise him...

140
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:59,190
...but he had a violent disposition,
and never took to him,

141
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,624
and he was utterly at
his wit's end over him.

142
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:07,259
But then, one day,
he fell into a ravine by accident...

143
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:12,103
...and hit his head hard, nearly dying.
However,

144
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:15,231
having an unbelievable life force,
the baby apparently survived.

145
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,480
What's more, afterward,
his violent nature disappeared,

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,277
and he became a good little boy.

147
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,389
T- that was me?

148
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,724
Mm-hmm.

149
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,360
S- so then, what does that mean?

150
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,352
Does this guy and Son-<i>kun</i> have
some kind of connection?

151
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:44,669
Hey, who the hell are you!?
Tell me who you are!

152
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:49,674
You're being one difficult bastard,
forgetting everything like this!

153
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,734
Fine. I'll remind you, then.

154
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:59,609
From here on, I'll have a lot of
work for you to do for me, after all...

155
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:04,022
Are you okay, Kuririn?

156
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:08,026
Be careful, Goku!
That's no ordinary guy!

157
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:11,362
Mm-hmm, so it would appear.

158
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:12,597
To be honest,

159
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:16,701
just us standing here looking at
each other like this has got me scared!

160
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,369
This has never happened to me before!

161
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:23,466
I'll tell you, then. You are
not a human from this planet.

162
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,879
You were born on Planet Vegeta.

163
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,050
You are a proud Saiyan, the mightiest
warrior race in the universe!

164
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,051
The universe?

165
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:33,818
Warriors?

166
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,785
Saiyan?

167
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,657
And I am your older brother, Raditz!

168
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,001
G- Goku's older brother!?

169
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,004
B- brothers!?
You're kidding!

170
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,006
Stop talking nonsense!

171
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,705
R- right! If Goku is from outer space,
then what is he doing on Earth!?

172
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:08,519
The answer is simple.
Kakarrot, you were sent here

173
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,023
to exterminate the bothersome humans
that live on this planet!

174
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,357
I was what!?

175
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,726
We Saiyans are a renowned warrior race!

176
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,898
Our task is to go through space,

177
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:23,701
searching for planets
with good environments,

178
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,932
and once we've exterminated
those who already live there,

179
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:35,202
we sell them for a high price to aliens
who are looking for a suitable planet.

180
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,417
Adult warriors embark
directly upon planets

181
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,987
where those with a
higher battle power live.

182
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:46,090
But to planets like this one,
which have a lower level,

183
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,684
we send babies like you.

184
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:57,668
I- if that's the truth,
then you guys are awful!

185
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:00,660
That's crazy! You even make
Piccolo look lovable!

186
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,035
How can you send babies
off on their own!?

187
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,352
Kakarrot,

188
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,954
given several years,

189
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,024
you should have had plenty of time to
purge these nuisances all by yourself!

190
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,720
If only you had remembered
your orders, that is.

191
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,700
Luckily, this planet has a moon,
as well.

192
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,534
Hey, why is it so lucky
that there's a moon here?

193
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:38,709
Don't play stupid! It is when
the moon is at its fullest

194
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,542
that we Saiyans are at our best,
you know!

195
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:46,317
What are you talking about?

196
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,985
I don't understand what you mean at all!

197
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,145
What?

198
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:54,082
I- it can't be... Where's your tail?

199
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,984
What happened to your tail!?

200
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,666
It got cut off and disappeared long ago!

201
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:06,603
H- how can this be? You miserable fool!

202
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:12,343
It's no wonder you were able to get
along with the beings on this planet!

203
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,106
Enough!

204
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,617
It doesn't matter if I <i>am</i> some
whatever-you-call-it guy

205
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:22,353
from another planet,
or if you <i>are</i> my big brother!

206
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:26,187
Kuririn is right!
Anyone like that is a lowlife!

207
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:32,029
I am Son Goku, and I was raised here!
Now get out of here right now!

208
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,364
Right! Right!

209
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:36,234
Like he said! Whatever
his past may be,

210
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:40,371
right now, Son Goku is a fine Earthling,
more so than anyone else!

211
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:44,865
Goku has even saved the world!
Get lost! Get lost!

212
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,245
Even so, I cannot allow this to be.

213
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:57,321
The Saiyans have always
been a race few in numbers,

214
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,325
but now, after colliding
with a giant meteor,

215
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,952
the planet Vegeta has blown up.

216
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:12,670
Just about all of the Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

217
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,468
Our father and mother included!

218
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,347
Including you, there are
only four remaining Saiyans.

219
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,383
Me and one of the others were spared

220
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,018
because we were off
assaulting another planet.

221
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:31,022
And as for the other one, he was lucky
enough to be sent off to another planet,

222
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:31,920
just like you were.

223
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,961
Earlier, we inadvertently
found a nice planet

224
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,088
that we ought to be able to sell
for an extremely high price.

225
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,400
We'd like to go attack it,

226
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,925
but it looks like we'd have a hard time
of it with just the three of us.

227
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,099
That's when I remembered
about you, Kakarrot.

228
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,811
Your battle power is still incomplete,

229
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,008
but if you were to join up with the
three of us, you could still manage.

230
00:15:58,649 --> 00:15:59,650
Stay away!

231
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,584
Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

232
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:07,658
It will be fun!
Is your Saiyan blood not stirred?

233
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:09,327
I'm scared!

234
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,329
Don't be ridiculous!

235
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,662
I'd die before lending my hand to you!

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,763
So that's how it is, huh?

237
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:23,674
For a while now, I've been wondering,

238
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,677
that boy behind you is your son,
isn't he?

239
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,346
N- no!

240
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:29,574
It's no use trying to fool me!

241
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:35,918
That tail is proof that he
carries Saiyan blood, isn't it?

242
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,626
So... what if he is!?

243
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,964
Since you, his father,
won't listen to reason,

244
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,831
I guess I'll have to borrow
your son for a little while.

245
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,610
Keep back!

246
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,318
Just try to come any closer!

247
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,842
I'll knock you flying!

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,059
Father!

249
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,673
--Father!
--You mustn't go!

250
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,731
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

251
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,680
Whoa, there!

252
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,919
Kakarrot, I'll be taking the child.
If you want him returned alive,

253
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,114
you'll listen to what your
brother tells you to do!

254
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,452
D- dammit!

255
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:53,691
G- Goku went down
with only one blow!

256
00:17:56,634 --> 00:18:01,305
Kakarrot, I'm giving you only one day,
so think about it.

257
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:05,105
You'll probably have to get
your friends to help, too.

258
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:10,239
Still, you'll have
to show me some proof.

259
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:17,088
Ah, but that's a simple matter.
By this time tomorrow,

260
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:21,459
you'll kill a hundred of this
planet's humans, at least for now,

261
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,993
and pile their bodies up here!

262
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:23,982
What!?

263
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:34,464
You heard me, right? I'll be
looking forward to tomorrow.

264
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,074
He is my brother's son, after all.

265
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,677
If possible, I don't want
to have to kill him.

266
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:41,872
Father!

267
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:46,407
I'm scared!

268
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,043
G- Gohan!

269
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:11,142
<i>Exceedingly strong,</i>
<i>and exceedingly cold</i>-<i>blooded,</i>

270
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:14,044
<i>he's Goku's brother, Raditz!</i>

271
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:20,210
<i>Will Goku be able to save his son,</i>
<i>Son Gohan?</i>

272
