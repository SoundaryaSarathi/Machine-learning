1
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:03,129
I am so happy!

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,730
We haven't gone to a hot spring

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,599
with the whole family in a long time!

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,502
What?! Why does a monster have
to follow us here, too?!

5
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:12,672
How dare you ruin our quality time
together as a family?!

6
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,697
I'll never, never forgive you!

7
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,306
In the name of Dad, Sailor Moon
will punish you!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

9
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short
sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

10
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight

11
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou

12
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

13
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

14
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,808
Seiza no matataki kazoe

15
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta no
miracle romance

16
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

17
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,925
It's such a nice day!

18
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:01,995
Since you have today
and tomorrow off,

19
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,331
you're going to thoroughly study
how to be a princess.

20
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,696
Okay, Usagi?

21
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,362
Hey, Usagi?

22
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,761
Wow, talk about unusual.
Did she get up already?

23
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,907
There's no one here.

24
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:19,846
Good morning, Luna!

25
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:23,250
Actually, the whole family has decided
to go to a hot spring!

26
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,851
We'll be back by tomorrow night,

27
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,286
so keep an eye on the house for us!

28
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,379
I'll bring back sweet bean jam buns!
Signed Usagi.

29
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,315
Usagi!

30
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,000
The Legendary Lake Monster!
Usagi's Family Ties

31
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,174
Sis, you're nuts!

32
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,543
Sneaking out of the house
so our pet won't notice!

33
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,344
What the heck are you thinking?!

34
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,079
Well, I've got my reasons for it.

35
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,215
Come on! Right there!
Shoot right there!

36
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:58,218
But it's been so long since
we've traveled together!

37
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,053
Even though it's like we're old people,

38
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,589
spending a night at a
remote hot spring.

39
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,691
Oh! What are you doing?!
Just let me do it!

40
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,093
What are you doing?! Give it back!

41
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,329
Oh, come on!
What are you doing?! Give it back!

42
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,627
Oh, no! It's gonna break!

43
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:15,666
I can't believe you!

44
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,405
What's the matter, panicking
like that, Usagi?

45
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,507
I get it. Did you get it from a guy
you like or something?

46
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:24,077
Huh? Well, I guess you could say that.

47
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,203
What?!

48
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,373
Wait, Dad! The wheel! The wheel!

49
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,486
Usagi! Are you dating someone
behind my back?!

50
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,721
No! It's not like that!

51
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,723
Dear! Keep your eyes ahead! Ahead!

52
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,691
Oh, so you're not dating!

53
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:42,794
Of course, not. There's no way
you would be.

54
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,660
Wow, it's so beautiful!

55
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,403
It's kind of romantic.

56
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,378
There really isn't anything here.

57
00:03:58,378 --> 00:03:59,946
The truth is, this lake

58
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:01,581
is where your mom and I met,

59
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:03,650
and it holds a lot of beautiful
memories for us.

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,675
Oh, Dear...

61
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:17,589
Mamoru's music box...

62
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,202
Mamoru...

63
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,177
Usagi, we're gonna get going soon.

64
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:34,748
Is something wrong, Usagi?

65
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:36,773
No, it's nothing.

66
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:58,705
So, is this the lake

67
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:02,075
where you detected an unusual
energy reading?

68
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,611
It is similar to the power
of our monsters,

69
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:09,344
but it is producing a slightly different
and very strong energy reading.

70
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,587
Endymion, start investigating
right away.

71
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:14,884
Yes, my lady.

72
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,187
Queen Beryl.

73
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,029
Lately, he has been acting
increasingly suspicious.

74
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,832
Could he possibly have begun
to notice

75
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,167
that his memories have been erased?

76
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,401
I doubt it.

77
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,503
But Kunzite, just in case,

78
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:34,140
follow him and keep an eye
on his actions.

79
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,471
Understood, my lady.

80
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:39,346
Endymion is completely
under my control.

81
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:42,838
It would be impossible for him
to question his past, but...

82
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,117
Wow! What a great view!
What a great view!

83
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:55,962
A remote hot spring inn isn't
so bad after all, is it?

84
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:58,453
Oh, Shingo. What are you doing?

85
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,935
Hurry up and get in! The water's fine!

86
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:05,105
But I don't wanna be in a mixed bath.

87
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:08,708
What are you being so shy about?
It's just us family here.

88
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,378
If you don't hurry, you'll catch a cold.

89
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,073
Okay...

90
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:17,617
Gotcha!

91
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:18,785
Stop it!
Gotcha!

92
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:19,019
Stop it!

93
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,987
It's mine now!

94
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:22,956
Shingo! Give that back!

95
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,392
Usagi! Enough is enough!

96
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:26,760
It's okay, just let them be.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,828
Hey, give it back!

98
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,497
Haha! Come and get it!

99
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,865
Hey, Shingo!

100
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:35,562
Wow! What a nice view! The lake's
right in front of us!

101
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,772
You let your guard down!
What's wrong?

102
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,675
Look, there's somebody by the lake.
Over there.

103
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:43,267
What? Where?

104
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,345
It can't be!

105
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,249
It is Mamoru.

106
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,118
Oh, wait!

107
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,691
Sis!

108
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,694
What's she in such a hurry about?

109
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,170
Mamoru!

110
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:17,338
It's not him.

111
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,915
The music box is playing again.

112
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,269
Mamoru!

113
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,373
That melody... Why does it throw
my heart into confusion?

114
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,876
Mamoru! It's me, Usagi!

115
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,676
Please! Don't pretend you
don't know me...

116
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:57,917
Mamoru? Usagi? I do not know them.

117
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,851
Those names have nothing
to do with me.

118
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,714
You can't mean that! Mamoru!

119
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,693
It's me! Don't you recognize me?!

120
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:07,494
Usagi!
It's me! Don't you recognize me?!

121
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:07,983
Usagi!

122
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,056
Mom...

123
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,468
Mamoru...

124
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,277
Usagi, what's the matter?
You disappeared so suddenly.

125
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:27,337
No, it's nothing.

126
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,851
Oh, the "Legendary Lovers".

127
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,553
So, this is what you were looking at.

128
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,111
What? Legendary?

129
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:41,019
It's an old story that's been passed
down through the generations.

130
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,196
A maiden of the Heavens
had come down to Earth,

131
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:45,460
and a youth of the land
fell in love with her.

132
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,802
But a girl, who adored that youth,

133
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:52,238
turned into a monster
in a fit of jealousy.

134
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:54,763
And she attacked the villagers
indiscriminately.

135
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,710
The maiden from the Heavens
and the youth

136
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,543
sealed the monster in this lake
with the power of their love.

137
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,117
And having exhausted their energy,

138
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,745
they rose up to the Heavens together.

139
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:10,345
That's the legend of their love.

140
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:14,392
Sealed the monster in this lake...

141
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,131
Come on, let's go back.
Or you'll catch cold.

142
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,738
Mom!

143
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,540
You're such a baby.

144
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,975
Say, Usagi?

145
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:31,411
If you find somebody you love...

146
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,605
What?

147
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:34,981
If you find somebody you love,

148
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:38,348
bring him home, and introduce him
to your dad and me, okay?

149
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,948
Okay, I will.

150
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,849
Someday, I will.

151
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,222
I'll introduce you to him.

152
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:56,297
A monster sealed in this lake...

153
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:02,174
So, that is the origin of
the unusual energy.

154
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:10,516
Endymion...

155
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,552
So, he has already found out the truth

156
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:14,577
behind the mysterious energy.

157
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,291
O vengeful soul, sealed
within this lake,

158
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,268
I command thee to rise once again!

159
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,813
Come forth, ancient spirit!

160
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,910
Give him back!

161
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:43,071
Give him back!

162
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,815
So, Endymion has awakened
the ancient soul

163
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:51,617
that was sealed within the lake.

164
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:52,879
What will you do now?

165
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:10,961
Give him back!

166
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,487
Give him back!

167
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:28,389
Wait! Where are you going?!
Give him back!

168
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,549
Give him back!

169
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:37,260
Mamoru, we are so close, and yet...

170
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,794
Usagi, is something wrong?

171
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,202
What? Oh, well...

172
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,431
The moon was just so beautiful,
I was lost in admiration.

173
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,479
Yeah, it really is a beautiful moon.

174
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,580
Isn't it?

175
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,378
It's so beautiful, it makes you
want to cry, doesn't it?

176
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,256
Well, I'm going to take another dip
in the hot spring

177
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,791
and gaze at the moon before dinner!

178
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,622
So, excuse me!

179
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,363
I never know what a girl's thinking.

180
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:12,332
Sometimes, Usagi seems like
a total stranger to me.

181
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,927
My...

182
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:19,540
I won't give in! Even if... Even if
Mamoru has forgotten about me...

183
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,940
If I cry, he'd laugh at me.

184
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,978
Give him back!

185
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,147
Huh? Did you say something?

186
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:27,981
Give him back!

187
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,083
Huh? Give what back?
Give him back!

188
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:29,947
Huh? Give what back?

189
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,553
No way! This is not happening to me!

190
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:34,788
Usagi, what is that?!

191
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:36,857
It's a ghost! A beastly monster!

192
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,916
It's a monster! A monster!

193
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,727
Get down!

194
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:41,395
Give him back!
Get down!

195
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:42,589
Give him back!

196
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,061
Run!

197
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,304
The trees!

198
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:51,532
It's poison!

199
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:56,743
That's it! I'm mad! Hey,
this is not funny!

200
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,146
How dare you ruin our family trip?!

201
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,581
What the heck are you thinking?!

202
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,082
Usagi, don't move!

203
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,915
Leave this to your dad!

204
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:09,722
Monster! You leave my family alone!

205
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:15,886
Dad!

206
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:21,932
Dad!

207
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,333
Moon...

208
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:31,072
Dear, are you okay?

209
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,381
Another weird one showed up.

210
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:38,249
Don't be silly! He's on
our side! Probably...

211
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:42,253
I will not allow you to harm
innocent people!

212
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:46,155
Give him back!

213
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,599
Dear, hang in there.

214
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,233
Ouch. My back...
Dear, hang in there.

215
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,001
Ouch. My back...

216
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,370
Tuxedo Mask, I wish I could help you,

217
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,167
but I can't transform here.

218
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,466
Run while you can!

219
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,708
Tuxedo Mask!

220
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,177
Hold it right there!

221
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,187
Sailor Venus!

222
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,288
Sailor Jupiter!

223
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,689
Sailor Mars!

224
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,020
Sailor Mercury!

225
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,394
Here we are!

226
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:23,664
Wow! The sailor warriors
of love and justice!

227
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:26,200
That's my line, damn it!

228
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,531
Give him back!

229
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,632
Bubble

230
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,542
Spray!

231
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:42,879
Everyone, now's our chance!
The inn is that way!

232
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:46,053
Okay, stick together!

233
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,044
Everyone, be careful.

234
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,815
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

235
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,823
Here, here! This way!

236
00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:37,871
How dare you frighten
innocent tourists,

237
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,705
and ruin Usagi's family's quality time?!
It's unforgivable!

238
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,039
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

239
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,481
Tuxedo Mask, you protected Usagi.

240
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,152
I knew you were a good person.

241
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,551
I love you.

242
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,151
Sailor Moon!

243
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:02,555
Crescent Beam!

244
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,226
Supreme

245
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,396
Thunder!

246
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,510
We did it!

247
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,354
Crescent Beam didn't work...

248
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:33,382
All right, then!

249
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:43,499
Moon Tiara Action!

250
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,204
This time...

251
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,441
No way! That's cheap!
This monster's not fair!

252
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,655
No, it's not a monster!

253
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:06,183
It's an evil phantom born of old,
fanatical jealousy!

254
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,196
She is right.

255
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:14,267
Sailor warriors, I am responsible for
awakening this ancient monster.

256
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,502
You girls, back off!

257
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,805
Sorry, but a phantom falls
in my domain!

258
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:19,106
Begone, Evil Spirit

259
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:19,840
Begone, Evil Spirit

260
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,043
Begone, Evil Spirit
Exorcise and cleanse with the
power of my purifying flame!

261
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:26,947
Begone, Evil Spirit
Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin,
Retsu, Zai, Zen!

262
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:27,538
Begone, Evil Spirit

263
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,848
Begone, evil spirit!

264
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,317
Fire

265
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,524
Soul!

266
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,933
Amazing!

267
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,268
Now, Sailor Moon!

268
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,202
Oops! I almost forgot.

269
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:03,306
Moon Healing Escalation!

270
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,186
Refresh!

271
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,913
Finally, she's been freed from
her ancient jealousy,

272
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:34,881
and she's rising up to the Heavens.

273
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,542
It's so beautiful!

274
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,054
Tuxedo Mask!

275
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,389
I would say that what you did
was unnecessary,

276
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,493
but I will yield this time. Good-bye.

277
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,154
Oh, wait!

278
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,653
Tuxedo Mask...

279
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:28,593
Endymion. He is a strange man.

280
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,205
Usagi!

281
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:32,472
Hey!

282
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:33,840
Usagi!
Hey!

283
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,207
Usagi!
Usagi!

284
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,367
Usagi!

285
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,978
Usagi, where are you?!

286
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,613
Answer me!

287
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,681
Sis!

288
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,050
Did she get eaten after all?

289
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,987
I should have just lent her my game.

290
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:47,921
Then lend it to me.

291
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,189
Sis!

292
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:50,390
Dad! Mom!

293
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,024
Usagi!
Dad! Mom!

294
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:51,820
Usagi!

295
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,489
You made us worry!

296
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:55,395
Just like the wind, yeah

297
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:56,630
I'm sorry.
Just like the wind, yeah

298
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,930
I'm sorry.
Spread out both hands, wow, wow

299
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,534
Dad risked his life trying to
protect us. Sweet Mom.
Spread out both hands, wow, wow

300
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:02,702
The sassy but adorable Shingo...
Spread out both hands, wow, wow

301
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:02,936
The sassy but adorable Shingo...
So, it's all right, all right

302
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,404
In the end, it's so nice
to have a family.
So, it's all right, all right

303
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:05,272
In the end, it's so nice
to have a family.
Toss your worries to the wind,
wow, wow

304
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:07,774
Wow, it feels so good!
Toss your worries to the wind,
wow, wow

305
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:09,543
What a nice view!
Toss your worries to the wind,
wow, wow

306
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:09,770
Toss your worries to the wind,
wow, wow

307
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,680
The magic of smiling

308
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,548
Tuxedo Mask...

309
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:15,448
Tuxedo Mask...
I cast it upon you

310
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,384
I cast it upon you

311
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:17,784
I'll give you a mystery that only I have

312
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:22,355
Usagi, don't give up. You'll
have more chances.
I'll give you a mystery that only I have

313
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,690
Mako...
I'll give you a mystery that only I have

314
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,190
I'll give you a mystery that only I have

315
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,293
I'm okay, because I've got great
friends like you guys!

316
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,562
I'm okay, because I've got great
friends like you guys!
I can feel it

317
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:29,429
By the way, how did you guys
get way out here?
I can feel it

318
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:32,198
By the way, how did you guys
get way out here?
The next world

319
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:32,866
By the way, how did you guys
get way out here?

320
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:33,667
Luna told us.

321
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,235
Luna told us.
I have faith

322
00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:36,603
And...
I have faith

323
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,003
We're not going to let you
I have faith

324
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,672
We're not going to let you
My dream will come true someday

325
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,707
have all the fun by yourself!
My dream will come true someday

326
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:41,107
have all the fun by yourself!

327
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,043
I can't breathe! Stop it!
Just fall in love

328
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:43,543
I can't breathe! Stop it!
Let your heart sing, wow, wow

329
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:48,571
Let your heart sing, wow, wow

330
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,817
So, it's all right, all right

331
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:56,050
Take a deep breath, wow, wow

332
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:02,757
I won't let it end as just a dream
