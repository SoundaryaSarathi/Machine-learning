00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,370
Where did he go?

2
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,714
Behind you, Butta!

3
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:23,703
What!?

4
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:28,720
Yo.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,553
H- how did you get behind me!?

6
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:37,729
Behind me, who prides himself on
being the fastest in the universe!

7
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,357
Then maybe you're second-fastest
in the universe, ain't you?

8
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,402
<i>H</i>- <i>how can this be?</i>

9
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:50,742
<i>Not only did he repel my Crusher Ball,</i>
<i>he managed to slip behind Butta!</i>

10
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:53,370
<i>lt's as if l'm having a bad dream.</i>

11
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,352
Who are you!?

12
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,719
I am a Saiyan, who was raised
on Earth... I guess.

13
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,691
Don't be ridiculous!

14
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,694
How can a Saiyan have
that kind of speed!?

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:14,032
How should I know? It must be
from my having trained so hard.

16
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,701
Still, you can't win on speed alone!

17
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,192
Not if all you're doing is running away!

18
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,908
Once you've worn yourself out running away,
you'll lose those sharp reflexes,

19
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,206
and then you'll die!

20
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,545
Go ahead, dodge me!

21
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,727
C- can you see that?

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,058
Not at all.

23
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,074
Dammit!

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,575
How can members of
the Ginyu Special Corps

25
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,067
let that runt make fools of them!?

26
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:13,291
It's all you can do to just evade me!

27
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,693
I could defeat you right now!

28
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,024
We'll see about that.

29
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,372
What do you think you're doing!?

30
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,040
What about you?
Where were you looking!?

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,708
What!?

32
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,369
Why you...

33
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:40,719
Hold on. This is no time
to be fighting each other.

34
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,721
R- right.

35
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,383
Shall I show you then?

36
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,394
How there's more to me
than just speed?

37
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:50,884
--What!?
--What!?

38
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:29,189
I hope you understand now.
Give up this senseless fight.

39
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:37,375
This guy, and the one before him,
are both still alive.

40
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,711
Hurry up and take the two of them
and get off this planet.

41
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:45,383
D- don't be a fool! Kakarrot,
finish them! Finish them off!

42
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,118
These two are all beat up.

43
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,951
There's no need to
kill them for no reason!

44
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:59,557
H- how can this be? We're the
Ginyu Special Corps, you know!

45
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,070
W- we're a super elite fighting force,

46
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,009
comprised of the five best
warriors in all the universe!

47
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,001
How can we be beaten by
such a low-level fighter!?

48
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,849
This is a nightmare!

49
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,946
I'm going to be done in,
and there's nothing I can do!

50
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,351
He's running away!

51
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,362
There's no helping some people, huh?

52
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,023
He just left his friends behind.

53
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,373
Sorry, guys, there ain't any <i>Senzu</i> left.

54
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,533
Hey...

55
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,534
A- are you really Goku?

56
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,577
Yeah. I've just been through
some incredible training is all.

57
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,548
Vegeta!

58
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:26,684
How could you!? I told you there
was no need to finish them off!

59
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:29,517
Those guys couldn't even move.

60
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:35,516
It utterly sickens me with how
lenient you always are!

61
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,465
Why did you let that
other one get away?

62
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,196
With your strength now,
you could have easily disposed of him!

63
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:52,710
It appears that you were unable to
fully become a Super Saiyan after all.

64
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,380
Super Saiyan?

65
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,049
You seem to be proud with how
overwhelmingly strong you've become,

66
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:00,652
but even so, there's no way
you can beat Freeza.

67
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,950
Not unless you make yourself
immortal or something.

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,660
You have no idea how
terrible Freeza is!

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,663
I hate to sound like
I'm blowing my own horn,

70
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,332
but I think I've become
a lot stronger.

71
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,336
Even so, you say that there's no way
I can defeat this Freeza guy?

72
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,674
That's right. If you plan on
fighting him, then brace yourself.

73
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:28,680
Freeza's strength goes far beyond
anything you can even imagine.

74
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,683
A- are you sure you're not
exaggerating a little bit?

75
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,687
I mean, you saw Goku's
strength just now, right?

76
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,256
Those guys were powerless
against him!

77
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:42,360
Is there anyone who
can beat Goku now?

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,352
In that case, go ahead
and try fighting him.

79
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,301
What's even worse is that by now,

80
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,705
Freeza has probably become
immortally young with the Dragon Balls.

81
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,474
Any way you cut it,
there's no way to beat him now.

82
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:59,375
We can only pray that
we don't run into him.

83
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:05,650
I don't think he's made his wish yet.

84
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,986
W- what? How can you tell!?

85
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:13,324
If the Dragon Balls here are the same
as the Dragon Balls on Earth,

86
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:16,661
then when Shen Long appears,
the sky is supposed to get dark, right?

87
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,891
But up to now, the sky
has remained bright.

88
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:30,341
I don't think it's happened yet.

89
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,344
S- Shen Long? What is that?

90
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:36,347
W- when you get the Dragon Balls together,
does something come out?

91
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:41,686
T- that's it! I've got it! He doesn't
know what the password is!

92
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:45,690
He must think that just gathering all seven
Dragon Balls together will grant him his wish.

93
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,649
A password? You need that too?

94
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:54,365
There's still a chance for us
to get our wish granted!

95
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:55,730
Oh, yeah!

96
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:04,308
Hey, Gohan! We still might be able to
bring our dead friends back to life!

97
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,643
Hooray!

98
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:06,978
Isn't that great, Gohan?

99
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:07,645
Yeah!

100
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,044
Yay! We're saved!

101
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,987
Goku, that means we have to get
the Dragon Balls back, huh?

102
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,386
That's right.

103
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,720
<i>S</i>- <i>Shen Long...</i>

104
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,231
To think that these things
can grant any wish...

105
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:46,684
After Freeza-<i>sama</i> gets the
password from the Namekians,

106
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:49,020
he'll be able to obtain eternal life...

107
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,358
Which means the whole universe
will belong to Freeza.

108
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,724
What a wonderful thought.

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,727
What did you say!? Ghurd, ReaCoom,
and Butta were all killed!?

110
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:33,397
Yes, by some unbelievable kind of guy.

111
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:34,398
Don't be ridiculous!

112
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:37,068
We are the Ginyu Special Corps!

113
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,504
With the exception of Freeza-<i>sama</i>,

114
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:43,407
there is no one in the world stronger
than the Ginyu Special Corps!

115
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:47,901
T- that's what I thought too,
but the fact remains...

116
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:00,358
So, having those three battle
ability ratings disappear

117
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:04,695
wasn't a Scouter malfunction, huh?

118
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,031
Should we contact Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

119
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:12,703
You must be joking! How can we
tell him such shameful news!?

120
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,137
It's a good thing
Freeza-<i>sama</i> is not here.

121
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,779
I, Commander Ginyu,
will give you an example

122
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,049
of how a real battle
is to be waged.

123
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,385
I- if you please.

124
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,220
Hide the Dragon Balls!

125
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,057
If anything happens to them,
you will suffer the wrath of Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

126
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,888
Yes, sir!

127
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:49,073
Hey you guys, this isn't
a game! Hurry up!

128
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:50,404
Yes, sir!

129
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,037
There, no one will find them now.

130
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:21,873
All right then, we're off.

131
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:25,707
I'm going to show them meticulously
just how dreadful I can be.

132
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:39,387
Ginyu Special Corps, move out!

133
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:49,400
Sure enough, it doesn't have the
same impact with only two of us.

134
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,404
And I just got done
thinking up a new one, too...

135
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:57,738
I don't know who you are, but you're
going to pay! You're going to pay!

136
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,951
I've had it with Dad.

137
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:10,944
How can he say that Son-<i>kun</i> should
have already landed on Namek?

138
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:17,350
Once Son-<i>kun</i> gets here, <i>l</i> should be
the first one he comes and saves.

139
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:25,025
I've been looking after Son-<i>kun</i>
ever since he was little.

140
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:35,043
It's no use. These are all beyond repair.
I don't care anymore!

141
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,227
I wonder if Son-<i>kun</i> has landed yet.

142
00:12:55,066 --> 00:13:00,338
It would be great if we could get the
Dragon Balls back from them somehow.

143
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:04,075
Vegeta, you know them
pretty well, right?

144
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,010
Is there any way
to go about it?

145
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,680
Weren't you planning
to defeat Freeza?

146
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,684
I'd like to if possible,
but first, we have to bring everyone

147
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,517
who you killed on Earth
back to life.

148
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:23,361
Come to think of it, Kaio-<i>sama</i> told me
not to fight Freeza, no matter what.

149
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:26,030
Even if you get such a worthless
wish granted, it won't do any good

150
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,701
if Freeza just comes along and wipes out
all of Earth soon after, will it?

151
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,372
Instead, let me wish myself
immortally young.

152
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,906
You've got to be kidding!

153
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:40,866
Letting you do that is no different
from letting Freeza do so, is it!?

154
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:49,720
There are two battle powers
headed this way!

155
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,381
So, he's gracing us
with his presence?

156
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:02,059
You let Jheese get away, and now
he's returning with Commander Ginyu.

157
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:07,705
This time, no matter
how strong you may be,

158
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:10,007
you're going to have one tough
opponent to handle.

159
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:13,841
Him, huh? This one is going
to be trouble all right, Goku.

160
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,015
Wait a minute, where's Freeza?

161
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:20,284
Now that he's got
the Dragon Balls from Ginyu,

162
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:22,686
he should be at his spaceship.

163
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:25,621
Looks like he ain't there any more.

164
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:46,377
I can feel a strong <i>Ki</i>
way off in this direction.

165
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:50,381
That's probably Freeza.

166
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,716
B- but that direction is...

167
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:56,379
Oh no! That's where
Grand Elder-<i>san</i> is!

168
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,323
Grand Elder?

169
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:03,160
I get it! Freeza was unable
to get his wish granted,

170
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,663
so now he's headed off to ask
a Namekian directly about it!

171
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:09,667
What? You mean there's still
some surviving Namekians?

172
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,337
That's probably the one who
created the Dragon Balls here.

173
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:17,007
Yeah, that would be Grand Elder-<i>san</i>.

174
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,343
T- this is bad!

175
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:22,680
Once he finds out how
to get his wish granted,

176
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,850
he's certain to kill
Grand Elder-<i>san</i> and the others!

177
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,342
And if Grand Elder-<i>san</i> dies...

178
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:41,031
Once I pass away, the Dragon
Balls will also disappear.

179
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,200
He doesn't know that if
Grand Elder-<i>san</i> dies,

180
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,370
the Dragon Balls will be lost too!

181
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,531
W- what?

182
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,609
They're here!

183
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,007
You certainly made a mockery
of us earlier, huh?

184
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:27,171
Now the Commander is here to personally
make you suffer the consequences!

185
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,017
How about it, Goku? Do you have
a chance of winning this time, too?

186
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:35,019
I won't know until I try.

187
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,854
This guy sure appears to have an
impressive level of strength, after all.

188
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:45,689
I see, so this is him, huh?

189
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:50,367
His battle power reads about 5000.

190
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:54,038
That's right, only 5000.
Strange, isn't it?

191
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,029
You idiot!

192
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:01,979
You were made to look like fools because
you only relied on the Scouter's rating.

193
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:06,850
No doubt he just raised his battle
power dramatically for just a moment.

194
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,653
That's the type he is.

195
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:15,326
In my estimation, I'd say he has an
actual battle power of around 60,000.

196
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:21,332
60,000? But he's a Saiyan! I've never
heard of a Saiyan with a 60,000 rating.

197
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,069
It's not unheard of. He was probably
born an extremely gifted warrior,

198
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,339
some kind of mutant,
just like we were.

199
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,074
This is shaping up to be a fight
more interesting than any

200
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,676
I've experienced before.

201
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,579
I didn't think the time
would ever come when Ginyu-<i>sama</i>

202
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,683
would have to display his true power.

203
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:45,356
I'll keep them busy. You guys use
the Dragon Radar to find the Dragon Balls.

204
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:49,360
They're probably still
near their spaceship.

205
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,696
If I'm able to defeat these guys,
I'll join you shortly.

206
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,033
Don't sound so discouraging!
Make sure you beat them!

207
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,368
Right.

208
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:01,639
Okay, let's go! We have to hurry,
before Grand Elder-<i>san</i> gets killed.

209
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,641
He may already have been...

210
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:05,643
At any rate, hurry!

211
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:08,979
Vegeta, you take care
of the other one.

212
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,914
Now that you've recovered
from being near death,

213
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:13,651
your power should be much greater.

214
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,320
He's no longer an
unbeatable opponent, right?

215
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,988
You knew about that, huh?

216
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,990
Really?

217
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,327
All right, get going!
And be careful!

218
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:23,994
We're off!

219
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,552
Good luck, Goku!

220
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,333
They're getting away!

221
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,335
Let them go. They're small fry.

222
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:34,004
Damn it, let there still be time!

223
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,564
Hang in there, Grand Elder-<i>san</i>.

224
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:56,694
All right, we're up, too.

225
00:18:56,694 --> 00:18:58,252
Guess we've got no choice.

226
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,378
See you later, Kakarrot!

227
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:29,727
Vegeta!

228
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,395
Your guard is down!

229
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,064
<i>Vegeta's ambitions are frightful.</i>

230
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:39,934
<i>And now, a direct battle</i>
<i>between Goku and Ginyu begins.</i>
