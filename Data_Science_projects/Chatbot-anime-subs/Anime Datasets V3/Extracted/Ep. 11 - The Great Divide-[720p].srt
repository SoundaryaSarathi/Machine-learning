1
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,950
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,825
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,936
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:10,230
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:15,436
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:23,838
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,001
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:31,168
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,010
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,218
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,957
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:02,568
Um... aren't you forgetting the tarp?

15
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,712
Right... got it.

16
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:08,081
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent.

17
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:10,262
You know, so we don't get rained on.

18
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:14,590
Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.

19
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,443
Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.

20
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,907
But what if it does rain?

21
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:21,952
But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.

22
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,489
You're infuriating!

23
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,974
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood...

24
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,215
...because that kindling's looking pretty sorry.

25
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:32,745
Well if you don't like my firewood... have it!

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,674
Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job... urg!

27
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,003
Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...

28
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:42,255
Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?

29
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,289
Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!

30
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:51,937
Oh yeah? Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the... Tents!

31
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:57,226
Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will.

32
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,172
Why don't you just switch jobs?

33
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,534
- Sounds good.
- Whatever.

34
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:08,431
You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.

35
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,034
Come on Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.

36
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:33,071
Here it is, guys, The Great Divide.

37
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,045
Wow! I could just stare at it forever.

38
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,819
Okay. I've seen enough.

39
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:43,191
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.

40
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:47,104
Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.

41
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:50,332
Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!

42
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,586
Ooooo... canyon guide. Sounds informative.

43
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:57,015
Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender.

44
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:00,161
And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help.

45
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,578
And he's takin' my tribe across next!

46
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,121
Calm down, we know you're next.

47
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:08,106
You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee.

48
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:13,162
My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!

49
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:14,710
You're a refugee.

50
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,588
Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.

51
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:20,801
Is that your tribe?

52
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:22,466
It most certainly is not.

53
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,994
That's the Zhang tribe.
A bunch of low-life thieves.

54
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:29,746
They've been the enemies of my tribe for hundred years.

55
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,793
Hey Zhangs! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even think of stealing it!

56
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:39,761
Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their campsite?

57
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,876
Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.

58
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,323
I didn't know the canyon Guide took reservations.

59
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:50,191
Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang!

60
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:55,569
So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,529
Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,823
Um... one of them I think.

63
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:14,248
I was here first! My party's on their way!

64
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,100
I can't guide people who aren't here.

65
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:21,233
Guess you guys'll have to make the trip tomorrow.

66
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:23,872
Wait! Here they come!

67
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,835
You're not seriously going to cave into these spoiled Gan Jins!

68
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:37,276
I mean, we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.

69
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,208
I... uh... well...

70
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,812
We've got old people who are weary from traveling.

71
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,622
Sick people get priority over old people.

72
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:49,429
Maybe you Zhang's wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.

73
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:54,116
If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

74
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:58,489
I could smell your stink a mile away.

75
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:56,749
Well Aang, ready to put your peace...

76
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,489
...making skills to the test?

77
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,798
I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing.

78
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:04,621
These people have been feuding for hundred years.

79
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:09,826
Everyone, listen up! This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance,...

80
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:15,522
...I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.

81
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:19,265
Uh... you could share the earthbender and travel together?

82
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,285
Absolutely not!

83
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,913
We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves.

84
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:27,505
We wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway!

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,283
I am not pompous!

86
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,855
Alright! Here's the deal!

87
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,972
We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across.

88
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,259
Does that seem fair?

89
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,434
Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.

90
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,921
And this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.

91
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,162
Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?

92
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:59,567
To tell the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,930
He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.

94
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:07,087
His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?

95
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:09,741
Okay, now comes the bad news.

96
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:16,382
No food allowed in the canyon. It attracts dangerous predators.

97
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,004
No food! This is ridiculous.

98
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:27,271
Aww, you babies can go a day without food. Would you rather be hungry... or dead?

99
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,849
Now, we're headin' down in ten minutes.

100
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:35,980
All food better be in your gut, or in the garbage!

101
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,852
Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.

102
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:49,192
See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!

103
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,147
Nice bending!

104
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:09,297
The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information.

105
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:13,685
Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed.

106
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:19,389
Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by Earth Spirits...

107
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:28,335
...who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice.

108
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:42,423
Guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,422
Okay... everyone stand clear of the wall.

110
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,909
Why'd you do that?

111
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:58,118
These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they?

112
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:04,122
I gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now.

113
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:10,644
We gotta help him!

114
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,305
Okay... now you gotta help me!

115
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:38,074
What was that?

116
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:43,297
Canyon crawler. Oh, ugh! And there's sure to be more.

117
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,833
Your arms... they're broken.

118
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:49,988
Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words...

119
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,435
...we're trapped in this canyon.

120
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:03,635
I thought the whole point of ditching our food...

121
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:06,913
...was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers...

122
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:12,230
It's the Zhangs! They took food down here, even after the guide told them not to!

123
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,128
What! If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day,...

124
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:18,204
...it's you pampered Gan Jins!

125
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:21,814
I hope you're happy. We're stuck in the canyon with no way out.

126
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:24,322
Why don't you thank yourself, food hider!

127
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,568
Look. Sticking together is the only way to...

128
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:29,563
I'm not walkin' another step with the likes of them.

129
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:32,718
Now, there's something we can agree on.

130
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,941
Any ideas?

131
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,064
No bending. We need to get out of this canyon.

132
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,655
I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!

133
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:46,107
See? We're going to become part of the food chain because of you!

134
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,565
Sure. Unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!

135
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,416
Gladly!

136
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,809
Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along,...

137
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:57,652
...but I guess that's not going to happen.

138
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:02,297
We should split up. Gan Jins on this side... and Zhangs on that side.

139
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:06,627
We'll travel in two separate lines.

140
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,173
Sokka, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.

141
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:20,705
See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much.

142
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,099
So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?

143
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,337
What for? It's the dry season.

144
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:42,738
Exactly!

145
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,698
Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.

146
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,979
Finally, someone gets it.

147
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,814
You really think it'll rain?

148
00:10:56,905 --> 00:11:02,678
No, but you can never be too careful, right?

149
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,636
Would you care for some bread, Katara?

150
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,952
So it was you guys who had food!

151
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:27,187
Oh come now. You really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food?

152
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:32,427
Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?

153
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:38,512
Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.

154
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,787
So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?

155
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:51,948
You seem like a smart girl, Katara. I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.

156
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,846
The patriarch of our tribe,...

157
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:02,928
...Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty,...

158
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:12,198
...transporting our sacred orb from the Great Eastern Gate to the Great Western Gate.

159
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:19,299
Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting.

160
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:23,569
It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual...

161
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,696
...but as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang!

162
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:34,316
A vermin, named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy.

163
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:41,604
That coward, Wei Jin, knocked Jin Wei to the ground and stole our sacred orb.

164
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:50,532
Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.

165
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:54,224
Care for some meat?

166
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:56,220
Would I!?

167
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:57,800
I know what you must be thinking.

168
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:02,364
We're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.

169
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:06,471
The Gan Jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in...

170
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:11,143
...and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.

171
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:17,660
Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years...

172
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:23,307
Our forefather, Wei Jin, was leaving the western gate of our village...

173
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:25,812
...when he saw a figure in the distance.

174
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:31,228
It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground.

175
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:36,757
Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,...

176
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:41,320
...a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual.

177
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,459
Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds,...

178
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,768
...but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important,...

179
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:49,602
...and asked him to take it back to his tribe.

180
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,946
Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could,...

181
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,458
...but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory...

182
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,803
...he was arrested!

183
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,485
Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed,...

184
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,849
...they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.

185
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,542
We Zhang's will never forget that injustice.

186
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:20,950
That's just terrible. You gonna finish that?

187
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,201
Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires,...

188
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:28,515
...telling stories and laughing. It's okay, Momo,...

189
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,394
...we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!

190
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,881
Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.

191
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:46,107
It's lonely, isn't it? Being impartial.

192
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:50,215
I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.

193
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:53,167
Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.

194
00:14:53,263 --> 00:15:00,214
I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.

195
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:10,003
All clear! We're almost to the other side.

196
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,368
Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?

197
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:26,122
I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins.

198
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,188
They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.

199
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,669
What are you talking about?

200
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,885
Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about?

201
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:34,887
We Jin didn't steal the orb,...

202
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:38,680
...he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.

203
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,219
Not punished enough if you ask me!

204
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,729
Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help.

205
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,423
Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.

206
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,699
Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat,...

207
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,257
...and then go our separate ways,...

208
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:02,957
...but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.

209
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:07,231
Maybe the Zhang can climb the walls with their long, disgusting fingernails.

210
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,264
Oh, sorry! I forgot that to the Gan Jin,...

211
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,411
...unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!

212
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:15,936
Why you dirty thief!

213
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,709
You pompous fool!

214
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,449
Guys! focus! How many times do I have to say it?

215
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,570
Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!

216
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:29,854
Perhaps the Avatar is right.

217
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:33,560
Yes, perhaps he is.

218
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:37,007
Harsh words will never solve our problems...

219
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:39,544
...action will!

220
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,627
To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!

221
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:56,636
You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad!

222
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:25,445
Is that... food? Everyone smuggled food down here!? Unbelievable!

223
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:29,598
You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!?

224
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:34,134
You are all... awful!

225
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:46,812
So hungry... is that... egg custard in that tart?

226
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,943
Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers!

227
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,869
We barely survived one!

228
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,188
They're coming back for me! They've had a taste, and they're coming back for me!

229
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:09,879
Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.

230
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:15,156
Me too. I only took their side because they fed me.

231
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:20,216
Everybody! Watch me! Do what I do!

232
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:50,611
Now, follow me! We're riding out of this hole!

233
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,715
Everyone! Get off!

234
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,628
We made it!

235
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,578
I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.

236
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:32,136
And I never knew you Zhang's were so reliable in a pinch.

237
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:36,160
Perhaps we're not so different after all.

238
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,686
Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei!

239
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:48,356
You tyrants unjustly imprisoned We Jin for twenty long years!

240
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:54,113
Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!

241
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,985
Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.

242
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,532
No! I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old.

243
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:06,788
I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about...

244
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:09,833
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.

245
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:14,060
First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers,...

246
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:18,858
...twins in fact and they were eight and most importantly,...

247
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:24,450
...they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend... that was the ball.

248
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,496
And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts.

249
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:31,476
Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.

250
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,299
Win Jei didn't steal the ball,...

251
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:36,328
...he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal.

252
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:41,146
But he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box,...

253
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:45,936
...not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.

254
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:50,609
There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game.

255
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:53,524
You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?

256
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:55,695
Nope, just a regular ball.

257
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,728
What about our tribe's redemption ritual?

258
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:00,317
That's what the game was called, Redemption.

259
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:03,068
As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other,...

260
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:07,357
...everyone would yell, "redemption!"

261
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,251
Don't get me wrong,...

262
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:12,653
...Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true,...

263
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:17,250
...but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field.

264
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:20,551
I suppose it's time we forget the past...

265
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:23,801
...and look to the future.

266
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:34,673
Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me?

267
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:37,220
I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.

268
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:41,690
Well, you know, I try.

269
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:47,696
Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe!

270
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,925
I'm goin' too! I'm sick of this place!

271
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:54,361
That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.

272
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,832
You could call it luck. Or, you could call it... lying!

273
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,680
What!?

274
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,426
I made the whole thing up.

275
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:04,391
You did not! That is so wrong.

276
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:09,963
Now where's that custard tart? I'm starving!
