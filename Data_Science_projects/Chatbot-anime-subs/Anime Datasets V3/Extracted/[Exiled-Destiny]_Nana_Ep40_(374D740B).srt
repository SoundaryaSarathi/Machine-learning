1
00:00:01,828 --> 00:00:05,958
In those hectic days when
we barely had time to sleep,

2
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:12,128
I had not realized the flaw in my plan.

3
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,198
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

4
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:24,078
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

5
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:30,918
Baby I'm standing alone

6
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:33,718
An unforgettable rainy day

7
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,728
Chasing after your shadow

8
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,598
And it's over, it's like sand now

9
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,898
I sigh every night

10
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:44,938
I scream like a child and cried

11
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:47,668
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

12
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:51,728
Please, please God, forgive my sins

13
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,468
I don't need to hide no more

14
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,418
Flowing toward the turquoise light

15
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:01,448
Just keep going on

16
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:03,048
You've got the chance now

17
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:04,258
You've got the power

18
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:06,758
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

19
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,388
I show you my life now

20
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,828
I show you my love now

21
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:13,058
I show you my everything yeah yeah

22
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:15,298
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

23
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:18,098
Don't ever change so be yourself

24
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:19,538
I'll show you my strength now

25
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,908
I'll show you my love now

26
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:24,178
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

27
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:28,198
Baby don't be afraid

28
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,848
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

29
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:34,548
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

30
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:37,318
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

31
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:40,218
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

32
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,438
So, what do you wanna do
when we get there?

33
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,168
We've gotta try out some
real Italian cuisine first.

34
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,478
Hey listen. I looked up some stores.

35
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:03,878
Hey, isn't he from Trapnest?!

36
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:05,178
- Huh? Who?
- Ren?

37
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,048
No, the long-haired one.

38
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:07,218
Really? Where?

39
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,338
So where's Ren?

40
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,448
I'm sick of eating bread
for breakfast every day.

41
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:15,718
I want some miso soup.

42
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:18,458
Oh, I found this great Japanese restaurant.

43
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:19,358
Wanna go there tonight?

44
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,568
I want some of Nana's salty miso soup!

45
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:23,758
Ren, keep your voice down.

46
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:28,258
Ren, you're better off forgetting
about women like that.

47
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,398
"Women like that"?

48
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,828
While we're on the subject,
I'll be blunt with you.

49
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:34,108
I believe Nana is the type of girl
she's rumored to be

50
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:36,478
and you're really being fooled by her.

51
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,978
If she loved you,

52
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,678
she'd be more careful about
the salt content in her cooking...

53
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,588
Take, let me go back to
Japan earlier too.

54
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,088
That's not fair just Takumi got to go.

55
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:48,418
No, you still have your photo shoot.
Besides, he had his reasons.

56
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:50,788
What? Takumi's returning early?

57
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:53,128
He's already left. Yesterday.

58
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:56,128
What's with that?!
Why didn't he say anything about it?!

59
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,028
He should've arrived in Japan by now.

60
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:00,228
He's so cold...

61
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,938
Mom, I'm off to check in at the hotel.

62
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:07,568
If Mr. Ichinose's coming to see us
tomorrow anyway,

63
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,078
he should've stayed over.

64
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:12,478
But he'll be arriving pretty late,

65
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:13,808
so he didn't wanna inconvenience anyone.

66
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:18,278
He shouldn't be so formal.
He's gonna be family.

67
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:20,118
They're seeing each other for
the first time in half a month.

68
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,278
Of course they want some time alone.

69
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,188
Oh, I guess you're right.

70
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:27,318
I'm sure looking forward to tomorrow.

71
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:30,698
Talking with him over the phone,
Takumi seems like a really nice person.

72
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,168
Huh? When did you talk to him?

73
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,668
I answered the phone when
he called from overseas.

74
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,708
Dad is prejudiced when it comes
to celebrities

75
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,568
saying they're as bad as the yakuza

76
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,408
but even he was praising Takumi
on his manners.

77
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:44,838
Really?

78
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,768
But he is like a yakuza though.

79
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,518
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.

80
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,548
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.
Is that so?

81
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:48,618
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.

82
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:48,818
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.
If he actually was a gangster,
he'd take over the world.

83
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,718
If he actually was a gangster,
he'd take over the world.

84
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,388
He's so cutthroat.

85
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,888
Then God must've given him
musical talent

86
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,828
to keep him on the right path in life.

87
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:04,798
The world of entertainment
seems glamorous,

88
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:06,458
but I'm sure it's pretty difficult.

89
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:10,498
It will be your job to create a home
where he can relax.

90
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,678
So stop slacking off and do your best.

91
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,178
Mhm.

92
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:17,838
By the way, how's Nana doing?
Have you been keeping in touch?

93
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:22,178
No. I hear that Nana broke
her cell phone.

94
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:25,218
So I haven't been able
to call or email her.

95
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,018
And she hasn't called me.

96
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:30,518
I see. That's a bit worrisome, isn't it?

97
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,898
Yeah. But from what my other friends
are telling me,

98
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,868
she seems to be in extremely
high spirits and working hard.

99
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,128
Extremely?

100
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,628
That's my Nana!

101
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,338
She's a tough girl!

102
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:48,838
I was so frantic to give Hachi the chance
to see me out there singing.

103
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,968
It never occurred to me to ask
how she was doing.

104
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:58,118
About her child, or about Takumi...

105
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:59,948
Honestly speaking,
I didn't want to know.

106
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,978
Although that was just me being jealous.

107
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:08,518
You haven't even touched your breakfast.
Are you feeling sick?

108
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:09,898
No...

109
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,668
Hey, Mari. I wonder if Takumi
met up with Stella.

110
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:16,238
Huh? I-I don't know.

111
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:21,338
But we've been so busy,
I doubt he had time to sleep around.

112
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,578
He raced through his schedule
for his fiancée, after all.

113
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,148
That's awful.

114
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:26,968
Huh?

115
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:30,738
Well, that might be okay for his fiancée,

116
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:33,948
but Stella has been Takumi's lover
for a lot longer!

117
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:36,428
Ah, is that so?

118
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,088
She might've even been secretly dreaming
of marrying Takumi some day.

119
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,388
I feel sorry for Stella.

120
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:49,998
SUBJECT: IT'S ME, SHIN

121
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,568
You sure are amazing, Reira.

122
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:54,698
Huh?

123
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:58,108
To be able to see things from
so many different perspectives like that.

124
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,908
I was only thinking of the feelings
of Takumi's fiancée.

125
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,618
Someone who can sing songs

126
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,608
that captivate the general public sure
is different.

127
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,988
You overestimate me, Mari.

128
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:15,558
It's just a matter of whose feelings
I can empathize with more.

129
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:19,788
I'm a selfish person
who only thinks of herself.

130
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:23,098
I have no idea how
Stella really feels at all.

131
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:28,678
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA?
ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST
IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M
RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP
(WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE
MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.

132
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:33,348
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA?
ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST
IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M
RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP
(WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE
MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.
How are you, Reira? Are you getting
enough rest in London?

133
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,448
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA?
ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST
IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M
RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP
(WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE
MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.

134
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:40,228
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA?
ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST
IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M
RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP
(WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE
MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.
Right now, I'm recording at a training camp
deep in the mountains up north.

135
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,328
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA?
ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST
IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M
RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP
(WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE
MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.

136
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:41,388
THE RECORDING IS COMING ALONG
WELL, BUT WE'RE FORCED TO RUN
IN THE MORNING AND DO THE
CLEANING. WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
(YOU SHOULD SEE YASU IN
HIS SWEAT SUIT.)

137
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,558
THE RECORDING IS COMING ALONG
WELL, BUT WE'RE FORCED TO RUN

(YOU SHOULD SEE YASU IN

The recording is coming along well,

138
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:47,428
THE RECORDING IS COMING ALONG
WELL, BUT WE'RE FORCED TO RUN
IN THE MORNING AND DO THE
CLEANING. WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
(YOU SHOULD SEE YASU IN

but we're forced to run in the morning
and do the cleaning.

139
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:47,868
THE RECORDING IS COMING ALONG
WELL, BUT WE'RE FORCED TO RUN
IN THE MORNING AND DO THE
CLEANING. WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

140
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,368
THE RECORDING IS COMING ALONG

(YOU SHOULD SEE YASU IN
HIS SWEAT SUIT.)
What's that all about?

141
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:50,538
BUT IN THESE FIVE DAYS, PERHAPS
BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTHY
LIFESTYLE, I THINK I'VE GROWN
A LITTLE TALLER. MAYBE I'M
JUST IMAGINING IT.

142
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:55,138
BUT IN THESE FIVE DAYS, PERHAPS
BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTHY
LIFESTYLE, I THINK I'VE GROWN
A LITTLE TALLER. MAYBE I'M
JUST IMAGINING IT.
But in these five days,
perhaps because of this healthy lifestyle,

143
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:55,808
BUT IN THESE FIVE DAYS, PERHAPS
BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTHY
LIFESTYLE, I THINK I'VE GROWN
A LITTLE TALLER. MAYBE I'M
JUST IMAGINING IT.

144
00:06:55,808 --> 00:07:00,038
BUT IN THESE FIVE DAYS, PERHAPS
BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTHY
LIFESTYLE, I THINK I'VE GROWN
A LITTLE TALLER. MAYBE I'M
JUST IMAGINING IT.
I think I've grown a little taller.
Maybe I'm just imagining it.

145
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:03,998
It's salty!

146
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:05,508
Huh?

147
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,438
You're the one who said
you wanted miso soup!

148
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,978
Stop complaining and eat it!

149
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,718
Why is everything you cook
always so salty?

150
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,788
Misato should've come along
to this camp.

151
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,188
Then she could've cooked for us.

152
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,558
No, we couldn't do that.

153
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:26,428
She should quit school and
become our manager.

154
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,428
- Great idea!
- She's very considerate.

155
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,808
That's true. In any case,
I wanted a cute girl for a manager.

156
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:35,078
Yasu!

157
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:35,848
Are you not satisfied with me?

158
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:37,248
GINPEl MOROBOSHI (28)
MANAGER
Are you not satisfied with me?

159
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,168
- Not satisfied at all.
- Not satisfied at all.

160
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,178
What was that?!

161
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:46,718
Ginpei! You're a man, so talk like one!

162
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,448
And we don't need two baldies!

163
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,528
Who are you to talk?!
You're a girl, so talk like one!

164
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:56,488
And my head's not bald,
it's just shaved!

165
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:59,028
Well, I'm not naturally bald either...

166
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,028
Oh! Smells good in here.

167
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,998
Ah, Matsuo! If you haven't eaten,
would you care to join us?

168
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,108
- I'll pass.
- Eat it.

169
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:11,078
I've decided to eat with the staff
when it's Nana's turn to cook.

170
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:14,208
That's why your wife left you, Matsuo.

171
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:18,258
Anyway, Mr. Kawano will
be arriving soon,

172
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,948
so we're gonna skip practice and
have a meeting instead.

173
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,518
Come to the studio's conference room
when you're done eating.

174
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,918
Man, it's cold! What's with this?!

175
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,888
This is crazy. It's still September.

176
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:30,728
What happened to global warming?

177
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,228
What's global warming?

178
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,528
Read the newspaper.

179
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,068
THESE FACILITIES BELONG TO GAIA
AND THE EQUIPMENT IS ALL
SPECTACULAR, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING BUT FOREST AND LAKES
AROUND US, WHICH MAKES
LIFE INCONVENIENT.

180
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:37,638

THESE FACILITIES BELONG TO GAIA
AND THE EQUIPMENT IS ALL
SPECTACULAR, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING BUT FOREST AND LAKES
AROUND US, WHICH MAKES
LIFE INCONVENIENT.

184
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:42,048
BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE PRESS
HASN'T COME AFTER US, SO IT'S
A LOT MORE PEACEFUL THAN
BEING IN TOKYO.

185
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,218
BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE PRESS
HASN'T COME AFTER US, SO IT'S
A LOT MORE PEACEFUL THAN
BEING IN TOKYO.
But at least for now,
the press hasn't come after us,

186
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,618
BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE PRESS
HASN'T COME AFTER US, SO IT'S
A LOT MORE PEACEFUL THAN
BEING IN TOKYO.
so it's a lot more peaceful than
being in Tokyo.

187
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:52,358
Above all, I appreciate the clean air
and seeing the sky full of stars at night.

188
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:53,358
ABOVE ALL, I APPRECIATE THE
CLEAN AIR AND SEEING THE SKY
FULL OF STARS AT NIGHT.
FOR SOME REASON, WHENEVER I
SEE SOMETHING THAT SPARKLES,
I'M REMINDED OF YOU, REIRA.
Above all, I appreciate the clean air

189
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,358

FULL OF STARS AT NIGHT.
FOR SOME REASON, WHENEVER I
SEE SOMETHING THAT SPARKLES,
I'M REMINDED OF YOU, REIRA.

190
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,588
ABOVE ALL, I APPRECIATE THE
CLEAN AIR AND SEEING THE SKY
FULL OF STARS AT NIGHT.
FOR SOME REASON, WHENEVER I
SEE SOMETHING THAT SPARKLES,
I'M REMINDED OF YOU, REIRA.
For some reason,
whenever I see something that sparkles,

191
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:00,058
ABOVE ALL, I APPRECIATE THE
CLEAN AIR AND SEEING THE SKY
FULL OF STARS AT NIGHT.
FOR SOME REASON, WHENEVER I
SEE SOMETHING THAT SPARKLES,
I'M REMINDED OF YOU, REIRA.
I'm reminded of you, Reira.
I wonder why.

192
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:01,228
I WONDER WHY.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I'm reminded of you, Reira.
I wonder why.

193
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:02,098
I WONDER WHY.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

194
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:03,228
I WONDER WHY.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I really don't know.

195
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,428
Guerrilla live performances?

196
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:09,088
Yeah. Five locations in Tokyo,
starting on the tenth of next month.

197
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:12,808
Shinjuku, Yoyogi, Ikebukuro,
Ueno, and Shibuya.

198
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:16,738
We'll be setting up a special stage
in spots with lots of pedestrian traffic.

199
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:18,638
Yay! Live performances!

200
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:21,148
But won't we get in trouble
with the police?

201
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:24,218
No. Of course we've obtained permits
for the locations.

202
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,258
We're just not announcing to the public

203
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,658
that we'll be having these
live performances.

204
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,788
I'm sure you're sick of dealing
with the cops, right, leader?

205
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:34,998
So, our audience is
the street pedestrians.

206
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:38,228
But we'll have
twenty part-time paid applauders.

207
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:39,928
We don't need your hired applauders!

208
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,008
Oh no, you must have applauders.

209
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,598
Japanese crowds are
so hard to get fired up.

210
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,008
You stop talking!

211
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,438
Just think of them as barkers for
when a new store opens.

212
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,108
It's just a way to draw customers.

213
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:50,968
Oh...

214
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:54,208
Oh my! So you'll obediently listen
to what Yasu says.

215
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:55,888
You aren't actually with him, are you?

216
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,058
SORE LOSER
You aren't actually with him, are you?

217
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:58,578
I'll kill you, shaved-head!

218
00:09:58,718 --> 00:10:00,488
Oh, bring it on!

219
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:02,318
- Wow, that's amazing, Ginpei!
- S-Sorry...

220
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,388
That's okay, as long as you understand.

221
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:04,958
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU MAY
NOT KNOW BEING OVERSEAS, REIRA,
BUT THE COVERAGE ON THE
MAGAZINES HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
AND NOW EVEN YASU'S BEING
TARGETED.

222
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,268
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU MAY
NOT KNOW BEING OVERSEAS, REIRA,
BUT THE COVERAGE ON THE
MAGAZINES HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
AND NOW EVEN YASU'S BEING
TARGETED.
Come to think of it,
you may not know being overseas, Reira,

223
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:12,598
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU MAY
NOT KNOW BEING OVERSEAS, REIRA,
BUT THE COVERAGE ON THE
MAGAZINES HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
AND NOW EVEN YASU'S BEING
TARGETED.
but the coverage on the magazines
have gotten worse

224
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:15,008
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU MAY
NOT KNOW BEING OVERSEAS, REIRA,
BUT THE COVERAGE ON THE
MAGAZINES HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
AND NOW EVEN YASU'S BEING
TARGETED.
and now even Yasu's being targeted.

225
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:16,038
JUST LIKE WITH NANA, THEY'RE
WRITING GARBAGE ABOUT
WHATEVER THEY CAN.
HIS PAST AND EVERYTHING.

226
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,938
JUST LIKE WITH NANA, THEY'RE
WRITING GARBAGE ABOUT
WHATEVER THEY CAN.
HIS PAST AND EVERYTHING.
Just like with Nana, they're writing garbage
about whatever they can.

227
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:20,548
JUST LIKE WITH NANA, THEY'RE
WRITING GARBAGE ABOUT
WHATEVER THEY CAN.
HIS PAST AND EVERYTHING.
His past and everything.

228
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:21,078
THEY'VE MADE HIM OUT TO BE
THE CHARACTER HE LOOKS LIKE.
HE'S GOT QUITE A PRESENCE NOW.
(ALTHOUGH HE WEARS
A SWEAT SUIT.)

229
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,578
THEY'VE MADE HIM OUT TO BE
THE CHARACTER HE LOOKS LIKE.
HE'S GOT QUITE A PRESENCE NOW.
(ALTHOUGH HE WEARS
A SWEAT SUIT.)
They've made him out to be
the character he looks like.

230
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,418
THEY'VE MADE HIM OUT TO BE
THE CHARACTER HE LOOKS LIKE.
HE'S GOT QUITE A PRESENCE NOW.
(ALTHOUGH HE WEARS
A SWEAT SUIT.)
He's got quite a presence now.

231
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:27,418
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.

232
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,788
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.
I don't know if it's because
they haven't found out

233
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:31,918
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.

234
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:34,288
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.
or they're purposely hiding it,

235
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,358
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.
but nothing's been written about
the fact that you and he were lovers.

236
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:37,728
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR
THEY'RE PURPOSELY HIDING IT, BUT
NOTHING'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND HE
WERE LOVERS. SO DON'T WORRY.
So don't worry.

237
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:50,738
Hey Ren, has Naoki told you
about Yasu?

238
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:52,328
What's that baldy up to?

239
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,178
I guess Search published
an exposé about him.

240
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:57,708
Naoki says there are rumors about it
all over the internet.

241
00:10:58,178 --> 00:10:59,308
An exposé about what?

242
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,408
All kinds of things.

243
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:02,548
Apparently he hit a Search reporter
to protect his vocalist,

244
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:05,488
and was taken in for questioning
by the police.

245
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,828
Then, other magazines started saying

246
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:13,318
that Nana and Yasu are actually dating
and things like that.

247
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,968
That's just not possible. It's all lies.

248
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:23,978
In addition, Search also wrote
that Yasu's not a real lawyer

249
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,238
since he doesn't have a license
to practice law.

250
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:26,238
Isn't that horrible?

251
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,668
That is horrible.

252
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,768
Um, Reira...

253
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:30,808
Oh, thank you.

254
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:34,708
You know, I've been concerned
about those rumors too.

255
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:39,748
Is it possible Mr. Takagi never served
as a law apprentice for a firm?

256
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,588
What's a law apprentice?

257
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,488
It would be equivalent to
a medical intern.

258
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:47,668
After passing the bar exam,

259
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,868
you must serve as a law apprentice
for a year and a half

260
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:51,598
before you can become a real lawyer.

261
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,928
You really know a lot, Mari!

262
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,368
More like you don't know anything.

263
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:56,538
What about you?!

264
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,608
Well, it's not exactly common knowledge.

265
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,538
I'm a law school graduate.

266
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:06,608
That's amazing! You're not just wearing
those glasses for show.

267
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,318
No, there's nothing amazing about it.

268
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:09,448
And these glasses are just for show.

269
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,118
Then what are you doing
being Reira's babysitter?

270
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,688
What do you mean, babysitter?!

271
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,358
You know, like changing your diapers...

272
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,588
She doesn't!

273
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,318
Enough about me.

274
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,288
No.

275
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:25,058
I wanna know more about you.
Are you free tonight?

276
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:28,038
Why do all our members try to
seduce every woman they see?!

277
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,098
Are you Italian?!

278
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:33,568
Anyway, so that's why
Yasu said he was a trainee.

279
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,778
So I guess he's in the midst of
his so-called apprenticeship.

280
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:39,618
But it's been a year and a half
since he graduated,

281
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:40,738
so he could already be a lawyer!

282
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,218
No, once you become an apprentice,

283
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,658
you must go where
you've been assigned.

284
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,888
He would've had no say as to
where he'd be assigned.

285
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,958
If he were devoted to the band,
it would've been difficult.

286
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,968
His mentor probably
saw Mr. Takagi's abilities

287
00:12:56,968 --> 00:13:00,628
and hired him through the office and
had him do only desk work.

288
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,068
Mari, can you come here?!

289
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:03,138
Yes!

290
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:07,208
Mr. Takagi probably couldn't give up
his dreams for the band.

291
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:11,138
The fact that he hit that reporter shows just
how much he cares for his band members.

292
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,018
No matter what the public says,

293
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,608
I think Reira's boyfriend
is a wonderful man.

294
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,378
Don't pay attention to the rumors,
and keep your spirits high.

295
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:19,948
Mari?

296
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:20,988
Yes!

297
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:22,858
Boyfriend?

298
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,788
What does that mean?
Wasn't Yasu's dream to be a lawyer?

299
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:34,628
It's always been secrets and lies.

300
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:38,408
Since the old days,
I never knew what he was thinking.

301
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,708
I have no intention of making
a living on music,

302
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,908
and I don't plan on ever
leaving this town.

303
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,578
So I guess there's nothing
we can do about it.

304
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:51,078
If the band is that important to him,

305
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,718
was that just an excuse to break up
with me?

306
00:13:55,858 --> 00:14:00,418
No, he didn't go that far for
the sake of the band.

307
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:03,088
This may be a problem.

308
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:07,998
I could no longer sacrifice
that much for Nana.

309
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,338
I wonder why.

310
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,678
I still love her
like I always have.

311
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:21,808
Hey, Ren. If I died,
would you die with me?

312
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:29,388
When did I become
such a cold person?

313
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:34,698
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON
IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE.

314
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:39,498
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON
IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE.
Reira. If you said that
you were lonely now,

315
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:43,138
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON
IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE.
I'd fly to London in a heartbeat.
I'd go anywhere.

316
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,178
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON
IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE.

317
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:44,238
IF I COULD WARM YOUR HEART
AND BODY EVEN A LITTLE,
THEN IT WOULD BE WORTH IT.

318
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:48,678
IF I COULD WARM YOUR HEART
AND BODY EVEN A LITTLE,
THEN IT WOULD BE WORTH IT.
If I could warm your heart and body
even a little,

319
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:49,808
IF I COULD WARM YOUR HEART
AND BODY EVEN A LITTLE,
THEN IT WOULD BE WORTH IT.
then it would be worth it.

320
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,148
IF I COULD WARM YOUR HEART
AND BODY EVEN A LITTLE,
THEN IT WOULD BE WORTH IT.

321
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:51,218
THE WAY I SAY THAT, YOU MAY
GET THE WRONG IDEA AND THINK
I'M A KIND PERSON.

322
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:52,748
THE WAY I SAY THAT, YOU MAY
GET THE WRONG IDEA AND THINK
I'M A KIND PERSON.
The way I say that,

323
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:56,218
THE WAY I SAY THAT, YOU MAY
GET THE WRONG IDEA AND THINK
I'M A KIND PERSON.
you may get the wrong idea and
think I'm a kind person.

324
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:56,948
THE WAY I SAY THAT, YOU MAY
GET THE WRONG IDEA AND THINK
I'M A KIND PERSON.

325
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,558
THE TRUTH IS SIMPLY THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THAT
IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOU.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
THOUGH...
SORRY FOR BEING SO SELFISH.
The truth is simply that
I don't have anything right now

326
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:02,088
THE TRUTH IS SIMPLY THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THAT
IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOU.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
THOUGH...
SORRY FOR BEING SO SELFISH.
that is as important to me as you.

327
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:02,858
THE TRUTH IS SIMPLY THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THAT
IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOU.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
THOUGH...
SORRY FOR BEING SO SELFISH.

328
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:08,468
THE TRUTH IS SIMPLY THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THAT
IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS YOU.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
THOUGH...
SORRY FOR BEING SO SELFISH.
I don't know about tomorrow, though...
Sorry for being so selfish.

329
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:18,408
That's different from
being a cold person, Ren.

330
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,638
The longer we live,
the more weight we carry on our shoulders.

331
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,908
And it gets harder to do what
you want...

332
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:32,518
That's why you need someone
to carry that load with you.

333
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,658
Don't you think you and your girlfriend
could do that for each other?

334
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:55,638
Welcome home!
You must be exhausted from work!

335
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,268
I'm really exhausted.

336
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:05,948
Souvenirs!

337
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,418
So many!

338
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:10,358
- Which do you want?
- Just one out of seven?!

339
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:13,858
How about this one!

340
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,688
You've got a great nose.

341
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,598
- You picked the diamond...
- Huh?!

342
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:19,428
earrings. That's a good choice.

343
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,598
- No, I'd rather have this one!
- That's some tea.

344
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,068
- What about this?
- A pearl necklace.

345
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:25,128
Wristwatch.

346
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,098
Shoes.
A handbag. Cashmere scarf.

347
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:31,508
Where's the ring?!

348
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:35,448
Well, that's different from a souvenir.
You already have it.

349
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:37,578
Your left pocket.

350
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:53,928
A magic trick?

351
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,368
It's that tendency to let your guard
down that let's men trick you.

352
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:03,268
I do have a list of priorities
that I cannot change.

353
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,978
First is work.

354
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,108
That makes up for more than
ninety percent of my brain.

355
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,378
Everything else doesn't matter as much.

356
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:16,618
But I'd say my girl comes second.
I need her so I can relax.

357
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,088
I won't be able to care
for you too much,

358
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:20,828
but I won't let you have a hard life.

359
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,328
Okay.

360
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,598
As long as I'm your number one
second priority.

361
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:30,398
I'm sorry but you're number two
in my second priority.

362
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:31,098
Huh?!

363
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,198
Maybe this souvenir would best suit
my number one woman.

364
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:34,898
Shoes?

365
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:36,738
They wouldn't fit you anyway.

366
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:38,008
She must be petite.

367
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:41,778
Sachiko...

368
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:43,488
TRAUMA

369
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:44,758
TRAUMA
Is it you again?

370
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,918
You've already given her a name?
And what a traditional name.

371
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,618
Well, whatever name's fine with me.

372
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,588
Here! Then these are for our lil' Sachiko.

373
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,168
They're so cute! Thank you, Daddy!

374
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,198
So many!

375
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,938
But doesn't that sound awkward?
Sachiko Ichinose.

376
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,208
It's like a tongue twister.

377
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,368
Stop it with that ominous name.

378
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:14,048
You gave her that name!

379
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:16,288
REIRA, THE REASON I BOUGHT
A LAPTOP COMPUTER WAS BECAUSE
I WANTED TO SPEND ALL THE MONEY
I GOT FROM YOU QUICKLY, BUT
I DIDN'T WANNA SPEND IT ONLY
ON MYSELF.

Reira. The reason I bought
a laptop computer was because

I WANTED TO SPEND ALL THE MONEY
I GOT FROM YOU QUICKLY, BUT
I DIDN'T WANNA SPEND IT ONLY
ON MYSELF.

385
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:30,198
I BOUGHT THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR
FOR THE SAME REASON, BUT I COULD
NEVER BECOME ROMANTIC ENOUGH
TO SING WHERE MY VOICE WOULD
NOT REACH YOU.

386
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:32,738
I BOUGHT THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR
FOR THE SAME REASON, BUT I COULD

I bought the acoustic guitar

I BOUGHT THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR
FOR THE SAME REASON, BUT I COULD

but I could never become
romantic enough to sing

NEVER BECOME ROMANTIC ENOUGH
TO SING WHERE MY VOICE WOULD

390
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:37,708
SO FROM NOW ON I'LL SEND YOU
AN EMAIL FROM TIME TO TIME LIKE
I'M DOING NOW. IF YOU FEEL UP

Goodbye for now.

GOODBYE FOR NOW.

00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:48,788
GOODBYE FOR NOW.

so I'm sure the sky will
be full of stars tonight.

401
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:00,018
Oh, Mr. Illegal Lawyer.

402
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,658
What are you working on,
hiding in the dark?

403
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,358
Same goes for you.

404
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,508
You shouldn't be walking outside alone
in the middle of the night.

405
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:09,368
It's dangerous.

406
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,668
It's all because that raccoon told us
about the guerrilla live performances.

407
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,038
I got too excited to sleep.

408
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,768
Sleep while you have the chance.

409
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,378
Once we get back to Tokyo,
we'll be really busy promoting our music.

410
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:25,448
Wanna sleep with me?

411
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,918
Sure. Why not.

412
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,748
That was a joke.

413
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,058
That wasn't funny.

414
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:39,568
Because you're in love with me.

415
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,128
You're right.

416
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,978
Now that I've laid all my cards
on the table,

417
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,268
there's no point in denying it.

418
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,408
Was I too obvious?

419
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:55,738
You're damn right, baldy.
What in the world are you up to?

420
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:58,458
I'm not really up to anything,

421
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,388
so you stop worrying and
just focus on singing.

422
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,218
But, Yasu.

423
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:09,118
Ever since Ren and I broke up
back home two and a half years ago,

424
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:15,628
I've felt closer to you than to Ren.

425
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:19,178
Even when I'm with Ren,
I'm still feeling a bit lonely.

426
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:22,768
He and I can no longer
become one like we used to.

427
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:30,578
Why is that?
I still love Ren like I always have.

428
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,378
Mai, Yui, Sumire, Akane.

429
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:38,958
Names using only
a single kanji character are best!

430
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,528
And it looks prettier with the last name,

431
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,998
which uses three kanji characters.
Like Takumi.

432
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:44,498
What's wrong with Sachiko?

433
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:46,438
No way!
Come on and help me think!

434
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,008
But I'm already kind of attached to it.

435
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:50,638
It's decided, the name's Sachiko!

436
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,178
Hey, Hachi.
With stardust spread all across,

437
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,938
the night sky looks awfully
bright tonight too.

438
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:02,988
Even now, when I see
something sparkling,

439
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,978
it reminds me of Ren.

440
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:12,118
I reached into the sky

441
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:18,628
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

442
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:24,008
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

443
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:29,998
Like colorful balloons

444
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,118
I'm alone

445
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:35,848
My hand had no place to go

446
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:42,478
And gently you took it

447
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:43,658
Starless night

448
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:47,858
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

449
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:53,658
I want to feel your warmth

450
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,538
Tears are falling down

451
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:59,638
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

452
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:06,138
Of your hand holding mine
