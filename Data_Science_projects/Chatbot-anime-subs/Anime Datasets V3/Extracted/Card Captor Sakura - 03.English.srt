1
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:06,238
“Hey, hey.”

2
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:08,009
This fish over here is cute.

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,075
Sakura-chan looks like she is having fun.

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:13,216
Yes she does.

5
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:17,020
Sakura-chan loves athletic meets
and field trips.

6
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:19,889
I’m Sakura Kinomoto.

7
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:22,190
A fourth grader at Tomoeda Elementary.

8
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,889
Today is a field trip day.

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:28,896
We’re going to various places in groups.

10
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,200
Our group is at the aquarium.

11
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,432
I love the aquarium.

12
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:37,010
The penguin show is about to start.

13
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:38,308
OK.

14
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,337
“Sakura-chan, let’s go.”

15
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,475
Let’s hurry everybody.

16
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,450
She’s fast.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,582
“Penguins, penguins, penguins.”

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,858
Sakura-chan really does seem to be
enjoying herself.

19
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:58,031
[Sakura’s first date]

20
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:04,534
That’s amazing.

21
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,439
How cool.

22
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:14,511
I want to swim with the penguins too.

23
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,443
Sakura is good at swimming right?

24
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:19,248
Here.

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,279
How cute.

26
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,375
My leg.

27
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,914
No! Penguin-san!

28
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:56,786
Penguin-san! Penguin-san! Penguin-san!

29
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,749
Sakura-chan.

30
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,255
We have to save the penguin.

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,159
Penguin-san! Penguin-san! Penguin-san!

32
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,556
What’s going on?

33
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:09,960
A penguin is drowning in the water.

34
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,629
But I can’t save it.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,457
That guy…

36
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,728
Brother?

37
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,123
Sakura-chan, You drowned?

38
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,827
That’s not it Kero-chan

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,897
You weren’t listening.

40
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:46,873
Oh, sorry.

41
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,797
I was able to come out of your room
for the first time

42
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,074
In a while with everybody gone

43
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:51,705
So I just can’t calm down.

44
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,677
I see, so that’s what happened?

45
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,980
I guess there is no way you would drown.

46
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:00,242
Your athletic ability is
the only good thing you have.

47
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,488
What do you mean by only?

48
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,081
I won’t give you any hot cakes.

49
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:06,654
Ah, Sakura-sama.

50
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,401
But it being a penguin that drowned

51
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,362
Makes it even stranger.

52
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:19,932
The adults were saying that

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,465
It might because
the drain in the pool was open.

54
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:26,041
But that doesn’t quite seem right.

55
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,013
Here.

56
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:34,912
It was that kind of accident.

57
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,220
It was more…

58
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:40,557
more like something was doing it.

59
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,793
Like when you saw the Clow Card?

60
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:49,499
I’m home.

61
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,262
Oh, no!

62
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:56,335
Kero-chan, room. Go to my room.

63
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,670
Hide.

64
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:00,845
Come home.

65
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:01,906
Yeah.

66
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,745
Hey big brother,
you were at the aquarium today right?

67
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:12,520
It’s written right here.

68
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,295
Hey

69
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,235
Why were you at the penguin show?

70
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:25,336
What kind of part-time job?

71
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,701
Feeding the penguins.

72
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,300
Eh? How cool.

73
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,368
Not cool.

74
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:31,674
Why not?

75
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:32,737
Just because.

76
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,484
You’re terrible

77
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,010
Eating it without asking.

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,253
Those are the hot cakes
I bought with my allowance.

79
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,218
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry and come in.

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,327
Sorry. Sorry.

81
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:50,829
It took me some time to get my shoes off.

82
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,165
Hello, Sakura-chan.

83
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:56,491
Yu… Yukito-san.

84
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,068
Hello.

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,132
That looks good.

86
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,231
Sakura, you’re a good cook right?

87
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,076
That’s not true.

88
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,242
Yeah. That really isn’t true.

89
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,379
Umm…

90
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:14,351
Yes?

91
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:16,019
Would you like

92
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,448
Some hot cakes?

93
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,154
Is it OK?

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,549
Didn’t you buy it with your allowance?

95
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,126
It’s fine.

96
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,495
I’ll bring it to my brother’s room later.

97
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,996
Thank you.

98
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:50,786
I can’t knock.

99
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,454
What should I do?

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,188
Thank you, Sakura-chan.

101
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,164
No problem.

102
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:06,402
What Sakura? You were there?

103
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,466
Umm.

104
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,000
How did you know
I was there when I didn’t knock?

105
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,474
I just got the feeling

106
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,610
You had brought them up.

107
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:20,978
Aquarium. Water.

108
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:30,922
Sakura.

109
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:32,430
Hey Sakura.

110
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,160
What’s going on?

111
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,158
I’m so happy.

112
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,171
Ah, Yukito-san.

113
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,267
Hey!

114
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,270
What are you going to do so spaced out?

115
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:48,075
What happened to your duty as Card Captor?

116
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,215
Yukito-san is more important than the cards.

117
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:55,052
Hey, hey.
Don’t you care of the penguin drowns again?

118
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,054
I don’t want that.

119
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,051
The poor things.

120
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,157
I thought I would die.

121
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:05,058
But this time might be a little bit bad.

122
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,430
If was obviously in the water that
the trainer woman

123
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,837
And the penguin were about the drown.

124
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:13,100
Yeah.

125
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:17,009
Did you see
who it was that tried to drown them?

126
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:21,105
No, not at all.
The water was just swirling around.

127
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:25,316
That was probably water,
the Watery card.

128
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,215
So that’s it.

129
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,889
So we just need to catch it
and return it to a card.

130
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,689
It won’t be so easy.

131
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,394
You can’t see Watery
when she is in the water.

132
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,029
Even if
you manage to draw her out of the water…

133
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:42,959
If she splits up all over the place
you can’t finish her off.

134
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:45,161
Something as shapeless

135
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:46,732
As water is tough to catch.

136
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:50,069
Watery is a high level magic

137
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,671
Amongst the Clow Cards.

138
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,603
The four basic elements

139
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,710
“Earth, water, fire, and wind “

140
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,572
Those are very difficult to use.

141
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:01,378
Above that,
Watery is an attack magic card.

142
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,383
She is very aggressive.

143
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,785
The cards you have are

144
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,128
“Windy, Fly, and Shadow.”

145
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,986
That won’t be able to do it.

146
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,362
Even if

147
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,293
You use another high level magic like Windy

148
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,069
You can’t beat Watery.

149
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,370
Windy is just too kind.

150
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:23,170
Windy.

151
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:24,636
Shadow.

152
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:26,803
And then Fly.

153
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:30,105
The cards I have are just these three.

154
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:01,345
How do you catch water?

155
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,812
I have to hurry and catch the Watery card.

156
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,243
You seem down, Sakura-chan.

157
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,817
No, not at all.

158
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:18,220
Ah?

159
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:23,158
It seems like the promised great trial for

160
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,403
An ally of justice has come.

161
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,712
It may be the work of a Clow Card after all.

162
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:40,284
But Kero-chan said it’s impossible now.

163
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,853
Ah…

164
00:09:56,903 --> 00:09:57,528
Tomoyo-chan.

165
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:58,563
Yes?

166
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,872
Thanks for listening to me.

167
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,740
That smile suits you the best.

168
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:08,004
Oh yeah, I meant to give this to you.

169
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:11,940
It’s a new product made by
my mother’s company.

170
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,248
This one is yours.

171
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,954
And here is one for Kero-chan too.

172
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,090
Is it OK to borrow this?

173
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:23,089
Of course.

174
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,619
My mom asked us to tell her

175
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,625
How useful it is.

176
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,891
Thanks for worrying about me.

177
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,167
Well, until tomorrow.

178
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:35,539
Yeah, see you later.

179
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,307
But

180
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,776
If I combine all three cards, can’t I…

181
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:46,984
You can’t. You can’t.

182
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,582
No mater how you use the ones you have,
it would be impossible.

183
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,657
But the Watery card is

184
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,784
in there.

185
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,431
It’s a little frustrating.

186
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:16,439
I’m sorry…

187
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,344
Are you OK, Sakura-chan?

188
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:21,644
Yu… Yukito-san.

189
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,055
It’s dangerous to daydream like that.

190
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:25,591
Yes, I’m sorry.

191
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:28,258
Thanks for yesterday.

192
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:29,820
The hot cakes were delicious.

193
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,522
Oh, not at all.

194
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:34,423
You’re going home late.
Coming back from club?

195
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:35,233
Ah?

196
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:37,636
You’re in the cheerleading club, right?

197
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:38,626
Yes.

198
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,164
I heard from Touya.

199
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,597
He said he was hit by your baton
while you were practicing at home.

200
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,708
Brother…

201
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:47,772
Why did he tell Yukito-san.

202
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:49,614
In thanks for the hot cakes

203
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,074
Do you want to go eat something good?

204
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:52,951
What? Is it OK?

205
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,649
I found a restaurant with some good stuff.

206
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,050
I’ll meet you tomorrow at one o’clock
at the penguin park.

207
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,084
OK!

208
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:04,085
All right!

209
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,531
Yukito-san.

210
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,067
What, again?

211
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,047
Hello, this is Daidouji.

212
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,517
I can’t come to the phone right now.

213
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,952
Please leave a message at the beep.

214
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,316
Tomoyo-chan, this is Sakura.

215
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:37,388
Tomorow I have a date with Yukito-san.

216
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,422
We’re meeting at one o’clock.

217
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,696
I’m so happy.

218
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,828
I’ll call you again when you are home.

219
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:06,558
Could it be that I got the time wrong?

220
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,024
No, you’re fifteen minutes early.

221
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:11,589
Eh? Then you…

222
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,391
I mustn’t keep you waiting

223
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:15,866
So I came early.

224
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,075
Huh? This is…

225
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,709
Oh yeah,
you came here not too long ago.

226
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:30,980
We’re going in here?

227
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:32,176
Yes.

228
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,078
I see.

229
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,382
It was this aquarium.

230
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,818
This is perfect

231
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,056
I can check

232
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,949
If the Clow Card really is in here.

233
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:45,226
I will catch Sakura’s first date on video.

234
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:50,736
Let’s go.

235
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:52,937
Yes.

236
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,567
What a big fish.

237
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,806
Really.

238
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,877
I wonder if you can eat it.

239
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:00,870
Wouldn’t it be impossible alone?

240
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:02,807
I don’t think so.

241
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,181
They seem so natural.

242
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,812
What? Don’t modern kids even hold hands?

243
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,816
Mr. Stuffed Animal.

244
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,257
Kid, if you mess with me, you’ll regret it.

245
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,193
They’ve moved off.

246
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,932
See ya.

247
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:33,111
This is so cool!

248
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,580
I didn’t get to see this part last time.

249
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,050
Ah, because of the accident
at the penguin show?

250
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,083
So you probably
didn’t know there was a tea room?

251
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,989
While looking at the pretty fish.

252
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:46,549
Touya.

253
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:49,890
Brother?

254
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:53,523
Did you move from your job
with the penguins?

255
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:57,797
They are taking all the water out of the tank
and changing it.

256
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,203
Then Watery would be…

257
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,405
Good thing you don’t have to work
in the freezer anymore.

258
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,542
The penguin food was kept in the freezer

259
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:07,970
He said it was really cold.

260
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:10,577
It’s the same thing.

261
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,118
Now they have me making shaved ice.

262
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,585
The strawberry milk here is really good.

263
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,548
Shaved ice?

264
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:21,620
Ice?

265
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,023
Well then, we will have two of those.

266
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,057
Sure, sure.

267
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,931
Don’t you want a large serving?

268
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,091
You have large servings?

269
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:32,036
What? A date along with guardians?

270
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,777
Sakura-chan!

271
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:56,457
Watery?

272
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,191
Sakura, Yuki!

273
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:23,947
Sakura-chan.

274
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,950
Are you OK, Sakura?

275
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:29,758
Sakura-chan.

276
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,457
Tomoyo-chan?

277
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:37,300
Oh yeah, where is Yukito-san?

278
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,332
Hey, are you all right?

279
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:43,998
I thought I would die.

280
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:45,535
Is this after all?

281
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,375
Yeah, the work of a Clow Card.

282
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,777
Watery was in here.

283
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:50,946
Did you see her?

284
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:54,319
Now that you mention it,
why are you two here?

285
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,583
Are you OK, Sakura?

286
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,189
Yes.

287
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,496
I guess that ruined our shaved ice.

288
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
Not at all.

289
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,060
Shaved ice. Shaved ice…

290
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,029
Ice? Oh yeah.

291
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:14,698
Yukito-san!

292
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,098
Thank you so much!

293
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,441
Thanks for your trouble.

294
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:26,383
Ah, thank you.

295
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:35,860
Is it really OK?

296
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:37,618
Leave it to me.

297
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:50,734
In here?

298
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,837
This is where the magic is strongest?

299
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,437
I’m getting off.

300
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:02,415
Hello, this is Daidouji.

301
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:03,549
Is it there?

302
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,787
Exactly, one level underground.

303
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,692
All right, well then hide.

304
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,193
Watery!

305
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:12,024
Come and get me.

306
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,335
Get out of the way, Kero-chan.

307
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,443
Fly.

308
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,657
Windy.

309
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,557
Nice work, Sakura.

310
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,790
If you harden the water, it’s easy to catch.

311
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,730
It’s because I heard from Yukito-san that

312
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,133
The food is kept in a freezer.

313
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,099
Thank you, Tomoyo-chan.

314
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:58,970
I’m glad I could be of help.

315
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:02,104
Well, shouldn’t it be about ready?

316
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,678
Return to your rightful form

317
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:19,214
Clow Card

318
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,328
But that was a good idea.

319
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,934
It was all because of Yukito-san.

320
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:39,301
Yukito-san.

321
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,217
Oh, my. Sakura has turned to ice now too.

322
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,683
All right. She’s with it now too.

323
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,754
Really show it to them next time Sakura.
