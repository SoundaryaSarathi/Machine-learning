1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,466
Who… Who are you?

2
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:28,753
[The Person Sakura Loves the Most]

3
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,390
What do you mean?

4
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:35,528
I know…

5
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,296
the truth.

6
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:40,224
And what will you do?

7
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,167
I know all about it.

8
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:45,537
The other you you’re
not ever aware of…

9
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:52,879
Another Yukito-san…

10
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,714
You… You’re really…

11
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,818
…not human…

12
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:11,458
the times I’m not aware of…

13
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,267
the other me takes over.

14
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:16,361
Everything of my past memory is a lie.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,974
Not really… at least, everything
you remember since we met is real.

16
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:29,605
I’m not really sure what you are.

17
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:34,053
But, as long as we’re together,
that’s fine by me.

18
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:36,417
Thanks.

19
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:41,484
Wow… that was really good…

20
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:42,955
I’m so glad I saw it.

21
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,319
Kinomoto-kun was so cool.

22
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:46,026
Tsukishiro-kun too!

23
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:50,902
The girl who played
Tsukishiro-kun’s sister…  she’s really
Kinomoto-kun’s sister, right?

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,307
Really? She was so cute…

25
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,804
You did a wonderful job.

26
00:01:58,946 --> 00:01:59,970
Th… thank you.

27
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,782
I’ve asked them to lend me the tape.

28
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:08,483
I’ll dub it and make it as my treasure.

29
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,221
T… Tomoyo-chan…

30
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,286
AHH!! KINOMOTO-KUN!

31
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,220
TSUKISHIRO-KUN! YOU WERE SO COOL!!

32
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,326
As usual, your brother and
Tsukishiro-san have gathered a crowd.

33
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,461
So it seems…

34
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,834
Thanks…

35
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:35,615
Ever since he gave
Yue-san his power,

36
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,578
Oniichan has been very tired.
I understand why he did it…

37
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:46,553
Without Yukito-san and Yue-san,
Oniichan would be very lonely…

38
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,121
The movie was very interesting

39
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:50,925
Thank you.

40
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,893
See you later…

41
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:00,367
Oniichan…

42
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,170
It’s ok… I’m just a little tired…

43
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:11,447
Sakura-chan!

44
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,948
Sakura?

45
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,117
You came as well.

46
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:19,250
I know, let’s go have some tea.

47
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:22,220
Ok!

48
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,401
Thanks for waiting.

49
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:31,867
Here.

50
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,036
Thank you very much!

51
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:34,298
Here.

52
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,766
Thank you very much!

53
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:37,806
Take it you…

54
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,544
Thank you very much.

55
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,120
Well, what did you like the movie?

56
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:55,524
Yes!

57
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,055
You were very cute, Sakura-chan.

58
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,763
not really…

59
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,029
The whole class thought
you were wonderful.

60
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,705
Have you toured the fair yet?

61
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:10,441
No, not yet.

62
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,112
How you would you like
to go together then?

63
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,177
Is that ok?

64
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,146
Yes. I’ll be your tour guide then.

65
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:21,751
I’ll be sleeping in the classroom.

66
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,655
You ok?

67
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,317
Just tired, don’t worry.

68
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:30,921
Don’t eat to much, monster.

69
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,025
I don’t eat that much!

70
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,524
Geeze…

71
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,375
I’ll take my leave as well…

72
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:47,642
You’re going too?

73
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:53,617
Yes. I have things to do at home.
I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.

74
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,478
See you then.

75
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:55,547
Take care.

76
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,916
See you, Li-kun.

77
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,085
Do your best, ok?

78
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:08,401
What is it?

79
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:13,096
I… it’s nothing…

80
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,007
Shall we go then?

81
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:17,608
Yes!

82
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,844
(The Milky Way)

83
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,342
The Milky way?

84
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,515
Our class put it together.
Shall we go take a look?

85
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:03,546
Sure!

86
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,088
Hiiiiii! Sakura-chan!!!

87
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,887
Thanks for being in my movie!!

88
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,889
You were the best!!!

89
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,232
What is it? Are you going
through the “Milky Way”?

90
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,061
y… yes.

91
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:23,707
OK!!! 5th graders coming through!!!

92
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,071
Wait a… where’s Touya-kun?

93
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,977
He was tired so he’s sleeping
in the classroom.

94
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:38,456
That’s too bad… 
he’s been so sleepy recently.

95
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,460
Anyway, only 2 at a time…

96
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,795
Sakura-chan and Tsukishiro-kun,

97
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,800
you go first and your friends’ll follow.

98
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,200
Ok, lets go then. Move along.

99
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:52,998
Move along. Ok!

100
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:57,372
Two on their way in!!

101
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:08,054
Wow!! Great! Pretty…

102
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,353
It’s really wonderful.

103
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,223
Eh? Oh, sorry…

104
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:23,594
What do you think?
It’s pretty good isn’t it.

105
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:25,301
Yes.

106
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,305
There’s a really nice
bit just up here…

107
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,807
I want him to know how I really feel.

108
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,006
Yukito-san…

109
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:16,017
What is it?

110
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:23,561
I… Yukito-san…

111
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,806
I… I…

112
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:36,800
I love you Yukito-san!

113
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,053
I love you too, Sakura-chan…

114
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:53,584
but, the person you’ll love most
isn’t me.

115
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,522
You love your father a lot, right?

116
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:00,792
Yes.

117
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,226
And me?

118
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:05,972
I love you…

119
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,668
Those feelings are the same, right?

120
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:14,938
The way you love your father,
and what you feel for me…

121
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,477
are similar, right?

122
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,366
They are…

123
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:42,072
I’m like him very much.

124
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,469
Since you’re so young,
you’re confused about it a bit.

125
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,077
Yes.

126
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:53,945
You knew the whole time?

127
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:59,558
Yes. I was glad you considered me

128
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,891
a part of your family.

129
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:07,763
There’s someone you love, isn’t there?

130
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:10,566
Yes, there is…

131
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,264
It’s Oniichan, right?

132
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,535
Yes, it’s him.

133
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:21,474
I’m not sure what I’d do without him.

134
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,984
Oniichan seems mean sometimes,

135
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,613
but he’s really very nice.

136
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,518
Yes.
He likes to tease me.

137
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:37,995
Yea. But, even though I love him,
I don’t know how he feels…

138
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:41,328
I’m sure he feels the same way!

139
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:46,567
That’s why he gave Yue his power.

140
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:51,110
Anyway, he must love you

141
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,605
at least as much as I do!

142
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,776
Sakura-chan…

143
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:59,646
But, If he’s ever mean to you,
you call me

144
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,412
and I’ll punish him for you, ok?

145
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:08,583
ok… Thank you.

146
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:10,695
I’m sure you’ll find him…

147
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,389
the one you’ll love most.

148
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,868
And I’m sure he’ll love you the most too.

149
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,338
Tell me when you find him, ok?

150
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:26,401
And if he’s ever mean,
I’ll punish him for you, ok?

151
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:31,709
Ok.

152
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:57,039
What’s happened?

153
00:11:58,411 --> 00:11:59,605
I can feel magic…

154
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,776
I wonder
if something’s happened to her…

155
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,114
To Sakura-chan?

156
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,112
You stay here.

157
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:08,084
Li-kun!

158
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,588
As I thought…

159
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,095
Yue-san?

160
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,691
Since my magic’s back,
I can’t be mistaken.

161
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:25,628
It must be Clow.

162
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:27,670
But he’s…

163
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:31,544
Dead.

164
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,446
Did you hear something?

165
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:36,678
Someone’s coming…

166
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,109
I know.

167
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:43,421
RELEASE!

168
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,957
O Card created by Clow,

169
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,166
discard thine old form and be reborn.

170
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:01,030
Under the name of Sakura,
thy new Mistress.

171
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:04,208
Maze! Illusion!

172
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:18,885
Wow! Isn’t this great!

173
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,925
It’s like a planetarium.

174
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,190
Isn’t this different from before?

175
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,430
Maze and Illusion, huh?

176
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,199
Damn, it looks like I’m late.

177
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:38,442
I can do it.

178
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:46,081
The aura’s gotten stronger…

179
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:47,978
Yes.

180
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,387
Where is it coming from?

181
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,521
This way!

182
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:58,397
Wait!

183
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:09,873
Clow-san’s

184
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,109
aura throught here

185
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,278
it’s getting stronger.

186
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,041
There it is!

187
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:31,522
Sakura!

188
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:35,965
Where is she?

189
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:36,926
This way.

190
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,599
He cut through the maze…?

191
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,415
E… Eriol-kun?

192
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,416
Why… Eriol?

193
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,796
It seems you’ve found me.

194
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,039
You’ve transformed
two cards and found me.

195
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,108
You really have gotten stronger.

196
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:25,147
Please wait just

197
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:29,118
a little bit longer,

198
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:30,947
good luck.

199
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,624
The cards…

200
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:46,371
She’s stopped using them…

201
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:47,866
Sakura.

202
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,508
Sakura!

203
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:53,640
Sakura!

204
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,479
Are you ok?

205
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:07,557
What happened?

206
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:10,624
I don’t know…

207
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:16,529
but I remember seeing someone standing

208
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:23,208
inside Clow’s magic circle.
Who was it…?

209
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,123
It’s as you said…

210
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,086
What’s the meaning of all this?

211
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:40,652
Is this really ok?

212
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:42,856
Yes. Thank you.

213
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,706
Is it really ok for you to go without me?

214
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:58,835
Yes. Shao Lan-kun and
Tomoyo-chan are with me.

215
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,881
It’s really ok.

216
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,547
Thank you for today.

217
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,013
Take care, ok?

218
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,183
We will, good bye.

219
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:12,721
Good bye, then.

220
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,003
So it was Clow-san again?

221
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:27,867
You’re not hurt, are you?

222
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:31,000
No, Shao Lan-kun rescued me.

223
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:35,444
I guess we should get
some rest tonight, then.

224
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:37,674
Yes, that’s a good idea.

225
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:41,453
Well, I must leave you here.

226
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,454
I’ll see you tomorrow, then.

227
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,550
I want to thank you too, Shao Lan-kun.

228
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:52,828
Shao Lan-kun?

229
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:54,900
I’ll

230
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:57,268
walk you home!

231
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:00,834
Thank you.

232
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,266
But first?

233
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,103
What?

234
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:08,573
Could we go to the park?

235
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:26,629
You know, today,

236
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,501
I told Yukito-san that I loved him…

237
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,070
Oh? Did you?…

238
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:45,114
But… But he said… 
the one for me wasn’t him…

239
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:56,287
He said “Your feeling for me,
are they like those for your father?”

240
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:58,989
I thought about it…

241
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:05,196
and I realized he was right.

242
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:13,039
But, there’s someone he loves,
really loves,

243
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,838
not like a father,…

244
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:19,183
The person he loves…

245
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:30,391
I love that person too…

246
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,731
and I’m sure that person loves him too.

247
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:39,504
So it’s ok that he doesn’t love me…

248
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:45,404
If Yukito’s with the person he loves,
then it’s ok.

249
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,640
Tomoyo told me that

250
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:52,878
when the person you love is happy,
then you can be happy too.

251
00:19:57,123 --> 00:20:04,723
I think I’d be happy to know
that he was happy.

252
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:13,863
But… it seems that… for some reason…

253
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,738
I can’t help but cry…

254
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:24,209
But I don’t want to cry in front of him.
Because he’d know…

255
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:38,960
No… why am I crying…

256
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,462
I understand what he said but…

257
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:45,434
really… It’s good that he’s happy…

258
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:46,195
I know.

259
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:53,772
I understand.

260
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:04,115
Thank you.

261
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:12,196
Yukito-san said…

262
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:19,970
Someday I’d find someone
I really loved. And… and he’d
love me as much as I loved him.

263
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,007
I’m sure you’ll find him.

264
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,112
It’s ok.

265
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:43,894
You’ll surely find him.

266
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:51,569
Thank you.
