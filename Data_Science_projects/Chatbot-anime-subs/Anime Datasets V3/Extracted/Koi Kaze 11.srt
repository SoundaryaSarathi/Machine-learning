1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,950
Lingering winter

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,950
We celebrated the new year, then January passed and it became February.

18
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,750
The world keeps moving on so fast that I can't believe I left my house only a month and a half ago.

19
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,050
During that time, I tried to concentrate only on my work.

20
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,050
The most popular is probably Italian.

21
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,550
For Chinese food, the turntable...

22
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,250
In reality, work was the only thing I had.

23
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,150
In order not to think of unnecessary things...

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,150
...and live as a wholesome and proper social person.

25
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,650
But...

26
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,850
Hello!

27
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,550
Hi, we've been waiting for you.

28
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,150
I'm sorry I was late.

29
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,650
Not at all.

30
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,850
It wasn't something so easily done.

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,450
Hey.

32
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,450
I'll lend you taxi money, so...

33
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,250
Koshiro-san, it's cold.

34
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,950
But in the end, what I think about at the end of the day is...

35
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,950
Brother, how are you?

36
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,950
Good morning!

37
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,750
Are you eating properly?

38
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,650
Have you been healthy?

39
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,950
I've thought about my feelings, your feelings, and many things since then.

40
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,850
Another day that has nothing to do with me is coming again.

41
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,850
You don't have a true love, do you, Nanoka?

42
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,950
Right?

43
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,650
I...

44
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,950
Hey Nanoka.

45
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,650
What are you worried about?

46
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,350
You haven't been looking too well recently.

47
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,650
Last time you said you'd sleep over, but you suddenly went home.

48
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,550
Something seems wrong.

49
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,650
What is it?

50
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,050
Did something happen?

51
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
Nothing happened.

52
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,550
Don't worry.

53
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,550
You don't have to hide it!

54
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,250
If there's something making you suffer or troubling you,

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
you know you can tell me anything!

56
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,050
If there's anything I can do, I'll help you!

57
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,150
I don't think you'd understand, Futaba-chan.

58
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,050
Probably...

59
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,550
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,450
What's that?

61
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,350
You won't tell me anything, so how am I supposed to understand?

62
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,550
But even if I think about it by myself,

63
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,050
I'm not able to find an answer.

64
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,950
Please take care of me tonight too.

65
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,450
You know...

66
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,950
I don't mind you staying over, but what are you going to do about a change of clothes and stuff?

67
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,950
I'll go home first and get them.

68
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,450
Then why don't you just sleep at your own home?

69
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,550
But your place is closer to the office,

70
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,550
so I'll be able to sleep in more in the morning.

71
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,550
Jeez.

72
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,050
That's why I went to the front of my brother's office a couple of times and..

73
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,750
I also tried going to my brother's house.

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,450
But...

75
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,850
Let's promise.

76
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,350
Today is the last day.

77
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,350
We won't meet again.

78
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,750
I remember my brother's words and

79
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,250
I restrained myself.

80
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,850
Thank you for the food.

81
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,850
You're not going to eat any more?

82
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,350
Your appetite has gone down recently.

83
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,250
Yeah, I'm full.

84
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,550
But brother...

85
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,250
I can't lie about my own feelings.

86
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,650
Brother, I still...

87
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,350
That idiot!

88
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,450
I told him to wake me up at six!

89
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,050
I slept in a weird position, so my whole body aches.

90
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,750
You slept over again?

91
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,250
Poor Koshiro-san.

92
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,250
Are you picking a fight with me?

93
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,750
If you keep on being his constant guest, he won't have any time to bring in girls!

94
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,750
I'm a girl too!

95
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,350
Is that your reason for being his constant guest?

96
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,250
You think?

97
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,750
I wonder why?

98
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,450
What?

99
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,750
Why he suddenly started living on his own.

100
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,550
I'm sure he has his reasons.

101
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,250
Like within his house.

102
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,950
Maybe he...!

103
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,550
Sniffed Nanoka-san's underwear and got disowned!

104
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,550
He's not you.

105
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,250
What kind of facial expression would they make, if I told them that was exactly the reason?

106
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,950
I sniffed her underwear, I thought of her and masturbated.

107
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,750
And in the end I embraced her.

108
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,850
I left my house in order to cut off that part of myself,

109
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,650
but I'm just thinking about her anyway.

110
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,150
What would you think if you found out about this part of me?

111
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,650
Don't frown like that!

112
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,750
I didn't intend to.

113
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,050
Everyone forgets things.

114
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,250
Yeah.

115
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll leave right after I find my pass.

116
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,450
I'm not saying don't come.

117
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,950
I'd be more considerate if you had a girlfriend or something.

118
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,650
Koshiro...

119
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,850
It's not like you're not interested in women, right?

120
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,150
Because I haven't heard any romance rumours.

121
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,950
I was talking with Odagiri today too, but...

122
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,650
Ah, wait a second, I'm going to go buy some cigarettes.

123
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,250
What is she saying?

124
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,150
Hey, isn't that Nanoka-ch--

125
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,750
Ouch!

126
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,850
What's wrong with you?

127
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,250
Let go of me!

128
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,450
What's wrong? What are you thinking?!

129
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,950
My hair got all messed up!

130
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,950
Hey! Why don't you say something?

131
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,450
Why do we have to hide from Nanoka-chan?

132
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,750
She left!

133
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,950
Is it okay? Why do you run away?

134
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,750
Hey, Koshiro? Why are you running away?

135
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,550
Is Nanoka-chan the reason why you left your home, Koshiro?

136
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,850
Then...

137
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,150
Forget it. I guess there are different kinds of household circumstances.

138
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,450
Odagiri was worried about you too.

139
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,750
He was saying maybe you sniffed your sister's underwear.

140
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,650
Or you surprised her while she was asleep.

141
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,250
He says those things so seriously, too.

142
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,550
I didn't do anything!

143
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,850
Before those things happen...

144
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,850
Why are you getting all serious?

145
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,750
I was just kidding!

146
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,350
Come to think of it, you guys weren't very sibling-like, to say...

147
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,550
You guys were spreading an odd atmosphere.

148
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,550
I guess you couldn't leave her alone, since she was so attached to you.

149
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,250
Nanoka-chan is so cute and everything.

150
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,550
Before too, she seemed to think of you more like a prince than a brother.

151
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,250
She made her eyes twinkle.

152
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,250
Did you make a move on her?

153
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,950
You...

154
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,150
What the hell are you thinking?! She's your younger sister!

155
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,550
Without even thinking about the rest of her life!

156
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,150
You bastard!

157
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,650
I didn't!

158
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,250
That's why I left before anything happened!

159
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
What's your problem?

160
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,850
You don't know anything!

161
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,650
Why do I have to take all this from you?

162
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:20,550
I didn't know either, that at first, we were siblings...

163
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,650
That's sick.

164
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,550
It's disgusting.

165
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,050
Are you saying this for real?

166
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,050
Being so old.

167
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,650
Your younger sister... your blood related sister too.

168
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,950
The hell is that?

169
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,950
That's low.

170
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,050
You're a pervert.

171
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,350
That's right. In the end, that's what it is.

172
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,450
I should've already known that long before, but...

173
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,350
But I...

174
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,650
It was the first time I felt this way.

175
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,050
I... still love you, brother.

176
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,050
That's why I want to see you, brother.

177
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Good morning.

178
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,550
Where's Koshiro?

179
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,050
He's not coming since he's not feeling well.

180
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,150
He called in with a voice sounding like he was about to die.

181
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,550
Poor condition, huh?

182
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,950
Do you know something?

183
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,050
Yeah, it's really terrible.

184
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,950
So that's why you didn't stay over last night?

185
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,150
It might not get better.

186
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,450
What? That bad?

187
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,550
That coward.

188
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,050
Unfortunately, I was not able to get a comment from Kanako-san.

189
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,650
So that means it's not for sure yet.

190
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,650
Yes, that is true, but...

191
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,650
So it means she was just looking at a female magazine.

192
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,150
Yes.

193
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,650
Then she isn't really able to give you any comment.

194
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,450
But I believe she could have given a little bit.

195
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,850
A little bit? But if it really is marriage, then at this time of year it's a bit odd.

196
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,750
Not just limiting it to celebrities, don't you think so?

197
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,250
I don't know what to say.

198
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,850
I'm sure you know these kinds of things better than I do.

199
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,550
Concerning the broadcasting of this interview...

200
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,950
Perhaps she's pregnant.

201
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,950
I've heard such rumours, too.

202
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,550
She's recently cancelled being on the drama series, right?

203
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,950
Do we know the reason?

204
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,450
She said she was in poor health condition.

205
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,750
Anyway, it seems like a celebratory occasion.

206
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,650
Yes?

207
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,950
U-umm...

208
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,250
What am I expecting?

209
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,350
Unable to be resolved.

210
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,750
Unable to give up.

211
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,250
Running away from her and running away from work.

212
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,850
Forever with this incomplete emotion.

213
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,950
Putting a pitiful face on.

214
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,250
What am I?

215
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,050
I want to see you too...

216
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,710
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

217
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,740
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

218
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,640
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

219
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,110
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

220
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

221
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,600
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

222
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,180
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

223
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,430
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

224
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,870
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

225
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,670
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

226
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,080
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

227
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,450
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

228
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,950
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

229
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,070
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

230
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:00,860
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

231
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,530
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

232
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,390
I'm sorry I broke the promise.

233
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,680
I was worried if my brother was doing well.

234
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,920
Punishment of fighting spirit!

235
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,080
Brother, how are you doing?

236
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,960
If you have energy, you can do anything!

237
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,890
1, 2, 3, go!
