00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>117,000... Unbelievable!</i>

2
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,446
<i>Even Commander Ginyu's highest</i>
<i>battle rating only reached 120,000.</i>

3
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:41,394
120,000... 130,000...

4
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:55,578
140,000!

5
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:07,755
In all the universe, <i>l</i> should be the one
whose strength is second only to Freeza's!

6
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:19,760
150,000! How can this be!?

7
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:26,607
Stop it!

8
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:45,892
Why you!

9
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,772
180,000!?

10
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:34,779
I- I can't believe it!
This is your true power!?

11
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,149
N- no wonder we didn't
stand a chance against him!

12
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:41,786
How can a Saiyan be so strong?

13
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,555
And just so we're clear,

14
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:48,126
I can momentarily put out
much more power than even this!

15
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,991
What!?

16
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,902
You can't possibly...

17
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,075
You can't possibly be...

18
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:01,224
How awful! I want to get away
from this planet soon!

19
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:14,407
The Dragon Balls can grant any wish...

20
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,772
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>, it's Nail-<i>san</i>!

21
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,366
I know.

22
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:00,892
Why have you returned?

23
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:06,464
Have I not charged you with the task
of assisting the people from Earth?

24
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:08,132
My sincerest apologies.

25
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:13,137
However, it is my duty, above all others,
to defend your life, Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>.

26
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,739
Even so...

27
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:19,077
If you die, Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>,
the Dragon Balls will also disappear.

28
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:23,912
If that happens, then the Earthlings'
wish cannot be granted.

29
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,022
Very well.

30
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:45,103
It's just over there, Kuririn-<i>san</i>.

31
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,537
Okay. Hurry!

32
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,114
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

33
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,048
We're here for the Dragon Radar!

34
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,554
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

35
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,737
Bulma-<i>san</i>! Please come out
from wherever you're hiding!

36
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:39,891
Good grief. And us without
a moment to lose.

37
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:43,428
She's never around when it's
really important, huh?

38
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,521
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, look!

39
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:52,103
Jet-Bike tracks!

40
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:57,442
Where do you suppose Bulma-<i>san</i>
would have gone on a Jet-Bike?

41
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:58,543
You don't suppose

42
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:03,114
she's decided to go off touring Namek
or something at a time like this?

43
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:05,450
Touring?

44
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,518
We'll follow her!

45
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:08,553
We have to get the Radar from her and locate
the Dragon Balls before we run out of time!

46
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,885
We have to get the Radar from her and locate
the Dragon Balls before we run out of time!

47
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,715
Right!

48
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,081
There it is.

49
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,524
Sure enough, it appears that
he finally sniffed this place out.

50
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:49,093
He's almost here.

51
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,428
Dende, come here.

52
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,055
Right.

53
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:23,394
Go to them, Dende.

54
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:27,065
The Earthlings stand in need of you.

55
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:29,400
I've drawn out the power within you,

56
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,403
so you should be able to arrive
in a short amount of time.

57
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:33,404
B- but...

58
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,895
Go now.

59
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:43,241
Very well. Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>,
please don't die on us!

60
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:05,930
I wonder, will I be killed, or will
my time to pass on come first?

61
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:23,520
Y- you can't possibly be a...

62
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,981
...Super Saiyan, can you!?

63
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:33,131
You know, Vegeta said
the same kind of thing earlier.

64
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,801
But I have no idea what
you guys are talking about.

65
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:41,568
A Super Saiyan! A legendary
warrior stronger than any other!

66
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,810
How can this be!?

67
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,814
H- he's a... He's a...

68
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:55,820
...Super Saiyan, the only thing
Freeza-<i>sama</i> is afraid of!?

69
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,158
Sorry, but there ain't any
way that you can beat me.

70
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:03,093
I don't want to fight
a meaningless battle.

71
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:07,430
You guys get off this planet.

72
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:17,775
W- what? Do you really mean that?

73
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:22,113
I really mean it. Especially you.
You're a much fairer warrior than I thought.

74
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:23,781
I don't want to kill you.

75
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,874
You don't want to kill me?

76
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,113
<i>You don't want to fight</i>
<i>meaningless battles?</i>

77
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:45,803
Get off this planet?

78
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,738
A Super Saiyan is supposed to be

79
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:52,810
the strongest warrior in
the universe, who loves to fight.

80
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,479
S- so then,

81
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,812
you're <i>not</i> a Super Saiyan, are you?

82
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:03,821
You have not completely
become a Super Saiyan.

83
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:08,087
I see... You are not a
Super Saiyan after all.

84
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:12,191
Is that right?

85
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:32,208
I see. So that is where
the Namekians are.

86
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:02,072
Oh, very well. I suppose I can
leave such a speck of dust alone.

87
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,556
He is here.

88
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,131
What do you want?

89
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,200
My name is Freeza,

90
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,472
and I have a wish that I would like
to have granted with the Dragon Balls.

91
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:04,141
I have managed to gather
all seven Dragon Balls together,

92
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:07,736
but for whatever reason, I cannot
seem to get my wish granted.

93
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,750
And so I was hoping you could tell me,

94
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,754
how does one get their wish granted?

95
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:22,750
I must ask you to leave. I cannot
tell that to anyone who is evil.

96
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,149
Well, well, you still have
some friends around, do you?

97
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,452
They must have fairly low battle powers.

98
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,888
My Scouter did not pick them
up until just now, after all.

99
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,558
Those guys!

100
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,078
Looks like we're in time.

101
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,413
Yeah.

102
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:20,084
S- stop! Don't do it! You don't
have a chance against him!

103
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:23,918
Maybe we don't have a chance,
but we can still land a punch or two!

104
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:30,094
After all, we're warrior-types
too, just like you are.

105
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:31,686
Warrior-types?

106
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,444
Oh, all three of you have
battle powers of around 10,000.

107
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:50,781
I suppose I should expect as much
from warriors of this planet.

108
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:53,773
As far as I am concerned, however,
you are still like rubbish to me.

109
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,378
What did you call us!?

110
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,725
Stop it! Your deaths
will be meaningless!

111
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:08,064
Nail, you take care
of Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>.

112
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:13,897
My children...

113
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,545
Do you know the password
for the Dragon Balls?

114
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,058
Well?

115
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:21,000
No, I suppose that rubbish
like you would not know.

116
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:25,068
It was silly of me
to have even asked.

117
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,266
I think it would be best
for you to accommodate me.

118
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:53,103
There is no reason why
I should not kill you.

119
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,439
There are two of you here,
are there not?

120
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,109
Either one of you would be acceptable
in answering my request.

121
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:04,648
You can do as you wish. But before
we fight, I will say this much:

122
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,750
The other one, who resides
within this house,

123
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,387
is the Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>
of Planet Namek.

124
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:15,059
The Dragon Balls are the creation
of this Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>.

125
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,063
Listen well, and get this
through that head of yours!

126
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:23,227
If you kill Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>,
the Dragon Balls will also disappear!

127
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,230
Grand Elder?

128
00:17:56,767 --> 00:18:01,772
Now I see. Apparently,
you are telling the truth.

129
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:07,044
He is certainly different
from the other Namekians.

130
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,147
Grand Elder-<i>san</i>, I do not
suppose that you

131
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:14,385
would be of a mind to
tell me, would you?

132
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,720
However,

133
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,922
you would not refuse to tell me
if this gentleman here

134
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,725
were about to be killed,
would you?

135
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:26,730
Nail will not be as easy
to defeat as you may think.

136
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,403
He is the strongest of
the warrior-type Namekians.

137
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,505
You will not be able to do to him

138
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:39,238
as you have the other Namekians
you have killed up to now.

139
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:47,751
It appears you have no intention
of telling me, no matter what, do you?

140
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:52,756
<i>l'm counting on you, Nail.</i>
<i>Buy us as much time as you can.</i>

141
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,246
<i>Understood</i>.

142
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,765
Very well. If you are going
to be as stubborn as this,

143
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:06,429
then I will show you the terror of
the strongest being in the universe.

144
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,391
You are not a Super Saiyan.

145
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:33,387
But you are at least
far stronger than I am.

146
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,898
Such incredible strength!

147
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,143
<i>Freeza's evil grasp closes</i>
<i>around the Grand Elder and Nail.</i>

148
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:50,481
<i>Will they be able to keep the</i>
<i>secret of the Dragon Balls safe?</i>

149
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:55,282
<i>And what will be the outcome of</i>
<i>the fight between Goku and Ginyu?</i>
