Do you mean Ica-sama?</font></font>

97
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,960
. </font>A-order, we Amyin use words such as "Atsuo" with friends</font></font>

98
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,170
. </font>This is just ... it's easier to use for this slipped me</font></font>

... Well, for</font></font>

103

So, in fact, that the fault lies on us, is not it?</font></font>

104
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,570
. </font>Maybe it is better if I did not volunteer that they do not want to</font></font>

105
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,740
. </font>Arzogaoa-san and friends do not like</font></font>

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,570
. </font>Most likely there is something else may have their reasons</font></font>

107
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,910
. </font>Please do not for this Tloha for this</font></font>

108
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,250

109
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,620

Verse ? </font>This proximity to look</font></font>

119
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,750
! </font>I have stumbled</font></font>

120
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,410
Is there a way in order to walking?</font></font>

121
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,250
! </font>No</font></font>

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
             "Tea," "French cuisine"</font></font>

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,210
! </font>What is that ? </font>How can this be written in Japanese! </font>I can not understand anything</font></font>

124
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,720
Kemeto-sama, what do you ask?</font></font>

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,380
. </font>Well, a Japanese meal</font></font>

126
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,510
. </font>So I will ask a Japanese meal as well as</font></font>

127
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,430
. </font>I also</font></font>

128
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,390
. </font>I will ask the Japanese meal also</font></font>

129
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,440
. </font>Thank you for waiting</font></font>

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,730
What is that ?</font></font>

131
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,360
. </font>Japanese meal, I heard that "the Maine Cup" is the main food</font></font>

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,820
... This is as of ways Amyin</font></font>

133
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,200
! </font>Even Amyin do not eat "Cobb Min" always</font></font>

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,490
Do you pop your tongue I did not it?</font></font>

135
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,580
So, do you go back on this?</font></font>

136
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,910
-Hassana, certainly will Kemeto-sama</font></font>

137
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,580
Huh?</font></font>

138
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,880
Is this food ... the smell is unusual?</font></font>

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,630
Do not you know what is the "Maine Cup"?</font></font>

140
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,300
Maine Cup?</font></font>

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,130
Well, do you know what is Alramen?</font></font>

142
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,550
. </font>Well, I've heard some stories</font></font>

143
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,890
! </font>S-stories, huh? </font>Well this kind of immediate Alramen</font></font>

144
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,980
. </font>In other words, it's easy to issue</font></font>

145
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,440
. </font>Tadhavin hot water and you can eat</font></font>

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,270
Just by adding hot water!?</font></font>

147
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,020
E. That's all what you do to cook?</font></font>

148
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,440
. </font>Rico-sama this is unlikely</font></font>

149
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,490
! </font>As on the box a lot of words written by</font></font>

150
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,950
. </font>Here are some of the old architecture in my house for decoration</font></font>

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,090
. </font>P-any case, we eat such a thing often</font></font>

152
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,510
! </font>Ah</font></font>

153
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,760
. </font>It really eaters, there are also other ingredients</font></font>

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,260
This may be Robien, but what those things yellow and brown?</font></font>

155
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,640
! </font>Imagine! </font>Only by adding water it takes this form</font></font>

156
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,020
How does this work ?</font></font>

157
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,480

182
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,190
! </font>The entire dish is uniquely refreshing</font></font>

183
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,810
! </font>I can make this a regular order</font></font>

184
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,110
. </font>This is certainly an unprecedented experience</font></font>

185
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:50,160
. </font>I will never forget this day, never, or even flavors known to</font></font>

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,530
Unbelievably ! </font>Thank you, Arzogaoa-san</font></font>

192
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:37,000
Not at all, just my thinking in this small meeting makes me enjoying</font></font>

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,670
! </font>Well, here it is here Kemeto-sama transferred Nkhbkm</font></font>

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,860
Is there something?</font></font>

196
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,570

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,540
. </font>In many ways, is not known to us</font></font>

200
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,000
. </font>My idea of â€‹â€‹myself to see when your eyes are something completely different</font></font>

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,170
. </font>I am happy because I congratulate you so, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

202
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,800
Kemeto-sama, do you want to dance?</font></font>

203
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,060
. </font>Er, do not uh, I do not dance not dance by</font></font>

204

205
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,440
. </font>Oh really ? </font>Perhaps you are ignorant, please forgive me</font></font>

206
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,320
. </font>No, h .... Well, let me try</font></font>

207
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,610

Are you okay, Arzogaoa-san?</font></font>

212
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,790
. </font>A-order</font></font>

213
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,260
. </font>You do not have to put a great effort in which</font></font>

214
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,680
. </font>I can not really dance, for this you will not know if it slipped never</font></font>

215
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,350
. </font>For this matter, I may be I'm from the slip</font></font>

216
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,310
... Kemeto-sama</font></font>

217
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,100
Well, how do you start?</font></font>

218
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,440
... a-order, it is true</font></font>

219
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,230
... Hmmm</font></font>

220
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,610
Huh?</font></font>

221
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,110
... Oh</font></font>

222
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,820
! </font>I think, we're dancing</font></font>

223
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,830
! </font>What an innovative dance</font></font>

224
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,040
. </font>This equally common folk act Bsjathm</font></font>

225
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,920
! </font>He was like hell</font></font>

226
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,420
. </font>It seems that Arzogaoa-san was hit too dizzy</font></font>

227
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,170
Arzogaoa-san</font></font>

228
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,280
Huh? </font>Huh? </font>What ?</font></font>

229
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,280
! </font>Long overdue</font></font>

230
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,320
To what extent do Ardtna wait!?</font></font>

231
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,990
. </font>I had no choice, they have set up my party welcome</font></font>

232
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,160
. </font>I had to come as you know</font></font>

233
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,330
! </font>Hav, do not bother, the club told me all about commoners</font></font>

234
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,920
What we do at the beginning?</font></font>

235
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,300
"Commoners Club"</font></font>

236
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,180
... Take your time! </font>I'm thinking in this regard. Let us see what the common folk who do</font></font>

237
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,300
 Say, O commoner, what is this?</font></font>

238
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,390
what is this ? </font>It Mangga</font></font>

239
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,720
Mango ?</font></font>

240
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,230
"200000000 folder may sell" " 'the Avatar Tonva, legend begins now."</font></font>

241
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,520
Do not know what this?</font></font>

242
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,190
How do you read this?</font></font>

243
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,520
. </font>Uh, you do not know how to read paintings</font></font>

244
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,780
. </font>So let's see, it reads from right to left and from the top down</font></font>

245
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,570
... Hmmm</font></font>

246
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:10,410
".. it must be." </font>"Chaser Mistraal .." "who does not know anything." </font>"In this city."</font></font>

247
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,670
"... weapons and Alrdaouat ..." "which I received .." "from that man ..."</font></font>

248
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,380
! </font>Vaaaaash! </font>Hmmm</font></font>

249
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:25,140
"All this was for this moment," "cloak the second body ..." "souring Aazonomi"</font></font>

250
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,610
... Weah</font></font>

251
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,070
how are you ?</font></font>

252
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,410
. </font>I'm a bit surprised you</font></font>

253
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,870
What did not say anything about this before?</font></font>

254
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,790
about what ?</font></font>

255
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,250
! </font>That all commoners in high school have psychic powers</font></font>

256
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,830
It's really pure, huh?</font></font>

257
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,750
... No way ! </font>Dear commoner, you do not mean</font></font>

258
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,260
.. huh? </font>No, do not tell me</font></font>

259
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,130
It's impossible to believe that, right?</font></font>

260
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,430
! </font>In this case, it will be also psychological</font></font>

261
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,020
! </font>If commoners managed to do this so there is no reason you can not do it like me miss</font></font>

262
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,440
! </font>I really believe it's what a pure beyond the border</font></font>

263
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:16,440
"Ø£Ø±Ø¹Ø¯ÙŠ"

266
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,570
! </font>From now on it must be Ica-sama Chapter Center</font></font>

267
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:30,250
Oh, Tanona? </font>Well that's what everyone says, this</font></font>

268
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,040
Can you see them?</font></font>

269
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,920
. </font>Oh dear quieter commoner, even if he became the most famous girl dismissal</font></font>

270
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,340
. </font>I will keep talking to you, you have to honor this</font></font>

271
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,260
. </font>Well, it's better for you to Taatdrba away</font></font>

272
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,390
This is a way of awakening the sleeping inner robe and put him in the contract, right?</font></font>

273
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,810
... No</font></font>

274
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,190
! </font>So</font></font>

275
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,070
Huh? </font>Is not this different from what the manga?</font></font>

276
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,030
You are not slang, you miss, right?</font></font>

277
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,660
That's right, you're right, what is the second part please?</font></font>

278
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,130
. </font>Well, now I try to do everything you shown together</font></font>

279
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,340
. </font>When Tflanha, Stkdran to stop time</font></font>

280
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,050
, From wearing a golden robe</font></font>

281
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,640
... towards the horizon</font></font>

282
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,560
... around the role of</font></font>

283
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,350
"I get it"</font></font>

284
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,310
. </font>Nothing happened</font></font>

285
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,360
Do you really stop?</font></font>

286
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,740
... of</font></font>

287
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,120
! </font>just awesome ! </font>It became a psychologist</font></font>

288
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,210
O foolish commoner</font></font>

289
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,550
Do you see? </font>Do you see?</font></font>

290
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,640
! </font>Well, it's time to write "Achenja" on your forehead</font></font>

291
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,190
E-huh? </font>My cheeks swollen, why?</font></font>

292
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,160
. </font>E-So, then, there is a limit to the extent of my ability to stop time</font></font>

293
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,870
. </font>To experience this more later</font></font>

294
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,830
Dost thou aloud, what gives "Achejna"?</font></font>

295
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,090
Hey, how you? </font>How did I know what I intend to write it?</font></font>

296
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,170
! ... l-do not tell me .. Do not tell me</font></font>

297
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,260

303
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,840
... between the parts and the tightest blown clear area</font></font>

304
