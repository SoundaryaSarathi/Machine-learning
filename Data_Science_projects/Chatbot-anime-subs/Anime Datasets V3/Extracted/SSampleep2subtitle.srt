00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
! </font>I never imagined that you can jump to this dimension</font></font>

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
I've jumped the way that always do it by, is this very cool?</font></font>

90
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,600

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,580
Atsu?</font></font>

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,330
Do you mean Ica-sama?</font></font>

97
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,960
. </font>A-order, we Amyin use words such as "Atsuo" with friends</font></font>

98
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,170
. </font>This is just ... it's easier to use for this slipped me</font></font>

99
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,970
, Now that I have indicated this, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

100
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,340

102
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,220
... Well, for</font></font>

103
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,310
So, in fact, that the fault lies on us, is not it?</font></font>

104
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,570
. </font>Maybe it is better if I did not volunteer that they do not want to</font></font>

105
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,740
. </font>Arzogaoa-san and friends do not like</font></font>

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,570
. </font>Most likely there is something else may have their reasons</font></font>

107
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,910
. </font>Please do not for this Tloha for this</font></font>

108
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,250
! </font>Since we may not love Ica-sama</font></font>

109
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,620
... huh? </font>I mean</font></font>

110
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,380
... We were delighted by saying that we did not do anything</font></font>

111
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,170
. </font>Offer to Ica-sama unhappiness, Kemeto-sama</font></font>

So go Amyin!?</font></font>

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,290
Verse ? </font>This proximity to look</font></font>

119
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,750
! </font>I have stumbled</font></font>

120
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,410
Is there a way in order to walking?</font></font>

121
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,250
! </font>No</font></font>

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
             "Tea," "French cuisine"</font></font>

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,210
! </font>What is that ? </font>How can this be written in Japanese! </font>I can not understand anything</font></font>

124
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,720
Kemeto-sama, what do you ask?</font></font>

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,380
. </font>Well, a Japanese meal</font></font>

126
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,510
. </font>So I will ask a Japanese meal as well as</font></font>

127
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,430
. </font>I also</font></font>

128
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,390
. </font>I will ask the Japanese meal also</font></font>

129
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,440
. </font>Thank you for waiting</font></font>

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,730
What is that ?</font></font>

131
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,360
. </font>Japanese meal, I heard that "the Maine Cup" is the main food</font></font>

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,820
... This is as of ways Amyin</font></font>

133
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,200
! </font>Even Amyin do not eat "Cobb Min" always</font></font>

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,490
Do you pop your tongue I did not it?</font></font>

135
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,580
So, do you go back on this?</font></font>

136
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,910
-Hassana, certainly will Kemeto-sama</font></font>

137
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,580
Huh?</font></font>

138
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,880
Is this food ... the smell is unusual?</font></font>

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,630
Do not you know what is the "Maine Cup"?</font></font>

140
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,300
Maine Cup?</font></font>

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,130
Well, do you know what is Alramen?</font></font>

142
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,550
. </font>Well, I've heard some stories</font></font>

143
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,890
! </font>S-stories, huh? </font>Well this kind of immediate Alramen</font></font>

144
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,980
. </font>In other words, it's easy to issue</font></font>

145
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,440
. </font>Tadhavin hot water and you can eat</font></font>

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,270
Just by adding hot water!?</font></font>

147
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,020
E. That's all what you do to cook?</font></font>

148
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,440
. </font>Rico-sama this is unlikely</font></font>

149
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,490
! </font>As on the box a lot of words written by</font></font>

150
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,950
. </font>Here are some of the old architecture in my house for decoration</font></font>

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,090
. </font>P-any case, we eat such a thing often</font></font>

152
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,510
! </font>Ah</font></font>

153
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,760
. </font>It really eaters, there are also other ingredients</font></font>

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,260
This may be Robien, but what those things yellow and brown?</font></font>

155
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,640
! </font>Imagine! </font>Only by adding water it takes this form</font></font>

156
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,020
How does this work ?</font></font>

157
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,480
If you are interested, do you want to try it?</font></font>

158

00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,520
. </font>Uh, you do not know how to read paintings</font></font>

244
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,780

What did not say anything about this before?</font></font>

254
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,790
about what ?</font></font>

255
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,250
! </font>That all commoners in high school have psychic powers</font></font>

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,130
It's impossible to believe that, right?</font></font>

260
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,430
! </font>In this case, it will be also psychological</font></font>

261
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,020
! </font>If commoners managed to do this so there is no reason you can not do it like me miss</font></font>

273
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,810
... No</font></font>

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,030
You are not slang, you miss, right?</font></font>

277
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,660
That's right, you're right, what is the second part please?</font></font>

"I get it"</font></font>

284
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,310
. </font>Nothing happened</font></font>
