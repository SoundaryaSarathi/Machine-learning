Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.38,0:00:08.39,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,That's because you ate two hamburgers.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.39,0:00:11.42,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,But Mashiro was treating.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.42,0:00:13.94,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Anyhow, it sure has been a while...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.94,0:00:15.35,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,What's it been... two, three months?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.35,0:00:16.30,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,I dunno.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.41,0:00:18.92,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Well anyway, let's give it our all starting today!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.92,0:00:19.78,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Right!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.61,0:00:26.40,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Guess we've got to clean up first.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.40,0:00:27.62,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, we do.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.52,0:02:01.09,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.37,0:02:03.99,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,The setup for the deceitful detective story.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.99,0:02:05.54,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Oh.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.50,0:02:10.54,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,The protagonist is a con man detective...

Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.69,0:02:17.29,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I see, it's interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.29,0:02:18.01,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,You think so?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.01,0:02:19.46,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,But this'll be tough.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.34,0:02:22.31,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I realized it when I was working on my name,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.31,0:02:24.43,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,but detectives aren't really that active.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.04,0:02:27.39,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,While they're solving mysteries, all they do is talk.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.39,0:02:31.20,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I mean, if all he does is have flashy battles, it's not really detective-like.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.20,0:02:32.87,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I guess you're right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.87,0:02:35.70,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,That's why I got stuck halfway through my name.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.70,0:02:37.09,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,You wrote a name?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.56,0:02:38.71,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Let me see it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.64,0:02:44.43,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Well... but... it's really only a little bit...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.43,0:02:45.33,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,It's fine, just show it to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.91,0:02:47.74,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,We're going to try our hardest on this together again, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.74,0:02:49.35,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Give it here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.35,0:02:51.93,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,It's really just the beginning, it's not much.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:00.00,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,{None of the text on the page is legible/relevant}
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.29,0:02:59.96,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,He makes them think that their victim is still alive, then catches them when they come to kill again... {QC}
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.96,0:03:03.36,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,It's an overused idea, but I think you've definitely got a grip on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.35,0:03:07.13,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I also like how you start with the main character in action.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.13,0:03:11.28,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Whoa, Mashiro's drawings are good! Totally different from yours.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.62,0:03:13.12,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,In a name, the story is more important than the drawings!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.12,0:03:14.29,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Yes, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.46,0:03:16.12,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Hey.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.99,0:03:19.27,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Do you think we could have the protagonist disguise himself?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.38,0:03:25.00,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,It's manga and he's a con man, so that should make sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.00,0:03:26.29,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Disguise himself as what?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.05,0:03:29.09,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,As the murdered person.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.09,0:03:32.18,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,So basically, the protagonist makes himself a decoy.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.18,0:03:33.59,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I get it...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.59,0:03:37.37,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, having one or two special abilities feels really fitting for a protagonist! {TLC - is abilities right here? doesn't seem to fit with the conversation} {QC - give this a look too}
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.37,0:03:39.47,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,It's definitely more interesting that way!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.18,0:03:44.15,Up of Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,From his body type to his gender, he can create a perfect disguise to defeat his enemies.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.02,0:03:45.71,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,It looks like I was right. They are better off working together. {This is said over Shuujin and Saikou's lines.}
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.15,0:03:46.66,Up of Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,That really works with setup of a con man!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.48,0:03:51.02,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Now I've gotta do past here... {TLC - not sure what this sentence is saying}
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.02,0:03:55.69,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah, grifts and traps that can surprise readers.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.69,0:03:57.87,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,We need to come up with some.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.87,0:04:01.20,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,But if we we can think some up, it'll be much more interesting!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.35,0:04:03.56,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,We can make it with this!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.56,0:04:06.21,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I want to write for this protagonist more than any other I've done so far!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.21,0:04:06.66,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Let's bet on this!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.37,0:04:09.19,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,With this, we can definitely get serialized!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.19,0:04:10.25,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.68,0:04:13.58,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,But half a year...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.44,0:04:17.05,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Five names in half a year...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.05,0:04:19.17,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Saikou, the limit is half a year, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.66,0:04:22.99,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Are you saying you want more time?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.99,0:04:24.86,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,No... I'll do it,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.90,0:04:26.95,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,but to be honest,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.95,0:04:31.04,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,a week after I told Hattori-san I was making a mystery-genre name...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.72,0:04:33.70,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Coming!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.30,0:04:36.70,Main,Guy,0000,0000,0000,,Sign please.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.70,0:04:37.95,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Six boxes?!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.82,0:04:42.27,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,They were packed with mystery novels and DVDs.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.27,0:04:43.66,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,And there was a letter.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.45,0:04:47.80,Main,Hattori,0000,0000,0000,,Some will probably overlap in terms of story content, but what's important is how they're presented!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.52,0:04:51.38,Main,Hattori,0000,0000,0000,,Try to study this much at the least.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.31,0:04:57.46,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,If I looked though all that, it'd take me three months.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.46,0:04:58.68,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Well, it would be good to look over them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.45,0:05:02.49,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,The factors that are most important in a mystery story are the tricks and mysteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.49,0:05:05.02,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,So it would definitely be beneficial to look through these.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.02,0:05:07.23,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Especially now that we've got a fascinating protagonist.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:10.13,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,I want to make stories that are high quality and well finished.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.13,0:05:14.03,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,So to be honest, I think it might be a good idea for us to take our time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.28,0:05:17.22,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I see...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.90,0:05:21.33,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Shuujin, that might be the best way to go. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.33,0:05:26.51,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,Even if we have good characters, we need to have cool stories or there's no point.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.83,0:05:30.21,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,And just like how I obsess over my drawings,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.21,0:05:33.15,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I think it would be good for you to be particular about your stories.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.15,0:05:34.62,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I think that we should do—
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.62,0:05:35.60,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,I'll look over them!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.48,0:05:39.12,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Those novels and DVDs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.12,0:05:41.93,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,I'll figure out all the main points and pass them along to Takagi.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.93,0:05:45.76,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,That way I can advise Takagi on his names and save us some time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.28,0:05:49.21,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Making the two of you a success is my dream!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.21,0:05:51.49,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,What about the cell phone novels?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.49,0:05:52.33,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,I'm giving that up.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.33,0:05:52.76,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,That was fast!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.13,0:05:56.39,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,You should think a little more before you act.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.39,0:06:01.04,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Helping you two out is more useful than trying to write a cell phone novel that might not sell, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.75,0:06:05.25,Main,Shuujin,0000,0000,0000,,Well, it certainly would help if you could just extract general ideas for me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.25,0:06:06.09,Main,Kaya,0000,0000,0000,,Then— {KmE: This wasn't on the TL script}
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.09,0:06:10.16,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,But novels and movies have atmosphere to them too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.16,0:06:11.71,Main,Saikou,0000,0000,0000,,I think it may be better for you to look at them yourself.
