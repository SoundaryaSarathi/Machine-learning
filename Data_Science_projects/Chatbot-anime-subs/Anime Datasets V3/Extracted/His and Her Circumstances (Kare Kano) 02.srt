500
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:13,074
What's happened so far!

501
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:14,976
Arima Souichirou. Excellent grades,

502
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:16,278
good in all sports...

503
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:18,380
Generally a sociable guy who
would never make any enemies.

504
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,547
Furthermore, he's a thoroughbred

505
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:22,999
from a super famous family of doctors...
...dating back to the Edo Period.

507
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:25,718
Miyazawa Yukino. Elegant and graceful,

508
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,723
blessed with both beauty and intelligence.

509
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:30,225
Though an ordinary commoner
raised in a middle class family...

510
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,227
...she's just as full of grace
and intellect as Arima.

511
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:35,697
The two, who captivate the multitudes
around them with their charm,

513
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:37,032
met in high school.

514
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:37,932
However,

515
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,734
Arima found out the other day that

516
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,934
his opposite number was a mongrel!

517
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:46,123
Sis is a moron.

518
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:49,311
Even worse, he had
confessed his love to her!

521
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,331
But Sis, without a second thought,
flatly turned him down.

523
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,683
And right afterwards, this happened.

524
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,455
Sis is really a moron.

525
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,425
She's a carp on a cutting board!

526
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,028
Having dug her own grave,

527
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:09,564
Sis is now between a rock and a hard place!

528
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:11,499
Now, what will you do, Miyazawa Yukino?!

529
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:13,899
And what about you, Arima Souichirou?!

530
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,424
You can tell that something is
"excellent" with just one glance.

531
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:37,792

532
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,000
Arima found out everything.

533
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:42,979
I'll regret it forever.

534
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,368
He's a sharp guy.

535
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:47,536
I'm sure he figured out
everything just by looking at me.

536
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,336
Everything about me at school is a bluff...

537
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Living in vanity. The very
embodiment of vanity!

539
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,511
That was me -
Miyazawa Yukino's true form.

540
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:01,000
So, what're you going to do, Arima?

541
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,752
Tell everyone and make a
Laughingstock out of me?

542
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:05,553
Go around holding me in contempt?

543
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,822
Or are you going to sympathize
with me about how foolish I am...

544
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,272
...like the model student that you are?

545
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:13,375
Why did Arima, of all
people, have to find out?!

546
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:16,664
He's the one person I wouldn't want
to laugh at me, or scorn me...or feel

547
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:17,814
sorry for me!

548
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,503
Hey, guys, Miyazawa was

549
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,937
just looking this way.

550
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:24,187
Could it be me?

551
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:26,756
Moron, who'd go out with you?

552
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:28,792
Yeah, really.

553
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,294
But she's really something.

554
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,281
All slim and feminine and stuff...

555
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:35,650
Maybe I should go and
confess my love to her...

556
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,750
It's no use.

557
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,087
You'd just end up getting hurt.

559
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:43,158
I waited for judgement
day with much anxiety.

560
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:45,000
All those girls who are
smiling at me now...

561
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,863
When they find out tomorrow
that they've been deceived...

562
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:50,565
...they'll probably look at me
with expressions of disgust!

563
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,734

564
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,784
Uuuuuuu....

565
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,454
By the way, about last lecture...

566
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,942
The teacher's so mean...

567
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,543
And he just talks forever...

570
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:06,529
I wish he'd give us a break...

571
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,015
Yeah, really.

573
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,100
But, even after several days,

574
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,455
Arima hasn't said anything to me.

575
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,855
It doesn't look like he told anyone...

577
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,295
Even after days and days
passed nothing at all happened.
**Several days several days several...**

578
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:21,995
Finally, a week later...

579
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,763
Could it be that he just let it slide?

580
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:25,966
That's it!

581
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,605
It's because he's been brought up
well and has good character!

583
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,674
He wouldn't go around talking behind people's
backs... and doing petty things like that!

584
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:37,978
That's it!  I'm so LUCKY!
ALRIGHT!

587
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,130
So, I was relieved.

588
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,221
Gotta go to the library.

589
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:53,109
But at that time,
who would have guessed...

591
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,779
...that a fearsome plot awaited me?

592
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:59,298
You're letting your face slip.

593
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,268
Am I some kind of demon?

594
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,254
Surprised you, huh?

595
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:07,275
I know what you're thinking.

596
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,310
I saw you at a bad time, didn't I?

597
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,510
You had even me completely fooled.

598
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:14,598
I never would have thought that the innocent
Little Miyazawa was this kind of person.

600
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,918
I bet everyone will be so surprised!

601
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:20,503
I bet it'll be a big sensation.

602
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,423
I wonder how they'll react...

603
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:25,323
Maybe they'll laugh. Maybe they'll be disgusted.

604
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:28,244
What is it, Miyazawa?

605
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:32,548
Don't... don't tell anyone.

606
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:35,902
Don't tell anyone, p-l-e-a-s-e.

607
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:40,974
Don't tell anyone, please.

608
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,111
Okay, fine.

609
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:46,163
Lucky!

611
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,099
Could you do those for me by tonight?

612
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:53,602
Well, I've got practice to go to, so...

613
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:00,811
What is this?

614
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,547
Why do I have to do it?

615
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,600
And who was that just now?!

616
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,850
Who the heck was that freaky dude?!

617
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:16,000
Well then, Arima, translate what we just read.

618
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,461
Yes. ma'am.
He was gasping for breath...

619
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,483
...and it seemed as
if he wanted to speak.

621
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,153
But as he looked greatly pained and sorely tired.
The Emperor...

624
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,625
Now then, Miyazawa, interpret it.

625
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,675
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:36,000
The words "men" and "women" are used here
to symbolize and express the rise of emotions.

628
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,668
In those times death inside the
court was considered unclean...

629
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:44,500
...and only the Emperor
was permitted to die there.
The attendant court ladies . . . 

632
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,342
Yes, that's correct.

633
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,742
Extremely impressive job from you two.

635
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:55,750
They echo words of admiration so easily.

636
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,650
None of these people know...

637
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,454
...that I'm currently...

638
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,089
...Arima's lackey!

639
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:05,342
After that, the

640
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,743
curtain rose on my tragedy.

641
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,732
Evening! Ah, you're really going at it.

642
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,432
Good work. Wow, perfect!

643
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,269
And you're done already.

644
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,755
Incredible. That's my Miyazawa.

645
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,777
Now see here! What do you think you're doing?!

646
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,077
Why're you making me do this stuff?!

647
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,116
Because,

648
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,853
I'm taking advantage of your weakness...

649
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,003
...and turning it to my own ends.

650
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,357
I...I...I know that already!

651
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,057
Don't say it so bluntly!

652
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,759
That's called blackmail.

653
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,562
Haven't you any shame?

654
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:42,312
Yeah.

655
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,099
But I can't help it.

656
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,784
I'm way busy,

657
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,872
and it's a major help having you sub for me.

658
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:52,022
You little...

659
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,990
So, you'll be useful to me.

660
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:55,708
Well, I won't force you.

661
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,514
If you don't want to do it, just say so.

662
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,164
If you've got the guts.

663
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,086
You scheming little bastard!

664
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:08,056
I never expected this. Who would've
thought he had another side of him too?

665
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,806
I've been my own master for these 15 years...

666
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,461
...showing off, with my head held high.

667
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,663
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life!
What the hell is with him? Dammit!

668
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,699
But, this sounds like a good deal for you.

670
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,433
Riiight?

671
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:22,236
He's taking the pains to show
you the harsh realities of life.

672
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:24,386
Not only the emptiness of vanity,
but also that greatness, is all relative.

675
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:28,609
Not!

676
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:33,214
He's not that nice of a guy!

677
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:34,064
Dammit!

678
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:39,852
But, I have no way
to escape from his trap.

680
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:43,621
There was nothing I could
do but curse my own fate.

681
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,591
But soon afterwards...

682
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:52,981
Now I'm tied up with Arima's work all day long!

683
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,771
Hey, did you know Yoshida,

684
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:58,239
the math teacher, has false teeth?

685
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,089
No way!

686
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:00,807
That was really...

687
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,765
Hey, pass, pass! Alright...

688
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,854
How could you make a girl do all this work...?

689
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:14,804
Pretending to cry won't work.

690
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:16,924
You're actually callous

691
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,524
and tough, aren't you?

692
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
None of your business!

693
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,465
What work is it this time?

694
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:27,315
Making a schedule for the Class Trip Committee.

695
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,752
Gack! Are you doing that too?

696
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,373
Since I was being made to help,

697
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,642
it was certainly clear that Arima was super-busy.

698
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:36,577
The Student Council...the Service Club

699
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:38,146
the Class Trip Committee...
on executive committees

700
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:40,548
for various events...
a part of the main staff for all of them.

701
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:41,998
And on top of that,

702
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,550
he does club sports...studies...

703
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:48,122
...and even talks with classmates
who come to him for help.

704
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:50,522
Of course, I weasel out of most of it.

705
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,992
You're gonna die if this keeps up.

706
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,997
It seems I stand out or something, I guess.

707
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,447
That must be tough.

708
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:00,401
I would have thought that your looks and brains

709
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,851
would have brought you a better life...

710
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,870
Oh, I see.  I guess so.

712
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:09,210
Well, since you're here, it's all good.

713
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm your dog?

714
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:11,578
Woof woof.

715
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:13,747
Arima,

716
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,517
you were Student Council
President in junior high, right?

717
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:17,717
Yeah. And you?

718
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,602
I did that too.

719
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:21,923
Well, it must've been tough then.

720
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,323
Uh-uh, not really.

721
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,275
What? How come?

722
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,078
What should I do?

723
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:30,466
I can't do all this...

724
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:34,751
...I said, and got a guy to do it for me!

726
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,787
What a fraud!
So that's the kind of person you really were.

727
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,943
Hey! You're doing exactly the same thing!

728
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:43,543
What? That's not true.

729
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,245
I act normally all the time.

730
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:49,197
This is all due to your
influence right now.

731
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,533
Oh, so it's my fault? How dare you!

732
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:53,686
It's true, you know.

733
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,257
Wow, it's pitch-black outside.

734
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:00,777
Miyazawa, you hungry?

735
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,545
Hungry? Sure.

736
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:06,347
Then I can treat you to
something...once in a while.

737
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,884
Arima is somehow perfect.

738
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:13,523
I want steak!

739
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:15,542
You blockhead.

740
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:20,995
Where did that come from, I wonder?

741
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,083
Until yesterday, there was nothing at all.

742
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:29,906
Until recently...

743
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:31,659
Hey, check it out!

744
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,759
Those two...

745
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,363
It shouldn't have been anywhere at all...

746
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,398
Like, that rumor's gotta be true!

747
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:38,798
No doubt about it!

748
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:07,994
You awake?

749
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:18,153
Practice just finished, so I came over.

750
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,039
You shouldn't fall asleep like that.

751
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,743
Suddenly, he seemed special to me.

752
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:28,764
Arima seemed special to me.

753
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:40,191
What was with Arima just then?

754
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:42,211
What is this sensation?

755
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,680
This feeling I can't place?

756
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,199
My head feels all foggy and I can't sit still.

757
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,636
This is the first time I've felt this way.

758
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,606
Wait! Could it be...

759
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:57,411
This isn't that
Love" thing I've often heard of, is it?

760
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,611
Like "crush..." and "romance," and

761
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,330
falling for someone?!

762
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,286
No way, not me...!
Ridiculous. I don't believe it.

763
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,736
I guess I just don't understand myseIf.

764
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,225
And yet...What a pain.

765
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:16,763
Let's's eat!

766
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,135
Hey, you sure come home

767
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,670
Late these days, Sis.

768
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,420
What?

769
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:26,307
Oh, I've got stuff to do
for the class committee.

770
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:27,357
That's all?

771
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,426
Well, yeah.

772
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,544
See, you had it all wrong.

773
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:33,496
Well, I don't know...

774
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:35,198
Now what?

775
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:36,917
What, what?

776
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,252
What are you talking about?

777
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,587
But it's really weird!

778
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:42,337
You started coming home late all of a sudden.

779
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:45,126
You used to talk a lot about
school, but not these days.

781
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:46,676
And most importantly,

782
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:48,994
you stopped wearing your sweats.

783
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,663
Sis, you got a boyfriend, don't you?

784
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:53,750
Wh....wh...wh...

785
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,385
WHAAAAT??!!

786
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,120
A g...g...guy, is it?

787
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,410
Your father, who loves you more
than anyone in the world...

788
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course, I love Tsukino and Kano
more than anyone in the world, too, but...

789
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,350
You pick another man over your father?!

791
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,686
What the heck are you babbling about?

792
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,136
Hey, she's nervous.

793
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,188
I knew it.

794
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:17,556
I'd love to see a picture.

795
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,593
I wonder if he's good looking?

796
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:21,043
Probably some hunk.

797
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,296
Even more than me?

798
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:24,347
No doubt.

799
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:25,800
Yuki's pretty choosy about looks...

800
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,850
I wonder who she got that from?

801
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,335
I'm telling you,

802
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:31,087
it's just work!

803
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,255
Yukino!

804
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,328
I swear, they're so inconsiderate...

805
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:47,621
If I had felt this way after meeting
normally, there wouldn't be any trouble.

808
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:50,000
That's right. I'm troubled.

809
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,592
Because Arima...

810
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,319
Hey, hey, Miyazawa.

811
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:08,473
Are you and Arima...going out?

812
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,514
You two are together a lot recently...

813
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:15,249
But I don't mean anything funny...

814
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,717
You two look really cute together,

815
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,552
and even if we're a bit jealous...

816
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:19,754
...you seem to be the

817
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,254
most suited for him.

818
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:24,558
And I was just wondering
what was really going on.

819
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,260
It's true that he said he liked me, but...

820
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,029
Hey, this one brave girl went up to
Arima and asked him the same thing.

821
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,000
And I hear that Arima just
Laughed and didn't answer.

822
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,682

823
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:44,245
I thought so. I've been thinking...

824
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:52,000
Where did that confession go inside Arima?
He hasn't brought it up at all since then.

827
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,505
I figured this
would happen, but...

829
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,325
Arima loved the me before
he knew my true identity.

831
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,877
Not the real me.

832
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:06,296
I fell in love with him after
I knew his true identity, but...

833
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:09,535
Miyazawa!

834
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,939
Sorry, would you stay late today?

835
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:15,910
I don't need you for much today,

836
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,510
so it won't take long.

837
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:22,815
I see. So it completely vanished from within him.

839
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:29,588
Oh, you're still here.

840
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,891
I saw the classroom lights from outside.

841
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,794
Did it take that long?

842
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,063
It's done already.

843
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:37,897
I see.

844
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,686
I'm not doing this anymore.

845
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:45,005
Huh?

846
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:47,672
I'm finished. I won't help any more.

847
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:50,711
But if you do that, you'll be in
all sorts of trouble, won't you?

848
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,784
I don't care.
Tell them.

850
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:58,684
Wait! What're you mad about?

851
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,686
I'm not mad. Let go.

852
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,456
You're mad, aren't you?

853
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:05,456
If something made you mad
all of a sudden, tell me.

854
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,927
I can't understand this way.

855
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:07,927
It's okay.

856
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:09,162
It's not okay!

857
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:11,814
Let's go...I said let go!

858
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm sick of being used!

859
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,030
Miyazawa!

860
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:34,086
We always talked like friends,

861
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,389
so I'd forgotten.

862
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,939
Arima was just taking

863
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,807
advantage of my weakness.

864
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,393
How could he?!

865
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:44,999
He totally changed his attitude
when he found out my true identity...

866
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,199
How could he?!

867
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,650
So I'm gonna end it right here.

868
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,643
Wh...wh...why're you following me?

869
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,180
Because you're running away!

870
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,730
Stay away! Stay away!

871
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,166
Won't happen!

872
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:18,548
Dammit!

873
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:22,299
You don't have to run away
Like your life depended on it!

874
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,220
I said wait, you little...!

875
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,984
This could look compromising...

876
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,521
You're still running away?!

877
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,375
Aren't you all scraped up?

878
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,775
Show me your face!

879
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,111
So I'm a weirdo!

880
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:10,351
I'm vain, seIfish, a liar,
a schemer, and I'm greedy!

882
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,401
I'm sure you were disappointed!

883
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,856
But, why did you have to change
your attitude towards me?!

884
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:19,308
If I'm not acting elegant,
am I that worthless?!

886
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,311
I hate you! Don't touch me!

887
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,335
I'm sorry.

888
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,757
Am I really that weird?

889
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:37,878
If I'm not the model student,
am I really without any value?

890
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:38,928
Not at all.

891
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,348
I like you the way you
are right now. It's fun.

893
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,517
F...fun?

894
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,969
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.

895
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:49,656
I never intended to tell

896
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:51,256
anyone from the start.

897
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,294
I didn't want to seriously use you...

898
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:55,944
I just wanted a reason.

899
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,530
A reason to talk with you.

900
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,135
I thought it would be fun...

901
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,035
It was fun!

902
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:06,941
I've never talked with
anyone like that before.

904
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:11,578
But I never thought it was hurting you.

905
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,278
I'm sorry. I won't ask you to help any more.

906
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:16,532
So that's it.

907
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:21,319
So it wasn't that he didn't care about me...

908
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,738
I'm glad. I guess I had a good cry.

909
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:29,344
From that day on, Arima and I

910
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,497
became companions,

911
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,066
sharing the same secret.

912
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,618
So, you're an only child?

913
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,207
Somehow it figures.
*She's helping out after all*

914
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:41,107
And you?

915
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:43,308
I've got two little sisters.

916
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,010
Are your sisters cute?

917
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,397
Well, to be totally accurate,

918
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,899
Arima may have misunderstood a bit...

919
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:53,153
Yeah, they're super obnoxious and SO cute!

920
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:55,203
I'll show them to you sometime!

921
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:57,522
"Obnoxious and cute?" Oh, well.

922
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:02,811
He thinks I snapped because
I was being overworked.

924
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,630
Well, that's okay.

925
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,332
At any rate, I now know that

926
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,969
I'm something special to Arima...

928
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,238
Even if it's not love.

929
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,989
But you really had me going, you know.

930
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,244
I didn't know you were

931
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:18,594
Like this either.

932
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:20,697
Yeah...

933
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:24,432
I'm surprised myseIf.

934
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,435
You might not believe it...

935
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,371
...but I didn't know that

936
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,440
I had this in me...until I met you.

937
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,094
Why does it bother me?

938
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,365
Why do I let myseIf be influenced?

939
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm being drawn to you more and more
and becoming somebody else.

941
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,303
I wonder if that's a good thing...

942
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,206
...or a bad thing...

943
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:14,126
What'll happen next!

944
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,863
The two of them make up! Will
they enter straight into a love-love mode?!

945
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:18,498
But it won't be that easy!

946
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:20,298
Arima suddenly turns cold!

947
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,517
Is Sis gonna get dumped?!

948
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,170
Next time:

949
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,139
His Circumstances!
