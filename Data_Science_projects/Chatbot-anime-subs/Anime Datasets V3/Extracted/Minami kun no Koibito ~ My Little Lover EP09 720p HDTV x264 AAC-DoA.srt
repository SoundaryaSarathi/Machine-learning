8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,700

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,600
<i>About the dance workshop.</i>

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450

00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,900
<i>I do... like Horikiri-shi.</i>

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
<i>Did he see me?</i>

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,100
<i>- Chiyomi is not at the workshop.</i><br><i>- Eh?</i>

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,800
<i>Are you really Onee-chan? (big sister)</i>

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>Asuka, I'm sorry.</i>

Hurry up and get up. We'll be late.

24

Were you watching me?

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,830
How can you sleep like that.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,000
- I'm changing, so look away.<br>- Okay.

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,080

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,200
It's been a while since Grandma made a meal.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Yay! I can eat delicious meals again starting today.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
What do you mean by that?

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200

Well, that is true.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Eh? Did something happen again?

66
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,450
We're in trouble. Mom is going to ask the police <br>to search for you, Onee-chan.

67
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,830
- What?<br>- What?

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
<i>Well, asking the police to search for her...</i>

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
<i>Don't you think you are making too big of a deal?</i>

70

<i>It's been four weeks already.</i>

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,620
<i>She hasn't been home for four weeks, which is a big deal.</i>

73
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,410
<i>Besides, don't you think it is strange that we can't contact her?</i>

74

<i>How can I stay calm?</i>

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
- Yeah.<br>- Wait. Isn't she supposed to be in Tokyo for the dance workshop?

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

Chobiko?

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm talking about the figurine in your pocket.

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,500
What?

109
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,620
You are still playing dumb?

110
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Gosh, you are so good at acting.

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,040
You might as well become an actor.

112
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Riku, do you know about this?

113
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
What?

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,500
They say it is Chiyomi.

115
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Moon Bunny Michaela. She writes online novels...

116
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,200
Horikiri-san is now very famous.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Moon Bunny Michaela, was it?

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
Did you know about it?

119
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,100
No...

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,700
Is that so?

121
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
<i>My goodness, now he knows!</i>

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>I will be in trouble if he reads it. What should I do?</i>

123
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,790
<i>Wait. Minami-kun is not the type who reads something like that.</i>

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
<i>Well, I guess it'll be okay.</i>

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,450
<i>It sure is Chiyomi.</i>

126
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,400
This is 'Chiyomi's World.'

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Then, what you are saying is

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,100
that Chiyomi has been writing... online novels?

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,000
It definitely is Chiyomi.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,400
I am relieved. Ever since I heard she hadn't attended the workshop,

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,600
I was really worried.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,100
But, it is good that she is updating it frequently, at least.

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,400
But why did she have to leave the house?

134
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right. She didn't have to do this secretly.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I suppose she felt shy about showing it to you.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
But, why did she hide it from us?

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,700
Right?

138
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,520
Actually, I did know

140
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,290
- that Horikiri-shi was Moon Bunny Michaela.<br>- Eh?

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,100
I'm sorry, Amippe.

142
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,620
I didn't want to say something that Horikiri-shi had kept secret.

143
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,300
Hey, that's not good. You should have told us about it first thing.

144
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,410
On the day I told her that I knew about it

146
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,500
and how I love Moon Bunny Michaela and Horikiri-shi,

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,600
she disappeared.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
So, I felt responsible.

149
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
Takagi-san, it is not your fault.

150
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
The reason why Onee-chan disappeared

151
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,700
has nothing to do with her writing activities as Moon Bunny Michaela.

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,200
... That's what I think.

153
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
You should have told us if you knew about it.

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,600
I am sorry. I thought it would be better if Onee-chan told you about it herself after she came back.

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Oh... She has been thinking about these kinds of things.

156
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,000
And, she is... how should I say... expressing herself?

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't know she had this kind of talent.

158
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,200
Now that I think about it,

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,200
she told us she saw a tiny person and got really excited about it.

160
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
<i>You saw One-inch Princess?</i>

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
<i>Yes, One-inch Princess.</i>

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
<i>What are you saying? That's not possible.</i>

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
<i>But, she was really there.</i>

164
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,400
<i>- On the river. I was with Minami-kun --<br>- That's enough. I am busy.</i>

165
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,450
Maybe she really did see her.

166
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,200
She does have the tendency to daydream.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,500
You know, there is not a clear distinction between reality and a dream for children.

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,200
Maybe I shouldn't have scolded her that much.

169
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
I wonder if...

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
Onee-chan became a tiny person for real?

171
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,870
Hey, what are you saying?

172
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,700
But, she must have had a lot of things she wanted to say but couldn't.

173
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,890
Shunichi is late.

174
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,140
He said he'd go for a run but hasn't come back yet.

175
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,710
What is he doing, leaving Chiyomi-chan behind?

176
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,210
What?

177
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,840
<i>[The Big Guy prepared this red dress for me.]</i>

178
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,450
<i>[He must have just casually chosen it.]</i>

179
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,260
<i>[Even so, he wouldn't have given me <br>something that didn't suit me.]</i>

180
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,080
<i>[Today, I am feeling love towards him, in the red dress.]</i>

181
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,740
<i>[When I am in his pocket, I am the closest person to him.]</i>

182
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,270
<i>[I feel his body heat and heartbeat, ]</i>

183
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:06,470
<i>[and I can get closer to him than any other women of his kind.]</i>

184
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,310
<i>[I am the closest to him, and yet, I am the farthest.]</i>

185
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,110
<i>[Every time I dream of my wish coming true,]</i>

186
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,950
<i>[I deny the possibility, thinking that Big Guy <br>wouldn't possibly love me.]</i>

187
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,720
<i>[That's what I force myself to think.]</i>

188
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,150
<i>[I'll be happy just to be beside him.]</i>

189
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:33,220
<i>[I love the Big Guy, more than anyone in the world.]</i>

190
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:53,470
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>The Little Lover Team @Viki.</i>

191
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,570
<i>My Little Lover<br>Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

192
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,970
Minami-kun, did something happen?

193
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,130
You have been quiet since you came home.

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,530
Ah... Well...

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,390
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

196
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,500
<i>I am Takagi. I'm Shunichi-kun's classmate.</i>

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,390
Takagi?!

198
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,040
Why is he here?

199
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,470
<i>Oh, welcome.</i>

200
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,340
<i>Shunichi, Takagi-kun is here.</i>

201
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,650
<i>Come down.</i>

202
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,020
<i>Shunichi-kun's room is upstairs, right?</i>

203
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,820
<i>It's okay. I am going to his room.</i>

204
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,450
Huh?

205
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,310
<i>Oh, really?</i>

206
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,990
Hey, hide somewhere.

207
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,280
Okay.

208
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,140
What's the matter?

209
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,430
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

210
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,460
I want to talk to you as a man, face to face.

211
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,680
Let me come in.

212
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,530
Hey!

213
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,630
I was studying right now.

214
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,390
- Make it short if you need to talk.<br>- Your figurine doll...

215
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,050
Does she sleep here at night?

216
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,380
Oh! Well...

217
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,920
This is actually...

218
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,240
That is undoubtedly a bed for a figurine!

219
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,870
What? What are you saying?

220
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,330
I just put a towel in it. That's all.

221
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,190
You are playing dumb?

222
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,940
Then, shall I put my figurine on it?

223
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,870
Look. It's just the right size!

224
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,840
Hey, what are you talking about?

225
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,020
I am not interested in figurines or that kind.

226
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,950
Don't try to deny it.

227
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,850
I saw Horikiri-shi peeking out of your pocket in the classroom.

228
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,360
- What?<br>- What?

229
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,900
That was really well made.

230
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,830
<i>Riku thought I was a figurine.</i>

231
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,890
That's fine.

232
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,190
That's not what I want to ask you the most.

233
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,860
Minami.

234
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,720
You love Horikiri-shi, don't you?

235
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,850
<i>Riku...</i>

236
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,620
I can tell because I like creating things.

237
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,200
The reason why you can make a figurine that looks so real is because you love her that much.

238
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,900
W-What are you saying?

239
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,280
She is my childhood friend, but...

240
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,000
That's not all, is it?

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,450
Why are you playing dumb?

242
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,360
I am not.

243
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,300
It is you, isn't it?

244
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,070
The "Big Guy."

245
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,880
<i>Why are you covering it up?</i>

246
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,900
I... love Horikiri-shi.

247
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,840
So, I got jealous when I read "Chobiko in a Pocket."

248
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,910
I wished I had been the "Big Guy."

249
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,820
I don't know what you are talking about...

250
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,220
Then, what is this?!

251
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,640
Show me your figurine.

252
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
- I'm telling you, I don't have a figurine...<br>- Where is it?

253
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,070
Hey, stop! Stop it!

254
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,430
Hey, where is it?

255
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,090
Stop it! I'm telling you to stop!

256
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,470
Oh... They are so young...

257
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,820
This is...

258
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,620
what I gave Horikiri-shi.

259
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,200
<i>It's cute! Did you make it yourself?</i>

260
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,680
<i>It's great!</i>

261
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,430
That means...

262
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,860
Horikiri-shi is here.

263
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,530
Let me see Horikiri-shi.

264
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,840
You know where she is, don't you?

265
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
- Let me see her!<br>- That is...

266
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,050
impossible.

267
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,030
Impossible?

268
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,610
Then, let me ask you.

269
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,220
What is Horikiri-shi to you?

270
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,430
What do you mean?

271
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,990
Let me tell you this at least.

272
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,350
Don't make Horikiri-shi sad.

273
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,810
If you read Chobiko, you would know

274
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,940
that she is in a one-sided love relationship.

275
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,270
She believes that her feelings won't be returned.

276
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,500
That's all your fault!

277
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,590
My fault?

278
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,370
You haven't told her how you feel about her, have you?

279
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,830
Why do you make her suffer?

280
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,820
If you love her... tell her.

281
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Tell her how you feel about her.

282
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,140
I became afraid of

283
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,950
loving someone.

284
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,850
When I was in middle school,

285
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,500
my dad left us.

286
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,460
<i>Damn you!</i>

287
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,010
You know, my dad must have thought

288
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,550
that he would cherish my mom forever.

289
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,660
But...

290
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,180
People's feelings change.

291
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,240
Mine might too.

292
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,270
So, because you didn't want to hurt Horikiri-shi...

293
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,840
I decided not to love anyone.

294
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,080
I didn't want to be like my dad.

295
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,570
But, Takagi.

296
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
You...

297
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,740
When you hung around with Chiyomi, <br>I got upset for some reason.

298
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,110
Were you jealous of me?

299
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,480
You were?

300
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,240
I don't have a right to get jealous though.

301
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,830
That night,

302
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,080
Chiyomi told me how she felt about me.

303
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,020
But I...

304
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,740
If I had accepted her feelings then...

305
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,380
You need to tell her how you're feeling now.

306
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,330
You need to tell her.

307
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,360
"Big Guy" is you.

308
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,260
"Big Guy" actually loves Chobiko--

309
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,590
Chiyomi, I love you! I'm in love with you, Chiyomi!

310
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,570
Hey, why are you saying it to me?

311
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,910
You're not in a one-sided love.

312
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,010
You're... already a part of me!

313
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,060
<i>Minami...</i>

314
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,740
<i>Minami-kun!</i>

315
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Chiyomi?

316
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,210
I just heard Horikiri-shi's voice.

317
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,230
Minami-kun...

318
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,000
Me, too... I need you.

319
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,530
No way.

320
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,830
Minami-kun.

321
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,250
She spoke.

322
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,220
Thank you, Minami-kun.

323
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,200
Now, I finally know

324
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,590
how you feel about me.

325
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,050
I was the same.

326
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,710
Until that night,

327
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,530
I tried not to acknowledge my feelings.

328
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,220
Horikiri-shi...

329
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,910
Hey, Minami. Is this a figurine?

330
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,950
Riku. I am sorry.

331
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:43,590
On the night when you confessed to me, I became like this.

332
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,190
You became like this ?

333
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,890
Are you Horikiri-shi?

334
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,500
Yes.

335
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,590
Eh? What?

336
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,670
You became Chobiko for real.

337
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,800
Yes, I did.

338
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,990
You are turned off, aren't you?

339
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,750
No. I am not, but...

340
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,320
Cute...

341
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,430
Yeah, you are cute.

342
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,240
Did Minami give you the red dress?

343
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,960
When I became small, I had nothing to wear, <br>so he bought it for me.

344
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,760
I see.

345
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,750
She was always wearing that before that.

346
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,720
Thank you.

347
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,000
Without it, when Minami-kun came to find me,

348
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,390
I wouldn't have been able to come out.

349
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,040
<i>Chiyomi! Chiyomi!</i>

350
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,310
<i>Here! I'm over here! Minami-kun!</i>

351
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,120
<i>Minami-kun!</i>

352
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,180
<i>Without it, I wouldn't have been able to live on like this.</i>

353
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,470
I see.

354
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,630
I was of help to you... a bit.

355
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,450
This was the first thing that protected me.

356
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,300
I thought that the reason why Chobiko is a tiny person

357
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,510
was because it was a figurative expression you came up with.

358
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,110
I never thought it was real.

359
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,280
I wanted to give you a response,

360
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,120
but I thought I needed to get back to the original size.

361
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,030
Of course.

362
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,000
But, you gave me a response a long time ago.

363
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,660
What?

364
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,450
When I read Chobiko, I knew it was not me.

365
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,230
If Minami feels the same way as you, there is no chance for me.

366
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,230
Takagi...

367
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,050
Okay then,

368
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,900
I am leaving Horikiri-shi in your care.

369
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay.

370
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,060
Oh, yeah.

371
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,940
I looked into 'The legend of One-inch Princess.'

372
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,180
I found out that using the lucky mallet is not enough.

373
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,600
What?

374
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,910
You tried the lucky mallet, right?

375
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,650
Yes.

376
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,050
Apparently, that accomplishes just half a mission.

377
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,010
In the original story, after One-inch Princess used the mallet,

378
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,620
she prayed, facing the morning sun at Akebono Cape <br>and she became big.

379
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,850
Akebono Cape?

380
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,330
Why don't you go there?

381
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,000
<i>My Little Lover<br>Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

382
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,800
Why are you all of sudden going on a trip alone?

383
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
It's not that exaggerated. It's just over night.

384
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,100
A change of pace is necessary at times. <br>Here, take some onigiri (rice balls).

385
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Thank you Grandma. See you.

386
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,230
You didn't forget anything, did you?

387
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,000
I got everything.

388
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
I'm going.

389
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,200
Good morning.

390
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,100
Oh, Minami-kun. Good morning.

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>The Little Love Team @Viki.</i>

Hello.

393
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,500
Yes.

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,400
Can I stay here tonight?

396
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,800
- Are you alone?<br>- Yes.

397
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,500
Sure, come on in.

398
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,400
- Please fill this out.<br>- Yes.

399
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,400
Mom, isn't he a high school student?

400
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Don't be so nosy about our customers.

401
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,000

402
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,100
Please enjoy.

403
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,000
Here.

404
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
We're here.

405
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,590
They think you are alone.

406
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,390
Well, we are living as one now.

407
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm so happy that you brought me here. Thank you.

408
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
<i>Wow, it is so beautiful.</i>

409
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

410
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
<i>- It feels great.</i><br><i>-Yeah.</i>

411
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,250
<i>This is the first time we're taking time with our bath.</i>

412
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,000
You're right. Normally, we take turns.

413
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,900
- What should I do if all of a sudden I got big right now?<br>- Eh?

414
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,000
You're right.

415
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,200
I guess there is "onsen (hot spring) therapy".

416
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Oh boy, what should we do?

417
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
They'll get mad. You're supposed to be alone, but now, there are two people.

418
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
That's not what I was saying.

419
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Then, I'll borrow your yukata (kimono robe).

420
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
Then what should I wear?

421
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh yeah.

422
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Then you would be in your underwear.

423
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Are you serious?

424
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Just your underwear!

425
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,030
This looks good.

426
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,600
Can I have a small plate?

427
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't like hot food, so I like to put a small portion on it to cool it off.

428
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,780
Certainly.

429
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,450
- Thank you for this meal.<br>- Thank you for this meal.

430
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,200
This is so good!

431
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,030
Yeah, it is.

432
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,560
This feels like the best meal of my life.

433
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,840
I never thought a day would come when we could eat a meal together like this.

434
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,810
Yeah.

435
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,410
You're right.

436
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
Excuse me.

437
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,800
<i>- This is good right?<br>- Yeah, it's good.</i>

438
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,100
<i>This one is so fresh</i>

439
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,800
<i>This one is good, too.</i>

440
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,290
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

441
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,500
<i>- This is too hot.<br>- It's hot?</i>

442
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
It's true, Mom.

443
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,800
I clearly heard a woman's voice,

444
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,500
He was probably watching TV.

445
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,400
No, I think he has someone with him.

446
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
If you think about it,

447
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
it's weird to ask for another plate when he's all alone.

448
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,400
He's pretending he can't eat hot food. He's lying to us.

449
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
Hey...

450
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,400
Welcome back.

451
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,500
Thank you.

452
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Excuse me... about what time is tomorrow's sunrise?

453
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
- Oh, you are going to the cape.<br>- Yes.

454
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,500
Let's see.. About this time, people who go see it leave around 4:00.

455
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
I see. Thank you.

456
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,990
I hear people receive blessings there.

457
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,790
Usually, a couple or

458
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,760
a newly-wed couple goes there.

459
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,200
I'd like to be happy with my girlfriend.

460
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Have a good night.

461
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,980
Enjoy your stay.

462
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,550
He was alone.

463
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,350
Don't be rude to customers.

464
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,600
This is known as a relaxing place to stay.

465
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,300
So he does have a girlfriend.

466
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
That was a short lived romance.

467
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,960
But, you can't fall for customers. I tell you that all the time.

468
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,370
I don't want to hear that from you.

469
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,550
<i>Minami-kun no Koibito</i><br><i>My Little Lover</i>

470
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,400
I can hear

471
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,410
your heart beating nervously.

472
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,410
I am...

473
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
nervous.

474
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,620
Me too.

475
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Are you okay?

476
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,700
I am...

477
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,300
not okay.

478
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,610
But...

479
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,420
it hasn't been

480
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,990
okay since you've come.

481
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,700
Really?

482
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,260
Minami-kun?

483
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,310
Since I waited this long,

484
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,380
I might as well wait until tomorrow for the second one.

485
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,550
The second one?

486
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,120
You remembered.

487
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,630
Ah, we are here.

488
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,250
This is it.

489
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
You don't want to miss it, so keep looking up at the sky.

490
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,420
Yeah.

491
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,550
Minami-kun, what are these?

492
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,480
If you didn't have clothes to put on, we're in big trouble.

493
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,090
I...

494
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,590
like Chiyomi.

495
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,620

I...

498
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:31,000
had the most fun when we went to the mountain and river everyday

looking for One-inch Princess.

500
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,690
Me too. I had the most fun during that time.
