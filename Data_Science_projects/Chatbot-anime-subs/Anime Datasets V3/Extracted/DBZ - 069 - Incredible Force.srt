1
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:41,733
Vegeta!

2
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,065
Your guard is down!

3
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,898
He got him!

4
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:24,028
Yow... Damn that Vegeta...

5
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:30,034
I see now, you're a lot
better than I expected.

6
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:34,698
And having Vegeta run off on you
like that must have hurt too.

7
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:38,943
<i>l have to end this quickly.</i>

8
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:44,210
<i>Otherwise, what little hope</i>
<i>we have will be lost.</i>

9
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,455
This is a nice development.
From what I saw,

10
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:27,692
Kakarrot and Ginyu both have
about the same level of ability.

11
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:31,362
If I'm lucky, the two of them might
just take care of each other.

12
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:34,695
If that happens, I can't fail!

13
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:41,206
As soon as I get the password to have
my wish granted out of those runts,

14
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,708
I'll take care of them, too.

15
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:47,045
Then, once I make myself
immortally young,

16
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,708
I'll have a chance of beating
even Freeza in battle!

17
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:11,736
Gohan, no matter what it takes, we have
to borrow the Dragon Radar from Bulma-<i>san</i>,

18
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:17,408
and find the Dragon Balls before Freeza
gets the password from Grand Elder-<i>san</i>.

19
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:18,898
Right!

20
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:18,670
You certainly have impressive
speed for a Saiyan.

21
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,006
<i>Ginyu Special Corps Commander, Ginyu...</i>

22
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,066
...<i>Super Fighting Pose!!</i>

23
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,012
Like this?

24
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:32,016
F- fool! Your feet
are reversed! Your feet!

25
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,686
Oh, really?

26
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:40,024
You know, you guys all pose
in the strangest ways, huh?

27
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,694
I've never seen anything like it.

28
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:50,702
W- what!? Can't you grasp the splendor
of the Ultra Fighting Pose!?

29
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,038
It doesn't matter to me either way,
I'm running out of time.

30
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,474
Sorry to interrupt your big entrance,

31
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:59,043
but I have to end this right now.

32
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,103
Oh, aren't you the confident one?

33
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:11,723
This is the first time that I,
Ginyu-<i>sama</i>, have heard such insolence.

34
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,825
If you had dared to come
off to me like that

35
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,728
while we were sizing
each other up earlier,

36
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,357
I would not have hesitated
to knock you off your perch.

37
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,302
You see, like yourself,

38
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:30,070
I'm the type of fighter who can change
his level of battle power at will.

39
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:38,683
<i>That's the Commander Ginyu I know</i>
<i>so well. He's not at all agitated.</i>

40
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,118
<i>That's no surprise, I guess.</i>

41
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:44,188
<i>Even if that guy's battle power</i>
<i>really is around 60,000,</i>

42
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:48,750
<i>then Commander Ginyu's maximum</i>
<i>fighting power is much higher.</i>

43
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,591
Yikes!

44
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:10,174
Geez! What could everyone else
possibly be up to while I'm here,

45
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,377
struggling by myself like this?

46
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:16,547
How do I know they haven't
all forgotten about me,

47
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,716
and are just goofing around now?

48
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:21,953
Good grief, first my spaceship
gets all broken,

49
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:23,387
and I can't go back to Earth.

50
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,623
Then my transmitter gets all broken.

51
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:29,059
Nothing is going right.

52
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,197
All right, it's fixed!

53
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,564
That certainly did take up
a lot of time and effort.

54
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,346
W- what was that just now?

55
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:57,755
A- all seven of them are in
the same place, aren't they?

56
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:01,425
I- I'll just bet they were
going to leave me behind,

57
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:06,089
while they went and made
their wish to Shen Long! All right!

58
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:30,721
<i>But suppose the person who has gathered</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls is Vegeta, instead?</i>

59
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,723
Not again!

60
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:35,715
W- what is it with
this planet anyway?

61
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:41,332
I know! Even if it is Vegeta,
I can just say,

62
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:44,735
" Send me back to Earth" first!

63
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,071
Hey, that's simple
enough, isn't it?

64
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:50,404
With that settled,
I'm off to the Dragon Balls!

65
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,734
Let's go!

66
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,684
<i>All right...</i>

67
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:18,883
He's fast! He might
have the edge on speed!

68
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,196
Oh, crap!

69
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,900
I managed to bottle you up
there pretty good!

70
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,711
Dammit!

71
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:52,049
Commander! He's all ours now!

72
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,071
Damn... he's got incredible
power! I can't get free!

73
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:12,407
Commander! You can shatter his bones
any time now, and finish him off!

74
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:20,416
<i>l</i>- <i>l'm out of options! At this point,</i>
<i>l'll have to use Kaio-ken...</i>

75
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:23,581
Wha-?

76
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,414
C- Commander!

77
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:35,230
Who asked you to help, Jheese?

78
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,713
C- Commander!

79
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:56,053
If you pull anything uncalled-for like
that again, consider yourself dead!

80
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,577
Yes, sir.

81
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,414
And as for you!

82
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:06,730
You're still hiding your
true power level, even now!

83
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,222
Did you really think
I wouldn't be able to tell?

84
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:18,342
Perhaps you were planning on saving
that energy for a battle with Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

85
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:20,778
Don't you dare take me so lightly!

86
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:26,016
I'm itching for a good fight, the kind
I don't get to enjoy every day,

87
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:29,019
so cut out your silly charade!

88
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,692
Okay, you got it.
I'll show you my true power.

89
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:38,729
Very good. I doubt you'll
be able to rest in peace

90
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,365
if you're killed without
using all of your power.

91
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:45,035
Use that device of yours that
reads your opponent's power,

92
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:49,373
and take a good look at my rating!

93
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:52,042
I won't even need to
look at my Scouter.

94
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:57,537
Your rating should only rise
to around 85,000.

95
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,613
<i>Kaio-ken!</i>

96
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,467

108,000!

100
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,489
I- impossible!

101
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,927
109,000...

102
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,440
110,000!

103
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,715
110,000! It can't be!

104
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,617
I- it's still going up!

108
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:42,068
