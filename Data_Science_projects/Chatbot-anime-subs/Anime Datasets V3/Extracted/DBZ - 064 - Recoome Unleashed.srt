1
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:59,042
Okay, Vegeta-<i>chan</i>, now it's our turn.

2
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:07,892
You two little pipsqueaks there,
give Vegeta-<i>chan</i> a hand.

3
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:12,564
Use as many dirty tricks as you need to.

4
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:18,662
Hey, ReaCoom! Don't kill the little ones!
<i>We're</i> going to kill them, after all!

5
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:23,132
Leave a little treat for us, too!

6
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:28,246
Dammit!

7
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,009
Why, that jerk!

8
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,588
Ginyu...

9
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:40,258
...Special Corps...

10
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:43,523
ReaCoom!!

11
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:09,550
Hey, what's going on here? Vegeta-<i>chan</i>'s
power level just rose to upwards of 30,000!

12
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:16,042
Get down!

13
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:25,321
More! More! More!

14
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,519
H- he got him.

15
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:03,360
Incredible... He ended it all in one instant.
Vegeta has ridiculous strength, all right.

16
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,043
Hey, it couldn't be, right?

17
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:25,557
A- a <i>Ki</i>! H- he's alive!
That guy is alive!

18
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,152
H- he couldn't be... N- no way...

19
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,664
Hi!

20
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:46,844
H- he's taken hardly any damage at all!

21
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,845
That's enough for the warm-up exercises.

22
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:59,924
ReaCoom is trying to look cool,
and we're getting all dusty over here!

23
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,189
Our cleaning bill
is going to be outrageous.

24
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,201
W- what kind of monster is he?

25
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:14,934
How is it that we have to get the Dragon
Balls back from someone like this?

26
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,803
Whoops!

27
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:30,889
That was close, that was close.
I almost screwed up.

28
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,325
I have to make sure to
deliver these to Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

29
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,506
<i>Planet Namek.</i>

30
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:52,911
<i>Environment: moderate;</i>
<i>culture level: low;</i>

31
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:54,913
<i>practical resources: none;</i>

32
00:05:54,913 --> 00:06:00,681
<i>scouting industrial space,</i>
<i>commercial space, and residential space.</i>

33
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,859
Such a worthless planet, huh?
Perhaps I will make it a planet for exiles.

34
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:11,529
There are any number of planets
like this one in the universe.

35
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:15,522
I doubt there would be any value
in going to the trouble of developing it.

36
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:25,209
I will be acquiring the Dragon Balls shortly,
so I will have no further business here.

37
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:30,548
I know. As we are leaving,
I will turn this planet into fireworks.

38
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:31,883
F- fireworks?

39
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:36,554
Yes. To celebrate my eternal life.

40
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:39,546
A big, flashy " boom."

41
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:45,229
Are there any other planets we can sell
for development at a high price?

42
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,392
Y- yes, sir, I will investigate at once.

43
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:59,232
<i>Dragon Balls... how delightful...</i>

44
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,416
Well, should we get started?

45
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:17,093
<i>ReaCoom Kick!!</i>

46
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,697
V- Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

47
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:52,897
Good! That's pretty good, Vegeta-<i>chan</i>!
You're better than I thought, huh?

48
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:55,229
<i>ReaCoom Elbow!!</i>

49
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:15,920
He got him!

50
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,854
<i>Speed Up!!</i>

51
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,690
Yoo-hoo!

52
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,615
Way to go, ReaCoom!

53
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,708
Whoo! Whoo!

54
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,218
Thanks, guys!

55
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:40,196
V- Vegeta-<i>san</i>...

56
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,614
What's the matter, Vegeta-<i>chan</i>?

57
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:53,880
You can't possibly be
finished after that, right?

58
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,024
You're still pretty spirited, huh?
Good for you!

59
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,050
Hey, now, are you okay?

60
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:05,889
Don't tell me you've kicked
the bucket already, have you?

61
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,344
D- did he get him?

62
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:48,698
Okay...

63
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:58,609
Nice, nice, that's more like it.

64
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:04,282
There's the reason why Freeza-<i>sama</i>
adored you so much, long ago, huh?

65
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:08,378
But why would you turn your
back on him, Vegeta-<i>chan</i>?

66
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:14,214
ReaCoom is the same as ever, huh?

67
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,490
He's got a nasty personality.

68
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:22,828
What a freak!

69
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:27,238
Don't you have any techniques
with more panache than that?

70
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:31,575
If not, then it's about time
I killed you. Is that okay?

71
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:39,583
<i>Y</i>- <i>you monster! Damn it...</i>
<i>To think he'd be this strong...</i>

72
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:44,350
<i>lt's almost as though he's</i>
<i>treating me like a toddler...</i>

73
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,028
<i>lf it keeps going like this,</i>
<i>l'm going to get killed by him...</i>

74
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:55,266
G- Gohan...

75
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,600
Yes?

76
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,605
I- if Vegeta gets done in, then it
will be our turn to get killed next.

77
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,942
M- make no mistake,
there's no way we can beat him.

78
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:08,212
I'm sure that not even Goku could.

79
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:13,551
At this point, it's all or nothing.
Let's charge him!

80
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:14,779
Right!

81
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,822
All righty...

82
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:26,230
Your life is mine!

83
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,166
There it is!
ReaCoom's 18th final pose.

84
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:37,166
Poor Vegeta-<i>chan</i>. The life
of a flower is so short, huh?

85
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:59,859
Okay, I'll finish you with this.

86
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:05,603
All right... let's go, Gohan!

87
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:11,876
Vegeta doesn't have the strength left
to avoid ReaCoom's quick attacks.

88
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,210
Right!

89
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,371
<i>ReaCoom...</i>

90
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:20,479
<i>...Eraser Gun!!</i>

91
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,814
Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

92
00:14:55,252 --> 00:15:00,189
Move! You're in my way!
W- who asked you to do that!?

93
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:16,540
Y- you idiot! If you had time to rescue me,
why didn't you attack ReaCoom!?

94
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,807
For crying out loud, your softness
makes me want to vomit!

95
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:38,896
The ground's surface has been blown away,
and the planet's shape has changed...

96
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,660
What a terrifying beast!

97
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,574
That sneak attack just now
was a pretty good one.

98
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,578
Coming down from directly
above shut my mouth.

99
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:59,845
As a result, my teeth are messed up.
I think I might be a little bit mad.

100
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:05,521
Hey, Butta, Jheese!

101
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:10,528
Let me take out these
two little squirts, too!

102
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:14,157
Do you mind? Okay?
Do you mind?

103
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,201
What choice do we have?

104
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,037
Okay, fine! Do as you please.

105
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:25,543
In exchange, you're going to treat us
to chocolate parfaits later!

106
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:30,537
Okay! You heard him, maggot-<i>kun</i>.

107
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:45,218
<i>Big Fire Toe Attack!!</i>

108
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,236
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

109
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,239
Kuririn-<i>san</i>! Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

110
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:59,410
M- my bones...
How can this be?

111
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,582
With just one hit...
this is what happens to me...

112
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:07,518
He's too much...

113
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:10,421
I- is this allowed?

114
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:15,526
And after having Grand Elder-<i>san</i>
raise my power, too...

115
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,528
I- I'm no use at all...

116
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:22,866
S- shake it off, Kuririn-<i>san</i>!
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

117
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:27,204
F- frankly, we're finished...

118
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:31,542
We're powerless against them, and if
we run, they'll catch us right away...

119
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:35,212
And the Dragon Balls
have been taken from us...

120
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:39,376
There's nothing good about this...

121
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:46,223
Tch! Aw, man... I couldn't help
myself, and hit him too hard.

122
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:50,227
I was planning to play around
with him a little more, but too bad.

123
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:54,561
Now then, for the next
little pipsqueak's turn...

124
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,235
Darn it!

125
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,903
G- Gohan...

126
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:06,069
I- I'll do as much as I can!
Just you watch me!

127
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,910
This should be interesting.

128
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,845
Darn it...

129
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:36,707
<i>ReaCoom is an incredible foe.</i>

130
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:41,872
<i>Will Gohan be able to get through</i>
<i>this greatest of pinches?</i>
