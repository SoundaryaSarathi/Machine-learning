00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,903
Einstein and Hawking.

2
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:08,805
Geniuses are valuable because they
help make the world more peaceful.

3
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,534
I won't let them fall into
the hands of evil!

4
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,873
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon
will punish you.

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,107
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute

Shinjite iru no miracle romance

14
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,278
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old.
I'm in the 8th grade.

15
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:02,486
I'm clumsier than others and a bit
of a crybaby. That's about it.

16
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:06,562
One day, a strange black cat,
Luna, appeared

17
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:10,699
and gave me a peculiar transforming
brooch and made me a sailor warrior.

18
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,736
But, she wants me to fight
against bad guys.

19
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:16,136
That makes me really nervous.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,465
Oh well, I guess everything
will be okay.

21
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:31,211
Is the Genius Girl a Monster?
Brainwashing School of Terror

22
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:37,393
Right now, the children of Japan
are forced to study day after day

23
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,951
and they are suffering.

24
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:42,264
I have heard that there are
more and more mothers

25
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:46,496
who are called "academic moms" who
push their children mercilessly.

26
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,338
The parents are desperate
to send their children

27
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:52,705
to the best kindergarten,
the best primary school,

28
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,975
the best junior high school,
the best high school

29
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,348
and the best college.

30
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:02,585
And? What about after graduating
from the best college?

31
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,687
What do they do?

32
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,655
I am not quite certain.

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,425
I will leave it to you.

34
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:09,825
Yes, my lady.
I will leave it to you.

35
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:10,587
Yes, my lady.

36
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,786
Girls 5

37
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:20,703
Usagi!

38
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:24,195
Oh, Mom. Look! This is so funny!

39
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,910
This is no time to be laughing.

40
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:31,947
How did you do on that mock exam?

41
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:34,550
Oh, that? The results are
coming out tomorrow.

42
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,074
I can't believe you asked.

43
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:40,118
Usagi, I won't ask for the impossible.

44
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,180
But please, just don't fail.

45
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:50,533
No matter what, if there's
a kid in first place,

46
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:53,024
there's always a kid in last place too!

47
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,669
It's not fair to yell at that kid just
because her grades are bad!

48
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:03,607
You don't study, but you're always
ready with an excuse.

49
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:06,311
I'm the one who wants to cry!

50
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:16,425
Good girl. It's about time
you started studying.

51
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:19,189
Obviously, you don't care about me.
It must be nice to be a cat.

52
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,163
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:23,961
Oh, I wish I could be a cat.

54
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,303
Maybe, you don't know,
but I've got lots to do,

55
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:29,204
like finding the princess.

56
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,399
Oh, you're reading a comic book!

57
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:39,481
I wish you would put more effort
into finding the princess too.

58
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,846
But...

59
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,615
Find the princess and fight
against the enemy.

60
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:47,556
That is your fate and
you can't escape it.

61
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,046
You can't do this to me!

62
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,892
Besides, who is this enemy anyway?

63
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,730
Something very evil that's not human.

64
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,931
I don't really get it.

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,168
To be honest, I don't really know
who they are either.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,188
Please try the Sailor V game.

67
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,122
Sailor V
GAME
Please try the Sailor V game.

68
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,424
Sailor V

Code name 0091. This is Luna.

69
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:27,563
My secret password is "The rabbit
on the moon makes rice cakes."

70
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:29,698
"The moon rice cakes are sticky."

71
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:31,859
"When I grilled them,
they puffed up."

72
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,703
Have you found the princess?

73
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:37,137
Not yet. I still have no clue
where she is.

74
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,108
I see.

75
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:42,845
Sailor Moon is not as dependable
as I thought she would be.

76
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:45,147
I understand; do not grumble so.

77
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:49,379
Yes. By the way, I sensed a new
and strange energy.

78
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,317
This is her.

79
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:59,028
It could be another monster
sent by our enemy.

80
00:05:59,028 --> 00:05:59,795
That's what I thought.

81
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:00,362
Investigate her quickly.
That's what I thought.

82
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,230
Investigate her quickly.

83
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,254
Yes, I will.

2. Eisaku Yoshida
3. Takashi Kitano

90
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,905
As expected, Ami Mizuno's
at the top of our class.

91
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,144
Not only that, she's the best
in the country!

92
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,112
What?! The best in the country?

93
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,881
According to rumors...

94
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:22,282
Her IQ is supposedly 300.

95
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:25,187
Wow, she really is a genius.

96
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,555
Yes.

97
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:31,527
By the way, don't pop up suddenly
from such weird places!

98
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,154
Oh, it's Miss Mizuno!

99
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,173
I heard she attends
Crystal Cram School.

100
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:47,710
Hey, that's the new place
they just built, right?

101
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,446
My mom told me that
it's really expensive.

102
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:52,607
I heard that Miss Mizuno's mom
is a doctor.

103
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,484
They're probably rich.

104
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:59,147
However, she's on a scholarship,
so she's attending for free!

105
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:02,524
But she's got a bad attitude.

106
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,927
It's like she thinks she's better
than everybody else.

107
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:08,090
Oh, I can't stand people like that.

108
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:16,939
It's such a nice day!

109
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:17,506
Yeah, it is!
It's such a nice day!

110
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,495
Yeah, it is!

111
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:24,243
But, it must be nice to be so smart.

112
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,305
I always have to worry that Mom's
going to kill me.

113
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:28,984
Usagi! It's about time you started
going to a cram school!

114
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,386
No! No!
Usagi! It's about time you started
going to a cram school!

115
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:31,909
Usagi! It's about time you started
going to a cram school!

116
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:42,787
Oh, Miss Mizuno.

117
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,171
A cat?

118
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,943
I sense a strange energy
coming from this girl.

119
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,308
Oh, now's not the time!

120
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,390
You're so soft.

121
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,125
If only we didn't live in
a high-rise apartment,

122
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,956
I could get a nice cat too.

123
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,663
Luna!

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,568
Sorry, are you okay?

125
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,043
Is that your cat?

126
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,067
Yeah.

127
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:32,675
Since she came from the sky,
I thought she was an angel.

128
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:35,105
Luna an angel?

129
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,113
She's sweeter than I thought.

130
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:41,085
You're Miss Ami Mizuno
from Class 5, right?

131
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,926
I'm Usagi Tsukino from Class 1.
Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,060
Nice to meet you too.

133
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,296
This cat's name is Luna.

134
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,992
Luna? It means "moon", right?

135
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:54,762
You are a genius! You're the first
to know that right away!

136
00:08:56,538 --> 00:09:00,065
If I become friends with her, I can get
her to help me study for exams.

137
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:01,735
Usagi.

138
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:06,237
She could be a monster sent by
the enemy. So, be careful.

139
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,451
No way!

140
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,009
What's wrong? Laughing so suddenly?

141
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:14,223
Oh, it's nothing.

142
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:17,025
By the way, Miss Mizuno,
do you play games?

143
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,228
No, I've never tried before.

144
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,560
Then let's play some. I'll teach you
how to play.

145
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,660
And in exchange, when
tests come up...

146
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,968
Don't worry, Luna. I think you're
thinking too much.

147
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,945
Obviously, something's
wrong with me today.

148
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:51,151
Miss Mizuno, do you
want to try? It's fun.

149
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,326
But it looks difficult.

150
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:57,866
You're very observant! This game
really is pretty hard.

151
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,664
So, you'd be doing good if you can
score 500 points on your first try.

152
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:06,174
You're pretty good!

153
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,266
Really?

154
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,678
Wow! Amazing!

155
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,333
No way.

156
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,011
Wow, she got the highest score.

157
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:45,138
Huh? What? Oh, my...

158
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:48,283
Hi, Usagi. I didn't know you were here.

159
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,409
Yes!

160
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,886
Wow, she's amazing!

161
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,752
I know.

162
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,184
There goes my help on exams...

163
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,926
Oh, look at the time!

164
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:03,656
I'm sorry, Miss Tsukino, I have
to go to cram school!

165
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,063
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

166
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,036
I didn't know you had
cram school today.

167
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,333
I go everyday.

168
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:11,132
Everyday?

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,840
I don't have any talents
other than studying.

170
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,812
Well, thank you. I'll see you again.

171
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,547
Bye!

172
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:21,805
I feel like we live in completely
different worlds.

173
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,585
Usagi.

174
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:24,853
Yes!

175
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:25,520
By any chance...

176
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,154
Yes, what is it?
By any chance...

177
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:26,848
Yes, what is it?

178
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,790
I think this belongs to your friend.

179
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,558
Oh, is that all?

180
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:35,156
Oh, nothing.

181
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,923
I'll make sure she gets it!

182

184
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:44,806

Stupid human beings.

185
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:45,397
Stupid human beings.

186
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:50,173
Keep studying and provide us
with your brain energy.

187
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,159
Oh? My floppy's not here.

188
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,538
Did I drop it somewhere?

189
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,904
Oh, well. I don't use it much anyway.

190
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,635
Miss Mizuno.

191
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:31,236
Use the Crystal Disk and study hard.

192
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:34,749
You're on a scholarship,
so you mustn't be lazy.

193
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:36,376
Yes, Ma'am.

194
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,153
I have high expectations of you.

195
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:47,122
I hate to say it, but that disk
gives me a headache.

196
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,235
"If you use our newly developed
Crystal Disks,"

197
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,437
"even you can be a genius!"

198
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,574
So, is this the Crystal Disk?

199
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,899
Usagi, be careful.

200
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,276
I'm just going to return this disk.
You worry too much.

201
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,943
Are you finally in the mood to study
a little, dumpling head?

202
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,182
You again!

203
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,188
Why do you always show up
at the weirdest times?!

204
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:13,690
That's not my problem.

205
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,181
By the way, wasn't that cat
just talking?

206
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:24,359
Are you kidding? Cats can't talk!
You're so silly!

207
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,385
That was so close. It'd be big
trouble if he found out.

208
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,821
Oh, I was in a hurry and
forgot to return this.

209
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:48,416
It's all his fault!

210
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,056
Usagi, let's go to the computer
lab at school.

211
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,297
Why?

212
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,428
I want to check out that disk.

213
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,225
You think this is suspicious?

214
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,161
I'll just warn you now. I don't know
how to use a computer.

215
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,502
Luna, you are something!

216
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:13,009
Knowing how to use a computer is
normal these days, Miss Usagi.

217
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,677
Oh, really?

218
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:20,850
Look! I thought so.

219
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,452
Oh, no! What is this sound?!

220
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:30,024
Offer the energy of your brain and
knowledge to our great ruler,

221
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:31,468
and become our loyal followers.

222
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,703
This is a brainwashing program!
And become our loyal followers.

223
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,038
It can't be!

224
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:36,740
So, she is a monster!

225
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,707
Crystal Cram
School

226
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,209
Crystal Cram

I still can't believe it.

227
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:39,675
Crystal Cram
School

228
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,643
But it's a fact! Get ready!

229
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:43,936
Okay.

230
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,008
Moon Power!

231
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:50,982
Turn me into a doctor who works
at a university hospital!

232
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,190
I heard someone is sick here!

233
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,170
Everyone, get away from
the computers right now!

234
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:20,108
Who are you?! Don't interrupt
our studies!

235
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:23,350
So, you are a monster!

236
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,415
Huh? What are you talking about?

237
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,019
Don't play dumb!

238
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,187
Transform into Sailor Moon!

239
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:33,026
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

240
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,637
No way!

241
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:17,532
What?!

242
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:23,369
I am the monster of
knowledge, Garoben!

243
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:28,952
This genius girl is going to
sacrifice her brain energy

244
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,442
to our great ruler!

245
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:38,960
Which means Miss Mizuno
isn't a monster after all!

246
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:40,893
That's weird.

247
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,958
Stop this, evil villain!

248
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,101
Geniuses are valuable because they
help make the world more peaceful.

249
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,062
I won't let them fall into
the hands of evil!

250
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:55,172
Sailor warrior of love and
justice, Sailor Moon!

251
00:16:57,146 --> 00:17:00,047
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you.

252
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,881
Question number one!

253
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:07,051
Genius Newton question.

254
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,015
Why do apples fall from trees?

255
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,731
How should I know? Ask
the apples, not me!

256
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:17,529
You idiot! If you don't know
the answer, take this!

257
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,004
You idiot!

258
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:27,240
I know! Because a hurricane came!

259
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,109
Oh! Luna!

260
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,549
I can't believe you! It's because
the Earth has gravity!

261
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,312
Because the Earth has gravity!

262
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,255
Then question number two!

263
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:45,452
What is gravity? Explain in
less than 50 words!

264
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,453
That's impossible!

265
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,667
If you cannot answer,
this is what happens.

266
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,134
What?! No way!

267
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,763
Come on, wait a minute!

268
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:56,798
Now is my chance!

269
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,804
Give up your genius brain energy!

270
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,648
It's not absorbing her energy.

271
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:12,585
Why is that?

272
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,626
You didn't use the Crystal Disk,
did you?!

273
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,722
You should study on your own
without using machines!

274
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,261
You impudent little...

275
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:33,204
What... What is this?!

276
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,870
That mark is...

277
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:42,745
I see! That strange energy was
from a sailor warrior...

278
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,556
Then, I'll just take your brain instead!

279
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,230
Prepare yourself!

280
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,047
Ami!

281
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,139
Use this!

282
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,610
Say, "Mercury Power Makeup!"

283
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:28,163
Mercury Power Makeup!

284
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:46,342
So, Ami is the second sailor warrior,
Sailor Mercury.

285
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,709
Ami?

286
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,587
Say, "Bubble Spray!"

287
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,020
Bubble

288
00:19:58,294 --> 00:19:59,761
Spray!

289
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:04,855
What?!

290
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,097
Where did she go?

291
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,899
I'm getting cold.

292
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:14,735
What?

293
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,671
Shoot!

294
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,144
I have you now!

295
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,682
You fell for it!

296
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:27,657
Shoot!

297
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:29,559
Now, Sailor Moon!

298
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,526
Okay!

299
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:49,935
Moon Tiara Action!

300
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:13,630
Everyone, it's okay now!

301
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,292
I...

302
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:19,507
Yes, you're the second sailor
warrior, Sailor Mercury.

303
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,340
Sailor Mercury!

304
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,554
Sorry for mistaking you
for a monster.

305
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:33,156
That's okay.

306
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:37,360
But it's reassuring to have you
as one of us. Right, Luna?

307
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,995
Definitely.

308
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,292
Oh, thank you.

309
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,033
Especially when I need
to get ready for tests.

310
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,234
Usagi.

311
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:46,435
Yes?

312
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,371
Once again, I'm glad to meet you.

313
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:52,273
Let's work together, so we
can beat the bad guys!

314
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:55,776
Me too! I'm glad I met you!

315
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:02,316
She's such a tough girl, I think
I might not be able to keep up.

316
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:12,830
Yume no naka futari de ita yo ne
