1
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,517
Ah, yes, that way, please.

2
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:40,811
Be careful.

3
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:51,932
The Chicago-to-New York
transcontinental express, <i>Flying Pussyfoot.</i>

4
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:56,159
It's a mobile ornament, built by Nebula.

5
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:59,830
Its design is taken from the English royal train,

6
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:04,517
and these first-class cars,
which are usually in the rear,

7
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:09,423
are said to be up front because
the sculpting complements all the ornamentation.

8
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,136
Still, it does feel a little ostentatious, huh?

9
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:15,846
Let's not get on.

10
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,056
Why not?

11
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,008
Something not right is going to happen.
This train is cursed.

12
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:27,065
Hey, now, is this the same
sixth sense you always get?

13
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,109
Has it ever been wrong?

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,688
It's going to be terrible.
A lot of people are going to die.

15
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,201
The only ones who will survive
are those with fairly good luck, and...

16
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,746
And?

17
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,540
Probably...

18
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,045
...those who are not human, I'd say.

19
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,056
Hey, Isaac?

20
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,767
What, Miria?

21
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,220
What are we doing here?

22
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,342
We're digging for <i>kin</i>, Miria.

23
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:09,848
By <i>kin</i>, you mean, "gold," right?

24
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,512
Yeah, that's right, Miria.

25
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,682
This is a once-in-a-lifetime big job for us!

26
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:19,102
After all, we're stealing <i>kin</i> from the earth.

27
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:21,858
By "earth," you mean, this planet, right?

28
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,039
Yeah, that's right, Miria.

29
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:29,085
No one has ever tried to
steal from the earth before!

30
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:33,702
By which I mean, our names are
going to go down in history, Miria!

31
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:35,342
Incredible!

32
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,168
All right, let's go, Miria!

33
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,878
Let's go!

34
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,306
Ready, set...

35
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,106
Hey, Isaac?

36
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,109
What, Miria?

37
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,888
People usually take gold out of the river,

38
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:57,114
so why are we digging a hole?

39
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:02,522
That's something that hopeless
amateurs who don't know better do.

40
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,818
But then, when we tried to
pan out a little gold dust there,

41
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,112
some men made a lot of
noise about us being on their turf,

42
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,335
That was humiliating, huh?

43
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:14,658
However, I saw a centipede out
in front of this abandoned mine.

44
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:18,468
A huge one, that had
many hundreds of legs!

45
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,527
Word is that in the Orient,
centipedes are the gods of gold mining.

46
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,628
That's when I became convinced

47
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,922
that a whole bunch of
gold was coming out of here!

48
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,680
Wow! We haven't found
a single nugget yet, but

49
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,732
that's incredible!!

50
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,827
Oh, yeah, Isaac...

51
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,830
What, Miria?

52
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,166
We got a letter from Ennis.

53
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,544
Oh, and what does it say?

54
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,948
"Dear Isaac-<i>san</i> and Miria-<i>san,</i>

55
00:04:55,948 --> 00:05:00,302
Almost a year has passed
since you left New York.

56
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,372
Everything is the same here,

57
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:06,463
but we sure do miss having
the lively pair of you around.

58
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,968
Why not knock off your
unsuccessful gold mining for now,

59
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,439
and come this way to visit us?

60
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,848
Isaac-<i>san</i> and Miria-<i>san,</i>

61
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:20,405
I feel like you two are
my own brother and sister.

62
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:25,702
The real brother and sister
that I never got to meet.

63
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:32,818
When I think of everyone
that was created before I was,

64
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,336
I feel very sorrowful,

65
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:38,924
but thanks to you, Isaac-<i>san</i> and
Miria-<i>san</i>, I am able to get past it."

66
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,011
Hey, Isaac?

67
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,515
What, Miria?

68
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:51,228
Does Ennis mean that
her older siblings are already dead?

69
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:57,012
No, no, you're wrong. You're wrong, Miria.

70
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:01,018
Um, "was made"? "Never got to meet"?

71
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:03,427
You see, what she means is...

72
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,283
Yeah, that's it!

73
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,828
She wants a younger brother!

74
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:14,793
So you mean, she's like a happy little
problem child, pestering her mother?

75
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,493
Yeah, that's right, Miria.

76
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:22,342
That's it. Ennis is happy, you see?

77
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:32,048
Well, Isaac, we're not Ennis's
mama, so we can't do anything, huh?

78
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:35,355
Nope. Unfortunately, you're right, Miria.

79
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,098
Instead, let's come up with some
amazing gift, and go to New York!

80
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:43,217
But Isaac, we don't have any money at all.

81
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:45,438
Well then, let's commit a train robbery.

82
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,450
Ah, fantastic!

83
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,068
By the way, a train robbery is where

84
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,988
you take the train to a destination,
do the robbery,

85
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,397
then get on the train again and flee,

86
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,795
isn't it?

87
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,173
That's right, Isaac!

88
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,122
All right! Then, like we've done before...

89
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:08,179
Let's steal some money from
the Mafia, who do bad things!

90
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,878
<i>Strike</i>! <i>The count is 2-and-2.</i>

91
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,968
<i>Will the batter be able to</i>
<i>come from behind and deliver?</i>

92
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,522
<i>Yes, he'd certainly want to go for broke here.</i>

93
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,428
<i>The pitcher winds up... and throws</i>!

94
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:21,314
Wham!

95
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:22,484
<i>He hits it</i>!

96
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,484
Wham!

97
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,905
<i>It's going... it's going...</i>

98
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,824
<i>it's gone</i>! <i>A home run</i>!

99
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:27,949
Hold it--

100
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:32,329
<i>The crowd is cheering wildly</i>!

101
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,108
What do you think, Miria?!

102
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:37,542
It's incredible, Isaac!
We're champions of justice!

103
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:45,508
Wow, incredible!

104
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:45,675
J-Just a minute...

105
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,218
J-Just a minute...
Look at that, Miria.

106
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,292
Oh, what's that?

107
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:55,548
Just to be safe, the orchestra will be riding
in the freight hold, if that's all right with you.

108
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:57,422
No, that's out of my hands--

109
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,189
We have received permission.

110
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,984
Ah, in that case, there is no problem.

111
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,558
Our instruments are delicate,
you understand.

112
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:07,697
Carry them in.

113
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:13,828
Miria! A symphony!
An orchestra! Mozart! Paul Dukas!

114
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,373
And Beethoven, huh?

115
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,167
Tony-<i>san</i>, nice work, there.

116
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:23,977
Nice work, yourself.
You're as energetic as ever, huh?

117
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:28,237
Yeah. I finally get to ride
aboard the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>, after all.

118
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,820
I just can't bring myself
to be fond of this train,

119
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,827
but maybe a youngster
like you will enjoy it more.

120
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,894
What are you talking about?
Tony-<i>san</i>, you're not through yet.

121
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:43,233
I'm retiring after this go-round.
I've already told the company so.

122
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:45,905
You mean it?

123
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:50,058
I'm old. This is your era now.

124
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,031
Tony-<i>san...</i>

125
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,995
I'm counting on you. This is a special train.

126
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:55,745
Right!

127
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,751
Oh, there's a fine woman!

128
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:06,548
Don't you think so? Huh? Huh?

129
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,181
What do I do? What do I do?

130
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,351
I heard there was going to be
some sort of lookout in the freight hold!

131
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,088
It's all right.

132
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:23,802
It looks like what we're after is
going to be loaded into another hold.

133
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:24,858
B-But...

134
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,087
T-Take it easy.

135
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:30,377
I'll take care of the lookout.

136
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,380
N-N-No, no, you can't!

137
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,062
Donny, if you do anything,
you'll die! No! No!

138
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,108
It'll be all right... probably...

139
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,956
P-Probably isn't good enough!

140
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,584
We've made a hidden room
in the freight hold.

141
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,948
As long as nothing
comes up, no one will find it.

142
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:47,464
What might come up?

143
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,550
An explosion, or something.

144
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,432
They're in black, huh, Isaac?

145
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,588
I wonder what kind of rich folk
there's going to be,

146
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:03,897
riding in first class aboard this thing.

147
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:12,733
Ah, first off, there's that
black-suited orchestra, huh?

148
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,783
They're all in white, Miria!

149
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,467
See?

150
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:20,789
Doesn't it feel great,
with them accentuating the contrast between us?

151
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:27,607
Hey, has anyone seen who
else is going to be aboard?

152
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:28,963
Over there.

153
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,969
Senator Beriam's wife and daughter.

154
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,973
I've seen them in the newspaper,
so I know I'm not wrong.

155
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:44,854
Oh... they must really be
enjoying their way in the world.

156
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,678
Riding in first class,

157
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:52,654
I'll bet they think they're
going to be in for quite a safe trip.

158
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,741
Okay, let's get going.

159
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,037
We're going to care for these poor
passengers like our own livestock.

160
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,206
We'll despise them...

161
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,709
...like maggots...

162
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,715
...lovingly...

163
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:15,510
...angrily... carefully... carefully...

164
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,180
What do you say? Let's grind them up!

165
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,309
Ladd!

166
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,897
Ta-da! I got us a conductor's uniform!

167
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,780
You're the best.

168
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:39,364
They're all in white, huh?

169
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,483
I wonder if they're having a wedding
on the train, or something.

170
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:46,204
A happy wedding, right? A big bash, right?

171
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:51,584
Yeah! This is indeed a train fit
for us to be doing our train robbery on!

172
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:55,675
Eh? We've already done it, and
we're running away on the train, right?

173
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,431
That's part of the train robbery, too!

174
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,237
They departed on schedule.

175
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,365
And the item?

176
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,700
It's safe. However...

177
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,996
Your wife and daughter are aboard.

178
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,528
You're certain?

179
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,166
I checked the list of names.

180
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:35,543
The item is in the last car,
furthest away from the first-class car.

181
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:38,718
If anything were to happen,
I believe they would be safe.

182
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:44,265
It is also possible to force the train to stop,
and get just the two of them off.

183
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:48,145
It doesn't matter. Stick to the plan.

184
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:49,144
But sir...

185
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,981
It's a matter of which is more important.

186
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:56,195
The item, or my family.

187
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,236
Senator Beriam...

188
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,990
If anything does happen,

189
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,244
such is my wife and daughter's fate.

190
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,187
I told you not to talk about that here.

191
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:15,578
But Youn, coming at night didn't do any good.

192
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:19,578
It's too risky.
They say this is a high-grade package.

193
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:22,277
It's supposed to be a new type of bomb.

194
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:23,628
Thanks for waiting.

195
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,597
B-Bomb?!

196
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,557
Thank you for waiting.

197
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,838
T-They just said it <i>might</i> be, right? Right?

198
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:31,117
They were certain of it.

199
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:34,107
O-oh, man... if it were
to explode or anything...

200
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,608
That would be neat, wouldn't it?

201
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:40,478
That's Nice for you.
Living up to her reputation as a bomb fiend.

202
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,157
Cut it out, would you? It's embarrassing.

203
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,148
A-Are we really able to steal it?

204
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,028
Are we? Are we?

205
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,108
With me along, it'll be all right.

206
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:52,778
B-But...

207
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,127
Knock on wood.

208
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,880
That's right, Miria!

209
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,967
Are they actors, or something?

210
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,987
They've been ordering nothing
but Chinese dishes for a while now.

211
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:06,458
And honey green tea.

212
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,958
W-Why?

213
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,145
Who knows?

214
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,685
Why don't you try talking to them?

215
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:15,064
Go on and talk to them.

216
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,107
We were right, Miria!
Go on and talk to them.

217
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:16,232
Go on and talk to them.

218
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:16,607
Incredible, Isaac!
Go on and talk to them.

219
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:16,733
Incredible, Isaac!

220
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:17,859
Incredible, Isaac!
It will be fun, won't it?

221
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:18,026
Incredible, Isaac!

222
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:18,735
Incredible, Isaac!
B-But... I'm scared!

223
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,405
B-But... I'm scared!

224
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:23,348
They could be movie stars.

225
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:26,701
It would be kind of cool
if you got chummy with them, wouldn't it?

226
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,272
You think so?

227
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:30,371
I sure do.

228
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,710
U-Um...

229
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,255
Stop teasing Jacuzzi so much, would you?

230
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:43,009
That's not what I'm doing, Youn-<i>san</i>. I just...

231
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,748
...want Jacuzzi to be a little more sociable.

232
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:48,332
I have to say, buddy,

233
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:49,766
that looks really cool!

234
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,727
I've never seen anyone
with a tattoo right on their face!

235
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,479
It's like culture shock, huh?

236
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,758
By any chance, are <i>you</i> a movie star?

237
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,609
Huh?! Incredible!

238
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:08,728
N-No, I-I'm not a movie star,
I make... and sell... liquor...

239
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:09,619
And? And?

240
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,165
No... that's not true...

241
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:15,238
I'm just a delinquent,
or whatever you'd call it.

242
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,250
And? And?

243
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,629
A-Anyhow, I'm just a normal person...

244
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,175
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

245
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:28,582
I'm not sure why,
but he's suddenly apologizing to us.

246
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:29,792
What do we do, Miria?

247
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:32,048
From a win-or-lose standpoint, we've won, huh?

248
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,893
Oh, we've won, have we, Miria?

249
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,258
It was a good match!

250
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:39,802
Buddy, wipe those tears away,
and come sit over here!

251
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,393
Come on, have some Chinese cooking with us!

252
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,598
It's all-you-can-eat!

253
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:45,893
O-Okay...

254
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,281
No, it isn't.

255
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,398
Cows are herbivores, right?

256
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,148
Mm-hmm!

257
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,608
Which means that when you eat beef,

258
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:55,278
it also means that you're
eating meat and grass together!

259
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,402
You're so smart, Isaac!

260
00:15:57,402 --> 00:15:58,402
Aren't I?

261
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:02,463
If you eat something that's been eaten,
it means that you eat <i>that</i>, too!

262
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,015
And it's not just food, either!

263
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,385
If you pick up something
that something else is carrying...

264
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:12,265
...it all becomes yours!

265
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,128
If a person is carrying a bag full of money,

266
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:18,355
then they're carrying
both the money and the bag!

267
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,508
Yay! They're rich!

268
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:23,098
They have an expression
for this over in the Orient.

269
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,722
"And then I went..." um...

270
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:27,642
"...and ate you."

271
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,007
Yeah, that's it!

272
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,241
Oh, is that right? That's funny.

273
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,951
Oh, is that right? That's funny.
<i>I haven't seen Jacuzzi have</i>
<i>this much fun in a long time.</i>

274
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:32,076
<i>I haven't seen Jacuzzi have</i>
<i>this much fun in a long time.</i>

275
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,202
It is funny, huh?
<i>I haven't seen Jacuzzi have</i>
<i>this much fun in a long time.</i>

276
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,498
Jacuzzi?

277
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:39,125
I'm sorry!

278
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,587
Um, are you all right?

279
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,260
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.

280
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,390
Mary!

281
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm terribly sorry
my daughter disturbed you.

282
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,433
Oh, no, I should be apologizing to you.

283
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:05,610
What for?

284
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,978
Are you taking a family trip?

285
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:12,783
Yes. My daughter and I
are going to see my husband.

286
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,829
I'm Natalie Beriam.
My daughter's name is Mary.

287
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:21,477
J-Jacuzzi Splot. T-This is Nice-

288
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,528
Isaac and Miria!

289
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,587
Good evening!

290
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,340
G-Good evening.

291
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:31,636
I'm... Czeslaw Meyer.

292
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:36,367
I'm on my way to see
my family in New York.

293
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:39,878
You're so cute!
Just like Jacuzzi was, way back!

294
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:41,298
I really am sorry.

295
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:44,655
Oh, it's all right.
It's not like you did anything wrong.

296
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:48,098
Yeah, yeah! You <i>did</i> do
something wrong, and now...

297
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,558
You're gonna get eaten by the Rail Tracer!

298
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,058
M-Me?

299
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,153
That's right! Gobbled right up!

300
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,911
W-What's the Rail Tracer?

301
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:00,790
Oh, Jacuzzi, you don't know?

302
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,629
The Rail Tracer is...

303
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,748
...a monster, that comes chasing after trains.

304
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:14,582
It is cloaked in the darkness
of night, and little by little,

305
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,681
it draws closer to the train.

306
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,725
And it can change its shape into many things.

307
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,561
What happens when it catches up?

308
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,148
The people, you see... they all disappear...

309
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,928
Starting with the rear of the train,

310
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,905
gradually, one at a time...

311
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:34,949
Until finally, everyone is gone...

312
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:40,232
And the very existence
of that train just vanishes...

313
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,278
Ha, that's ridiculous.

314
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,959
But what's even more frightening...

315
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,873
More frightening...

316
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,828
When you tell this story on a train,

317
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,413
it comes to that train, too.

318
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,845
The Rail Tracer!!

319
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:02,128
T-This is terrible! We're gonna get wiped out!

320
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,218
Take it easy, Jacuzzi.

321
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:09,191
There is one way
to keep the Rail Tracer from coming here.

322
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,610
Only one?

323
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,967
Yes. And that is...

324
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,533
Oh, just a minute. It's time.

325
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,381
It's time.

326
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:36,218
Split up into teams of three,
as planned, and get to work.

327
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:40,292
So, um, in order to be spared, you see...

328
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:44,298
I know of a similar sort of story.

329
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:47,592
And you want to swap ways to be saved, right?

330
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:50,941
Oh, it's a simple story.

331
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:55,279
A story about the ghosts they call "Lemures."

332
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,677
We no longer have any blood relatives.

333
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:02,119
All we have is our allegiance
to Master Huey Laforet.

334
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:06,692
Our earnest wish is to
transcend both life and death,

335
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:10,628
and ultimately become one with Huey,
who has obtained eternal life!

336
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,630
We are the Lemures.

337
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,257
I want you to consider once again what it means

338
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,760
to call yourselves ghosts.

339
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,947
We are no longer afraid of death,

340
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:24,303
because we have become ghosts
while still alive.

341
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:26,852
So, in order to be spared...

342
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,428
What are you supposed to do again, Miria?

343
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,592
I don't know.

344
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:33,428
This is the first time
I'm hearing about this, too.

345
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,722
O-o-oh, no!

346
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,863
I've heard the story.

347
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,688
R-Really?

348
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,728
Yeah.

349
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:43,911
From the young conductor
on this train, as I recall.

350
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:49,166
Isaac-<i>san</i>! I-I'm going to go ask him
right now how to be saved!

351
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:53,546
Sorry, he's a bit of a scaredy-cat.

352
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:54,046
Sorry, he's a bit of a scaredy-cat.
<i>Why did I give my real name out earlier?</i>

353
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:54,171
<i>Why did I give my real name out earlier?</i>

354
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,091
Jacuzzi is a hell of a guy, huh, Miria?
<i>Why did I give my real name out earlier?</i>

355
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:57,216
<i>Why did I give my real name out earlier?</i>

356
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:57,675
Well, we'll have to let him win later.
<i>Why did I give my real name out earlier?</i>

357
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:57,800
Well, we'll have to let him win later.

358
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,510
Well, we'll have to let him win later.
<i>Is there an immortal among them?</i>

359
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,635
<i>Is there an immortal among them?</i>

360
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,594
Yeah! Let's let him win a round!
<i>Is there an immortal among them?</i>

361
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:00,845
Yeah! Let's let him win a round!

362
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,012
Yeah! Let's let him win a round!
It's scary, huh, Czes-<i>kun</i>?

363
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:02,138
It's scary, huh, Czes-<i>kun</i>?

364
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:02,888
Just one round, Isaac?
It's scary, huh, Czes-<i>kun</i>?

365
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:03,013
Just one round, Isaac?

366
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,598
Just one round, Isaac?
Huh? Oh, you're right.

367
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:04,723
Huh? Oh, you're right.

368
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,308
Okay, two rounds?
Huh? Oh, you're right.

369
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,812
There was a great leader among the ghosts.

370
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,928
But the United States
government arrested that man,

371
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:16,652
and is trying to keep it all hushed up.

372
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:22,283
This is a rite, to bring
our great teacher back to us again.

373
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,898
This train is our altar,

374
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,165
and the passengers are
no more than sacrifices.

375
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:28,622
Do not forget that.

376
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:30,958
Whoa.

377
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,503
What's the matter, Jacuzzi? What's the rush?

378
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:39,828
Oh, it's terrible!
This train just might vanish!

379
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:42,845
So I have to get to the conductor!

380
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,685
So then, the remaining ghosts had an idea.

381
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,798
They would take some passengers hostage,
including the family of a senator,

382
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:56,525
and demand that their leader be freed.

383
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,667
Our great teacher, Huey,

384
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:03,532
is going to be questioned by
the judiciary in New York tomorrow.

385
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:08,287
And so, this train has been chosen
to be a sacrifice for our teacher!

386
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,977
Have faith that our actions

387
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:15,158
will lead to the release and rescue of
our captive Master Huey!

388
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:16,337
Be right back.

389
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,423
Watch it, you little brat!

390
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,760
S-Sorry! Excuse me.

391
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,708
The train is in trouble!

392
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:30,157
T-That's why I have to get to
the conductor's compartment!

393
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:32,269
Anyhow, I'm sorry!

394
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:33,437
Wasn't that...

395
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:35,940
I'm sure of it.

396
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,444
Now then, as for
the all-important way to be spared...

397
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:45,199
Everyone who heard this story died right away.

398
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:49,912
They say there wasn't a single way
for any of them to be saved!

399
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:07,418
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

400
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:21,683
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

401
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,232
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

402
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:40,310
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

403
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:47,372
<i>I believe so</i>

404
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:54,422
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

405
00:23:54,422 --> 00:24:01,928
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

406
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:08,602
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

407
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:18,656
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

408
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,221
<i>Hey, Miria, what do you do</i>
<i>to get ready for a party?</i>

409
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:30,221
<i>First, you get people together.</i>

410
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:30,971
<i>Then what?</i>

411
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,141
<i>Then you make a lot of noise</i>!

412
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,601
<i>Miria, that's not getting ready,</i>
<i>that's the actual party.</i>

413
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,394
<i>Oh. Then, what do you do?</i>

414
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,938
<i>What do you do?</i>
