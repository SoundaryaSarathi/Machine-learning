<i>Genshiken</i>

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:23,668
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

3
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:29,708
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

4
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:34,308
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:39,218
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:43,058
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:45,718
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:52,738
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

9
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:58,938
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:04,208
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

11
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,608
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

12
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:14,858
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

13
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,628
<i>At this tempo!</i>

14
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:28,278
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

15
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,968
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

16
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:45,648
All right, this is more or
less the financial report.

17
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:47,318
Since we saved money
on the school festival...

18
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,188
...and had our activities suspended,
we have quite the budget...

19
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,028
Oh?

20
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:52,358
Look what I found, a sketchbook.

21
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:53,898
H-Hey, Kasukabe!

22
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:54,938
<i>Can I look through it?
H-Hey, Kasukabe!</i>

23
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:55,668
<i>Can I look through it?</i>

24
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,198
Wow.

25
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,938
<i>Pretty Menma</i>

26
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,878
Yow, it's full of models and figures.

27
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:11,918
No touching, okay?

28
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:14,848
Look, Saki, these are
costumes for you to wear.

29
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,028
Why not try them on, since you're here?

30
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:17,388
<i>Don't wanna see it, don't wanna hear it.
Why not try them on, since you're here?</i>

31
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,428
This is how I live, love it or leave it.

32
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,868
See ya.

33
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,408
<i>12, Problems and Countermeasures Arise When
an Organization Undergoes Reconstruction</i>

34
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:09,298
No more intruders left.

35
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:12,368
Yeah, I guess we're in gallery mode now.

36
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,418
Why don't we go?

37
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,688
Ohh, sure.

38
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:30,468
That's unusual...

39
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,478
Wanna get something to eat?

40
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,148
Let's do that.

41
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:54,278
What to get...

42
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,988
What's the matter?

43
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:07,988
That's not a safe place to be.

44
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:14,798
I figured you'd show up about now.

45
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,338
Oh, really...

46
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:21,508
I don't suppose you have some
plan to turn all this around?

47
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:22,878
Eh...

48
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,248
No, sorry, I don't...

49
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:32,818
Maybe this time you went a bit
too far, starting that fire...

50
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,758
Yeah...

51
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:40,488
But according to the information I've
procured, the club won't be disbanded.

52
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,088
Information?

53
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,538
A limited suspension of activities...

54
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,938
...with some volunteer work
during that time, I'd say.

55
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:54,548
Wouldn't it make you happier
to see Genshiken go away?

56
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:58,138
Uh well yeah, that is true.

57
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:06,388
It's like, gotten boring lately
having to meet at people's places.

58
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:11,268
Like it's no fun, not
how the group should be.

59
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:15,228
I don't think it's something you
should feel so responsible for.

60
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:18,528
They probably don't blame you
as much as they say they do.

61
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,968
That might be true.

62
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,978
But for all that...

63
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:31,408
Several days later, a formal
punishment was issued to Genshiken.

64
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:34,488
For one month from the day of
issue, suspension of club activities...

65
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,418
...no usage of the club office...

66
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:40,588
...and over 100 combined hours of
volunteer work between all members.

67
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:44,328
We were allowed to take things
we needed from the club room...

68
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:47,258
...as long as it didn't
amount to too much.

69
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,888
Should we keep this in someone's room?

70
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,268
Good idea, we can use it for New Year's.

71
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,638
Get some controllers and games too.

72
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,138
I wonder what the volunteer
program will be like.

73
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,208
Who knows!

74
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:02,608
But it'll probably be welfare-related or
helping out with official events, right?

75
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,048
I guess there's a lot of
that over the holidays.

76
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,548
You're probably right.

77
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,618
Right in the middle
of year-end sale wars!

78
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,288
Not having time for
any of it really stings!

79
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,018
All thanks to someone!

80
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,618
Now, now.

81
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:27,568
Saki?

82
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,668
Saki?
What's the matter?

83
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,468
Hey, Saki?

84
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:35,908
Me?

85
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:36,638
Was it me?

86
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:37,678
Did I do that?

87
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:38,648
Well duh!

88
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,078
I mean, she's really crying?
It's not just an act?

89
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,488
It's for real!

90
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:49,398
We're sorry.

91
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:52,258
We didn't realize, did we?

92
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:58,708
R-Right.

93
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,468
We'll leave the rest to you, Kohsaka!

94
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,238
Everybody out! Hurry!

95
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,418
I-Isn't it a bad idea to
leave them by themselves?

96
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,178
What?

97
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,278
T-That's right, we don't know what'll
happen in a situation like this!

98
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,188
And y-you're the one
with the key, M-Madarame.

99
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,248
Anyway you're the
one who made her cry!

100
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,558
H-Hey, wait a minute.

101
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,928
This is your chance!

102
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,728
If you wait you won't be able to go!
Do it as our chairman!

103
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:38,738
You know, lately...

104
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:39,708
Yeah.

105
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,238
I can't smoke.

106
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,038
Smoke?

107
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,978
Cigarettes...

108
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,688
I mean, fire...

109
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:55,158
It scares me even in my dreams...

110
00:07:57,498 --> 00:08:01,558
W-Well that's just as well!
Cigarettes are bad for you!

111
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:05,268
Crap, that didn't work.

112
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,138
It's okay, I know you were scared.

113
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:12,098
Don't worry, just relax.

114
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,358
R-Really, when that happened...

115
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:33,128
I dropped my cigarette
because Madarame scared me.

116
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:36,688
Of course, it was
me, it was my fault.

117
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:40,468
No, it's my fault!
I can see that...

118
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,108
That's why I even cosplayed, but I'm
always having to make it up to everyone.

119
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,678
Of course! Sorry!

120
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,548
I won't talk about it anymore.

121
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:55,448
Damn, is that the only
way I can talk right now?

122
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,718
But you know, Saki...

123
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:02,018
I think cosplaying was
the right thing to do.

124
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:05,228
That became more a way for
us to appeal to other clubs...

125
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,298
...than for you to make things up to us.

126
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,658
After that, the others weren't
so harsh towards Genshiken.

127
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:13,798
Uh, yeah, that's very true.

128
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:16,638
The mood around us
changed a bit after that.

129
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,478
The video the manga club shot seems
to have quite the cult following.

130
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,488
So even if it takes time, part of
why Genshiken can pick up the pieces...

131
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,348
...is because we have
that going for us...

132
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,618
Besides, the reason we pick on you...

133
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,118
...is that we all like you.

134
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:42,188
That sounded so embarrassing, I just...

135
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:51,808
I'm going to the bathroom.

136
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:53,068
Okay.

137
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:04,848
Yeah, she hasn't been smoking lately.

138
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:09,258
You're right, and she
no longer smells of it.

139
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,858
Well, maybe this is an
unexpected side of her.

140
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:17,538
I wouldn't call it unexpected...

141
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:21,168
But it's something we
easily fail to notice.

142
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:22,378
Saki.

143
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,308
<i>Hold on, I need to fix my face.
Saki.</i>

144
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,108
<i>Hold on, I need to fix my face.</i>

145
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,468
Here's the key.

146
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:29,378
All right, I'll accept
responsibility for it.

147
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,288
This is the volunteer work schedule.

148
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:34,748
Many thanks.

149
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,718
We're sorry for the trouble.

150
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,228
You should tell that
to your club members.

151
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:41,688
That's true.

152
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,358
Well, good luck.

153
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:45,568
Pardon?

154
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,288
Nothing.

155
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,358
Ah, there they are.

156
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,228
Are we done?

157
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,428
Yup, thanks for helping.

158
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:55,138
Let's call it a day.

159
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,398
Are you sure?

160
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:58,748
Well, you know...

161
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,508
You're right.

162
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:05,508
It'd also be better for Saki
to settle down a little more.

163
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:08,718
Bye.

164
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,148
Yeah.

165
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,828
So, shall we grab some food?

166
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,228
Sure, it'd be a good way to finish up.

167
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,198
Where to?

168
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,938
How about some beef bowl from
Handaya?

169
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,568
Or cabbage fried rice at Soukutsuya.

170
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,768
I'm for kiev style cutlet at Chiruchiru.

171
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,848
W-Want to sing?

172
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:32,778
No singing!

173
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,368
Ehhh!

175
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,248
That can't be!

176
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:39,248
T-This sucks.

177
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:40,878
So much for Comic Fest.

00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:42,218
All three days.

179
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,788
Man...

180
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:46,948
No.

181
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,458
Just one of us has the 30th free.

182
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,738
I don't suppose you're going
to suggest another penalty game.

183
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,248
No, this is a request.

184
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,268
<i>No!
No, this is a request.</i>

185
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,938
But even if Kasukabe did that for us,

186
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,578
she'd probably just get
more mainstream dojinshi.

187
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,808
We can always just buy that
kind afterwards at dojin shops.

188
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:16,648
No, there's also Comic
Fest-specific limited editions!

189
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,488
That's why someone must go in person!

190
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,918
I know better than that.

191
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:23,758
Your ultimate goal isn't to
buy dojinshi, it's to use them.

192
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:28,238
You'd make me be your gopher
for something like that?

193
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,988
She's a tough one.

194
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,008
If you understand us that
well, I'll get to the point.

195
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,718
Here it comes.

196
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,918
If I may be so bold!

197
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,618
It's always gotta be
some big production.

198
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:52,588
A winter break without
new books from Comic Fest...

199
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,598
...is more boring than we can stand!

200
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,998
And when it's that boring, we're of course
going to spend it doing you-know-what!

201
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,698
<i>In other words, nothing but
m- m-m...the whole time!</i>

202
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,488
Wham.

203
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,428
She really punched him.

204
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,568
Like her arm just extended.

205
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,568
This is volunteer work,
and the last time...

206
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:39,938
I'll go!

207
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:09,698
So, this is the first Kujiun
series summarization meeting.

208
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:14,768
Wasn't it the New Year's / Genshiken
is back in business party?

209
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,408
Well, it certainly did take
a long time to come home!

210
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:22,408
All kinds of volunteer work, forced labor,
working for free, compulsory service!

211
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:26,708
You can stop making it sound like
all I did was go buy dojinshi.

212
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,078
I worked at a nursery.

213
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,488
So anyway, yes, let's stop
talking about that and cut! Right?

214
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:42,528
Tokino!

215
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:43,758
Tokino!

216
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:48,458
Please come over, Tokino!
We're waiting for you!

217
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:52,678
Come on!

218
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,808
What can you see from there?

219
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,918
What I can see from here is...

220
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,658
A view I'm sure we've never seen before!

221
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,498
This is it! This is the
quality I wanted to see!

222
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:23,108
The sale date got pushed
back again and again...

223
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,108
...and some said it
would never be released.

224
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,148
But this changes my
opinion of Yamabata now.

225
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:33,448
T-These days only a-artist
type directors tend to stand out.

226
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,748
Like Aizawa and Seki.

227
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,548
Yeah, they're a bit over-hyped.

228
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,418
Their tricks are too
obvious and polished.

229
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:39,928
I'll say.

230
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:43,488
It shows we need to pay
more respect towards these...

231
00:15:43,598 --> 00:15:45,788
...negotiator-type
professional directors.

232
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,198
It's the same as ever.

233
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:49,728
Yes, it is.

234
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,868
I've got something I need
to say, if now's a good time.

235
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:58,238
What is it?

236
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:04,518
Well, h-how to say this...

237
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,208
Um...

238
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,588
Might I retire as chairman?

239
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,088
Huh?

240
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:17,528
W-What brought this on?

241
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,698
Well, I guess, this seemed
like a good stopping point.

242
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,528
I'm not too sure.

243
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,068
Oh really?

244
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:27,738
Just come out and say it...

245
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,638
Someone's been causing too many
problems and you're tired of it!

246
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:34,238
Uh, no, I was afraid to say it since
I thought you'd take it that way.

247
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:36,278
Besides.

248
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:40,918
I have to start job hunting this year.

249
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:41,888
Job hunting?

250
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,518
<i>Knock off the harmony, you two!
Job hunting?</i>

251
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,788
Well, I think it could be good
timing, not really too early.

252
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,258
It's January, after all.

253
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:50,288
True...

254
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,628
And so, as for my successor...

255
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,868
I'd like Sasahara to do it.

256
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:57,268
Eh?

257
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:00,898
W-Why me?

258
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,638
I'm not suited at all, am I?

259
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:06,708
Hmm, well, you don't look like you've
ever been in charge of anything before.

260
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,938
Of course not!

261
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:11,748
But, when I look at these faces...

262
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,618
There's no generalized
otaku there but you.

263
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,558
One of them isn't even otaku at all.

264
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:18,888
Why not?

265
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:22,228
It was process of
elimination the last time too.

266
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:23,958
It's a tradition.

267
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,798
N-Not a very good one.

268
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:29,298
Well, we have Kasukabe's
stamp of approval...

269
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:29,958
Okay!

270
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,708
So new chairman, tell us your ambitions.

271
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,868
Ah, all right...

272
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:47,318
Now that I've become chairman...

273
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,788
Kind of like Madarame.

274
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:49,588
<i>Shut up!
Kind of like Madarame.</i>

275
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,618
Just once I'd like to see us
participate as a circle at Comic Fest!

276
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:02,638
Oh?

277
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:05,258
Ah, he said it.

278
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,838
I'm not involved.

279
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:07,928
What's the big deal?

280
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,338
Participate as a circle?

281
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,848
It means becoming a
seller at Comic Fest.

282
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:13,038
Making dojinshi.

283
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,118
<i>Are you thinking
"gaku-man" for a genre?</i>

284
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:15,978
What's "gaku-man?"

285
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,248
It means a school's manga club.

286
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:17,748
<i>Is there a series you wanted to parody?
It means a school's manga club.</i>

287
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,338
<i>Is there a series you wanted to parody?</i>

288
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:22,318
A series I want to do?

289
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:40,768
If we're going to do this, I want to do a
male-oriented offset-printed Kujiun book!

290
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,268
"Male-oriented?"

291
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,738
Uh, um, umm umm...

292
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,138
Umm, uh, uhhh...

293
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,218
Never mind, I get it.

294
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:54,218
<i>Suioh University Entrance Exam Site</i>

295
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:04,998
What?

296
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:06,388
You're alone.

297
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,398
I'm meeting someone.

298
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:09,398
I see.

299
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:13,038
Oh, yes.
Good job on things.

300
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:18,278
Various things.

301
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:25,178
You fit in well over there.

302
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:41,868
Didn't Kugayama draw it?

303
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,438
Why not a sketch of Yamada?

304
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,708
Well, it's my personal preference.

305
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,268
I still don't know what direction
the story will take in the end.

306
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:50,738
What's up?

307
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:51,308
Yo.

308
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:52,308
What's that?

309
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:54,368
The Comic Fest application.

310
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,468
Really.

311
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,748
If we're accepted,
will you be a salesgirl?

312
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,078
Sounds like fun, but I'll pass.

313
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,048
If you think it sounds like fun...

314
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:08,458
If I did it, I'm sure I'd take the
money like this, like it's dirty.

315
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:16,098
Still, really doing the application...

316
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:25,508
I guess, I've longed vaguely for this...

317
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:32,238
...but once I came out and said
it, it suddenly felt real...

318
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:40,848
It's like maybe I really
did want to do this.

319
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:49,028
Come to think of it, dojinshi were
part of why I joined Genshiken.

320
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:50,468
Yeah, what a surprise.

321
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:56,328
And now, here you are
applying to Comic Fest.

322
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,778
Have I gone up or down?

323
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:01,508
Come on.
Down, obviously!

324
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:07,788
And oh yeah, that was when
Kasukabe hit me for the first time.

325
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:09,408
Wow, that takes me back.

326
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,358
You've got a good memory.

327
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:12,388
I mean, sorry!

328
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,518
You shouldn't hit people
when you first meet them.

329
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,858
No, it's all right.

330
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,758
Well, I'm sure I've turned
out the way I was meant to.

331
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:28,838
How I joined Genshiken then,
how I'm chairman of it now...

332
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:33,808
...and even down to how I'm
applying to Comic Fest, everything.

333
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:42,178
Might as well keep going
until I get there...

334
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:48,418
Oh, yeah, what should we
do about our circle name?

335
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:52,888
Hmm, The Society for the Study of
Modern Visual Culture's no good.

336
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:56,158
Of course not, we're applying
as totally male-oriented.

337
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,868
Guess the abbreviation's out, too.

338
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,868
I wouldn't say it's completely
out, but it's not that good.

339
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:04,138
Let's think of something weird, then.

340
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,108
How about "Genshiken" in hiragana?

341
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,108
Ahh, good idea.

342
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:14,388
Yeah, yeah, a subtly dubious
sound might be the ticket.

343
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:16,008
Hello.

344
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:16,948
Howdy.

345
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,458
You're just in time
to see a legend born.

346
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:20,428
Like what?

347
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,328
Kasukabe did the naming.

348
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,058
Don't go nuts on me.

349
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:29,498
Nice sound.

350
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,368
G-Good sense.

351
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:35,128
Being told I have good sense for this
kind of thing makes me really nervous.

352
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:37,268
It's all good, it's all good.

353
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:38,338
I'll hit you.

354
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,498
That aside, take a look at this.

355
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:41,638
Let's see.

356
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:43,208
Oh awesome!

357
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,378
Who did the original?

358
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,888
M-Manta. From Sangakudou.

359
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,278
Ahh, I see.

360
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:49,978
It's out already?
I could have sworn...

361
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Genshiken</i>

362
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:15,938
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

363
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:25,278
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

364
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:34,558
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

365
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:44,308
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

366
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:54,678
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

367
00:23:55,758 --> 00:24:06,188
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

368
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:15,638
<i>The time we spied from there sparkled,
even if nothing big happened.</i>

369
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:25,618
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

370
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:34,488
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

371
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:41,998
What was with this episode?

372
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,468
It was boring and ridiculous.
It wasn't even worth watching!

373
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,668
The "light and shadow of youth?"
Who wrote this embarrassing stuff?

374
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,468
But Mistress Renko, you
spoke your part so well.

375
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:50,738
It moved me!

376
00:24:51,178 --> 00:24:52,578
D-Don't be stupid!

377
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:55,278
That was just part of the script,
and it wasn't how I really felt.

378
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,148
You really are a fool if
you don't realize that.

379
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,688
Then you really are
mean, Mistress Renko.

380
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:00,718
What, that again...

381
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,588
Next episode, the long-awaited finale.

382
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:05,128
Kujibiki Unbalance,
the final tournament.

383
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:07,628
Mean Mistress Renko is finally
going to be active again!

384
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:09,658
Stop referring to me that way...
