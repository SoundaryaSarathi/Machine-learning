1
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:07,131
I shouldn't have gotten
a cell phone.

2
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:14,241
I know I'm the one who's staying out
without telling her,

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,211
but Hachi didn't even
email me once.

4
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:19,911
That made her look more selfish to me
and it irritated me.

5
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:25,581
I don't want the strength
of our bonds

6
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:29,061
to be tested by
some communication device.

7
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:36,531
Blinking eyes call the wind

8
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:44,181
A smile clears all the noise away

9
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:50,741
The angel in your eyes whispers

10
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:55,921
"Everything begins now"

11
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,161
Can you feel it now
Can you feel it now

12
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:01,961
It's like being caught in a wave

13
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,131
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart

14
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,601
Breath held, arms reaching out

15
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:14,831
Baby this world is
different from yesterday's

16
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,481
You're the only one I can see

17
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:23,411
Baby my wish on a wing

18
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,381
This sky is torn

19
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:31,791
By a single overflowing word

20
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:04,751
CHECKING FOR MESSAGES

21
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:05,911
NO NEW MESSAGES

22
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,331
I haven't been home for nine days.

23
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:25,481
The more time passes,
the harder it becomes for me to go home.

24
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,871
But I can't continue living here.

25
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:37,021
What am I gonna do?

26
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:56,541
How does Hachi spend her time
all alone in that room?

27
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,011
Trapnest's recording schedule

28
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,641
was extended past
what was originally planned,

29
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,311
and the band members were
all stuck inside together.

30
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,981
It was clear that Hachi
was lonely every day.

31
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:16,261
I couldn't imagine that self-centered guy
contacting her much.

32
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,761
But I couldn't feel
any sympathy for her.

33
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,131
This is the life that Hachi chose.

34
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:27,701
Good morning!

35
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,301
You sure are up early, Takumi.
Did you get some rest?

36
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,811
No. I'm about to take a nap now.

37
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,041
Is that so?
You've been working hard, haven't you?

38
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,721
How is Reira doing?

39
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,381
She's sleeping well.

40
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,851
It seems that the medicine the doctor
prescribed for her is working.

41
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:45,791
Sleeping pills?

42
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,911
Maybe I should get some, too.

43
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,691
You can't sleep either, Takumi?

44
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,031
I may be able to sleep if
you came to my room.

45
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,031
I'm not going!

46
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:56,931
How lonely.

47
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,301
I can't take it anymore...
this ascetic life.

48
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,231
Then we have to be sure and
get this finished today.

49
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,201
Right. Our schedule's been
really messed up.

50
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,711
Take's in tears.

51
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:12,281
I'm sure your fiancée's also
in tears from loneliness.

52
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,281
You know,
that's really not the case.

53
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,421
She sends me several emails a day,
and she says stuff like

54
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,511
I KNITTED SOCKS (^-^)
"I knitted socks."

55
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,991
She seems to be having fun.

56
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,031
Socks?

57
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,691
She's thinking way, way ahead.

58
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,961
The baby's not due until
May of next year.

59
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,861
Oh, for the baby!

60
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,701
But why is it that

61
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,461
women don't want to talk
about the real important things,

62
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,801
but want to report unimportant stuff?

63
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:40,341
Don't think of it as unimportant.
Please just remember to reply, okay?

64
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,071
I am. I write things like,

65
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,011
MAKE A PAIR FOR DADDY TOO (^3^)
"make a pair for Daddy too."

66
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,271
Really?

67
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,041
But what if she really knit me a pair?

68
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,651
An identical pair to the kid's?
That would be too painful.

69
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,351
You'll hafta wear them.
It would be a sight not to be missed.

70
00:04:54,391 --> 00:05:01,321
I was hoping Hachi would be so lonely
that she'd be longing for me.

71
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:06,731
Nana Osaki? Yeah, I remember.
The rabbits, right?

72
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,141
Huh? The rabbits?

73
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:09,501
Oh, hey! Don't film this!

74
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,971
Is this gonna air on TV?

75
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,981
No, it's for a magazine article.
Don't worry.

76
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,641
I don't wanna get involved.
Did Osaki do something?

77
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,341
When we were in fifth grade,

78
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,871
the rabbits in the rabbit cage were found
slaughtered one morning.

79
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,351
Everyone accused Osaki

80
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,251
because you'd expect something like that
from a gloomy kid like her.

81
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,961
Miss Osaki was pretty,
so she stood out in junior high,

82
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,331
but she was so anti-social.
People hated her for that.

83
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,611
She was bullied?

84
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,251
I'm not too sure about that,
but I did hear rumors

85
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:26,681
that she got angry and beat up
a senior who harassed her.

86
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,381
Osaki's the girl who
got kicked outta school

87
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,511
when they found out that
she was selling her body, right?

88
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,951
What did she do this time?

89
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,131
So, as you can see,

90
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:51,041
it was almost like investigating
a criminal's past.

91
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:54,271
She's the best! That Nana Osaki!

92
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,711
There is so much to write about her.

93
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,611
But I am so exhausted.

94
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:02,441
Why do I, a photographer,
end up having to go after stories like this?

95
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,251
We're short of staff!

96
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,591
Can I go home for the day?

97
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,591
Ren Honjo's still locked up
in the studio, right?

98
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:13,691
Yeah. Why are they taking ten days
to record just a couple of songs?

99
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,561
Are they having some issues?

100
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:19,401
Chief, it appears that Trapnest
has finished recording.

101
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,961
The band members have
started going home.

102
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:23,431
Kurata!

103
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,511
I'll have an article ready
and reserve a big space for you.

104
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:30,071
I'm counting on you.
For a shot of the two.

105
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:40,521
How do you like the new song,
Director Matsuo, Producer Kawano?

106
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,351
I like it. It's complete with energy

107
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,621
- and a little sexiness!
- Great!

108
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,821
That was more than satisfactory!

109
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,891
Then please let us record it right away.

110
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:52,001
And we really need you to decide on
an agency for us soon.

111
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:58,141
We are working on it little by little.

112
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,611
Is he really?! That raccoon bastard!

113
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:04,641
- Raccoon!
- It's not a laughing matter!

114
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,281
Yeah, that name suits that man,
all right.

115
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,781
You drunk already?

116
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,791
There's no use trying anymore
for this.

117
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,711
Shin. Are you at all serious
about doing this?

118
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,261
You've gotta realize that

119
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,631
the company's not about to invest
in a risky new band.

120
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,761
They say Gaia's not about
to invest money

121
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,701
in an old fashioned punk band like ours.

122
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:31,641
What's this?

123
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,381
Who said that?

124
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:35,981
I am really sorry.

125
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,741
I'm sorry it's not going anywhere,
all due to my lack of ability.

126
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,741
It's not your fault, Mr. Kawano.

127
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,121
Our band just doesn't have
what it takes.

128
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:48,251
No, your band is not the problem.

129
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,321
Due to the recession, Gaia is
reluctant to promote new bands.

130
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:57,691
This is a tough time
for bands in general.

131
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:03,011
But Trapnest's album has sold
almost three million copies.

132
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,971
Well, I guess a big part of their success
lies with their vocalist Reira.

133
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,171
She is attractive enough
to ride the diva boom.

134
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:12,241
I'm worthless unless I sing.

135
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:17,141
But the same goes for
your vocalist, Nana.

136
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,891
I'm not about to give up, Yasu.

137
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,161
We're not giving up that
easily either.

138
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,161
Then will you give me
a bit more time?

139
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,931
Our temporary contract is
for three months, right?

140
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:36,331
We signed the contract
because we trust you, Mr. Kawano.

141
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,001
We'll keep our promise.

142
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,071
Really? Thank you.

143
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,001
I should be thanking you.

144
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,541
I appreciate that you put
this much heart into this.

145
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:49,721
But you can't do business
on heart alone.

146
00:09:55,391 --> 00:10:00,061
But I have no desire to turn music
into a heartless business.

147
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,161
In our band, we have people
like Nana and Shin

148
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,601
who have had the misfortune of
not being loved by those around them.

149
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:10,171
I don't want them thinking

150
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:14,701
this world is nothing
but money and greed, after all.

151
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,721
But I'm sure there will be
many more situations in the future

152
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,811
when they will be forced to
think that way.

153
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:25,581
So it would be so encouraging
to have someone like you

154
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,111
who will support our band
with passion and love.

155
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,061
Is it too much to ask?

156
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,761
The burden you carry on
your shoulders seems much greater.

157
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,641
Let me carry half of it.
Don't try to carry all that you can.

158
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,741
If both your hands are full,

159
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,711
you won't be able to take action
when you need to.

160
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:50,941
Here.

161
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,621
I guess you're right.

162
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,181
You still drinking, Nobu?

163
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,341
How could I not drink?!
Who cares about the recession?

164
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:26,681
It feels like I've been laid off.

165
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:29,481
Have Hachi comfort you.

166
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,191
I can't blame it on the recession.

167
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,721
I just need to write songs that
will convince the guys at Gaia.

168
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:43,591
Give me that!

169
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,631
Say, did something happen
between you and Hachi, Nobu?

170
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,101
Nobody talks about Hachi
anymore at the studio.

171
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,041
Shin.

172
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,671
Don't you ever mention that name again.

173
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,611
Even Nobu has a thing or two
he would rather not talk about.

174
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:13,221
By the way, why did you buy
this acoustic guitar?

175
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,961
No real reason. I'm going out.

176
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:21,471
Must be nice. The little boy has
many older women to comfort him.

177
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,741
Even one who would
buy him a guitar.

178
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,031
I bought it on my own.

179
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,511
But you bought it with the money
you got from women, right?

180
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:28,651
It's the same thing.

181
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,051
Nana...

182
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:33,141
When you get everything
you want so easily,

183
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,551
you lose that hungry spirit within you.

184
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,981
"There's no use trying"?

185
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:41,251
If you have the time to play
your acoustic guitar,

186
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:42,451
practice the bass.

187
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,231
I shouldn't hafta be lectured
by some vocalist

188
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,821
who can't even stop smoking.

189
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,871
- What?!
- Ah, Nana!

190
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,671
Same goes for you, Nana.
Where did you get your new guitar?

191
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,711
It's not something you could
buy with your pay.

192
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,141
And it's unsuitable for someone
like you who can hardly play it.

193
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,041
I borrowed it from Ren!

194
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,411
Then what about those clothes?

195
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,721
They've all been given
by Misato and Ren, right?

196
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:11,651
Nana!

197
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:13,911
What's wrong with that?!

198
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:15,661
Don't compare me with someone
like you who sells his body!

199
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,851
Don't be provoked!

200
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,321
I'm the one who doesn't wanna
be compared with you.

201
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,131
I receive what's appropriate
for my efforts.

202
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,701
But Nana, all you're doing is cuddling up
to Ren's kindness.

203
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,491
Shin!

204
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,581
That guy... Is he at the rebellious phase?

205
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,381
Wh-Why are you taking your clothes off?!

206
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,161
Damn it!

207
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,121
Is it wrong?

208
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,401
Is it wrong to accept kindness?!

209
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,271
No, there's nothing wrong about that.

210
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:10,611
Don't worry about it, okay?
Shin's only trying to justify himself.

211
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:14,071
I think you should let Ren spoil you more.

212
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,811
Don't let some stupid pride
force you into a corner.

213
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,501
REN

214
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,331
Hello.

215
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,371
Oh, Nobu.
Sorry to call you at this hour.

216
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:37,431
Were you asleep?

217
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,271
No,

218
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,311
I'm still up.

219
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,201
Things going well?

220
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:40,941
Yeah.

221
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,611
Are you sure about that?

222
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:46,781
There's no way you don't know
about Hachiko, right?

223
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,081
Yeah. But...

224
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,821
I guess it can't be helped.

225
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,791
Honestly, there's nothing I can do
for her right now...

226
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,851
So you're finally able to
face the reality.

227
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:03,521
Try and relate to the trouble your parents
went through to raise you, okay?

228
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,071
Yes, I'm sorry.

229
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,171
You're being too obedient.
You're no fun to tease.

230
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,641
By the way,
Nana's at my place right now.

231
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,611
Huh? She's at your place?

232
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,511
I was getting worried because
I can't reach her on her cell phone.

233
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,751
And she hasn't replied to my emails.

234
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:23,711
Huh?

235
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,521
Really? Maybe she's forgotten
to switch it on.

236
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:30,191
After band practice, Nana, Shin
and I were drinking together.

237
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,461
Actually, Ren, .,
Nana's been acting a bit strange lately.

238
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:47,011
She's always been short-tempered,
but her mood swings are intense.

239
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:48,701
Even just now,
she got into an argument with Shin,

240
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,181
she got all panicky,
and started crying.

241
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,621
Also, she told me not to tell anyone,
but at one point,

242
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,881
she said she sometimes can't remember
what she's been doing.

243
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:05,561
Yeah, she has been acting a bit strange.

244
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:08,921
Nana...

245
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,501
Nana, get up!

246
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,531
At least put your clothes on.

247
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,971
Shut up.

248
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:20,771
If you're a man come at me.

249
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,641
Show me what you're made of.

250
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,011
Ren said he's coming to pick you up.

251
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,251
If he sees you like that
he'll get the wrong idea.

252
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,171
He should be here any time now.

253
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,281
He doesn't hafta come!

254
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,221
Why not? First, get dressed!

255
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:35,191
What if he got followed by a mosquito?!
That'll be trouble.

256
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,191
A mosquito?

257
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,161
The paparazzi are after us!
I hear Naoki was saying so.

258
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,201
There's no doubt about it.

259
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,961
But I'm sure it's fine.

260
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,171
If it weren't, I doubt Ren would say
he'd come pick you up.

261
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,671
He has no idea of the damage
a scandal can cause!

262
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:53,001
He kept calling me to his place

263
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:55,011
without saying a word about being targeted.

264
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,711
He only thinks of himself.

265
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:02,011
I don't wanna draw attention
as "Ren's girl."

266
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,151
Return the guitar to him.

267
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,361
And tell him that I won't be
seeing him for a while.

268
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:12,191
Is your pride that important to you?

269
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,901
Ren needs you, you know.

270
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,431
You're the one who's only thinking
about yourself.

271
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,221
A moon that's not quite full.

272
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:46,121
That's how I feel when I'm with Ren.

273
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,301
No matter how deeply
we love each other.

274
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,771
I'll bet there's no one who can
really make me feel complete.

275
00:17:55,941 --> 00:18:00,641
But when I'm on stage...
I become complete.

276
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:06,151
I must protect it. My dream.

277
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,451
No matter what I end up sacrificing.

278
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:14,611
I wonder if Hachi's sleeping.

279
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,261
What time is it now?

280
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,461
Where's my cell phone?

281
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:25,371
It's annoying to have,
but so inconvenient not to have.

282
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:33,541
Takumi might be there.
But it is my home.

283
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,671
There's no need for me to hold back.

284
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,261
It's quiet.

285
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:04,201
Isn't she here?

286
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,541
Maybe she's sleeping with Takumi.

287
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,711
But she may be alone.

288
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,611
Whatever, I don't know what to think.

289
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,681
TO NANA

290
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:27,391
TO NANA

291
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,901
TO NANA

292
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,971
What's this?

293
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,481
What's she up to?

294
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:50,751
Hachi!

295
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:06,861
Hachiko, are you here?!

296
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,761
You know, Hachi...

297
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:46,001
Back then, when you kept
losing yourself in love...

298
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:52,211
Maybe you too were struggling
to feel complete, just like me.

299
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,951
If so, then I can understand
some of those feelings you had.

300
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,851
It's just that I couldn't back then.

301
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:07,261
Does the new life you protected at all costs
make you feel complete even now?

302
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:14,441
I can't count
how many nights

303
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,201
I wished tomorrow
would never come

304
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:25,981
To live as I am
without being fake

305
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,581
What do I need

306
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:37,721
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

307
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:42,891
The answer is
too close to see

308
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:49,131
Black tears are
falling down

309
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:56,081
I have nothing,
only sadness

310
00:21:56,151 --> 00:22:01,171
I can't put it
into words

311
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:07,251
My whole body
starts to ache

312
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:12,661
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
