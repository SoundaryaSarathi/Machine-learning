1
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:06,182
Back then, I wasn't really able to
love someone properly.

2
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,462
Yet, I couldn't help but want to be loved.

3
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,852
When I was darkness at that time

4
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:38,692
With trembling lips

5
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:41,782
In a corner of a room I cry

6
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,872
The more I struggle

7
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:49,702
The more this wound deepens

8
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:52,862
The broken promise hurt me

9
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:57,602
Nobody can save me

10
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,782
God, I have only one request

11
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:04,412
Stop tearing apart my love

12
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:07,752
I need your love

13
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:10,982
I'm a broken rose

14
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,932
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

15
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:16,092
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

16
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:18,862
I need your love

17
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:22,172
I'm a broken rose

18
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:25,102
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

19
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:29,062
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

20
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:32,042
I wanna need your love

21
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:35,272
I'm a broken rose

22
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:37,612
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,352
What's that supposed to mean?

24
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,092
You went to Nana's place because
you were worried, right?

25
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:55,602
Then what good will lecturing her do?

26
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,572
But it just came out that way.

27
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,012
How can you say things
so bluntly

28
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:02,302
to someone who's heart's
been shattered?

29
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,682
But I did it for Nana's sake.

30
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,672
If so, you could've chosen a better time.

31
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,872
But there's meaning in talking to her
about it now because of what happened.

32
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:10,212
Welcome.

33
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:14,212
What? Hey Nobo,
where's Koichi Sato?

34
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:16,482
He caught a cold, so he's off today.

35
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:19,252
Really? I guess, with the change
in temperature lately.

36
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,462
Could we have two beers?

37
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,662
Sure.

38
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,492
What are you doing
sneaking around like that, Shoji?

39
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,802
Don't worry about me. My character
disappeared in the last episode.

40
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,312
You definitely didn't disappear.

41
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,312
- I can see you just fine.
- That's not possible...

42
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,902
- Drink with us.
- Watch out!

43
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,412
How naive of you.

44
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:42,152
You deserve to experience being
that character who gets hated

45
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:45,282
and despised by viewers,
but still needs to make appearances.

46
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,922
I shouldn't have come to Jackson's.

47
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,122
What about work?
Do you have the day off?

48
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,422
No sir. If you must know,

49
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,192
I have the evenings off during
the "Golden Week" holidays.

50
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:55,852
Just talk like you usually do.

51
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,392
I went to see Nana.

52
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,132
She really hates you,

53
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,862
so I suggest you don't try to fix things
and just keep a low profile.

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,592
What do you mean by "fix things"?

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,312
Well, because Shoji says

56
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:14,842
he hates breaking up like this
and wants to talk things over with Nana.

57
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:17,072
What does he want to talk to her about?

58
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,182
Some excuses, perhaps?

59
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:19,812
No, it's not like I wanna
make excuses to her...

60
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:27,162
It's just, I think I should properly
apologize to her.

61
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,262
Not a good idea!
If you have no intention

62
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,662
of getting back together with Nana,
you should clearly end this relationship!

63
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,972
You've gotta realize it's your attitude,
trying to hold on to them both,

64
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,832
that hurt both Nana and Sachiko.

65
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,532
You still haven't learned your lesson!

66
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:43,042
I don't think you wanna apologize
to Nana out of kindness.

67
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,012
By apologizing, you just wanna
feel better about yourself.

68
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,282
Kyosuke, you're being
just as blunt, you know.

69
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:58,812
Yeah? It's ok. My motto is
to be kind to women, strict toward men.

70
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,622
Nobo. I'll leave the money here.

71
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,032
You running away?

72
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,992
No. You're absolutely right.

73
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:09,032
So on that note, I'm gonna disappear.

74
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:10,132
Where to?

75
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:11,902
What are these flowers?

76
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,032
Don't worry about it. Bye.

77
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,132
Oh, Shoji!

78
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:16,472
What?

79
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,132
Please, just let me leave.

80
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,212
That hat belongs to the store.

81
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,252
Thank you very much.

82
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,352
That was lame.

83
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,522
Apparently, it's his girlfriend's birthday.

84
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,122
Sachiko's? Oh, so that's what
the flowers were for.

85
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:42,472
He was saying she's at work now,
but it'll be her birthday at midnight

86
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:44,732
so he wanted to be the first
to wish her a Happy Birthday.

87
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:46,802
That kid's got a kind heart.

88
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:52,502
Well, well. He's being all lovey-dovey
where we can't see him.

89
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:56,912
Good for him. That's how it should be,
for Sachiko's sake.

90
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,182
Oh, hello.

91
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,552
The main issue is with Nana.
Especially with you lecturing her.

92
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,522
I just hope she's still alive.

93
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:10,662
She'll be fine! Tomorrow's the day
of her roommate's live concert.

94
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,532
She was really looking forward to that,
so she'll be alive until then.

95
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:16,092
Besides, I promised her that
we'd drive her there in the evening.

96
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,992
But she might die after that.

97
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,062
Farewell.

98
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,512
Then that'll probably also mean
the end of this series.

99
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:32,082
And I was so thrilled that I started crying!

100
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,552
It's the first row!

101
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,412
The first row at a Trapnest concert!

102
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,352
I get to see Takumi in person
from that close!

103
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,832
I feel so great I could just die!

104
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,122
Farewell.

105
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:45,762
But I can't do that.
If I die, I won't see him.

106
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,762
So there's no way I can die until then.

107
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,492
- Thank goodness for that.
- Thank goodness for that.

108
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,442
Hey, if by any chance
Nana can't come along,

109
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:53,402
you wanna come with me, Jun-chan?

110
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:58,672
Well... even in the front row,
I'm not particularly a fan of Trapnest.

111
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,212
Why not go? It's just a live concert.

112
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,142
That's no fun.

113
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:08,892
That's exactly what Nana said.
She says "I'll come if I'm in the mood",

114
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:11,722
then learning that the concert hall's
far away, says, "that's such a drag."

115
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:13,552
Far away? Where exactly is it?

116
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:14,892
At the Idea Hall.

117
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,122
Idea Hall? You mean
that place back home?

118
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:19,302
Mhm!

119
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:22,892
What's the? Why didn't you get
tickets to the Tokyo performance?

120
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,802
Because back when I ordered them

121
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,902
I still wasn't sure if I'd
be able to come to Tokyo.

122
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:29,242
On top of that,
given the popularity of Trapnest,

123
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:32,042
even fan club members have a hard time
getting tickets for the Tokyo live.

124
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:34,282
It would be totally sad
if I couldn't get seats.

125
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:38,142
But I'm assured of getting two seats
together for the live back home.

126
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,952
And I figured I'd see them better than
from seats in Tokyo's bigger concert hall.

127
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:43,422
I'm not going! It would be such a drag.

128
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,822
How come? You could also
visit your folks,

129
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,052
so you'd be killing two birds
with one stone.

130
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:51,492
I don't wanna visit my folks! They'd only
put me to work in those rice fields!

131
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:56,162
Fine, then. I'll ask Nana again.

132
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,842
She may talk in an unfriendly tone,
but inside, she's really kind.

133
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,872
I'm sure she'll agree to come.

134
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:04,512
You know, I'd think twice
about pressuring her to go.

135
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:08,782
Why not find a guy who's
a Trapnest fan and go with him?

136
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:09,582
Yeah.

137
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,782
You'll have a new boyfriend
and you get to go to the concert.

138
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:14,282
That's killing two birds with one stone.

139
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:20,022
I don't wanna boyfriend.
I'm through with love.

140
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:27,492
What are we gonna do?

141
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:31,272
You take love away from Nana,
and she's got nothing left.

142
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:37,802
I have Nana, after all.

143
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,572
As long as I'm with Nana,
I won't feel lonely.

144
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:44,312
Since we're both women, we can
be ourselves in front of each other.

145
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,582
There's no need to be jealous.

146
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,892
We can always be together without
worrying about that kinda stuff.

147
00:07:55,232 --> 00:08:00,362
In comparison, love is tiresome, hurtful,
and never lasts. I've had enough of it.

148
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,232
What I want is not a boyfriend.

149
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,772
I want a knight who will protect me.

150
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:08,842
But I know very well that,

151
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:11,932
in the real world,
such a person doesn't exist.

152
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:20,592
- This is loud!
- This is loud!

153
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,212
No way, it's a full house!

154
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:26,592
I want to see them from the very front!
We should've come sooner!

155
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:30,992
What kind of event is this, anyway?!
"Punk Night"?!

156
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,802
They're all punk bands?!

157
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,532
What a dull title.

158
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:39,502
I think Nana's band is after this one!
I'm gonna force my way to the front!

159
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:41,602
Hey, Nana, do you want a drink?

160
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,672
I don't want one! It'll only get in the way!

161
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,052
Ow!

162
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,382
Oh, no, I can't get through!

163
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:58,812
What is this weird vibe?
I can't get into mood.

164
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,262
That singer's not at all cool.

165
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,662
Thanks!

166
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,222
You need to lose a bit of weight, mate.

167
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,332
I guess they're finished.

168
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,672
Nana's next.
This is my chance to get closer.

169
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:14,502
Hey, wanna stick around
for the next one?

170
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,272
"Black Stones"? Don't know them.

171
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:19,642
"BLAST" for short? How lame.

172
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,912
How dare you?!

173
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,552
Let's go outside for a smoke.

174
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:24,152
The main guys have already performed.
Let's go home!

175
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:25,352
Let's go for a drink.

176
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:29,982
How come? Wait a minute,
everyone, don't leave yet.

177
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,422
Hey, have you heard?!

178
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,052
The next band is super cool!

179
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,502
What a cute girl.

180
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:51,212
Yes, I know! BLAST is really cool!

181
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,252
There's a girl who's into it.

182
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:58,442
Especially the vocalist, Nana!
She's so powerful for a young woman!

183
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,582
Really?
Is the next band a girl band?

184
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,892
Ah, no. The vocalist is a woman,

185
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:07,122
but the drummer and guitarist
play like pros.

186
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,792
This is their first live in Tokyo

187
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,692
but they were quite famous
back in their hometown.

188
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,102
- Wanna check them out?
- Sure.

189
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,902
These blonde curls are really cute.
Are they fake?

190
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:19,472
No, they're real.

191
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,072
Who is this girl?

192
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:24,072
Hey, you know,
I hear the next band is pretty good.

193
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:25,672
Huh? Really?

194
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,472
Why not stay just for the beginning?

195
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:31,382
Hey, they're saying that the next band's
really great. Let's hear them play.

196
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:33,922
They're really great?
In that case, let's hear them.

197
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:34,922
Are they?

198
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,482
Well, I don't know, but...

199
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:38,892
If they don't perform well,
this could be embarrassing.

200
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:44,432
Looks like a lot of the people
have returned.

201
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,862
- Um...
- They're coming!

202
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:01,532
What am I gonna do?

203
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,882
I'm getting really nervous.

204
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:08,182
My heart is beating so hard, it could tear.

205
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:15,192
Hey, look at them.
That band looks really hot.

206
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:19,462
Yeah, but a band should be credited,
not for its looks, but for its sound.

207
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,982
What's this? The floor is shaking.

208
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:41,892
Nana!

209
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,002
Good evening. We're BLAST.

210
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,912
Back home, she had
some dedicated fans.

211
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:13,042
She was like a celebrity.

212
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:35,372
It was enough just to stand
on my own two feet.

213
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:38,572
I felt that I was being left behind.

214
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,512
Nana's songs all seemed to
consist of that same message.

215
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:50,282
I feel my eyes tearing up.

216
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:55,652
That's exactly how I'm feeling.

217
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,762
Don't leave me behind, Nana.

218
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:03,862
What a surprise!

219
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,202
You guys are really talented!

220
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,812
The other performances that
came up after you all

221
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,402
looked like those played by children
in a school band.

222
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:11,442
Sure your sound is great.
But how do I put this.

223
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,312
You guys had this great aura emitting
from you when you took that stage.

224
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,112
Anyway, you were awesome.

225
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,612
Thank you, Mr. Kyosuke, Ms. Junko.

226
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:22,342
You can drop the "Mr" Nobu.
We're the same age as you, after all.

227
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,822
Really? You are?

228
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:27,092
You're really mature, so I expected you
to be about the same age as Yasu.

229
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,712
You're the one who acts
like a kid for his age, Nobu.

230
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,292
You're pretty cool as long as
you don't talk.

231
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:34,092
That's a good call to have you
not talk while on stage.

232
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:39,132
Um, Miss Komatsu. Do you have plates
we can use to divide this for everyone?

233
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:42,932
Oh, we don't have enough plates.
Just serve it like that.

234
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,872
- Okay.
- Misato!

235
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:46,342
What did you make?

236
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:47,882
Some vinegared dish and salad.

237
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,382
I figured you'd want something light
after the concert.

238
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:54,252
Far out! You sure are thoughtful, Misato.

239
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,452
Leave the rest to Hachiko.
Come chat with us.

240
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,612
- But...
- It's fine, it's fine.

241
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,592
- There aren't enough seats. Nobu, move.
- Yes.

242
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,032
What about my seat?

243
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:07,362
Did you come all the way out here
just to see them perform?

244
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,202
- Yes.
- You look so cute in that apron.

245
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:12,192
Shin, that's my apron!

246
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:15,532
That's great. You already
have such dedicated fans.

247
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:18,612
But I'm surprised that you found out
about the live concert.

248
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,702
We got this on a last minute call
to fill in an opening.

249
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,182
Nana called me and told me about it.

250
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,452
Is that so?

251
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:28,482
I just wanted to inform her.
I never expected her to actually come.

252
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,282
Should I not have come?!

253
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:33,152
Why would you think that?
I'm happy you came.

254
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,192
Have a seat.

255
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,162
Thank you!

256
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,332
What's with that
"Should I not have come?" nonsense?

257
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,362
That sounds stupid.

258
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,862
Does that girl seriously like Nana?

259
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,802
She was crying a lot at the live.

260
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,602
But they're both women.
That's just weird.

261
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:57,982
- I never imagined I'd feel any jealousy.
- These blonde curls are really nice.

262
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,642
I may be the weird one.

263
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:02,552
That's really cute.

264
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,792
Well then, see you. Good night.

265
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,422
Good luck with your band!

266
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,062
Hey Nobu, get up. We're leaving.

267
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,222
No way. I don't feel well.

268
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,832
Nobu really can't take alcohol.

269
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,532
And you're too unaffected by alcohol.

270
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,662
Hey, Nana. Let's let Nobu crash here.

271
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,632
Sure, as you wish.

272
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:23,942
Well...

273
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,672
I should be going now.

274
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,872
Huh? Where are you going, Misato?

275
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,542
I've booked a room in a hotel
near Tokyo Station.

276
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:34,052
Really? Then why don't I get
a taxi and take you there?

277
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,722
What a relief. I thought
she was planning on staying here.

278
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,022
Cancel the hotel room. Just stay here.

279
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:42,062
That's right. You came
all the way here, after all.

280
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,592
No, it's okay. I couldn't.

281
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:47,462
There's no need to hesitate. Nobu!
It's decided. You go home now.

282
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,492
If you stay here, Misato won't be safe.

283
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:51,202
That's not fair!

284
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:53,502
Then I'll stay at Nobu's place tonight.

285
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,242
I can't sleep.

286
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:03,912
Sure I know Nana's not the type that
would force herself on another woman,

287
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,642
but what if Misato's into that sorta thing?

288
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:09,012
Maybe they'll get carried away.

289
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:14,822
Nana was kinda drunk. Her being in
such a good mood is proof she's drunk.

290
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,262
But how do two women do it?

291
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,672
I guess Nana would be on top...

292
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,402
Oh, no! I almost imagined it!
I'd better find myself a boyfriend!

293
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:29,512
Sexually deprived

294
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:32,812
Sexually deprived
I need to be touched.
Both mentally and physically.

295
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,172
That's why I'm having these
inexplicable feelings.

296
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:41,742
I really am in need of a kind man
who will take good care of me.

297
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,722
But it's such a burden going through
the process of finding a boyfriend.

298
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,692
And falling in love is exhausting.

299
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,892
In the first place, I get too involved
when I fall in love.

300
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:55,792
I'm so involved that I
lose sight of everything.

301
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:58,032
That's why things don't work out.

302
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,502
It was like that with Mr. Asano too...

303
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,732
I can't picture his face anymore.

304
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:09,042
And I really liked him.
And with Shoji too.

305
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:14,412
I don't wanna think about Shoji now.
I don't wanna remember anything.

306
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,222
In the meantime, how am I gonna
spend the day tomorrow?

307
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:22,322
As long as I have work, I've got
something else to put my mind on.

308
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,362
But I don't work until
the day after tomorrow.

309
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,462
On the other hand, if I think I've
gotta put up with Ms. Sakagami

310
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:30,522
telling me how useless I am,
I really don't wanna go.

311
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,402
I wanna look for another job
and quit this one right away.

312
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:39,002
No matter how I think it through,
I'm just not suited for that workplace.

313
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:43,302
But I wonder, is there such a place
in this world I'm suited for?

314
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,642
I envy Nana.

315
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:54,922
Good morning! I'm going to
the amusement park with Misato!
I'll bet you're envious!
Ha ha ha!

316
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:01,662
Why not ask me out?!
I wanna go to the amusement park, too!

317
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:04,902
Anyway, I'm going out.

318
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:10,512
I know. I'll go shopping. I'll buy clothes,
and make up, and everything I want.

319
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:11,472
I'm going on a shopping spree.

320
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,682
But I don't have any money.

321
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,552
I put that 300,000 yen
my mom gave me in a CD deposit.

322
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:19,582
Hello.

323
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:20,582
The interest rate isn't that great.

324
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,052
- I shouldn't have done it.
- Um,

325
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,152
- I no longer care about
- if you're looking for that color...

326
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,862
that detached home with a yard!

327
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,222
M-Miss?

328
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:33,062
Why is the city full of couples
on holidays?

329
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:36,702
I'm going home.

330
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,772
It's already seven o'clock.

331
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:45,172
I hardly did anything today.

332
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:48,442
Yet I'm really hungry.
What should I do about dinner?

333
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:51,242
Oh, I know. I'll go to Jackson's.

334
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:54,742
The people there know me,
so I won't be lonely even if I go alone.

335
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,622
But Shoji also hangs out there.

336
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:02,562
I changed my mind.

337
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,552
I'll go to the supermarket
and buy something to cook.

338
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,092
I've gotta spend less.

339
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:10,992
Misato's in high school, so she's got
classes from tomorrow.

340
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,002
I'm sure she's on the train
returning home about now.

341
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:15,972
Then Nana could be back soon.

342
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,942
The ground meat's on sale.
I'll make hamburgers.

343
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:42,592
Why must I run into her here?
Does she live around here too?

344
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:50,602
Or maybe she's about to go to
Shoji's place... and cook in that kitchen...

345
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,012
You're home, Hachiko. Where'd you go?

346
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:05,852
Hello. Great timing.
I just finished preparing dinner.

347
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:08,852
Look at her. Isn't Misato super cute?

348
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,092
Nana bought this for me.

349
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:16,432
Wha?

350
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:21,992
Stop taking them away.

351
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:23,842
Hachi?

352
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:27,182
Everyone's taking away
my places of comfort.

353
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,872
Is this girl gonna stay here tonight, too?

354
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,322
This is my home, too!

355
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:35,712
So don't just do as you please, Nana!

356
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,862
That moment, I was convinced
Nana would be furious.

357
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:50,532
But she had the expression
of a scolded child.

358
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:55,042
Every time I think back about it,
it hurts me.

359
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:00,842
Back then, if I were a bit more mature,

360
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,282
and a bit more understanding
of your weaknesses,

361
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:06,272
would our future have been different?

362
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,882
I reached into the sky

363
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:19,402
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

364
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:24,772
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

365
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:30,762
Like colorful balloons

366
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,882
I'm alone

367
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:36,612
My hand had no place to go

368
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:43,242
And gently you took it

369
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,422
Starless night

370
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:48,622
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

371
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:54,422
I want to feel your warmth

372
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,302
Tears are falling down

373
00:21:56,302 --> 00:22:00,402
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

374
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:06,902
Of your hand holding mine
