1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,875
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:05,748
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,859
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,152
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,355
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:18,438
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,754
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:25,915
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:30,081
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:31,922
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,128
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:37,865
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,491
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,324
Look!

15
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:08,416
He is taunting us. You are so gonna be dinner!

16
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:10,661
Hey! Where's the fishing line?

17
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:14,104
Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.

18
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,546
Aahh, it's all tangled!

19
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:20,566
Not tangled... woven. I made you a necklace, Katara.

20
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:25,148
I thought since you lost your other one...

21
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:28,473
Thanks, Aang. I love it.

22
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,631
Great, Aang.

23
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:33,297
Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making business.

24
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,980
I don't see why I can't do both.

25
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,511
Stop taunting me!

26
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,874
So, how do I look?

27
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:55,427
You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.

28
00:01:55,483 --> 00:02:00,045
Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love.

29
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,984
I... well...

30
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:08,795
Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet little guy... just like Momo.

31
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,583
Thanks.

32
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:19,998
Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!

33
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:33,425
Well, hello there. Nice day, isn't it?

34
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,030
Make noise, it'll run off!

35
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:37,440
No, play dead, he'll lose interest!

36
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,708
Whoa! Close one.

37
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,708
Run down hill, then climb a tree!

38
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,237
No, punch him in the bill!

39
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,452
And then run in zigzags!

40
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:51,019
No need. It's going to be fine.

41
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,639
Whoa there!

42
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,381
Mmm! Lunch! Lucky for you we came along.

43
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:16,268
Thanks, but everything was already under control.

44
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:20,962
Not to worry, Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey.

45
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:21,904
Aunt who?

46
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:29,394
No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future.

47
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,615
Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.

48
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,794
But the fortuneteller was wrong!

49
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:38,664
You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!

50
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:44,472
But I wasn't. All right, have a good one!

51
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:51,626
Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this.

52
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:56,405
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.

53
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,623
Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.

54
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:04,864
What do ya know, an umbrella!

55
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,221
That proves it.

56
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:09,802
No it doesn't... you can't really tell the future.

57
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:14,790
I guess you're not really getting wet then.

58
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,503
Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day.

59
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,688
Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.

60
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:29,781
Look, I'm going to predict the future now... "It's going to keep drizzling."

61
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,888
See!

62
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,852
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

63
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,680
Aunt Wu is expecting you.

64
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,727
Really?

65
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:10,680
My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

66
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,043
Well hello there.

67
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,181
Hello.

68
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,568
Can I get you some tea, or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?

69
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll try a curd puff.

70
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,535
Just a second. So what's your name?

71
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:26,720
Aang.

72
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:32,653
That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?

73
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,328
I... guess...

74
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,998
Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!

75
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:41,254
Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.

76
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:43,269
Likewise.

77
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,251
I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.

78
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,566
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

79
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,376
There are things in this world that just can't be explained.

80
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,100
Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?

81
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:58,499
It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.

82
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:03,361
Oh Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love!

83
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,451
He's going to give me a rare panda lilly.

84
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:13,330
That's so romantic. I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.

85
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,310
Good luck with that!

86
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:21,400
Is that the big eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

87
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:31,223
Enjoy your snack.

88
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:39,043
Welcome young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy.

89
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,143
I guess that's me.

90
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:47,163
Not bad. Not bad.

91
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:52,024
I'm good on puffs.

92
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:55,912
So... what do you think they're talking about back there?

93
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,024
Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love.

94
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,957
Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have.

95
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:07,413
Yeh... dumb stuff like that... well, I've gotta find a bathroom!

96
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:15,016
Your palms are so smooth... do you use moisturizer?

97
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:20,251
Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some if you want.

98
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,597
So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?

99
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,752
I feel great romance for you. The man you're going to marry...

100
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:29,919
Tell me more!

101
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:36,556
I can see that he is a very powerful bender.

102
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,712
Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.

103
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:46,663
Yeh, when I was in there...

104
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:47,958
I don't even wanna know!

105
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,296
Who's next?

106
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,511
Okay, let's get this over with.

107
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:58,124
Your future is full of struggle and anguish, most of it self-inflicted.

108
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,446
But, you didn't read my palms or anything!

109
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:06,560
I don't need to... it's written all over your face.

110
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:10,739
You then, come with me.

111
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:17,260
This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie.

112
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,923
Go on, pick one.

113
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,818
Now throw it on the fire.

114
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:31,141
The heat makes cracks in the bones and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny.

115
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:34,525
Wow, that's a big crack.

116
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:38,475
I've never seen this before.

117
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,584
Oh my!

118
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:54,103
The old destiny, this is incredible! You will be involved in a great battle,...

119
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,870
...an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil,...

120
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:02,680
...a battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!

121
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:06,537
Yeh, yeh, I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl?

122
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:09,668
A girl? You want to know about love?

123
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:10,845
Yes!

124
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:15,676
I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

125
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,442
Oh look! I must have missed something.

126
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,228
Right here... it says, "trust your heart and you will be with the one you love."

127
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:30,286
Really!? Thank you, Aunt Wu!

128
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:35,939
Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax.

129
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,563
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.

130
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:46,464
That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy and joyful!

131
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,882
That doesn't prove anything!

132
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,804
Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well.

133
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,723
They sure are.

134
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,966
Why, what did she tell you?

135
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,925
Some stuff. You'll find out.

136
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,290
What's with the sky?

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,022
We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds...

138
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,052
...to predict the fate of the whole village.

139
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,752
That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny.

140
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,718
You better hope that's not a bunny...

141
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:21,301
...the fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.

142
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,278
Do you even hear yourself?

143
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,577
The cloud reading will tell us if Mount Makapu...

144
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:29,145
...will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.

145
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:32,395
We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain...

146
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:37,190
...to check the volcano ourselves, but ever since Aunt Wu moved to the village...

147
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:42,025
...twenty years ago we have a tradition of not doing that.

148
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,438
I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition.

149
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:49,501
Shhhh!! She's coming!

150
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:56,603
Hey Aang, doesn't that cloud look like a flower?

151
00:10:56,678 --> 00:11:00,245
Huh? Sure, I guess.

152
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,145
Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?

153
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,417
Shh!!

154
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:16,857
Bending arrow cloud... good crops this year, nice big harvest!

155
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:19,235
Arg! Good news!

156
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:26,984
Wavy moon shape cloud... let's see? gonna be a great year for twins.

157
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:27,938
Yes!

158
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:33,188
And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it...

159
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:39,770
...the village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year!

160
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:43,823
Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.

161
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:48,326
I like you, but more than normal.

162
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:51,043
Never mind.

163
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,817
Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.

164
00:11:58,876 --> 00:11:59,756
Anytime.

165
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,916
About this man I'm supposed to marry...

166
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,929
...is he gonna be handsome? Oh, I hope he's tall!

167
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:08,204
Ahh, you want another reading.

168
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,759
Yes, please!

169
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:17,048
I can't believe all these saps. Someone really needs to scream some sense at them.

170
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,896
They seem happy, Sokka.

171
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:23,493
Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

172
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:27,404
Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?

173
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:31,087
Yeh, she said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.

174
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:35,861
Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?

175
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,745
Everyday.

176
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,492
Then of course it's going to come true!

177
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:45,827
Really? You think so? I'm so excited!

178
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:52,863
...and then you'll have your third great grandchild...

179
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:58,309
...before quietly passing away in your sleep. Is that enough information for you?

180
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:03,318
Wow, thanks Aunt Wu. Oh, wait, one more thing.

181
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,848
How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

182
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,509
You want me to do a reading for that?

183
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:16,338
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!

184
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,458
So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?

185
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:26,292
Some stuff? You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?

186
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:29,659
Well, there's this girl...

187
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:32,082
I think I know who you mean.

188
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,062
You do? And you're ok with it?

189
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,472
Of course I am. And, to tell you the truth,...

190
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,091
...I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes you too.

191
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,231
She does!?

192
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:44,894
Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up.

193
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:46,516
Well, how do I do that?

194
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:50,912
The number one mistake nice guys like you make being too nice.

195
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:52,325
You can be too nice?

196
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:56,339
Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof,...

197
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,651
...like you don't really care one way or the other.

198
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,974
Well... okay.

199
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,541
Hey Aang, I was wondering...

200
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:06,342
See ya later.

201
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,955
Wow, that kid is good.

202
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:13,988
...and you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye bye now.

203
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,703
Okay, okay, but, one more thing.

204
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,990
All right, what is it?

205
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,653
Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?

206
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,781
Papaya!

207
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:28,257
Ohhh, I hate papaya.

208
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:31,402
Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.

209
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,243
Hey Aang.

210
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:37,819
That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff.

211
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,506
Ugh. Papaya please.

212
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,774
So... papaya.

213
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:51,912
Uh-huh. Would you like some?

214
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:55,526
You know me. I don't really care what I eat.

215
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:58,950
Ok then. See you later.

216
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,655
Maybe aloof isn't my style.

217
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:05,573
Oh! A panda lilly!

218
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,086
Did you see that?

219
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:12,886
Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?

220
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:16,912
I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.

221
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:23,122
Not just any flower... a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy does it work.

222
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,210
Flowers are fine once you're married,...

223
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:30,957
...but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.

224
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,943
But my heart is telling me to get this flower,...

225
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:36,984
...and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.

226
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:41,087
What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.

227
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:43,637
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

228
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,777
Why should she be wrong about love?*

229
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,932
There, on the rim!

230
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:59,912
Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.

231
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:11,889
Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn 'em.

232
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:15,676
There's no time to walk. Grab on.

233
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,129
Hi, Katara.

234
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:30,208
Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?

235
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,793
But, she doesn't even charge.

236
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:33,287
I know, but still.

237
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:37,738
Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

238
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,381
Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.

239
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:44,258
It's going to take an awful lot to change my min...

240
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:46,361
Oh, no!

241
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:51,813
Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!

242
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:56,823
Yeh, yeh, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, "Mr. Science and Reason Lover."

243
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:59,987
If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me.

244
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:03,028
I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do,...

245
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,458
...but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.

246
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:12,309
Well I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.

247
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:17,633
Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here.

248
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:23,457
You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.

249
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:28,166
Look! Can your fortunetelling explain that?

250
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,129
Can your science explain why it rains?

251
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:36,656
Yes! Yes, it can!

252
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:41,298
They just won't listen to reason.

253
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,727
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

254
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,634
I know, that's the problem.

255
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:50,301
Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands.

256
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:54,843
First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.

257
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,011
Shh... we don't want anyone to hear us.

258
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:10,483
Oh, oh! I didn't see you there.

259
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,388
You don't like me. Do you?

260
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,068
Of course I like you.

261
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:17,078
But not the way I like you.

262
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,576
Oh. I guess not.

263
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:24,011
It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone,...

264
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,853
...but they don't think of you that way.

265
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,567
I know what you mean.

266
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,564
She's beautiful, by the way.

267
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:31,369
Huh?

268
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,439
That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.

269
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:42,954
She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair seems so manageable.

270
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:43,964
Don't worry.

271
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:48,394
You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it.

272
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:53,365
Thanks. Wait! Don't you want this?

273
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,625
How did you know?

274
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,050
I've kind of been stalking you... heh!

275
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:02,251
Oh, thanks. I... I guess.

276
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:07,416
Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us...

277
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:10,579
...we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.

278
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:14,881
I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.

279
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:45,102
Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.

280
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:51,333
That's very strange. It shouldn't... Oh my!

281
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:01,719
We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.

282
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,171
Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.

283
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:05,426
If we can dig a deep enough trench...

284
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:08,485
...we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.

285
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:11,380
If any of you are earthbenders come with me.

286
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,770
I'm an earthbender!

287
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:13,896
I'm not!

288
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:20,154
Everybody else grab a shovel... come on, we've gotta hurry!

289
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:41,037
Dig faster! Dig faster!

290
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:50,200
Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!

291
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:21,232
It's too much! It's gonna overflow!

292
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:57,360
Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender that kid is.

293
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:59,477
Wait, what did you just say?

294
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:03,880
Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.

295
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,886
I suppose he is...

296
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,858
By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.

297
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:21,887
So you messed with the clouds did you!

298
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,898
Very clever!

299
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:26,342
No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson...

300
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,952
...about not relying too much on fortunetelling.

301
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:33,294
But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed, and it wasn't.

302
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,480
She was right, after all.

303
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:36,992
I hate you.

304
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:40,313
It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna be all right.

305
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,022
Can I ask you something?

306
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,557
Of course, honey.

307
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:46,093
You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?

308
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,295
You just told me what I wanted to hear.

309
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,959
I'll tell you a little secret, young Airbender. Just as you reshaped those clouds,...

310
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:58,592
...you have the power to reshape your own destiny.

311
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:03,526
Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.

312
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,764
Take care!

313
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,443
Floozy.
