Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.27,0:04:57.40,Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is that you have no choice but to fight,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.91,0:05:02.16,Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that Servants are powerful familiars, \Nso you should use yours well.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.10,0:05:25.29,Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so even replenishing my mana \Nwill likely be difficult for him.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.09,0:05:59.47,Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,Given that,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.47,0:06:03.57,Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the best course was to enlighten \NShirou as to his situation,
