1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,600
The sound of the waves is clearer than usual,
and the moonlight is very bright.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,970
They gently surround me, filling me with warmth.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,580
It's true...

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,450
If you're able to enjoy everything
this world gives to you, then surely...

5
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,130
"Dear Ai, autumn is quickly coming
to an end here in Neo-Venezia,"

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,690
"and winter will soon be upon us."

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,540
"Because Alice was
promoted to Prima before us,"

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,840
"it's just been Aika and I at joint practice lately."

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,680
It's gotten really cold, hasn't it, Aika?

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,850
Huh?

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,260
...Yeah.

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,560
Autumn is almost over, isn't it?

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,960
Hey, Aika.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,860
Yeah?

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,000
Doesn't practice with just the two of us
remind you of when we first met?

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,970
I'd be lying if I said it
doesn't feel a bit lonely, but...

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,690
...it's something we should
be really happy about.

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,420
We just need to catch up to her, don't we?

19
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,160
All right! Let's focus on
becoming Primas, and do our best!

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Huh?

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,130
Aika?

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,120
I'm sorry, Akari.

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,030
I...

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,070
...can't practice with you anymore...

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,110
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,810
What?!

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,890
Why are you apologizing?

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,350
Well...

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,560
You've been dreaming of this day
and working hard for it, haven't you?

30
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,170
Congratulations on your promotion to Prima, Aika!

31
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,330
Thanks. I knew you'd say that.

32
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,270
Also...

33
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,750
...there's one more thing I have to tell you.

34
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,050
What?!

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,400
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

36
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,740
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

37
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:17,960
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,700
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

39
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:29,240
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,670
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

41
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,080
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:47,550
As the days begin to swirl in brilliant colors
Azayaka ni mawaridashita hibi

43
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:57,600
Always and forever, they're filled with love
Itsumo itsudemo ai ga michiteita

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Surely, it's a spiral
Kitto supiraare

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:11,410
The days passed by, each one filled with warmth
Atataka na mainichi o kasanetara

46
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:20,460
And before I knew it, off in the distance...
Itsunomanika tooku ni

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,760
...there you were
Kiteita no ne

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Embraced By That Blue Sea And Wind...

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,700
My!

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,170
Aika was promoted to Prima?

51
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,370
Yes!

52
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,840
My, my! Well, well!

53
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,310
That's wonderful news, isn't it?

54
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,650
Yes! Her alias is "Rosen Queen."

55
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,480
The Queen of Roses!

56
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,690
So that's the one she chose.

57
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,680
Eh?

58
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:04,230
For a while now, Akira has been agonizing
about when to give Aika her promotion exam.

59
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,640
"Not only does Aika have to become a Prima,"

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,370
"but she'll also have to carry
Himeya someday," she said.

61
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,350
Ah, I see.

62
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,410
I'm sure Aika will be fine, though.

63
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,530
Actually, I have another piece of good news.

64
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,430
A new Himeya branch will be opening
near the Santa Lucia Station,

65
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,630
and Aika will be working there
as the branch manager.

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,930
So, she said she'll be really busy from now on.

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,710
But, I wonder why?

68
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,980
She should have been really happy
about it, but Aika was in tears.

69
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,360
Akari.

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,410
Yes?

71
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,480
Your Prima Promotion Exam
will take place tomorrow.

72
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,730
Okay.

73
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,870
President Aria...

74
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,020
I feel kind of nervous.

75
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,520
I can't fall asleep.

76
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,430
"Ai, my Prima Promotion Exam
will finally happen tomorrow."

77
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,880
"I'm too nervous to fall asleep,"

78
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,310
"so even though it's the middle of the night,
I'm going to go practice for a bit."

79
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,450
"Akari, it's finally time, huh?"

80
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,440
"I'm getting kind of nervous, too."

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,730
Thank you for keeping
me company, President Aria.

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,260
Calm down. Just do what you
always do during practice.

83
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,870
Huh? That voice...

84
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,060
I dropped it!

85
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,940
Sideburns!

86
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,770
Hey, I'm in trouble!

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,440
I dropped it! I can't believe I dropped it!

88
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,950
What happened?

89
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,750
I was on the way back from
my middle school reunion.

90
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,690
And then I realized my wallet was gone!

91
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,380
I even had it tied to an elastic band!
But I still dropped it!

92
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,630
But hey, what are you
doing out this late, Sideburns?

93
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,900
My Prima Promotion Exam is tomorrow. So...

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,890
What? I see.

95
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,530
I'll be taking my promotion exam soon, as well.
So I know exactly how you feel, Sideburns.

96
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,310
Let's both do our best!

97
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,110
Akatsuki...

98
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,050
Right!

99
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,750
Hey, Akatsukin!

100
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,350
I found your wallet!

101
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,620
What?! Where was it?

102
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,850
It fell in the restaurant toilet!

103
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,020
It fell in?!

104
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,290
It fell in!

105
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,730
Curse you, wallet!
How dare you fall in such a place!

106
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,700
Stupid thing! I can't even go
to the bathroom in peace!

107
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,930
Calm down, Akatsukin! Calm down!
Stupid thing! I can't even go
to the bathroom in peace!

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,520
Calm down, Akatsukin! Calm down!

109
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,400
You little!

110
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,230
Huh? Akari!
You little!

111
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,300
You're practicing at this hour?

112
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,510
Ah, yes!

113
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,740
Sideburns!

114
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,610
Good luck on your exam!

115
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,110
You dropped it again!

116
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,150
I hope the weather doesn't turn bad.

117
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,460
I have to try and get some sleep.

118
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,890
Good morning, Alicia.

119
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,020
Good morning.

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,730
It's raining, isn't it?

121
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,920
Yes...

122
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,200
Ah, but the sky is bright off in the distance.

123
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,830
It seems like it might stop
in the afternoon, doesn't it?

124
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,440
Why don't we postpone the promotion exam?

125
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,050
This is an important day, after all.

126
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,920
Let's hold the exam another day
when the weather is nice.

127
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,490
It's all right.

128
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,590
Eh?

129
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,960
I've been waiting for this day
to come for a long time.

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,500
This is also the day you decided on
for the promotion exam.

131
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,490
So today is already an important day to me.

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,860
Akari...

133
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,610
Although I guess it can't be helped
if it's still raining in the afternoon.

134
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,080
Akari.

135
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,820
Yes!

136
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,530
It stopped raining.

137
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,230
So, shall we begin?

138
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,670
Yes!

139
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,320
The preparations are complete.
I'm at your service.

140
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,610
All right.

141
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,630
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,390
Now, please take my hand.

143
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,360
Right.

144
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,510
My, is this?

145
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,970
It's a hot water bottle.

146
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,200
My, my, such wonderful service.

147
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,210
Both the seat and the blanket are nice and warm.

148
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,180
Yes, yes.

149
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,360
Well then, off we go.

150
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:42,820
Between here and the Canal Grande, you can see
the Campanile in many different locations.

151
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,620
But on a day when the rain has just let up,
I recommend seeing it from this alleyway.

152
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,490
My!

153
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,730
Hey, Akari!

154
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,030
My, my.

155
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,870
This gentleman is one of the rowers
in the regatta. He makes his own oars.

156
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,910
That's right!

157
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,320
Carve out your own path, I always say!
You'll regret it if you don't.

158
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,750
We're going to win it next year!

159
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,450
Good luck!

160
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,480
Gondola coming through!

161
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,990
We've finally reached the Canal Grande.

162
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,960
It's the great reverse-S-shaped canal
that splits Neo-Venezia in two.

163
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,370
Are you cold?

164
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,490
Not at all.

165
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,980
This is Rialto Bridge, a bridge that spans the
entire Canal Grande with its single arch.

166
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:45,540
It's a place where people crossing over the water
and people enjoying the view cross paths.

167
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,890
Oh! Here she comes, Akatsukin!

168
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,860
All right. Hey, Woody.
Let's go ahead with our plan!

169
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,020
Got it!

170
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,020
Good luck!
Good luck!

171
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,070
Hurrah, hurrah, Akari!
Hurrah, hurrah, Sideburns!

172
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,610
Do your best, Akari!
Akatsuki, Woody...

173
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,340
Do your best, Akari!
A-A-Alicia, best wishes to you, too!

174
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,140
A-A-Alicia, best wishes to you, too!

175
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,510
H-Hey! Get down from there! You'll fall!

176
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,540
My, my.

177
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:34,800
I see you gazing up at the endless sky
Dokomademo tsuzuku kono sora nagameteru yokogao

178
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:45,640
Your long hair brushes your cheeks as it sways in the wind
Hoho ni fureru nagai kami ga yureteiru

179
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,850
Though this heartache can't be expressed with words,
Setsunasa wa kotoba ni naranai keredo

180
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,260
As I always have, both now and forevermore...
Ano koro mo ima mo zutto

181
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,830
...here in this city, overflowing with light,
Hikari afureteru kono machi ni

182
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:12,110
I'll gather up these feelings that will never change
Itsumademo kawaranu omoi o yosete

183
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,980
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki

184
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,620
I can always feel the wind as it sweeps past
Fukinukeru kaze wa itsudemo

185
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:36,260
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

186
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,220
Gondola coming through!

187
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,610
We spoke a little while ago, it was a moment full of smiles
Sakki made futari hanashita hohoemi no hitotoki

188
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,150
We spoke a little while ago, it was a moment full of smiles
Sakki made futari hanashita hohoemi no hitotoki
As the sun starts to set,

189
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,580
We spoke a little while ago, it was a moment full of smiles
Sakki made futari hanashita hohoemi no hitotoki
both Piazza San Marco and the inland sea called
"the laguna" gradually begin to change colors.

190
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,950
both Piazza San Marco and the inland sea called
"the laguna" gradually begin to change colors.

191
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,050
These nostalgic, happy days... I'm leaving them behind
Natsukashikute tanoshii hibi nokoshiteku

192
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:07,160
These nostalgic, happy days... I'm leaving them behind
Natsukashikute tanoshii hibi nokoshiteku
It feels as though those warm colors
surround us and soothe our hearts, doesn't it?

193
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,820
These nostalgic, happy days... I'm leaving them behind
Natsukashikute tanoshii hibi nokoshiteku

194
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,270
There's just one thing I'm praying for
Hitotsu dake negai o komete inoru no
Akari, your sculling and tour guide
skills have really improved.

195
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,770
There's just one thing I'm praying for
Hitotsu dake negai o komete inoru no

196
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,070
There's just one thing I'm praying for
Hitotsu dake negai o komete inoru no
You have your own style,
which can be easily felt.

197
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,300
You have your own style,
which can be easily felt.

198
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,770
A bridge to connect our hearts
Kokoro o tsunagu kake hashi
You have your own style,
which can be easily felt.

199
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,840
A bridge to connect our hearts
Kokoro o tsunagu kake hashi
That's very important.

200
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,080
As you cross that bridge,
Ano sanbashi no mukougawa e
That's very important.

201
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,940
As you cross that bridge,
Ano sanbashi no mukougawa e

202
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,980
As you cross that bridge,
Ano sanbashi no mukougawa e
Thank you very much.

203
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,750
As you cross that bridge,
Ano sanbashi no mukougawa e

204
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,380
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi

205
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,550
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi
Well then, let's continue on.

206
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:33,820
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi

207
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,760
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi
Right.

208
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,120
Look around, and you'll see the sun-dappled canal
Furimukeba kirameku komorebi no michi

209
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,790
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

210
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,130
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
Alicia, isn't this canal?

211
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,070
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
Yes, it's normally restricted.

212
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,530
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

213
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,040
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
But right now, we have
permission to pass through.

214
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,140
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru

215
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,080
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
Now, let's go...

216
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,140
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
...toward the future that
awaits you on the other side.

217
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,880
...toward the future that
awaits you on the other side.

218
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,210
Of that I'm certain
Sou kitto
...toward the future that
awaits you on the other side.

219
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,220
Of that I'm certain
Sou kitto

220
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,340
Right!

221
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:12,260
My heart races like the rhythm of the waves
Takanaru kodou wa namima o utau rizumu

222
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,160
My heart races like the rhythm of the waves
Takanaru kodou wa namima o utau rizumu
It's really narrow.

223
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,330
My heart races like the rhythm of the waves
Takanaru kodou wa namima o utau rizumu
Narrower than any other canal
I've ever passed through.

224
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,900
Narrower than any other canal
I've ever passed through.

225
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,330
As I discover that intangible certainty
Katachi no nai tashika na mono mitsukete
Narrower than any other canal
I've ever passed through.

226
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,630
As I discover that intangible certainty
Katachi no nai tashika na mono mitsukete

227
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,670
As I discover that intangible certainty
Katachi no nai tashika na mono mitsukete
I never knew a place like this existed.

228
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,040
As I discover that intangible certainty
Katachi no nai tashika na mono mitsukete

229
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,050
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki

230
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,280
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki
But, I wonder why...

231
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,250
Whenever I am blessed with kindness,
Yasashisa ni meguriau toki
For some reason, I'm not worried at all.

232
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,860
I can always feel the wind as it sweeps past
Fukinukeru kaze wa itsudemo

233
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,620
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

234
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,060
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita
I can feel it.

235
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,530
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita
I'll be all right.

236
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,090
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

237
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,000
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita
Ah, I see...

238
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,760
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita

239
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,140
It fades away in the distance, as I gently close my eyes
Haruka tooku tokete yuku sotto me o tojita
It's because the three of us
always practiced together.

240
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,340
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

241
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,010
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
That's why I'll be okay.

242
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,280
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete

243
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,010
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
From the oar, to my fingertips...

244
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,550
If you visit here, come with open arms
Kono basho ni otozureta nara ryoute hirogete uketomete
I can feel the deep, calm,
melodic waves of the water.

245
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,780
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
I can feel the deep, calm,
melodic waves of the water.

246
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,250
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
Those precious days spent with friends...

247
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,660
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
...are now supporting me...

248
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,720
The blue sky and the starry night will be here to greet you
Aoi sora mo hoshizora mo mukaetekureru
...and firmly pushing me forward.

249
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,060
...and firmly pushing me forward.

250
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,290
They'll welcome you
Anata no koto o
...and firmly pushing me forward.

251
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,660
They'll welcome you
Anata no koto o

252
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,760
Of that I'm certain
Sou kitto

253
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,540
Gondola coming through!

254
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,190
Akari, that was a wonderful ride.

255
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,830
It was slow and gentle, as if the
gondola became one with the water.

256
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,660
Alicia...

257
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,100
Now for the final course.

258
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,500
Our next destination will be
wherever you choose.

259
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,840
After all, it's up to you to decide
what kind of Prima you want to be.

260
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,910
What kind of Prima I want to be...

261
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,150
All right.

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,230
Say, Akari.

263
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,200
The moment when things begin
to change is so mysterious, isn't it?

264
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,710
Even though everyone is
walking down their own path,

265
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,210
our changes are connected, as if
we were all calling out to each other.

266
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,910
It's as though everything
was fated from the beginning.

267
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,260
Alicia...

268
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,340
Alicia, we can see it now.

269
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,540
That...

270
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,420
That is my goal.

271
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,980
I want to be...

272
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,560
...like Grandma...

273
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,930
...like you, Alicia...

274
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,130
I want to be a Prima that embodies
the Aria Company itself.

275
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,710
Akari.

276
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,940
Yes?

277
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:59,140
Ever since you came to Aqua,
my world has completely changed.

278
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,620
My ordinary days...

279
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,730
The way I viewed the world...

280
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,020
They all began to shine,
so wonderful and bright.

281
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,920
Yes...

282
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,660
As if a magic spell had been cast on them.

283
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:25,300
Just like the endless sky and sea
that gently surround all of Aqua...

284
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,450
I'm so glad that I met you.

285
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
Thank you...

286
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,460
...my Aquamarine.

287
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,190
Aquamarine...

288
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,350
The distant, endless blue.

289
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,380
Congratulations on your
promotion to Prima, Akari.

290
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,020
Thank you very much, Alicia!

291
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,530
President Aria!

292
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,090
I did it!

293
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,400
I've finally become a Prima!

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,540
I've always...

295
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,300
...always, always yearned to be one.

296
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,680
From the first day I came to this planet. Always.

297
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,420
Akari.

298
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,520
Yes?

299
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,150
I have something important to tell you.

300
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,900
Yes?

301
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,640
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

302
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,270
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

303
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:20,260
As my thoughts focus intently on someone,
Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki

304
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:29,230
Love rests on my palm, held high
Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru

305
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:42,580
A future guided by the flow of water and wind
Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai

306
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:51,680
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world
Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete

307
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:04,910
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now
Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima

308
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,410
A shore awash in golden waves
Kin no nami kishibe ni

309
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:16,580
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning
Akogare mezameru no asa ni

310
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,890
And my day begins
Hajimaru

311
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,430
Changing days...

312
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,030
Beloved times...

313
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,830
Our respective futures...

314
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,170
And so, I move forward.

315
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,040
Final Episode
To That New Beginning...
The final episode, "To That New Beginning..."

316
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,560
Final Episode
To That New Beginning...
Now, please take my hand.
