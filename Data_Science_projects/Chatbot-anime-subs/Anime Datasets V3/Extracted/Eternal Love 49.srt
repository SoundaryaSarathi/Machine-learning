<i>[Episode 49]</i>

3
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,485
Auntie, are you really going
to marry the Crown Prince?

4
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,680
I have to marry him sooner or later.

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,180
There's no harm in choosing "earlier."

6
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,187
Surely not.

7
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,484
I'm just surprised by
your fiery passion with Ye Hua.

8
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:28,813
You can marry whenever you want.

9
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:31,161
I wouldn't dare voice an opinion.

10
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:35,330
The marriage between Qing Qiu and
the Celestial Tribe is very important.

11
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,454
We can't be the only willing party.

12
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,876
The wedding was brought up
by Ye Hua's mother first

13
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,328
so I came home to discuss about it.

14
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,937
Consort Le Xu mentioned it?

15
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,020
- But...
- Second Brother!

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,344
Look at you.

17
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,764
They are already engaged anyway.

18
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,252
It's just holding the wedding now.

19
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:57,862
Why do you have that many worries?

20
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,218
What about Mo Yuan?

21
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,253
Master?

22
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,459
Once a mentor, a father for life.

23
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,848
I do have to inform my mentor about it.

24
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:12,675
However, this marriage was
decided by the Heavenly Lord and Father.

25
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,894
Master wouldn't object to it.

26
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:19,006
Moreover, he probably still
doesn't know that I'm a girl.

27
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,085
Naive... You're too naive.

28
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,098
Do you think that High God Mo Yuan
couldn't see through Zhe Yan's magic?

29
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,923
They are brothers!

30
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:34,825
I've always thought it was Mo Yuan
you had on your mind.

31
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,862
Second Brother, you mustn't make
such a joke.

32
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:41,236
My mentor saved me from
my heavenly trial.

33
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,712
He also mentored and educated me.

34
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:47,645
He's as close to me as Father is.

35
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,813
Even if I had to sacrifice my life
for Master one day

36
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,318
I wouldn't hesitate at all.

37
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:54,907
However, Ye Hua is the only
man on my mind.

38
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,509
That is absolutely true.

39
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,563
All right.

40
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,889
Since you clearly know
what it is you seek

41
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,257
I won't hold you back.

42
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:05,784
It's just that you've been
engaged for a long time.

43
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,056
Why are you suddenly in a rush
to get the wedding done?

44
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:12,199
It's because Ye Hua went to
Yingzhou for me

45
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,111
and used up his cultivation
to make the elixir.

46
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,956
He saved my mentor.

47
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,093
He doesn't have much cultivation left.

48
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,076
I'm worried that should he
take the throne of Heavenly Lord

49
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,973
he might not be able to withstand

50
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,238
the karma of 81 sacred blazes
and 9 holy lightning bolts.

51
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,747
What has his inheriting the throne
got to do with your wedding?

52
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,374
Since the ancient times

53
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,795
both the Heavenly Lord and Empress have
endured such fires of karma together.

54
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,415
If I could marry him soon

55
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,886
I could take on
the fires of karma with him.

56
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,673
You're not his wife yet,
and you're already so thoughtful of him?

57
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:50,367
Fifth Sister is from Qing Qiu.

58
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,889
She's so faithful. So faithful.

59
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,610
All right. I'll write a letter tomorrow.

60
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,538
I'll have it sent to Mother and Father.

61
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,987
Thank you, Second Brother.
I'll get going.

62
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:02,112
Sure.

63
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:03,161
Where are you going?

64
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,642
This is your Qing Qiu Fox Den.

65
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,053
Riceball is still young.

66
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:10,331
Ye Hua is constantly busy with work.

67
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,915
I have to head back to look after him.

68
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,668
What about your second
and fourth brothers?

69
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:14,798
You don't care about us?

70
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:16,958
Ignore him.

71
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,351
Get going.

72
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,011
Yes, Second Brother. I'll leave now.

73
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:26,302
Look at her.
What a good step-mother she is.

74
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,860
It's a pity that there's a side consort

75
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,101
bestowed by the Heavenly Lord
in Ye Hua's harem.

76
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:35,918
Fifth Sister and Ye Hua can't just be
a loving couple with intruders.

77
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,401
By the way, I forgot about a matter.

78
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,141
What is it?

79
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,906
I'm about to marry into
the Celestial Palace.

80
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,805
I took one of the thrones of
the Five Far Lands

81
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,233
so it must be passed on to another.

82
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,644
I can't be a heavenly princess consort
and a queen at the same time.

83
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,471
Although it seems correct in theory

84
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:58,420
our parents only had five children.

85
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,141
Five Far Lands of Qing Qiu, five rulers.

86
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,603
No one should take two thrones.

87
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,452
I mean...

88
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:09,485
Among the five of us
only you have a daughter, Feng Jiu.

89
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:12,475
Why don't I... pass it on to her?

90
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,310
Me?

91
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,024
Good! Great idea.

92
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:21,677
However, Second Brother is the emperor
of Qing Qiu's Five Far Lands.

93
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,949
If Feng Jiu takes your throne

94
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,341
isn't the seniority a bit messed up?

95
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,242
Head back first.

96
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:32,918
I'll discuss this matter with
our parents and Bai Xuan first

97
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,134
before we make a decision.

98
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,281
All right, I'll get going now.

99
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:37,382
I...

100
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,351
Auntie, why have you asked to talk to me?

101
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,764
Did your father hit you again?

102
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,064
He didn't beat me up that severely.

103
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:55,567
What exactly is it?

104
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,564
I don't really know the details.

105
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,175
It's just that Third Prince's girlfriend
has asked me to pass on a message.

106
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:05,156
She asked that you visit her
in the Nine Heavens.

107
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,206
Lady Cheng Yu?

108
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,459
Exactly.

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,353
Lady Cheng Yu always
acts very cautiously.

110
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:15,552
If it weren't an important matter

111
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,197
she wouldn't have asked
Auntie to approach me for her.

112
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,009
I don't know the details.

113
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,170
However, judging from her expression

114
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,307
it seems to be a serious matter.

115
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,834
I won't stay to chat.

116
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,062
I'm in a rush to head back
for dinner with Riceball.

117
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:32,117
If you're going to sneak
into the Nine Heavens

118
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,567
get Bai Zhen to help you.

119
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,382
Feng Jiu sees Auntie off.

120
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,439
You've been smiling all day.

121
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,137
Is there some joyous occasion?

122
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,285
Exactly.

123
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,175
There are actually two joyous occasions.

124
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:03,127
First, our little Feng Jiu is going
to become the Queen of Qing Qiu.

125
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,990
Isn't Qian Qian the Queen of Qing Qiu?

126
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,059
That's the second joyous occasion.

127
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,182
My Fifth Sister is getting married.

128
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:13,002
She's really fallen in love this time.

129
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:15,759
She even approached Bai Yi to
have him bring it up to our parents.

130
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,490
She's also set a date.

131
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,463
It's the second day of September.

132
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,382
<i>Mo Yuan...</i>

133
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,360
Aren't you going to say anything?

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,826
You're not surprised?

135
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:31,444
Even a man like my brother
Bai Yi was shocked.

136
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,836
What is so surprising and shocking?

137
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:47,216
Indeed. Ye Hua's father is already
making a list of betrothal gifts.

138
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,894
I also have much to prepare.

139
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:54,312
Su Jin.

140
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:57,091
Not only are you the side consort
of Xiwu Palace

141
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,491
but also the only concubine in its harem.

142
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,412
You have to help with the preparations.

143
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:05,643
Assign the servants to
start preparing for the wedding.

144
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,216
We haven't had such a grand
joyous occasion for a long time.

145
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:20,086
Don't worry, Your Highness.

146
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:23,666
I'll surely do my best to make
all the arrangements for Your Highness.

147
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,937
High God Bai Qian will marry
into the palace glamorously.

148
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,109
I wonder when the wedding will be held?

149
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:36,394
We have yet to set a date.

150
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,008
The date isn't set?

151
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:42,765
Didn't Ye Hua sink Yingzhou
of the Eastern Sea?

152
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,437
He slayed the four mythical beasts
left behind by Heavenly Father.

153
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:48,370
He's now punished to withstand
heavenly trial in the Mortal Realm.

154
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,649
The soonest he could return
is two months.

155
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,198
We'll set the date when he returns.

156
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,269
I understand.

157
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:13,945
High God.

158
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,841
Is His Highness in there?

159
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,332
His Highness didn't know
when High God would return

160
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:23,346
so he's instructed me to wait here
for your return to take you to him.

161
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,075
He's made it so mysterious?

162
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,721
High God, this way, please.

163
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:38,840
High God, is there a problem?

164
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:44,029
I'm fine.

165
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:50,298
I've been to this lotus pond before.

166
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,672
Why is it so foggy here tonight?

167
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:58,440
His Highness has especially
arranged it to be so.

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,519
High God, this way, please.

169
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,467
Greetings to Auntie!

170
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,460
Qian Qian, come here.

171
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,958
Come here.

172
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,163
Qian Qian.

173
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:26,568
These are all the deities of
the Celestial Tribe.

174
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,683
Bai Qian greets everyone.

175
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,878
What a perfect match.

176
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:37,616
How lovely.

177
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,172
A match made in heaven.

178
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,807
What a beautiful couple!

179
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,282
Why did you welcome me in
with the Crown Prince's formality?

180
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:45,557
You're the Crown Princess Consort
of the Nine Heavens.

181
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,116
It should be done so.

182
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:51,739
Who knew that
you could sometimes be so...

183
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:54,947
What?

184
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:58,692
So likable.

185
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,371
Just likable?

186
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,428
A-Li greets Father and Mother.

187
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,909
- Come here.
- That's so adorable!

188
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,453
Why has Mother sneaked in here again?

189
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:18,190
I thought that I wouldn't be
able to see you for some time.

190
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:22,897
I've gone to visit a few of
your uncles in Qing Qiu.

191
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:28,307
I've asked them to make arrangements
so that I can marry your father soon.

192
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,020
Really? That's wonderful!

193
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,298
Look!

194
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:34,485
He's such a good boy.

195
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:36,067
How lovely!

196
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,797
He's so adorable.

197
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:40,533
Ye Hua.

198
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,577
I visited my brothers back in Qing Qiu.

199
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:46,222
My second brother has already
agreed to speak to my parents.

200
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:50,403
If it all goes well, we can get married
on the second of September.

201
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:54,033
Qian Qian, I'm afraid that we won't
be able to make it then.

202
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,033
Why?

203
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,322
I have to withstand
a heavenly trial in the Mortal Realm.

204
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,510
Why would you have to do so
for no reason?

205
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:12,505
It has to do with those four mythical
beasts of Yingzhou.

206
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,754
Although I've rendered a great merit
in destroying the divine fungal grass

207
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,748
it's a great sin to have killed
those four beasts.

208
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,571
After all, they did possess half of
Heavenly Father's powers.

209
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,469
There's still much to make up for it
after rendering the merit.

210
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:28,549
I have to be punished.

211
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,400
Hence, the heavenly trial
in the Mortal Realm.

212
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,177
It's actually because of
those four mythical beasts?

213
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:39,299
I already didn't like them when
they wounded my father.

214
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,077
It seems that they are really
my nemesis in life.

215
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,261
How long will you be gone?

216
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,057
It's 60 years in the Mortal Realm
until my mortal self dies.

217
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,417
That's just two months apart from you
in the heavens.

218
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,174
Two months?

219
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,543
You'll head down into the Mortal Realm
at the beginning of August

220
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:04,933
so if the trial takes two months

221
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,875
we'll postpone the wedding to October?

222
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,446
In October, there's the Indian Summer.

223
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,933
It's also a good date.

224
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:18,081
Although it's only two months for me

225
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:21,054
it will be a lifetime for you
in the Mortal Realm.

226
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,480
Have you read the destiny
that Star Lord wrote you?

227
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,126
He wouldn't write you a two-timing
or three-timing relationship?

228
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,357
Star Lord won't get to write
my story this time.

229
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:35,143
Heavenly Lord gave orders to
leave my destiny blank.

230
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,666
Whatever relationships I might have
are entirely up to me.

231
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,130
It's left blank?

232
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:46,080
It means that no one will know
what you will experience?

233
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,427
Exactly.

234
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:51,438
I have a few reminders for you.

235
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:52,778
Do tell.

236
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:58,620
Even if you will forget your identity
as the Crown Prince of the Nine Heavens

237
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,160
when you descend into the Mortal Realm

238
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,436
and that you still have a legal consort
in Xiwu Palace to marry

239
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,793
you're not allowed to marry
anyone else as a mortal.

240
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:11,041
I'm not worried about anything else.

241
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,383
I'm just concerned that
you might get involved

242
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,725
with some women in the mortal realm.

243
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,975
You should know that I draw
a clear line between love and hate.

244
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,298
I can't stand any betrayal.

245
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,033
If I really got involved in
such a mortal relationship

246
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,812
what would you do?

247
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,529
Should that really happen

248
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,729
I'd snatch you back to Qing Qiu
and lock you up in my Fox Den.

249
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,900
You would only look at me every day.

250
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,697
You'd have to look at me when you eat.

251
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,453
You'd have to look at me when you read.

252
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,636
You'd have to look at me when you draw.

253
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:54,278
If that is so, I'd rather that
you snatch me away right now.

254
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:58,506
Then... it's a deal?

255
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,928
When you get back
from your heavenly trial

256
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,557
come and look for me in Qing Qiu.

257
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,818
By then, we don't have to worry
about those wedding rituals.

258
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,694
We'll just go with Qing Qiu's customs.

259
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,784
I'll lock you in my Fox Den.

260
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,108
Sure.

261
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:17,435
Qian Qian.

262
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,069
Let's go to bed?

263
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,608
You're going to the Heavenly Palace?

264
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:32,924
When we were in the Heavenly Palace

265
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:34,970
Lady Cheng Yu was very kind to me.

266
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,232
She suddenly had Auntie pass on
a message to me urgently.

267
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:40,420
It must be a matter of great importance.

268
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,046
I can't just make up some excuse.

269
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,901
You have a point.

270
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,458
She has taken good care of you.

271
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,568
Now that she has asked to see you

272
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,257
you shouldn't make any excuses not to go.

273
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,955
However...

274
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:54,520
Your father has forbidden you
to leave Qing Qiu.

275
00:17:56,315 --> 00:17:58,047
But Fourth Uncle, you could.

276
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,530
Just take me along with you.

277
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,769
As long as I stay on you

278
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,936
I can get past the celestial shield that
my father put up at the valley.

279
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,910
It's fine that I take you with me.

280
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,769
However, you have to understand that
we can't keep this a secret.

281
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,653
If you escape, your father will
surely go after you.

282
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,388
Give it some thought.

283
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,429
If you make such an effort to escape

284
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,469
you must have gone
to the Celestial Palace.

285
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,834
By then, your father wouldn't even
have to search for you.

286
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,934
He would go straight to Lord Dong Hua.

287
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,585
I'm not going to visit him this time.

288
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,002
Whatever. I'll act accordingly
after my father finds out.

289
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,423
I have to get away first.

290
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,959
Fourth Uncle, please?

291
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:38,813
- Fourth Uncle...
- All right!

292
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,309
Little lass.

293
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:44,586
I'll grant you your wish this time.

294
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:46,736
Thank you, Fourth Uncle.

295
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:00,912
Where are you going, Fourth Uncle?

296
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,942
You're not staying for lunch?

297
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,355
I'm thinking about visiting that
Die Yong in the West Sea

298
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,815
to see how High God
Mo Yuan's spirit is faring.

299
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,132
Qian Qian has been looking after
her future husband

300
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,622
in the Celestial Palace these days.

301
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:15,450
How could she care about the West Sea?

302
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,654
I'll tell Little Princess
not to make you lunch.

303
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,019
Feng Jiu is still asleep.
Don't wake her up.

304
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,076
She hasn't been in a good mood lately.

305
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,682
Just let her sleep in.

306
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:26,092
Wake her up at lunchtime.

307
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,092
Sure.

308
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:38,912
Fourth Uncle is so thoughtful today.

309
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:54,296
Fourth Uncle, be gentle!

310
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:56,070
You threw me to the ground.

311
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:02,491
You're still yammering?

312
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,896
If you don't hurry up,
your father will catch you.

313
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,461
I'll get going now.

314
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,695
Thank you, Fourth Uncle!

315
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,905
Since I've made an excuse
to leave the den

316
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,962
it's troublesome to head back now.

317
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:19,977
That lass got me in this fix.

318
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,858
I don't even have a place
to go for lunch.

319
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,465
Forget it.

320
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,117
I'd better go to Zhe Yan.

321
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,993
What brings both high gods over?

322
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:45,132
Your 17th junior has to look after
the Crown Prince in the Celestial Palace.

323
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,618
She can't come here.

324
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:49,108
Zhen and I decided to take a look.

325
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,317
How has your brother been?

326
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,019
He was suddenly unwell last night.

327
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,132
It went on all night, so I thought
that his situation might deteriorate.

328
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,365
However, he said that he felt
energetic the next day.

329
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:00,238
It was as if his lingering
illness was gone.

330
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:01,623
He even ate quite a lot.

331
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,480
Really?

332
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,609
Yes.

333
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:09,585
It seems that there will be
some good news soon.

334
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,249
High God, you mean...

335
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,903
Your mentor will return very soon.

336
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:16,424
Is that right?

337
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,190
Forgive my manners.

338
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:22,423
It's all right.

339
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:25,041
Quickly. Take me to your brother.

340
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,246
After you.

341
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:54,574
It's indeed as I thought.

342
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:57,519
Your mentor's spirit isn't here anymore.

343
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:01,751
I think that he must have
returned to his own body.

344
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,909
Then... What should I do?

345
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,118
Don't panic.

346
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,580
Hurry back to Kunlun Mountain now.

347
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,353
Gather up all the disciples.

348
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:12,506
Have them prepare to welcome
Mo Yuan back home.

349
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:16,207
Zhen and I will rush back
to Qing Qiu's Yanhua Cave.

350
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:19,830
We'll check to see if your mentor
Mo Yuan's spirit has really returned.

351
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,306
Yes, I'll head back to
Kunlun Mountain right away.

352
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:32,044
He doesn't seem like the first disciple
of Kunlun Mountain.

353
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:33,992
He's more like a reckless teen.

354
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,625
It's not just him.

355
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,009
Even I'm so thrilled that
I don't know what to do next.

356
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,797
Quickly. Let's rush back
to Qing Qiu now.

357
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,929
Go on.

358
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,865
I'll head down to the Mortal Realm
after visiting the Heavenly Lord.

359
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,188
Why won't you let me
see you off to the Mortal Realm?

360
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,837
It's just two months.

361
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,507
If the others learn that High God

362
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,627
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
went personally to see me off

363
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:01,144
aren't you worried about being teased?

364
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:03,269
The Celestial Tribe's regulations
are so bothersome.

365
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:06,348
By the way, I have something for you.

366
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,232
Take this with you.

367
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:12,525
Soul jade?

368
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:16,031
Do you know why Li Jing
handed this over to Mu Gu?

369
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:20,968
It's probably because I saved him
and his sister in Yingzhou.

370
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:23,301
Since you saved them

371
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,282
it's fine for you to keep it.

372
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:32,635
Do you not find it strange that
I accept it so quickly?

373
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:36,301
You're worried that Li Jing would
use that as an excuse to meet me?

374
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,386
I'll get going now.

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,163
Go on.

376
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:01,708
- Second Senior!
- Second Senior!

377
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,051
The bell is chiming again.

378
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,076
It's Master!

379
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,791
- It's Master!
- Master has returned!

380
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,738
- Master has returned!
- This is great!

381
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,429
Master has returned!

382
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:11,761
Master...

383
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,555
- Indeed...
- We've been waiting for so long.

384
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,749
You're right.

385
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:26,757
<i>That's Kunlun Mountain.</i>

386
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:34,962
Lord Dong Hua, could you
recognize this bell?

387
00:24:34,962 --> 00:24:37,102
It is as Heavenly Lord thinks.

388
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,300
The bell is chiming in Kunlun Mountain.

389
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,973
Mo Yuan has returned.

390
00:24:59,692 --> 00:25:01,035
Fifth Sister!

391
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,141
Your long-awaited wish
can probably be fulfilled today.

392
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:06,473
Fourth Brother.

393
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,496
Have you also heard the bell chime?

394
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,246
It isn't just the bell.

395
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:14,019
Your fourth brother and I just
rushed back from the West Sea.

396
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,700
Die Yong had a tough night yesterday

397
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,980
so I investigated with
my soul-tracking magic.

398
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,461
I found out that Mo Yuan's spirit isn't
residing in Die Yong's body anymore.

399
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:25,255
That's why I rushed back here
to check on Yanhua Cave.

400
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:27,521
Mo Yuan has been asleep for so long.

401
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:30,558
He's finally picked
a good day to wake up.

402
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:33,340
<i>Master...</i>

403
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,345
Master is going to wake up?

404
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,152
Crown Prince.

405
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:03,634
According to the regulations
before I take you to the Mortal Realm

406
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:06,683
you'll have to drink the amnesia potion
from the River of Oblivion.

407
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,690
<i>Then... it's a deal?</i>

408
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:13,221
<i>You'll come to look for me
in Qing Qiu when you return.</i>

409
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,434
<i>We won't abide by the wedding rituals.</i>

410
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:19,432
<i>We'll just go along with
Qing Qiu's customs.</i>

411
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:21,250
<i>I'll lock you back in my Fox Den.</i>

412
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,708
<i>Qian Qian...</i>

413
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:45,931
<i>Await my return.</i>

414
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:12,261
What are you doing?

415
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,181
I want to put on my male disguise.

416
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,329
After all, my mentor used to
see me as Si Yin in the past.

417
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,953
He probably wouldn't recognize me.

418
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,842
With Mo Yuan's cultivation,
he long knew that you're a girl.

419
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:30,880
He didn't expose your identity
because of your parents.

420
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,965
Did you really think you fooled
him for 20,000 years?

421
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,913
Fourth Brother said that to me as well.

422
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:42,105
But I still think that Master is used
to seeing me as Si Yin.

423
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:44,480
Stop fooling yourself.

424
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,586
Go ahead.

425
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,144
Don't be scared.
Go and take a look at your mentor.

426
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:57,690
<i>It's been 70,000 years.</i>

427
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:01,758
<i>Between the Four Seas and the Six Realms</i>

428
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:05,905
<i>I've looked at the lakes of
Qing Qiu 779 times.</i>

429
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,496
<i>70,000 years...</i>

430
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:11,232
<i>That is as long as half of my lifetime.</i>

431
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:14,912
<i>I've used half of my lifetime
to do just one thing.</i>

432
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,923
<i>I've been waiting for Master to wake up.</i>

433
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:50,448
<i>From this day forth</i>

434
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:54,435
<i>you're the God of War
Mo Yuan's 17th disciple.</i>

435
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,059
<i>Deity Si Yin.</i>

436
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:58,255
<i>Master, don't leave.</i>

437
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:12,420
Master! I should be the one
to take that heavenly trial!

438
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:24,875
Master!

439
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,641
Master!

440
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:36,515
Seventeenth.

441
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,755
Come and let me take a look at you.

442
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:44,510
Let's see if you've made
any progress over all these years.

443
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:02,561
Master...

444
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,260
You're indeed my little Seventeenth.

445
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,981
Master...

446
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:20,863
You've finally returned.

447
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,176
Yes.

448
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:34,513
I have returned.

449
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:46,895
My little Seventeenth looks lovely
in this form as well.

450
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,164
Master...

451
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:55,751
You haven't changed at all.

452
00:30:58,749 --> 00:30:59,932
Is that so?

453
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,373
Mo Yuan.

454
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:25,382
After 70,000 years, you finally woke up.

455
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:27,854
70,000 years...

456
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:29,991
Yes.

457
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:33,038
It isn't that long,
but it isn't short either.

458
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,602
Qian Qian has hidden out here
in Qing Qiu for 70,000 years as well.

459
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:40,945
She safeguarded your body
to await your return.

460
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,506
It's too damp and cold in here.

461
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:44,689
Let's leave this cave.

462
00:32:16,972 --> 00:32:20,325
You must have had a hard time
in the past 70,000 years?

463
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:25,053
My spirit was split into fragments

464
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:28,011
so it took me quite a lot of time
to put them back together.

465
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,001
Mo Yuan...

466
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,642
You're finally awake.

467
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:55,884
Do you think the Bell of East Emperor
could trap me without your spirit?

468
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:59,247
I just need a bit more time...

469
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,693
It won't take me too long.

470
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,500
We will soon meet again.

471
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:23,950
Master.

472
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,810
Zhe Yan.

473
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,132
During the past 70,000 years
when I was asleep

474
00:33:38,132 --> 00:33:40,916
did anyone who looked identical
to me appear?

475
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,163
There is one such man.

476
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:51,505
Your little disciple even
knows him quite well.

477
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,761
Little Seventeenth, you know him?

478
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,134
What is it?

479
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:06,222
Only when it comes to Mo Yuan
would you show some fear.

480
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:08,498
Don't be shy. Tell him.

481
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,704
The man you just mentioned...

482
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:18,974
He's my fiance.

483
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,380
The Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe.

484
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,302
Your fiance?

485
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,744
What is his name?

486
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:37,438
When was he born?

487
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,385
His name is Ye Hua.

488
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:43,614
He was born about 70,000 years ago

489
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,846
when I brought your body
out of Kunlun Mountain.

490
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,701
Little Seventeenth.

491
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:58,351
My twin brother
is snatched away by you just like that.

492
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:04,416
Why haven't I heard that
you have a twin brother?

493
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,394
It's no wonder that you're surprised.

494
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:12,050
I only learned of it when
Heavenly Father passed away.

495
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,052
A golden lotus?

496
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:17,422
Heavenly Father...

497
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:23,255
I have to tell you  a story first.

498
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:30,614
That year, the Four Pillars of
Heaven and Earth collapsed.

499
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:35,489
In order to hold up and repair those
four pillars that supported the heavens

500
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:37,644
your mother nearly had a miscarriage.

501
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,677
When she went into labor

502
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,536
she was supposed to
give birth to twin sons

503
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:44,434
but she only managed to
keep the eldest alive.

504
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,641
The younger twin was lost.

505
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:52,724
You're that eldest twin.

506
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:57,195
I had a younger brother?

507
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:04,936
I felt guilty toward your brother.

508
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,454
So I used up half of all my powers
to create a celestial fetus.

509
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:16,512
I turned that celestial fetus
into a golden lotus.

510
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:21,521
Now that I'll soon go into
the realm of nothingness

511
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:26,838
I'm entrusting your brother's
celestial fetus to you.

512
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:32,204
You must nurse him in
Kunlun Mountain's lotus pond.

513
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:39,605
Hopefully he shall one day
be born into this world.

514
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:43,175
The both of you are bonded by blood.

515
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:48,472
That might give him a better chance
of reviving him some day.

516
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:52,112
Keep him safe.

517
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:58,889
Mo Yuan.

518
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:09,746
This is... my only wish.

519
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:12,952
Yes.

520
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:22,235
When I sacrificed my spirit
to the Bell of East Emperor

521
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,509
he was finally awakened.

522
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:32,864
I only know that after
Heavenly Father passed away

523
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,300
you've dedicated yourself
to looking after that lotus.

524
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,096
I've never once suspected
where it came from.

525
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:40,630
It's no wonder.

526
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,134
That golden lotus withered
when your soul and spirit vanished.

527
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:48,340
Soon afterwards, Consort Le Xu gave birth
to Crown Prince Ye Hua.

528
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:51,985
No wonder when that lad was born

529
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:54,697
72 rainbow birds flew around
the pillar for 81 days

530
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:57,184
and the misty clouds in the twilight
appeared for three years.

531
00:37:57,184 --> 00:38:00,001
He's actually High God
Mo Yuan's twin brother.

532
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,853
Indeed.

533
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:04,635
Only the twin brother of Mo Yuan
and the son of Heavenly Father

534
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:07,416
could be blessed with
such a celebratory sight.

535
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:11,313
The records in the Nine Heavens
stated clearly that

536
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:14,594
Heavenly Father only had one son
High God Mo Yuan.

537
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:20,025
It seems that these historical records
are not to be trusted.

538
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:25,793
Instead of reading those records,
I might as well read Star Lord's stories.

539
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:30,644
<i>Everyone said that
Ye Hua resembles Master.</i>

540
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:33,981
<i>I almost mistook him for Master
as well when I first met him.</i>

541
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:40,123
<i>Yet no one could have known
they were related in such a way.</i>

542
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:44,943
Seventeenth.

543
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,117
I'd like to meet my twin brother.

544
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:51,371
How is he doing?

545
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,773
Master.

546
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:55,188
You just woke up.

547
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,592
You'll still need to
meditate for some time

548
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,998
to be restored to your original state.

549
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:03,887
Ye Hua is now in the Mortal Realm.

550
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:06,128
I can't locate him either.

551
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:08,603
Why don't we wait till
you're well recuperated

552
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:11,358
and I'll bring him here to you?

553
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:13,092
That's good.

554
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,663
I'll meditate in Kunlun Mountain
to await his return.

555
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,844
Are all your seniors doing well?

556
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:28,505
70,000 years ago after you passed away

557
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:32,811
your disciples searched for us
for several thousand years.

558
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:36,648
Then their families came
and took them home one by one.

559
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:39,119
They went to fulfill their dutiful roles.

560
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,000
Kunlun Mountain is no longer
what it used to be.

561
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,769
Moreover...

562
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:49,661
I don't wish Master to see
what Kunlun Mountain has become now.

563
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,759
It doesn't matter.

564
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:57,760
We'll set out toward Kunlun Mountain now.

565
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,996
Yes, Master.

566
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:07,820
What did you say?

567
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,244
Lord Dong Hua will meet
his destined calamity?

568
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,155
Feng Jiu, look on the bright side.

569
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:18,963
Irregardless of their capability
or ranks, all deities in the heavens

570
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:21,271
will have to meet
their destined calamity.

571
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:24,242
All have to enter
the realm of nothingness.

572
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:27,893
Look at how long Lord Dong Hua
has already been around.

573
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,414
It's time...

574
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,721
It's time that he meets
his destined calamity.

575
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,679
I don't believe it...

576
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,402
I don't believe it.

577
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:42,952
I'm going to ask him.

578
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:47,206
Lord Dong Hua!

579
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,047
Lord Dong Hua!

580
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,887
Lord Dong Hua!

581
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:53,784
Where are you, Lord Dong Hua?

582
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,737
Lord Dong Hua!

583
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:16,711
Lord Dong Hua...

584
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:23,907
Why are you crying?

585
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,380
If Your Lordship lives, Feng Jiu lives.

586
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,856
If you die, I'd never survive alone.

587
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:48,460
Feng Jiu.

588
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,364
Don't behave so.

589
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:52,954
I won't obey you.

590
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:57,965
Qing Qiu's princess comes up to
the Nine Heavens

591
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,965
and hugs me for no reason.
Aren't you embarrassed?

592
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:04,333
We have been married for years
in the Mortal Realm. Why would I mind?

593
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,295
That was to overcome the calamity.

594
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:08,199
How can you regard that with another?

595
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:16,670
Are you still brooding over what
happened between me and Yuan Zhen?

596
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,201
Star Lord made me do that.

597
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:23,204
I never had an affair with Yuan Zhen.

598
00:42:23,204 --> 00:42:24,333
I know.

599
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:29,782
Anyway, I won't leave you before
you meet your destined calamity.

600
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,869
Who told you that I'll meet
my destined calamity?

601
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:39,530
Are you not?

602
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
