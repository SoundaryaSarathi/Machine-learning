It's been years since then.

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,980

show...

128
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,210

T-The scriptwriter Yokotari
o-originally did Crusher.

130
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah, I think it's an adventure
framework, like Tarurun Family was.

131
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,520
T-They all get blown up.

132
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,030
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,400
It has good points so will it be a good
adventure or just go out on a limb?

134
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,510

141
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,410
I-It said "Muranaka" on
the original drawings.

142
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,460
It didn't really seem to fit.
Didn't he originally do action stuff?

143
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,150
N-No, lately he's been doing
p-promotional cels and whatnot.

144
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,820
He's generally involved
in Studio Pulp productions.

145
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,160
Maybe he gets used for
convenience, since he seems speedy.

146
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,130
Ah, that's probably true.

147
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,070

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,340

150
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,880

A c-cooking match in
the first episode, h-huh?

157
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,730
It's cool to show off,
but that's pushing it.

158
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,170
It could also be because
it's the first episode.

159
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,870
To present a world view and
developments to the viewer.

160
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,440
Doesn't that make it
too hard to understand?

161
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,480
At first glance, you can't tell if it's a
romantic comedy or an action show.

162
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,920
The director spends some time
making this fight the central point.

163
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,320
F-Fight?

164
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,520
K-Kujiun isn't about fighting.

165
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,060
But to introduce Renko and
Yamada, they had to have a fight.

166
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,190
What a dilemma...

167
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,360
Hello.

168
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,800

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,850

173
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,380

180
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,180
So? Will you join?

181
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,480
Hmm, I don't know.

182
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,380
What made you join?

183
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,740
Hmm.

184
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,910
Well, the easygoing
atmosphere seems to suit me.

185
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,700
Flower Girl Lunlun?

186
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,930
Yeah, I'm in the club office...

187
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,880
Okay, all right.

188
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,170
Sorry, my turn.

189
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,870
Saki needs to see me.

190
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,540
Oh, okay...

191
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,410
It's cool, just watch some Kujiun.

192
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,570
Oh right...

193
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,610
In a room like this, there's
bound to be some erotic stuff...

194
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,890
I've wanted to, but
I've never bought one...

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,130
This is a dojinshi!

196
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,100
Wow!

197
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,830
Wow!

198
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,470
Wow!

199
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,660
Wow!

200
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,160
We saw everything, you know.

201
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,780
W-What?

202
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,730
A figure's just not the real
thing if you can't see panties.

203
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,630
Or maybe you've only seen them
in model magazine photos?

204
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,860
Wha...

205
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,000
Take a look out the window.

206
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,700
Huh?

207
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,580
Higher up.

208
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,340
Hi, Mr. Chairman, good work.

209
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,180
You can come back.

210
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,690
Don't sweat it, this happens every year.

211
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,450
They get everyone.

212
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,390
T-They got me too last year.

213
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,960
They haven't gotten me.

214
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,990
So...

215
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,630
You're one of us!

216
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,290
Why not join?

217
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,740
Yo.

218
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,270
Gimme back Kohsaka.

219
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,770
Huh? Another one?

220
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,470
What's with him?

221
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,510
His baseless pride has crumbled.

222
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,350
A-Are you a member too?

223
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,020
Do I look it?

224
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Do I look like I'm one of them?

225
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,050
What?

226
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,480
That wasn't a hard question!

227
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,150
What?

228
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,190
<i>Suioh University</i>

229
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,360
Hi, Sasahara.

230
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,220
Can I sit here?

231
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,290
Sure, go ahead.

232
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,490
You aren't really
showing up at Genshiken.

233
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,470
Why not?

234
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,130
Um, well...

235
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,670
It's not like I actually joined...

236
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,210
Oh, I see.

237
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,270
Why's that?

238
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,040
It don't really think it suits me.

239
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,340
You think so?

240
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,070
You look like a perfect fit.

241
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,810
Well, maybe you're right then...

242
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,830
You don't really look that way.

243
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,150
Oh, really?

244
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,790
I mean, you've got a girlfriend.

245
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,520
Not now, I don't.

246
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,230
You don't?
But the other day...

247
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,990
Well, that doesn't mean we're going out.

248
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,900
But, we are together a lot.

249
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,010
Maybe Saki's interested in me.

250
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,340
What do you think?

251
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,110
I-I suppose you're otaku...

252
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,570
Otaku, and yet...

253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,580
That's right, they're otaku.

254
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,310
It's 30 minutes from Shinjuku,

255
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,480
but it doesn't feel like Tokyo with all
those mountains!

256
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,490
It's the middle of nowhere!

257
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,220
There's not a single fun thing to
do around there for a young couple.

258
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,890
That's hilarious!

259
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,060
Why do they spend so
much time playing games?

260
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,970
Want to come over today?
We'll go head to head.

261
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,390
What?

262
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,140
<i>Night Shift Academy</i>

263
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,020
Do you play adult games?

264
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,210
N-No thanks.

265
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,480
Oh, okay.

266
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,020
Then, fighting games?

267
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,960
S-Sure, okay.

268
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,760
Yeah!

269
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,330
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't think I can win.

270
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,060
Then, what to do?

271
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's call the club guys.

272
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,100
I think they're about
as good at this as you.

273
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,040
No, um...

274
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,710
Greetings, we're here.

275
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,680
Capcom Vs. SNK?

276
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,580
Forget that, let's play some COF.

277
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,450
I don't have the system.

278
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,720
Okay, that then.

279
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,450
Let's do league matches.
I'll make a chart.

280
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,890
What about regulations?
Can we switch characters?

281
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,960
I think we should be able to.

282
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,290
Cool.

283
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,830
K-Kohsaka, can I read some manga?

284
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,600
Go ahead.

285
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,140
Pick the box lunch you want.
We'll figure out the money later.

286
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,000
Kohsaka, I need some paper.

287
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,140
All right.

288
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,940
Just decide, already.

289
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,980
Become part of the group.

290
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,710
Come on, just say it.

291
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,940
Get to know me, include me, fulfill me!

292
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,990
Is seaweed okay?

293
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,250
S-Sure.

294
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,090
Then here.

295
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,120
Hello, Kohsaka speaking.

296
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,730
Hi, Saki.

297
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,070
So I went to Harajuku today,
and on the way home...

298
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,400
...I bought a bunch
of clothes and a cake.

299
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,840
Can I come over right now?

300
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,910
Go ahead.

301
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,700
Let's all hang out.

302
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,880
"AII?"

303
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,480
Right, the Genshiken guys are here.

304
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,920
Yeah, we're playing games.

305
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,480
You sure?

306
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,060
That's too bad.

307
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,430
Yeah.

308
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,150
Yeah.

309
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,060
Yeah.

310
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,500
Okay?

311
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,560
Don't worry, we're all leaving.

312
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,500
Huh?

313
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,070
You can come over, it's all right!

314
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,230
Okay...

315
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,440
Who is this, anyway?

316
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,980
Sasahara.

317
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,880
Anyway, come over,
we're leaving soon.

318
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,880
Are you sure?

319
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,710
Sasahara?

320
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,520
He must be the one I hit
on impulse the other day...

321
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,360
It'd be really messed up
if I owed him for this.

322
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,470
He's a weird guy.

323
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,470
Kohsaka?

324
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,300
Yeah.

325
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Hmm...

326
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,140
A bit.

327
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,570
You don't throw a mundane girlfriend
into the same room as us.

328
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,680
W-We're the ones who get shafted.

329
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,440
S-She doesn't seem to
be his girlfriend, yet.

330
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,740
What?

331
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,410
What's with him?

332
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,390
Isn't Kohsaka the only
one who thinks that?

333
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,220
I can't really say.

334
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,560
Um, I'm sorry I said we were leaving.

335
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,600
It's just as well.

336
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,290
It was the thing to do.

337
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,570
All right then, where should we go?

338
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,840
To do what?

339
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,670
Um...

340
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,670
Can I suggest something?

341
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,440
You can try, Sasahara.

342
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,540
Does anyone have any adult video
games?

343
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,050
I've never played one.

344
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,150
Very well, let's go to Kugayama's place.

345
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,590
W-Why my place?

346
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,490
Because it's the biggest.

347
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,800
What, again?

348
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,460
H-Hey, you mean no matter what?

349
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,940
Seize the day.

350
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,340
What I'm lacking is determination...

351
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,740
The determination to
live the way I want...

352
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:28,990
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

353
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:38,370
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

354
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:47,710
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

355
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:57,050
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

356
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:07,870
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

357
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:19,250
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

358
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:28,790
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

359
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:38,770
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

360
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:47,610
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

361
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,650
I'm going to try this on, then.
Keep your head turned.

362
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,620
Sure.

363
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,690
Don't look.

364
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,450
Sure.

365
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,420
I really mean it, don't.

366
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,430
Sure.

367
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,000
"Animation" comes
from the Latin "anima."

368
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,730
In other words, its word
root means "the soul."

369
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:18,310
"Animism" is the ideal from the
19th century anthropologist Tylor's...

370
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,310
..."Primitive Culture," which advocates
that souls reside in all things.

371
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,320
Animation is therefore what gives
movement to still pictures...

372
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,390
...and breathes life into them.

373
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,460
Namely, the power of the gods!

374
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,320
Some gods are evil, though.
