00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:19,174
<i>Genshiken</i>

2
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:23,784
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

3
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:29,814
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

4
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:34,624
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:39,494
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,324
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:45,834
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:52,844
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

9
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:59,214
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:04,484
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

11
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:09,714
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

12
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:14,994
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

13
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,764
<i>At this tempo!</i>

14
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,544
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

15
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:30,244
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

16
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,024
Shall we get going?

17
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,924
Is today a serious meeting?

18
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:42,824
So it seems.

19
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:44,824
Not the usual boring fare?

20
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,024
No.

21
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:49,534
Saki!

22
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:50,854
Does it still hurt?

23
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:52,874
There's a lump.

24
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:54,874
Clean your room up.

25
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:56,964
Sure, eventually.

26
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:04,844
<i>Episode 11, The Position of Malice
in the Phenomenon of Urban Crime</i>

27
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,824
Wow, this manga sure
is getting good again...

28
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,694
The cuteness and the hotness!

29
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:26,104
The clincher is that she's
Tokino's little sister.

30
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:30,344
She's flat-chested like Renko
while being a total villain.

31
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:33,574
Come to think of it, she's the first
little sister character in the story.

32
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:37,814
Koyuki's one too, but having a
crush on her's a little wrong.

33
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:40,914
We don't really want to
look at her that way, do we?

34
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:44,454
I-I wonder if the sister relationship
is going to s-stir things up.

35
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,094
I'm not sure Yuu Kuroki can manage it.

36
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,954
But I myself like things like that.

37
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:52,024
Until now we've seen glimpses
of the more severe aspects...

38
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,064
...of the president's childhood.

39
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,664
Oh, good point.

40
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:57,824
It's not as if he's
bad at muddled plots.

41
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:01,094
Yeah! Hurry and publish that manga!

42
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:01,964
Hey.

43
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,034
What were we here for today?

44
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,974
We need to talk about
the school festival.

45
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:15,024
Regarding materials for this year...
They're the same as last year's.

46
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,384
Adjourned.

47
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,424
Speedy!

48
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:18,854
Um, um...

49
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:21,114
I got permission for a photo shoot.

50
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:22,014
I won't do it.

51
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,624
This club truly has no motivation.

52
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:27,824
You really go for the throat, Saki.

53
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:30,404
So that's it?
What about the manga club?

54
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,464
Since you mention it...

55
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:37,404
...it seems the manga and anime clubs
are holding a joint large-scale event.

56
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,914
The towns around here are getting
together for some area revitalization...

57
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,644
...and it's called
Animefesta or something...

58
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,374
Towns? You mean local governments?

59
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:47,454
Yeah, yeah, it's like
they're linked to them.

60
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,644
Who would've thought?

61
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:53,654
Well, they've also invited guests
from anime studios for a symposium...

62
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,594
...and then they're
having a cosplay contest.

63
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:00,754
That means it's quite a serious event.

64
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,904
What about us?
Aren't we involved?

65
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,574
Not at all.
They didn't even ask us.

66
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:10,844
This club really is useless.

67
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,444
We might as well close
down Genshiken altogether.

68
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,854
Are you all right?

69
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,844
Thankfully it was empty.

70
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,844
It hit the same spot.

71
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,824
It hit the same spot!

72
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:31,124
Time for a major cleanup!

73
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,124
What brought that on?

74
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:35,034
I've decided, we're doing it!

75
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,534
I can't stand this anymore!

76
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,964
Come on, this meeting
was worthless anyway!

77
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:44,504
If we don't clean up,
I won't come anymore!

78
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:48,514
Well, I don't think that
would be such a bad thing...

79
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,134
Don't talk that way, stupid!

80
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:51,944
Everyone up, then.

81
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,984
We'll start with the magazines!

82
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,154
Did something happen?

83
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,624
She hit her head just as we left...

84
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,224
Why aren't we throwing those out?

85
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,524
We can't decide that for things
that've been here longer than us...

86
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:09,924
Then try asking the original chairman.

87
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:11,864
He doesn't come to meetings.

88
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:17,944
Let's at least get rid of things we have
plenty of or that we obviously don't need.

89
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,204
Uh, well...

90
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,274
That's tough to judge...

91
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,514
Very important.
Let's throw out the porn.

92
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,554
Especially those dojinshi and whatnot...

93
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,744
Well, some of those might
have a premium and be valuable.

94
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,624
Is that so...

95
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:35,784
Probably...

96
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:36,724
Then let's sell them.

97
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,884
She's evil.

98
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,194
Hey, why don't we also tear
down all the posters?

99
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:44,934
N-No, those have too much to
do with the group's identity.

100
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,974
But they're the most
unsightly things in here...

101
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,704
Right...

102
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,004
These look like old club mags.

103
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,274
<i>Mebaetame</i>

104
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:55,714
From when?

105
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,514
It says '87!

106
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,104
Wow, what a flashback!

107
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:01,884
That drawing is from
Silver Cyclone Zillios.

108
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:03,924
'87?

109
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:05,594
How long ago was that?

110
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:09,224
Then Genshiken's been
around since then...

111
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:13,964
The founding
president... r-right now he's...

112
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:14,964
Don't say it!

113
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,634
Let's pretend we didn't see them.

114
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:28,234
Well, the magazines are more
or less our personal property...

115
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,214
...so that leaves the toys.

116
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:33,084
All of the action
figures are in these...

117
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:36,314
They're mostly broken from being
tossed into cardboard boxes.

118
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,024
It doesn't feel like we've
made much progress, though...

119
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:42,324
The room's small to begin with.

120
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:43,924
Yeah, good point.

121
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,024
No need to throw it out right away.

122
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:47,964
Wrong.

123
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,624
This stuff needs to go ASAP!

124
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:52,964
She'll make an excellent mother
someday.

125
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,974
She throws out whatever she wants to.

126
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:58,564
And sh-she calls models
toys and b-breaks them.

127
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:26,294
Ahh, I want to burn it all.

128
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,044
What're you doing?

129
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,604
Nothing in particular.

130
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,134
What about you?

131
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,044
Well, you were just
staring at the old books.

132
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,814
Yeah, I was thinking
"So these are my enemies"...

133
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,184
And maybe I should burn them.

134
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:43,754
They're burning.

135
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:55,634
Watch out!

136
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:12,074
Put it out!

137
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,254
Holy crap!

138
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,844
They're burning! Burning up!
They're antiques!

139
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,284
Water! Water! Water!

140
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,414
Water!
Fire extinguisher!

141
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:24,834
I found water!

142
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,304
This water kind of stinks.

143
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:39,774
I'm sorry!

144
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,844
But why are you standing there?

145
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,384
Burning! Burning! Burning!

146
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:45,914
What the hell's this?

147
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,224
I'll go get Kitagawa!

148
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,354
And then tell the student council!

149
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,854
Fire extinguisher,
where's a fire extinguisher?

150
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,954
The fire! Action figures on fire!
Smoke! Nasty smoke!

151
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,724
Trip the fire alarm!

152
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,304
Hurry and broadcast an
emergency evacuation!

153
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,294
Yes, ma'am!

154
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,904
Emphasize that it's not
a drill or a mistake!

155
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,904
The evacuation route is the east stairwell!

156
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:07,134
<i>Yes, ma'am!
The evacuation route is the east stairwell!</i>

157
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,304
Kimura, get on the phone! Not a cell, use
the one in the council office.

158
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:12,304
Call the fire department
and the university office.

159
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,004
W-Which one first?

160
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:15,144
Fire department!

161
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:15,774
Yes, ma'am!

162
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,484
Shouldn't someone call an ambulance?

163
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,344
Was someone injured?

164
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,924
He means a fire engine.

165
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:23,754
Oh, right, right, fire engine.

166
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,914
Um, I need to be hosed down too.

167
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,494
Aren't you cold?

168
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:29,524
It's hot...

169
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:32,164
F-Fire extinguisher!
Where?

170
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,264
You guys clear the hell out of here too!

171
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:45,334
Let's see, I got called down to the
student council a while ago...

172
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,814
Sure enough, club activities are
suspended indefinitely as a penalty...

173
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,904
...we're banned from using the office...

174
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:53,784
...and in addition we're banned from
participating in the school festival.

175
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,014
F-Figures.

176
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:57,214
This was bad timing...

177
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:02,424
That's odd, we went out of
our way to apologize, too.

178
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,154
It feels like enough apologies
for a whole lifetime.

179
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,564
This isn't a problem you can
just say you're sorry for...

180
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:09,094
E-Excuse me...

181
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,764
W-What about the cosplay photo shoot?

182
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,004
It's toast too...

183
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,564
Hey I'm sorry, Ohno.

184
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,344
But you don't look too well anyway.

185
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:22,844
No need to push things.

186
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:27,174
It just so happens that I got this way
after you splashed me with that water...

187
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,484
Does that mean you can't cosplay, Ohno?

188
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,854
We can still enter
the cosplay contest...

189
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:37,294
Rather, I think they want us to.

190
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,494
Do you mean that?

191
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:41,564
It's been advertised, so
even the public can enter.

192
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:45,104
But they want to see as much
school participation as possible...

193
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,204
That's what I was told.

194
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:48,064
Yeah.

195
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:50,034
Thank goodness!

196
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:59,044
At this point, I'll
have Saki go instead.

197
00:10:59,114 --> 00:10:59,914
No!

198
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:01,514
That might work.

199
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:05,054
I didn't want to say it, but all
this happened because of Kasukabe...

200
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,054
What?

201
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:10,994
I don't want to say it
either, but I agree...

202
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:13,224
Oh, but wait, a costume!

203
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,194
I don't have a costume.

204
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:16,624
No problem!

205
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:20,234
Given a week, I can make anything.

206
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:22,904
Actually, I already have one for you.

207
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,044
For what reason?

208
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,274
So that if you changed your
mind you could wear it anytime.

209
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,544
What about my sizes?

210
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,484
I saw you at the beach.

211
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,144
It's slightly off, but...

212
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:41,314
Oh yeah!

213
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,294
Tanaka is to be feared...

214
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:45,924
Here I thought you only looked at Ohno.

215
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,394
Hah, what say you?

216
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:50,234
But one week really
is too short a time...

217
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,264
If she were to cosplay,
I had planned to...

218
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,894
...diligently train her on the
charm of her chosen character...

219
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,434
I really wanted three weeks for
her to get into it perfectly.

220
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:03,144
With only a week, she'll have to pour
over materials night and day.

221
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,644
And I'm sick, to top it off.

222
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:09,384
But, I might never have a second
chance for Saki to cosplay...

223
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,684
D-Don't get carried away, Ohno!

224
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,554
I still haven't said I'd do it.

225
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:19,294
No, but cosplaying while not
understanding the character is...

226
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,594
...straying from the path, heresy.

227
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:27,434
It's not how things should be, but...

228
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,534
You know what, forget it!

229
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,304
Go on, do it!

230
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,644
Think of it as a penalty game.

231
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,974
Kohsaka says he wants to see it too.

232
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:36,944
I do!

233
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:39,284
That won't change my mind!

234
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,324
You know what, Kasukabe.

235
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,954
I really don't want to say this, but...

236
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,154
...our activities are suspended and we
can't be part of the school festival.

237
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:52,924
No matter how half-assed a circle
we may be, this really stings.

238
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,294
You should take responsibility!

239
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,194
Now that's how a chairman talks...

240
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,244
Do I have to no matter what?

241
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:19,054
Here comes the crying act!

242
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,724
I know I'm at fault for this...

243
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,424
But cosplay has nothing to do with it...

244
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:27,094
So I still have to
do this no matter...

245
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,394
Yes, you do!

246
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,194
<i>Suioh University</i>

247
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,004
Where's Saki?

248
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,444
She hasn't answered her
cell since yesterday...

249
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:37,564
Say what?

250
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:38,614
So she ran...

251
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,004
What?

252
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,614
Don't worry, steps
have already been taken.

253
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:43,304
Huh?

254
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,744
<i>Kichijoji Station</i>

255
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,744
<i>Shichimei Kan</i>

256
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:56,684
Welcome!

257
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,464
H-How'd you know I was...

258
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:01,994
Intuition.

259
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,464
N-No time like the present...

260
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:12,164
Okay, all you guys please leave.

261
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:15,604
It's time for Saki to get changed!

262
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:17,144
Gotcha!

263
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,544
Kohsaka...

264
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:19,744
Do your best.

265
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:22,414
They let us in the club room
just for this, after all...

266
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,084
Bye.

267
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:27,794
It's in your hands, Ohno.

268
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:29,154
Roger!

269
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:32,664
You guys are not allowed
to take any pictures!

270
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:34,234
Oh really?

271
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:36,454
I think there'll be plenty
of other cameras there though.

272
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,434
Whatever, just not you guys!

273
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:41,194
When I say that I mean it! Got me?

274
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:47,104
Did you take a look at the
manga and videos you borrowed?

275
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:50,304
Of course not, I had no
intention of being here.

276
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:54,044
Hmm, a person like you shouldn't
be doing this in the first place...

277
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,314
Then let's forget it!

278
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:56,644
Take your clothes off, please!

279
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,314
She's looking pretty healthy, dammit.

280
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,384
What is that?

281
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,184
A handy portable dressing room, my
own.

282
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,634
I closed the curtains.

283
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,234
Well, better safe than sorry.

284
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:13,324
Am I seriously doing this?

285
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,234
So, how much do I take off?

286
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,504
Does your bra have shoulder straps?

287
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:18,594
Yeah, the usual kind...

288
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,074
Then please take it off.
It would be visible.

289
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,074
For real?

290
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:25,274
It's okay, I guarantee your safety.

291
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,314
I'll bet.

292
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,714
You can keep your bottom on.

293
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,154
Have you finished?

294
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,694
Well, more or less.

295
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,524
Then I'm coming in to put it on you.

296
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:36,654
All right.

297
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,894
Oh come on, you still
haven't taken it off.

298
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,794
Lay off, I'm doing it now!

299
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,824
You're so gorgeous, Saki...

300
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:44,804
What?

301
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:47,204
Do you even think like an old man?

302
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:47,904
I'm sorry, it's just my honest opinion.

303
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:50,344
<i>So it's really going to be Kasukabe.
I'm sorry, it's just my honest opinion.</i>

304
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:51,814
<i>That's right, we're shocked too.</i>

305
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:52,544
<i>That's right, we're shocked too.
Hey, I'm counting on you.</i>

306
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,634
Hey, I'm counting on you.

307
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,644
I don't want you forgetting some critical
piece and the whole thing falling off.

308
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:58,754
Aren't there gonna be
lots of guys with cameras?

309
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:02,444
Don't worry, when it comes to
cosplay I don't make mistakes.

310
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:03,644
I sure hope not.

311
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,324
Okay, first, please
put these pantyhose on.

312
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,294
Yeah.

313
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:13,254
It's too bad we can't see Ohno,
but this should be priceless...

314
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:16,864
Yeah, it's just my opinion, but
we probably won't see this again.

315
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:24,304
But you know, it's like more than half
of this excitement is due to worry...

316
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,574
Yeah, it does feel that way...

317
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:32,144
Saki, you look mahvelous...

318
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:37,174
Uh, yeah well I've been
sweating badly for a while now...

319
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:39,594
Can you move?
It's not too heavy?

320
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:41,354
Try turning around once.

321
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:42,684
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:45,864
Aieee! That's so cute...

323
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,724
I don't get this, I mean, please.

324
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:49,954
No.

325
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:53,434
You must be careful about saying and
doing things that cast a pall on the room.

326
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,894
In your case, please take
a "I don't know her well..."

327
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,304
"...but I thought I'd try her
since she's cute." stance!

328
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:02,734
Right, right, I'll just
act like a fool at this point.

329
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:04,444
You mustn’t be a fool!

330
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,344
All right...

331
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:08,674
And so, our special guest is the
former director of Kujibiki Unbalance...

332
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:10,614
...Tsutomu Mizudori!

333
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,554
Don't say "former!"

334
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,624
So, that lining is really pretty.

335
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:18,284
You sure get right down
to details, Mr. Director.

336
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,824
How 'bout you get out of the way?

337
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,794
Um, you can only buy cloth
for real school uniforms...

338
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:26,464
...straight from the manufacturer, so
it requires lots of careful planning.

339
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:27,804
There you have it, Mr. Director.

340
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:30,904
In the first place, this
color must be tough to find.

341
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,574
Because it's a bright blue...

342
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,584
We really argued over
this in the planning...

343
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,744
...whether to drop it
another shade or not...

344
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,474
Ahh, you don't say.

345
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:42,924
So, a lot happened and partway
through, you got dropped.

346
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:45,884
I'm the one and only Mizudori, you!

347
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,854
Yeah, I guess I succumbed to politics...

348
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,394
I should've asked where we were in line.

349
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:54,504
Yeah, I'm all nervous about
when she'll be coming out.

350
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,834
Oh crap, Kitagawa's here.

351
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:03,934
I-I wonder if she's on the lookout...

352
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,974
I hope nothing happens.

353
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,514
...so unfortunately we weren't able to
get Director Yamabata to come today...

354
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:11,704
That's because he's such a hard worker.

355
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:14,654
I'm sorry for the tangent there.

356
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,414
This was our second
Vice-President of the day.

357
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,024
Let's have a big round of applause...

358
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:23,484
I can't take this anymore.

359
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,424
Entry no. 9.

360
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:29,864
She represents our own school's Society
for the Study of Modern Visual Culture!

361
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:37,934
T-There she is!

362
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:43,344
This is our third Ritsuko
Kubel Kettenkrad of the day!

363
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,984
Ugh, they're taking pictures...

364
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,894
Did you make this costume yourself?

365
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,664
No, a friend made it for me.

366
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:05,964
Who is that friend?

367
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,894
Um, an upperclassman in my club.

368
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,064
It's an amazing arrangement.

369
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,574
It's a combat uniform for the President
based on the Vice-President's.

370
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:17,804
Then, does that mean this
is an original design?

371
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:18,744
That's right.

372
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:21,314
Ugh, they're here too.

373
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:22,784
Oh, Kohsaka.

374
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:23,984
Are you happy?

375
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:25,984
You're too far away to tell...

376
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,024
Why're you here?

377
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,924
And are you laughing?

378
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:33,824
Ohh, let this end soon...

379
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:36,524
Okay, thank you very much!

380
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:46,734
Our next person is Maori Haru.

381
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:04,484
What are you filming?

382
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,554
F-Filming...

383
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:15,804
Spy camera!

384
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,674
Who is in charge here?

385
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,444
That's me...

386
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:30,374
The executive committee will deal
with this person, so please continue.

387
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:36,724
Bring him along!

388
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,134
Miss President...

389
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:58,584
Miss President.
It's the president.

390
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,484
Miss President.

391
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:03,014
Miss President.

392
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:03,884
Miss President!

393
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:10,114
Miss President!

394
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:12,854
S-Say what?
Miss President?

395
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:15,524
Congratulations, Saki!

396
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:17,034
O-Ohno?

397
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:18,794
That was just amazing!

398
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:23,204
I'm not all that thrilled
at praise from people like them.

399
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,704
The most important thing is to
have fun wearing it yourself.

400
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,464
Did you have fun?

401
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:32,644
In terms of just clothes, I can't
say it felt fun to wear this.

402
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,484
But maybe, on the contrary...

403
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:41,454
...the real idea is the fun
of becoming a manga character.

404
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,254
Right, right!
You were totally the president.

405
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,734
If you say so, I must have missed it.

406
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,794
Too bad.

407
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,464
Yeah...

408
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:55,834
I might as well at least find out
what the character I did is like.

409
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:58,804
Guess I'll read those manga I borrowed.

410
00:21:58,914 --> 00:21:59,674
By all means!

411
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:00,244
<i>Um, Miss Kasukabe?
By all means!</i>

412
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:02,184
<i>Um, Miss Kasukabe?</i>

413
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:05,914
I'm with the student council,
Could you come to our office?

414
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:09,984
The police are here about what happened
and they'd like to question you...

415
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,884
Okay, I'll get changed and come over.

416
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:16,484
Well, they want you to come
right away, as you are.

417
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:17,184
Huh?

418
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,564
Hey, hold up.
Is this necessary?

419
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:21,254
Did Kitagawa set this up?

420
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:23,194
It's harassment, I swear it!

421
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:24,934
Saki!

422
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:30,504
In the end, she underwent
police questioning in costume.

423
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:33,934
Also, the policeman displayed
quite an interest in said costume.

424
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:37,514
In fact he asked more questions about it
than the crime itself...

425
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:39,984
Never...

426
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:42,684
I'll never cosplay again!

427
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:59,134
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

428
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:08,604
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

429
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:17,874
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

430
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:27,624
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

431
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:38,004
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

432
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:49,354
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

433
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:58,954
<i>The time we spied from there sparkled,
even if nothing big happened.</i>

434
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:08,934
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

435
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:17,814
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

436
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,684
I don't see what the big deal is.

437
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:29,254
After all, I did a good deed for
you guys, so about those penalties...

438
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,054
That's apples and oranges.

439
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:33,894
One must be punished
for one's wrongdoing.

440
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,324
Anyway, the police want to commend
you, but only if you go in costume.

441
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,834
Then I won't go!

442
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:42,764
Being discontinued
really sucks, doesn't it?

443
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:43,934
What're you saying?

444
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:47,244
Did you see Gundam?
Layzner? Yamato? Triton?

445
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,404
Well, yes, I saw them...

446
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:50,074
You hear talk about business
proposals with the hopes of...

447
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,914
...long term broadcasting
periods of one, two years...

448
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,344
...then ratings or toy sales go into
a slump and the dream is shattered...

449
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:56,884
...and the original story,
not to mention episode count...

450
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,214
...gets condensed and it ends abruptly.

451
00:24:58,294 --> 00:24:59,054
However!

452
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,324
Series that were discontinued yet
called masterpieces are not few.

453
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:04,264
No! Rather the fact they're discontinued
is proof they're masterpieces!

454
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:06,054
Huzzah for discontinuation!

455
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,124
Huzzah!

456
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:07,994
Huzzah!

457
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:08,934
Huzzah!

458
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,024
Huzzah!
