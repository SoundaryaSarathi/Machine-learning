1
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:08,265
I’m so sorry.

2
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,727
I set my alarm to a wrong time…

3
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:15,606
G’morning.

4
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:18,067
G’morning, Father.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,404
G’morning, Touya, Sakura…

6
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,212
Oh? I thought today’s breakfast is my…

7
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,617
We just ate. This is yours.

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,762
It’s ready. Eat.

9
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,065
Thank you.

10
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,668
You didn’t sleep much
last night, did you?

11
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:48,563
From today on, let us do the housework.

12
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:50,800
The academic meeting
is next week, right?

13
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,380
Thank you. And thanks for the food.

14
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:05,114
[Sakura and Her Kind Father]

15
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:07,355
Here’s your lunch.

16
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,752
Oh? Lunch? This…

17
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,823
Somehow I felt confident today.

18
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:14,224
Thank you.

19
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,928
I won’t be as busy next week.

20
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,029
Don’t worry about it.

21
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,169
Isn’t it about time already?

22
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,599
Oh?! Then, I gotta go.

23
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:24,909
Take care.

24
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:28,172
I made lunch and did the dishes.

25
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,346
A perfect score today.

26
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,010
Oh? You’re leaving already?

27
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,014
Morning practice.

28
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:34,877
I’m meeting up with Yuki.

29
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:36,847
Wa… Wait! I’m going too!

30
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,100
Father, Keep it up at work!

31
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:54,268
Okay!

32
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,039
The total comes to 700 yen.

33
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,503
Can I have a bag for this?

34
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,408
Oh, you two are doing the housework?

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,045
Yeah. Father said he’ll be reading

36
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,947
A very important paper
at this academic meeting.

37
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,886
That’s why Touya and
I discussed and decided to do that.

38
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:17,523
We would do all the housework

39
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:21,161
so Father can concentrate on
work just this week.

40
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,358
When is the research announcement?

41
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,699
Next Monday. That’s why it seems
that now is the busiest time.

42
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,438
That is very nice of you two.
Teamwork from you and your brother.

43
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,738
It’s not that big of a deal.

44
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:37,539
Oh, how about this book?

45
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,417
Then I will take this too…

46
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:45,451
With this many, I think I will do fine.
Thank you very much.

47
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:48,486
But what are you doing with
all these books about flowers?

48
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,930
Recently, I have come
to a bit of deadlock…

49
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,993
I was thinking of
doing some research for a new motif.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,492
Mo… Motif?

51
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,698
Of course!
This is for your costume design!

52
00:02:59,138 --> 00:02:59,763
Eh!

53
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,300
Because you made all
the effort to wear them for me…

54
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,008
I must always put in
new thoughts and ideas.

55
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,772
Tomoyo…

56
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:11,941
Thank you very much.

57
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:16,114
Excuse me, I came to
pick up a pre-ordered book…

58
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,219
May I have your name please?

59
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,116
Kinomoto.

60
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:22,860
Yukito!

61
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,963
Touya asked you to get
it for him, didn’t he?

62
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,603
Yeah. His club practice
has gotten a little long.

63
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,535
It looks like your
father needs this book

64
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:35,805
in a hurry…

65
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,108
Oh, then it’s a
book Father pre-ordered.

66
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,006
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:44,415
Not at all. I heard from Touya that

68
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,418
you worked very hard for your father.

69
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,015
It wasn’t anything at all…

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,288
Here it is.

71
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:56,027
Thanks.

72
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,491
I’m sure everything will go well.

73
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,928
Because you put in all
these efforts to help.

74
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:05,996
See you later.

75
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,372
Yukito…

76
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:24,584
Father is working
late tonight too…

77
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,353
Sakura…

78
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,000
Did you fold the laundry?

79
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,231
Yeah, I finished
it a while ago.

80
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,037
Okay. Then, I’ve one
more thing for you.

81
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:43,967
What is it?

82
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,340
Can you bring Father
his midnight snack?

83
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,814
Okay!

84
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:54,420
Father’s still working,
so don’t stay in there for too long.

85
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,750
Also, it’s getting late,
so go to sleep!

86
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:01,686
I came to bring you midnight snack.

87
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:05,055
Maybe I’ll eat it now.
It’s good to take a little break.

88
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,067
It’s good.

89
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:15,601
Are you almost done?

90
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,744
I’m just about done gathering data,

91
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:21,736
but putting them
together will take a while.

92
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:23,807
I’ll be fine.

93
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,342
I’ll just have to stay at the university
for two to three days,

94
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,753
and I can probably
finish it at home on Saturday.

95
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,452
I give you and
Touya so much trouble,

96
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,155
next week after
the announcement is over…

97
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,353
Don’t worry about things like that.
Just concentrate on work.

98
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:38,654
Thanks.

99
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,125
So, what kind of people

100
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,697
are you presenting this to?

101
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,570
Are there going to be
lots of famous people?

102
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,367
How should I put it…

103
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:52,675
Those people attending
aren’t any famous people in particular.

104
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:54,008
Yes!

105
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:55,878
We live in a big world,

106
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,783
and it has been a long time
since human beings were born.

107
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:02,415
But what we know is
actually very little.

108
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:05,322
Living in different countries,
speaking different languages,

109
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,783
those people who lived
in different times

110
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,786
We hardly know anything about them.

111
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,059
That’s why this is what
I do for work.

112
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,566
Things about the ancient times,
about the ancient countries.

113
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,162
I want to learn about them,
research on them.

114
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:23,207
And then, I announce my result, because
I want to tell someone about them.

115
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,142
Rather than keeping something
you enjoy to yourself,

116
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,206
it’s more fun to let
everyone know about it, right?

117
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,306
Yeah!

118
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:32,815
Thanks for the midnight snack.

119
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,614
One more day of hard work
and it should be done.

120
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,388
Now, you need to get up
early tomorrow too, right?

121
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:39,955
Yeah. Good night.

122
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:42,051
G’night.

123
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,457
Goin’ to your father’s school?

124
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,158
Why don’t you come along too?

125
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:51,133
I don’t need to study.
I’m already so smart.

126
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,064
No, I’m thinking of bringing
him some snacks.

127
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:57,042
He’s staying there overnight and
probably even has a change of clothes.

128
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,541
Oh, maybe I’ll ask Tomoyo
to come with me too.

129
00:06:58,978 --> 00:06:59,842
Tomoyo too?

130
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh, she’s gonna bring cookies, right?

131
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,850
All you care is the food.

132
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:06,479
Okay, it’s decided!

133
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,853
Let’s go to the university on Saturday!

134
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,889
But I’m glad for you, Sakura.

135
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:11,915
Eh!

136
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:16,386
The entrance exams to the
university must be real hard, right?

137
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:19,492
You can get in without takin’ the exam,
aren’t you lucky or what?

138
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,059
What do you mean by that…

139
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,468
Universities are really big.

140
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,837
I wonder where your father is.

141
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:39,083
Um… The department of history
in the faculty of literature…

142
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,043
Let us ask someone.

143
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,190
Thanks very much for coming with me.

144
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:51,492
Not at all. I am happy to be
able to come with you.

145
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,631
Oh, that’s right. Thanks to the
books I bought yesterday,

146
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,602
I had a nice idea for your new costume.

147
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,494
It is very cute.

148
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:01,735
Do you need some help?

149
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,243
Um… I would like to get to
the faculty of literature…

150
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:07,510
Faculty of literature?

151
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,446
Yes.

152
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,779
Who do you need to see
from the faculty of literature?

153
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,844
Kinomoto from the department of history.

154
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:14,644
Oh? Professor Kinomoto?

155
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,256
Do you know my father?

156
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,517
Oh, you are Professor
Kinomoto’s daughter?

157
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,928
Yes, I’m Sakura Kinomoto.

158
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:24,528
You’re cute.

159
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,032
Hey, Sakura,

160
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,858
do you want to see your
father’s lecture?

161
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:31,996
Is that really okay?

162
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,331
Look, over here.

163
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,440
In this way, the ancient,

164
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:47,884
which spreaded agriculture

165
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,951
that originated from
Mesopotamia to Europe,

166
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,391
has a very important implication.

167
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,781
The widespread
knowledge of how to grow

168
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,357
wheat, barley,
and soya bean,

169
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,856
and even things
like pottery and ceramics…

170
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:02,358
…could be seen distinctively…

171
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:04,536
Your father is wonderful.

172
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,736
Professor Kinomoto’s
lectures are popular.

173
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,742
He made them really interesting.

174
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,277
When I first came
to this university,

175
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,748
I never thought history
is this interesting.

176
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,915
We are

177
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,718
Professor Kinomoto’s assistants.

178
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,452
We help him with various
research projects.

179
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,285
I see.

180
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:30,088
Um… Thanks for helping Father
out all this time.

181
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,487
Not at all.
We thank him for helping us too.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Lecture is almost over.
Now, let’s go.

183
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:54,077
Come in!

184
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,879
Professor Kinomoto,
your daughter is here.

185
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,288
Sakura?

186
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,488
Sorry for bothering you.

187
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:02,825
Hello.

188
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,462
Oh my God. Why do you come…?

189
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:06,991
We brought snacks.

190
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,969
Thanks for taking the trouble,
Sakura, Tomoyo.

191
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,601
I’m in here too!

192
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,877
Professor, we’ll be in the
data research room.

193
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:23,440
Data research room?

194
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:26,116
As you see,

195
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:27,778
just myself and these books are
already taking lots of space here.

196
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,414
The three of them use the data
research room next door.

197
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,425
They’re all staying behind
to help out with this.

198
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:37,319
It sounds like very tough work.

199
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,554
Not really, we’ll be fine.

200
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,463
Thanks to them,

201
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,768
things are wrapping up here.

202
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:46,233
Sakura, you guys also helped a lot.

203
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,898
I didn’t really do anything at all.
But I’m glad.

204
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,911
You work so hard all this time,
I was thinking what if you
can’t make it in time.

205
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:55,908
Sakura…

206
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,344
Father…

207
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:01,850
Father…

208
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,649
Maybe he is tired…

209
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:11,922
I’m sorry. I didn’t have much sleep,
that’s why…

210
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:18,836
Father is sleepy.

211
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,469
It’s probably because
of the all-nighters.

212
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,342
But Kero seemed to be asleep all along.

213
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:25,607
What are you talkin’ about?!

214
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,707
I was desperately hidin’!
I didn’t fall asleep!

215
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:33,451
Then what’s that mark of the basket
on your cheek?

216
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:42,987
But I wonder if there is
anything else I can help with.

217
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:44,284
Right.

218
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:46,895
How about bringing them coffee

219
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,631
to help them stay awake?

220
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,031
That’s a good idea!

221
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:54,033
Thank you very much!

222
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:04,214
It looks like Father isn’t in here.

223
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,641
It does not seem so.

224
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:09,910
Come in!

225
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:13,191
Oh, it’s Professor Kinomoto’s daughter.

226
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:15,992
Excuse me, Father wasn’t there.

227
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,087
He left the room just for a little bit

228
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,897
to talk to another professor.

229
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:25,494
I see. Oh, I brought coffee
for everyone. Please help yourself.

230
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,599
Thanks.

231
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,375
They fell asleep?

232
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,214
They are all tired.

233
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,879
I wonder why. Just a second ago,
they were…

234
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,047
Kero, this is…

235
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:45,981
It’s a Clow Card!

236
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,254
I’m sure it’s in this room!

237
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:52,596
There it is!

238
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:53,828
That’s Sleep!

239
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,594
If its powder falls on you,

240
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,833
you’d feel sleepy!

241
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,364
Then just now, when Father
was feeling sleepy…

242
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,768
There’s no mistake.

243
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,469
Sleep doesn’t care

244
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,309
and would make anyone fall asleep.

245
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:06,301
No way!

246
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:07,836
If I don’t seal it quickly,

247
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,272
Father will never finish his work!

248
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:21,721
Key which hides the forces of darkness,

249
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,252
reveal thy true form before me!

250
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,732
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

251
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:33,065
Release!

252
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:48,815
Eh!

253
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:49,744
What’s wrong?!

254
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,722
I did not bring Sakura’s
new costume with me.

255
00:13:58,364 --> 00:13:59,023
Watch out!

256
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,329
Tomoyo!

257
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,201
Jump !

258
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:13,004
Return to thy form which thou should be!

259
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:14,636
It went outside!

260
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,651
Everyone is asleep!

261
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:30,921
Crap!

262
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:32,894
Where is it?!

263
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,022
Over there!

264
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:45,940
Windy !

265
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,254
Return to thy form which thou should be!

266
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:05,125
Clow Card!

267
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,121
That hurts.

268
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:03,778
Did you seal Sleep?

269
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:07,982
It was a success, wasn’t it?

270
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,322
What’s wrong?

271
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,056
Father’s work…

272
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,062
Crap…

273
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:19,159
Maybe there’s a card I can use
to restore this back to the original…

274
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,428
Sakura…

275
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:25,566
I tried every single card!

276
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:28,736
But none of them worked…

277
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:33,917
It would’ve been nice if the cards could
solve any problem.

278
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,218
There are things even cards
and magics wouldn’t work.

279
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,986
Father…

280
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:44,821
Oh? Sakura?

281
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,166
What’s wrong?

282
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,301
I thought that you were sleepy,

283
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:59,471
so I brought you some coffee…

284
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:00,810
I’m sorry…

285
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:08,609
I’m sorry… for messing up your work…

286
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,123
There’s nothing you can do
if something is ruined.

287
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:24,497
Come on. Smile.

288
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,971
I wonder where is that coffee
you brought in for me.

289
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,102
Father…

290
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,748
Let’s go home together after
I’m done with the coffee.

291
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,551
Sakura, how long are you
gonna stay awake?

292
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,931
Your father has already forgiven you,
you know?

293
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,298
But…

294
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,469
Things about the ancient times,

295
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,498
about the ancient countries.

296
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,932
I want to learn about them,
research on them.

297
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,776
Father…

298
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,106
G’morning.

299
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,576
That’s early for you on a Sunday.

300
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:17,520
Where is Father?

301
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,159
He’s awake but he said he was
gonna tidy up his room.

302
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:22,725
Is it?

303
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,629
Touya?

304
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,134
You won’t have energy if you don’t eat.

305
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:32,795
Yes!

306
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,803
It hurts.

307
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,009
It’s hard to tidy up

308
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,711
since I have so many
things scattered around.

309
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,849
It’s okay.
Just leave them where they are.

310
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,494
Father… I’m really sorry!

311
00:18:59,031 --> 00:18:59,929
Sakura.

312
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,259
If there’s anything I can do,
just tell me.

313
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,033
If it’s something I can do,

314
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,134
I’ll do it.

315
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:08,939
Please!

316
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:14,039
Sakura.

317
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,671
I thought about it last night,

318
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:20,582
but the paper for the
announcement is almost done.

319
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,011
But I ruined it…

320
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:27,458
I still have the contents of
the paper… in here.

321
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,660
If I work on it all day today,

322
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,653
I might be able to finish it on time.

323
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:35,097
But I need the help of a
capable assistant.

324
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,667
I’ll help you!

325
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:41,001
Then you’ll be my assistant for one day.

326
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,104
Let’s work hard together.

327
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,135
I’ll work hard.
I’ll do my very best for it!

328
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,211
Then, what should I do?
Tell me. Tell me.

329
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:21,938
You finished it.

330
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,154
Father…

331
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,085
Then I’ll be going!

332
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:38,721
Take care.

333
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,059
I wonder if Father
hasn’t gotten any sleep.

334
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,099
He was more afraid

335
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:45,927
of being tempted to fall
asleep like you did.

336
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:47,332
You’re mean!

337
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:49,963
Oh? You’re leaving already?

338
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:53,467
Morning practice.
I’m meeting up with Yuki.

339
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:55,639
Wait! I’m going with you!

340
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,514
He had a little bit of spare time.

341
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,479
If he had time for this,
he should’ve just rest for a little.

342
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,198
(Thank you, Sakura. Work hard!)

343
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:15,997
Father…

344
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,004
Hey! Wait for me!
