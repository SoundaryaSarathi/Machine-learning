00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,548
Damn you...

2
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,597
This is for Yamucha!

3
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,971
Why, you-!

4
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,242
I- incredible!

5
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:14,196
You dirty brat!

6
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,030
I don't even have
to dodge this one!

7
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,408
W- what!?

8
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,412
H- he defused it
with just a <i>kiai</i> shout!?

9
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,903
D- d- dammit!

10
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:07,083
This is for Tenshinhan!

11
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:13,692
How!? How does Kakarrot
have this much power!?

12
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:17,028
What!?

13
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,690
And this is for Piccolo!

14
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,191
Dammit!

15
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:50,395
Awesome! You really
are awesome, Goku!

16
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,555
Yeah!

17
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,414
Dammit!

18
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:13,510
Dammit!

19
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:19,016
Dammit!

20
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:24,362
I see... Impressive, you really
are extremely tough, huh?

21
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:27,365
I am an elite warrior
from a distinguished family!

22
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:31,369
I'm not about to be looked down upon
by a lower-class warrior like you!

23
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:34,539
You'll pay for this!
I'll kill you!

24
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,209
You miserable fool!
Cool that head of yours!

25
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,211
If you'll compose yourself
and think about it,

26
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,381
you'll find he's not the kind of opponent
that you can't take, Nappa!

27
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,212
Calm down!

28
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,231
You're right!

29
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,893
Thanks to you, my eyes
have been opened.

30
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:10,675
<i>That simple-celled fool! At this rate,</i>
<i>it looks like I will have to step in.</i>

31
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:17,015
It's true, I was pretty upset. Now it's time
to show you what I'm really made of.

32
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:20,185
Are you ready for this, Kakarrot!?

33
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:24,355
That's more like it.
I can't wait!

34
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,691
Talk tough, will you?

35
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:32,323
<i>He's not just talking tough. He's got</i>
<i>assurance and absolute confidence in himself.</i>

36
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,050
G- Goku...

37
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,041
Father...

38
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,001
Son-<i>kun</i>, pound that guy
into a pulpy mass!

39
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,559
H- hey!

40
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:21,679
Hey! Don't be so rough with this!

41
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:25,016
Who cares if a crystal ball
or two gets broken!?

42
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:28,019
It's an important tool of my trade!

43
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,357
With Kami-<i>sama</i> dead, and us not knowing
whether the earth will be destroyed or not,

44
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:34,692
you can just stuff your trade!

45
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,194
How dare you say that!

46
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,530
Now see here!

47
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,866
Would you two quit it!?

48
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,535
It doesn't matter, does it?

49
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:48,540
Yeah! While you two are at it there,
Goku could be getting done in.

50
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,544
Rubbish! Son-<i>kun</i> is
obviously doing all right!

51
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:57,215
You think he's going to lose
to those guys!? No way! No way!

52
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:59,217
Don't hit my crystal ball!

53
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:03,821
Hey, shut up, already!
Give that here!

54
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,949
A little brother does not take
his older sister's things!

55
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,206
I see you!

56
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:26,292
Whoo! This is a lot
better, ain't it?

57
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,408
This is a lot better, huh?

58
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,512
I'm going to put a stop to that
irritatingly smart mouth of yours!

59
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:36,707
You're finished now!

60
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,934
What kind of guy is this!?
He countered at that close range!

61
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:21,826
That would have been trouble
if I'd taken that one head-on.

62
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:28,833
I- impossible! That was- that was my greatest
technique, and you brushed it aside!

63
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,335
You really are one tough bastard.

64
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:34,172
You should have taken at least
a little damage from my <i>Kamehame-ha</i>.

65
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:39,844
--We ain't getting anywhere like this.
--Enough! Get down here, Nappa!

66
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:43,514
You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him for you.

67
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,850
What!?

68
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,119
You're pathetic!

69
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:53,524
To think that I would have to trouble myself
to take action against Kakarrot there.

70
00:08:53,524 --> 00:09:00,531
He's finally coming forward, huh?
Even that big guy is scared of him.

71
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,590
Father...

72
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,915
D- dammit...

73
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:55,253
T- to think that I should have to
yield your execution to Vegeta...

74
00:09:55,253 --> 00:10:02,527
But brace yourself! Your life will only
last for a moment against Vegeta!

75
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:08,199
He is a warrior gifted enough to take upon him
the name of Planet Vegeta, after all.

76
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,537
Since he ordered me to,
I'll leave you to Vegeta.

77
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,700
But I won't be content
to withdraw like this.

78
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:27,548
Oh, no! He's going
after those two!

79
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,626
It's no use!
I won't make it in time!

80
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,574
<i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

81
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,734
What!?

82
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,867
What just happened?

83
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,358
Goku! How did you-?

84
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:36,053
I doubt he'll be able
to fight anymore.

85
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:39,716
Take him, and disappear
from the face of the earth right now!

86
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>What was that just now!? For an instant,</i>
<i>his speed and power suddenly increased!</i>

87
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:54,572
G- Goku, how did you do that?

88
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:58,576
Was that a technique you
learned from that Kaio person?

89
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:01,909
Yeah. It's called <i>Kaio-ken</i>.

90
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,875
By controlling all of the energy within
your body, you can momentarily amplify it.

91
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,357
If you do it right,
your speed, power,

92
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,054
destructive and defensive forces
all increase many times over.

93
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,002
T- that's awesome!

94
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,704
Even after getting
that much stronger,

95
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,195
you can become many times
stronger than <i>that</i>!?

96
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,534
Yeah.

97
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,881
What are those guys talking about?

98
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:41,218
Goku, that was mean of you!
This is no time to be playing around.

99
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:46,557
If you have something like that up your
sleeve, then use it right at the start!

100
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,226
Sorry, but I can't do that.

101
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:54,630
If I don't restrain my <i>Ki</i> just right while
I'm controlling it, I could wreck myself.

102
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,368
In short...

103
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,040
You have done well to master
the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique,

104
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,179
which even I could not handle,
to this degree. However,

105
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:13,851
I must stress once again that you must not
overuse <i>Kaio-ken</i> at your current level.

106
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:18,189
If you mishandle your control,
you will end up ruining your body.

107
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,192
Do your best to limit
yourself to 2X power.

108
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:24,028
Remember, using <i>Kaio-ken</i>
any higher than that

109
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,864
will place too great
a burden upon your body.

110
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:29,867
In other words, your body won't
be able to keep up with the <i>Kaio-ken</i>,

111
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:33,030
and it will bite back
for what you're doing to it.

112
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:35,539
Understood clearly.

113
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,031
--...and that's the story.
--I- is that right?

114
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:46,172
V- Vegeta... h- help me...

115
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:55,386
T- thanks...

116
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,187
Not at all.

117
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:13,511
W- what are you doing,
Vegeta!? Vegeta!

118
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:17,675
I don't have any use
for Saiyans that can't move!

119
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:31,017
W- what a <i>Ki</i>!

120
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,199
F- Father!

121
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,536
W- what's going on!?

122
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:40,561
Die!

123
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:58,886
V- Vegeta!

124
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,671
W- what a beast!
He even killed his own man!

125
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:13,164
Gohan... Kuririn...

126
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:17,157
Both of you, go back
to Kame House right now.

127
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,849
R- right...

128
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:35,186
Gohan, you heard him.
Let's go, now.

129
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,188
B- but...

130
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:42,526
Gohan, he's just too terrible.
We won't do any good being here.

131
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:49,200
On the contrary, our being here will
distract Goku, and we'll just be in his way!

132
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,203
Really, Father?

133
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:58,039
Sorry, yeah. His strength appears
to be even greater than I thought.

134
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:02,479
O- okay, I understand.

135
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:09,486
Oh yeah, Goku, as long as you're at it,
could you fight in some other place?

136
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,890
It would be wrong to mess up
everyone's bodies,

137
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,559
in case they ever come back to life.

138
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,231
They ever come back to life?
With Piccolo dead, Kami-<i>sama</i> is dead, too.

139
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,723
The Dragon Balls
have disappeared forever.

140
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,509
I hate to say it, but nobody
is ever coming back to life again.

141
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,512
I know that...

142
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,073
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, you don't think-?

143
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,519
What?

144
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:49,526
I'll go into the details later.
T- that is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

145
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,196
<i>lf</i> I can beat him, huh?

146
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,223
Right. In any case,
I have to beat him.

147
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,476
What are you doing? What happened
to all that energy you had before?

148
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:08,812
Did you get scared, and now you're
discussing how you're going to run away?

149
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:13,550
Now then, to change locations
and give it my best, I guess.

150
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,488
Just let me take care of this.

151
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:23,060
Goku, I feel bad about always
leaving our fate up to you.

152
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,551
Don't you dare die now, my friend.

153
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,058
Right.

154
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,840
Father...

155
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,510
Gohan...

156
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,573
Once your daddy comes back alive,
let's go fishing again, okay?

157
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:57,589
Okay.

158
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,270
Looks like you know that it
won't do any good to run.

159
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,211
We're going to change
the location of our battle.

160
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:18,375
Suit yourself. It will
all end up the same.

161
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,852
Father...

162
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:34,231
<i>Vegeta... Has there ever been</i>
<i>a foe this powerful before?</i>

163
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,067
<i>The curtain now rises</i>
<i>on a fierce deathbattle,</i>

164
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:41,231
<i>with the fate of the earth</i>
<i>and our friends at stake.</i>
