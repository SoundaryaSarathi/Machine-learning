<i>[Episode 58]</i>

3
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:11,092
My dear!

4
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,382
My dear!

5
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,387
- My dear!
- Let go of me!

6
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,637
I never want to see you again!

7
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,730
My dear, don't leave! My dear!

8
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,787
Fourth Brother, I know what
you're going to say.

9
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:24,872
I think that the Heavenly Lord
punished her too harshly.

10
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,950
It might be because of Ye Hua...

11
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,338
Anyway, whatever she owed me,
she has paid the price for it.

12
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,530
She now has nothing to do with me.

13
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:38,443
Fourth Brother.

14
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:41,432
You've brought me here
especially to look at her?

15
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,032
Since you say so, it is so.

16
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:50,801
We've been walking for quite some time.

17
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,783
I'm tired. Let's go and have some tea.

18
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,474
A pot of tea, please!

19
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,789
Sure!

20
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,425
Sir and Madam...

21
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,606
Si Yin?

22
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:35,378
Yan Zhi?

23
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:39,116
We haven't seen each other
in 70,000 years.

24
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,066
Stay and chat.

25
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,432
I'll go and take a look around.

26
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,037
You're right.

27
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:59,591
We haven't talked since that battle
at Ruoshui Riverbank.

28
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,846
Thank you for being willing
to speak to me.

29
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,552
Si Yin.

30
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:12,688
When I met you, you were Si Yin.

31
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:17,283
So... can I just call you that?

32
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:18,721
Sure.

33
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,495
Si Yin, when I saw you just now

34
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:28,041
it made me remember those days
when we were young.

35
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,894
You and I were still messing around
in Grand Ziming Palace.

36
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:35,158
My Brother Li Jing
was still alive then...

37
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,547
Mother, this auntie is so pretty.

38
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,019
You're also pretty.

39
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>Mother!</i>

40
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:53,509
Mother, do you not want A-Li anymore?

41
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,617
How could I not want A-Li?

42
00:04:56,617 --> 00:05:00,148
I've been thinking of my dear
Little Riceball for the past three years.

43
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:03,365
Why didn't Mother visit me
in the Celestial Palace?

44
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,529
I've been asleep
for the past three years.

45
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:09,774
I didn't wake up.

46
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,639
I didn't wake up from my dreams
until yesterday.

47
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,675
I'd wanted to take a stroll in
the Mortal Realm

48
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,485
and then visit you
in the Celestial Palace.

49
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,526
Who knew that you'd sneak out here?

50
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,982
When I went past here above the clouds

51
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,971
I noticed an auspicious aura
of a  high god around here.

52
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,968
I wanted to take a look
to see which high god it was.

53
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,944
Then I saw Mother down here.

54
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,132
A-Li!

55
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,096
A-Li greets Uncle Zhen.

56
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,795
You're so polite
Imperial Great-grandson!

57
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,689
- Tian Shu greets both high gods!
- Jia Yun greets both high gods!

58
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,250
Where are you taking little A-Li?

59
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,497
You can't tell me?

60
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,858
What is there not to tell?

61
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:55,629
Mother, I'm going to visit
Father at the Sea of Innocence.

62
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,516
Will you come with me?

63
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:01,259
The Sea of Innocence?

64
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,942
- Greetings to Heavenly Lord.
- Zhi Yue greets Heavenly Lord.

65
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,555
Get up.

66
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,476
- Thank you, Heavenly Lord!
- Thank you, Heavenly Lord!

67
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:24,434
Several years ago,
I wronged you unjustly.

68
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,867
You ended up enduring
a heavenly trial for 60 years.

69
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,749
Yuan Zhen, tell me.

70
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:33,418
How would you like me
to make it up to you?

71
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:39,237
Heavenly Lord, I don't regard
those 60 years as suffering.

72
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:42,072
Therefore, I wouldn't ask
for any compensation.

73
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:43,600
You're a dummy!

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,706
How presumptuous.

75
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,781
It's all right.

76
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,673
I always reward and
punish just as fairly.

77
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,211
Go ahead and tell me.

78
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:58,014
I... I'd like to visit High God Bai Qian.

79
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,711
It's just that she's ranked so high up

80
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,779
that I don't dare to request
a visit at Qing Qiu.

81
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,149
Why are you dumb?

82
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,865
You had to say what shouldn't be said.

83
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:08,480
You can't mention the name
Bai Qian in here.

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,656
Don't you know that?

85
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,108
It's been three years
since Ye Hua passed away.

86
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:40,579
There's nothing that can't be said.

87
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,197
Yuan Zhen.

88
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,444
Tell me.

89
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:51,153
Why do you wish to visit
High God Bai Qian in Qing Qiu?

90
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,485
She was my mentor
when I was in the Mortal Realm.

91
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,184
Once a mentor, always a mentor.

92
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:02,608
I wish to greet her and thank her
for looking after me in the Mortal Realm.

93
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:11,779
I believe High God Bai Qian
would be very touched by your words.

94
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:18,161
However, we should discuss
this matter some other time.

95
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,501
The Crown Prince sacrificed his spirit to
the Bell of East Emperor at a young age.

96
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:36,756
Didn't I already remind you?

97
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:38,592
Didn't I tell you
that in the Nine Heavens

98
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:42,197
you're not to mention the deceased
Crown Prince, or his fiancee?

99
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,932
I don't understand.

100
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,636
Why can't we talk about them?

101
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:48,291
Tell me what you know about them first.

102
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,570
Don't keep touching me.

103
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,390
You might be the Crown Prince's cousin

104
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,903
but it's still inappropriate for
men and women to touch.

105
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,293
Goodness...

106
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:03,176
- By the way, on you...
- What are you doing?

107
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,908
Do you have any treasures on you?

108
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,005
What do you want with it?

109
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,676
I owe a deity friend some money,
so I have to pay her back.

110
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,619
I don't believe you.

111
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,808
You're always fooling me.

112
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,434
Not once have you told the truth.

113
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,251
You're always carrying this
Cloud Clearing Fan around.

114
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,955
You treat it like some treasure.

115
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:33,168
I'm going to steal it away
just to spite you!

116
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:40,835
Mother, who was that lady?

117
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,208
That lady the Queen of Qing Qiu.

118
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,227
High God Bai Qian.

119
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,809
I see.

120
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,412
It's going to rain soon.

121
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:53,197
We should tidy up and head home.

122
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,264
Good girl.

123
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,657
Mother misses Father again?

124
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,827
I miss your father at all times.

125
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,937
I remember that your father went alone
to slay the four mythical beasts

126
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:30,820
left behind by the Heavenly Father,
and sank Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

127
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,304
He was so valiant that
none was a match for him.

128
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,596
Father was once the son
of the Heavenly Father.

129
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,428
He's definitely invincible.

130
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,027
Now that I think about it,
I've been really fortunate.

131
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,155
The Heavenly Father had two sons.

132
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:53,753
One is my mentor and
the other, my husband.

133
00:10:53,753 --> 00:11:00,236
Since then, I no longer have eyes
for any other men.

134
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:08,272
Seventeenth, you're really not
ashamed to brag about yourself.

135
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,018
I've really been very lonely
for the past three years.

136
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:17,386
Finally, someone has come
to visit me today.

137
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:19,734
Let's go.

138
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,206
That is the Crown Prince's
basalt crystal coffin.

139
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,268
I know.

140
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:59,513
His parents took him away from
Qing Qiu in this basalt crystal coffin.

141
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,717
Father, I've been unfilial.

142
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:48,644
It took me three years to visit you
in the Sea of Innocence.

143
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:53,504
I've been locked away in Xiwu Palace to
study every day for the past three years.

144
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:57,288
Grandmother kept an eye on me
and wouldn't let me leave...

145
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:01,322
Father... I miss you...

146
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:17,399
<i>Now that you're sleeping in here,
you finally have some rest.</i>

147
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,489
<i>You don't have endless reports to read,
or conquests to make at any time...</i>

148
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,043
Here.

149
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,678
<i>Ye Hua...</i>

150
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,697
A-Li.

151
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,839
Mother, I have to return
to the Celestial Palace now.

152
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,960
I'll surely visit you in Qing Qiu
next month on your birthday.

153
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:40,523
A-Li, if there are too many books
to study, just leave some out.

154
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,873
I just want you to be happy.

155
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:46,268
I don't expect you to become
the next Heavenly Lord.

156
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:50,597
A-Li is the first born of
the Nine Heaven's Crown Prince Ye Hua.

157
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:53,431
I mustn't slack on my studies.

158
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:56,134
Although I'm nowhere
as smart as Father was

159
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:59,272
I must be just as diligent in studies
as Father once was.

160
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,982
You really are Ye Hua's son.

161
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,110
You don't take after me at all.

162
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,091
Fourth Brother.

163
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,799
I watched a play the other day
and felt like watching a few more.

164
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,097
Why don't you head back to
the Peach Tree Woods first?

165
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,635
I'll watch some more plays.

166
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:40,746
All right.

167
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,341
You'd better not watch so many that
you lose track of time.

168
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,789
Heavenly Lord.

169
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,228
Since this morning

170
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,857
the basalt crystal coffin that
encased the Crown Prince

171
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,814
is suddenly swarmed over by
celestial blessings.

172
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,077
No one can get close to it.

173
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:37,694
I rushed over to report it to you.

174
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:40,003
Ye Hua's spirit was already vanquished.

175
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:44,207
Why would it be protected by
such powerful celestial blessings?

176
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,218
Perhaps...

177
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,248
Ye Hua isn't dead.

178
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,631
Ye Hua...

179
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,454
Ye Hua has returned?

180
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:02,871
The junior family members are
to be dismissed now.

181
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:05,726
Not a word about this is to be said.

182
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,623
- Yes!
- Yes!

183
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:13,883
Could High Immortal Zi Lan
invite High God Mo Yuan over

184
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,942
to take a look personally
in the Sea of Innocence?

185
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:18,192
I'll head back to Kunlun Mountain
to invite Master over.

186
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,564
Ye Hua...

187
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,769
If it weren't for this basalt crystal
coffin and the Sea of Innocence

188
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,611
Seventeenth might have to
wait a few more years for you.

189
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,666
Mo Yuan...

190
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,138
High God Mo Yuan...

191
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:30,742
Seek out Seventeenth.

192
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:33,242
She's been waiting three years for you.

193
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:48,453
The cenotaph she made for you is
in Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods.

194
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,913
Thank you...

195
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:00,638
Brother.

196
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,761
<i>- Great!
- Well done!</i>

197
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,093
Upstairs, please.

198
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,901
You really are here!

199
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,932
You came especially to look for me?

200
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,852
Yes! It's rare to find a friend
who likes to watch plays like I do.

201
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:57,559
Why is the play still so tragic?

202
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,352
Life never turns out the way you want.

203
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,676
This play isn't that tragic,
comparatively.

204
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,788
But whenever I watch this play,
I can't help but think

205
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:09,821
of my highly talented cousin
who died young!

206
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:12,622
You had a cousin?

207
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:15,444
Yes, my cousin was very handsome.

208
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:19,463
All the women of Heaven and Earth
couldn't walk away after seeing him.

209
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,315
All they could think about
was marrying him.

210
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:24,513
Sadly, his life was cut short.

211
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:29,858
He died young on the battlefield,
and left behind bereft parents

212
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,046
as well as a young son
who cries all day in sorrow.

213
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,192
How sad.

214
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:38,338
The worst is always when the children
pass away before their parents do.

215
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:42,141
It's sad for your cousin,
but even more so for his parents.

216
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:45,934
The son he left behind
is the most pitiful one.

217
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:51,798
Three years ago, our entire tribe thought
all that was left was my cousin's corpse

218
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,757
and his spirit had been vanquished.

219
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:57,344
They made him a basalt crystal coffin
and sunk him into a sea.

220
00:23:57,344 --> 00:24:00,905
I went to visit him then,
and it all seemed normal.

221
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:04,372
Who knew that yesterday
in that sea where his coffin lay

222
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,061
the waters were greatly disturbed.

223
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,982
They said that the disturbance
was caused by

224
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,676
the celestial blessings
around the coffin.

225
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:13,855
Isn't that strange?

226
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:17,281
My cousin's spirit was long vanquished.

227
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:20,346
How could his body still be protected
by such powerful celestial blessings?

228
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:25,959
Anyway, my parents said that
perhaps my cousin isn't dead.

229
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:33,964
- Great!
- Well done!

230
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:46,788
What's the matter with you?

231
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,195
Continue with your story.

232
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:56,130
If he isn't dead, that poor little
A-Li wouldn't have to cry all day.

233
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:05,584
Is that sea the Sea of Innocence?

234
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:09,508
Your cousin...

235
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,989
Is he the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe, Ye Hua?

236
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,429
You... How did you know?

237
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:20,001
Have I given away a secret?

238
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,893
You mustn't tell anyone!

239
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,971
If my parents learn of this,
I won't have the money to watch plays.

240
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,759
- Well done!
- Great!

241
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,092
I finally managed to steal the
Cloud Clearing Fan to pay for that pearl!

242
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:51,486
Wasn't that High God Bai Qian?

243
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:54,022
I thought I was seeing things.

244
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,421
- High God!
- Where is His Highness? Where is he?

245
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,707
His Highness?

246
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:10,019
Isn't he already buried
in the Sea of Innocence?

247
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,665
Master!

248
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,461
Master!

249
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,363
Where is Ye Hua?

250
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,565
I knew that you'd come here.

251
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:13,798
Where is Ye Hua?

252
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,695
Fret not.

253
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,213
I'm here to talk
to you about this matter.

254
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,019
<i>Heavenly Father used half of his powers</i>

255
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,038
<i>to create the celestial fetus
into a golden lotus.</i>

256
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:32,247
<i>Since then, those powers have
been hidden in his spirit.</i>

257
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:37,951
<i>Three years ago, Ye Hua slayed
the four beasts of Yingzhou</i>

258
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:40,601
<i>and attained the other half
of Heavenly Father's powers from them.</i>

259
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:44,487
<i>I believe that Ye Hua must have
used all of Heavenly Father's powers</i>

260
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:47,111
<i>to curb the destructive energy
from the Bell of East Emperor.</i>

261
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:50,946
<i>His own spirit was wounded from
the collision of those two powers</i>

262
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,730
<i>so it triggered his body to
sink into a cycle of slumber.</i>

263
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,730
Ye Hua?

264
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,444
<i>He would have slept for decades.</i>

265
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,468
<i>However, the basalt crystal coffin
is a great artifact.</i>

266
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:05,041
<i>The Sea of Innocence might
be a burial place for the Celestial Tribe</i>

267
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,222
<i>but it's also a sacred place
for recuperation.</i>

268
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:11,863
<i>That was why Ye Hua could
wake up in just three years.</i>

269
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,548
Qian Qian...

270
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,365
Come here.

271
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,767
Ye Hua!

272
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,209
Don't cry.

273
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:13,511
Look at me.

274
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,522
Am I not standing
before you safe and sound?

275
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:39,885
What brings you here?

276
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:44,917
I've brought her here to
greet her savior.

277
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,137
Quickly!

278
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:52,830
Bow to High Immortal Zi Lan
for saving your life.

279
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,589
High Immortal, thank you
for saving my life.

280
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,010
Get up quickly!

281
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:16,336
She... Isn't the child a boy?

282
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:19,378
I kept hearing Xuan Nu call
the child her son.

283
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,134
I thought...

284
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:26,198
No, the child is a girl.

285
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:29,733
Perhaps, Xuan Nu wanted a son too badly

286
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:32,554
to inherit Brother Li Jing's throne
as the Ghost Lord

287
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:34,824
so she called her a son.

288
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:47,838
Xuan Nu lived her entire life
fooling herself and others.

289
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:57,665
You...

290
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:00,869
Have you been in
Kunlun Mountain all these years?

291
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,103
Yes, I've been here all this time.

292
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:09,016
I never left.

293
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,428
I heard that your mentor returned.

294
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:18,823
Did he ever blame you for
making an elixir for the Ghost Tribe?

295
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,169
No.

296
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,892
Did your seniors ever pick on you
for helping me with the elixir?

297
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,576
Not once.

298
00:33:34,307 --> 00:33:36,141
Then I can set my mind at ease.

299
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,775
Farewell.

300
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,435
Hold on!

301
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,915
This is, after all, Kunlun Mountain.

302
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:07,494
Don't ever come here again.

303
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:13,880
Don't come looking for me either.

304
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:19,983
All right.

305
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:32,596
Farewell.

306
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,766
Master has returned?

307
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:47,737
Zi Lan just rushed back here to say
that the Crown Prince is waking up?

308
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,815
He is already awake.

309
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,427
That's wonderful!

310
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,264
Seventeenth can finally be married!

311
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,628
Play it well.

312
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:54,487
Your father already told me that you have
to finish seven rounds of chess with me

313
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,208
before you can go looking for him.

314
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,349
How could I possibly defeat
High God Zhe Yan?

315
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,983
It's all right. I'll let you win.

316
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:10,788
Your father surely places...
his wife before his son.

317
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,304
Let's not play chess anymore...

318
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:14,791
How about this?

319
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,932
I'll tell you stories about
your mother when she was little

320
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:21,273
or the tales of your parents'
love-hate relationship?

321
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,818
When did my parents ever have
a love-hate relationship?

322
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,405
There's only sweet love.

323
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,307
All right...

324
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:29,260
In all Four Seas and the Eight Far Lands

325
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,231
your parents are the most deeply in love.

326
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,077
I'll tell you about stories about
your mother when she was little then?

327
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,018
Zhen.

328
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:39,750
Where should we start?

329
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,259
Let's start from that year when she went
traveling across the four seas with me

330
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,860
at 20,000 years old and
created havoc in the realms?

331
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,072
That's a long enough story to tell
until Riceball's baby brother is born.

332
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:52,190
When your mother was little,
she was very naughty.

333
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,509
She got into trouble every day,
and often took things from others.

334
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:59,038
She would take things from others
and forget to return them.

335
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,192
Your mother...

336
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:07,949
Ye Hua.

337
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:15,659
For the past three years,
I often saw you in my dreams.

338
00:38:16,851 --> 00:38:20,173
Gradually, I couldn't make out
the dream from reality.

339
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:28,512
In my dreams, you often spoke to me
and played chess with me.

340
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,175
I told my Fourth Brother that
it's best when I dream of you.

341
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,731
Whenever I fell asleep, I could see you.

342
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,304
That was why for the past three years,
I was often very sleepy.

343
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:47,458
I'd sleep from dawn until dusk
and then get a sip of water

344
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,916
before sleeping all the way
until the next afternoon.

345
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,914
Now... This is not a dream.

346
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,423
Ye Hua...

347
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:15,757
Tell me.

348
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,728
This isn't a dream, is it?

349
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,179
It isn't.

350
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,222
Qian Qian.

351
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:41,054
In the previous life, we first met
in Mount Junji of the Far East.

352
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,045
You mistook me for a small black snake.

353
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:48,432
You kept me as a pet and
even fed me raw meat.

354
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:52,954
Then I approached you in the name
of repaying your kindness

355
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,121
but you had me marry you.

356
00:39:57,512 --> 00:40:00,472
Later, we just went ahead
and held a wedding ritual.

357
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:02,318
We became husband and wife.

358
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:09,726
That was the first time,
I ever felt truly happy.

359
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:19,648
Not long afterwards
you were forced into the Celestial Palace

360
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,400
and eventually jumped off
the Zhuxian Terrace.

361
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:28,929
If it hadn't been for A-Li

362
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,550
I really didn't know
how I could have survived.

363
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:36,690
Fortunately 300 years later...

364
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,954
I met you again.

365
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:46,130
I remember seeing you
in the Crystal Palace.

366
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:49,887
I watched you as
you preached to Uncle Sang Ji's wife.

367
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:52,172
You had a fan in your right hand and

368
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:56,067
strummed the table with your left
like you always did.

369
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:00,215
The way you preached at her

370
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,813
and that scar on your wrist
from the crimson hellfire...

371
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:04,893
I was certain that...

372
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:12,269
Whether you're Su Su or Qian Qian,
you are just you.

373
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:25,847
See?

374
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:27,992
I remember it so clearly.

375
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,813
Would I be able to do so in your dreams?

376
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:35,485
That's why this isn't a dream.

377
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:41,836
This isn't a dream.

378
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:47,101
What you just said
was what we went through.

379
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,643
How can you remember it so clearly?

380
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,907
I still remember what I first
said to you in the Crystal Palace.

381
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,862
I can't remember it very clearly.

382
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,313
Ye Hua failed to recognize that

383
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:09,556
you were actually High God
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu!

384
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,820
