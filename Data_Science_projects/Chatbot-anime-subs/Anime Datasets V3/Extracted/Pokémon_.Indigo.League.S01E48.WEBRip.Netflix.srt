-Get out of its way.

You don't have to worry
about your Bulbasaur, Ash.

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,002
It isn't sick at all.
It's just getting ready to evolve.

63
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,965
Evolve? I can't believe it.
Bulbasaur's going to evolve.

64
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,425
You shouldn't be surprised.

65
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,761
That mountain man said
Bulbasaur was strong

66
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,472
and that's because you've done
such a great job training it.

68
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,643
When Bulbasaur evolves,
it'll turn into Ivysaur, right?

69
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,897
Right. So how long is it going to be
till the big evolve-o-rama?

No one knows
why they choose that time.

It's different every year,

81
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,180
but it seems to have something to do
with the alignment of the planets

82
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,723
and the phases of the moon.

83

at just the right time for the festival.

Where do the Bulbasaur go
to evolve?

Cool name.

Yes, but since no human being
has ever seen the garden clearly.

Most people think
it's nothing but an illusion.

[Misty] Look at those flowers sparkle.
That's not an illusion.

91
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,833

must be someplace out there.

<i>the sun's rays as a source of energy.</i>

169
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,911
Hmm, but that kind of behavior
makes it sound like a plant.

170
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,997
I don't see my Bulbasaur
anyplace around here.

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,292
Hey, Ash, your Bulbasaur still
has that bandage on its head.

172
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,334
-Hmm.
-Ka!

173
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,300
Hey, there it is.
Over here, Bulba... Urgh.

174
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,636
Hey, don't forget human beings
aren't supposed to be here.

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,264
-Oh, right.
-Let's watch the festival.

176
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,393
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

177
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,479
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

178
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,858
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

179
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,361
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

180
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,739
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

181
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,740
Bulbasaur.

182
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,744
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

183
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,748
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

184
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
[all gasp]

185
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,045
[all groan]

186
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,796
How do we get in there?

187
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,758
Why doesn't Meowth just scratch
his way through with his claws?

188
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,176
I just filed them.

189
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,889
-All right, garden wall, you axed for it.
-We're the toughest team you ever saw.

190
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,350
Let's cut to the chase.

191
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,352
[all groaning]

192
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,357
A timber-tantrum, eh?
Let's get to the root of its problem.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,817
[grunting and groaning]

194
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,487
I think its bite is as bad as its bark.

195
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,671
-Ivysaur.
-All right.

196
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,256
[Pokédex]
<i>The seed Pokémon Ivysaur.</i>

197
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>Bulbasaur's evolved form.</i>

198
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,763
<i>The bulb on its back absorbs nourishment</i>
<i>and blooms into a large flower.</i>

199
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:49,185
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

200
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:54,524
-Saur!
-[all] Saur

201
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,609
This must be their evolution festival.

202
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,403
For a long time,
people have disagreed

203
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,156
whether Bulbasaur is an animal type
Pokémon or a plant type.

204
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,619
If either plants or animals disappeared
from the planet, life wouldn't go on.

205
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,414
[Misty]
They need each other to live and grow.

206
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,374
Pika.

207
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,795
Maybe the Bulbasaur are a sign
that all life on earth is connected.

208
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,338
Maybe you're right.

209
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,966
I wonder if my Bulbasaur's
going to evolve too.

210
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,592
-Ah!
-Huh?

211
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,512
Hmm, it's not evolving.

212
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,431
-[grunting]
-[Ash] Why not?

213
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,309
it looks like it's trying not to evolve.

214
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,437
Pika.

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,523
Venus... Venusaur.

216
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,151
-Venusaur.
-Bulba.

217
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,487
-Venus. Venusaur.
-Bulba. Bulbasaur.

218
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,574
Venusaur. Venusaur. Venusaur.

219
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,036
Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulba.
Bulbasaur. Saur.

220
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,831
Venusaur. Venusaur!

221
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,750
Venusaur.

222
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,751
Bulbasaur.

223
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,213
[Misty] The others are getting
really angry at Bulbasaur.

224
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,506
I wonder why.

225
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,633
Bulbasaur's even more stubborn
than you.

226
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,386
-Venusaur!
-Bulba!

227
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,888
-Hey!
-Pika!

228
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,765
-Leave it alone.
-Pika.

229
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,978
[groans]

230
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,188
-Pika Pik!
-Bulbasaur!

231
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,149
[sighs and then chuckles]

232
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,109
-Ash.
-Are you okay?

233
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,779
-Ven...
-Asaur.

234
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,741
-Are they mad at us too?
-I don't think they're too thrilled.

235
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,576
Venusaur.

236
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,245
Sorry we broke in on your festival

237
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,040
but the Bulbasaur
you're angry at is my friend.

238
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,752
The reason you're so mad is
because it doesn't want to evolve, right?

239
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,712
[all] Venusaur!

240
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:45,176
You probably feel like it ruined your
festival and I'm very sorry about that.

241
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,220
But if Bulbasaur doesn't
want to evolve yet,

242
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,639
I don't think you should
have right to force it to.

243
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,394
Venusaur!

244
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,732
[Brock]
Whoa, they're manipulating nature.

245
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,360
If Bulbasaur evolves,
it could do that too.

246
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,113
Don't you want to have
that kind of power, Bulbasaur?

247
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,406
Bulba.

248
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,616
Sorry I got so excited about you evolving

249
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,327
without even thinking about
whether you wanted to do it or not.

250
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,787
Bulbasaur.

251
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,958
Now, look, you can't just force
Bulbasaur to do what you want.

252
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,961
Bulbasaur has a right to decide
when it's ready to evolve.

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,587
-[James] The pest is right.
-Saur?

254
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,631
[Jessie]
You've got to choose your own path.

255
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,717
[James] And when our path to
the Mysterious Garden was blocked...

256
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,220
[Jessie]
We decided to rise above it all.

257
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,431
[Meowth]
And we provide our own hot air.

258
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,891
Now we'll have to prepare for trouble.

259
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,895
-[Jessie] Prepare for trouble.
-[James] Make it double.

260
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,106
[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

261
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,358
[James]
To unite all peoples within our nation.

262
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,986
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

263
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,363
To extend our reach to the stars above.

264
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,782
-Jessie.
-James.

265
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,910
[Jessie] Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

266
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,746
[James]
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

267
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,666
Stop wasting time.
Start the machine up.

268
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,711
-We need the motto.
-Our fans have come to expect it.

269
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,838
[Jessie] Let's get started.

270
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,548
Here we go... again.

271
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,093
[chuckles]

272
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,012
-Hit it.
-Suction on.

273
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,807
[all groaning] Bulbasaur!

274
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,059
-It's a vacuum!
-No kidding!

275
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,606
-It's really working.
-It's a suck-cess.

276
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,444
[all yell] Saur! Bulbasaur!

277
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,411
[chuckles] It's trying to save them.

278
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,372
-Turn up the suction full-power.
-Roger.

279
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,880
Venusaur!

280
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,009
Pikachu, use your thunder
to bring down their balloon.

281
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,928
-Pika.
-No, wait!

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,264
A thunder attack might hurt
the Ivysaur that Team Rocket captured.

283
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,266
-We got to do something.
-Pika!

284
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,352
-Ah! Pikachu!
-Pika!

285
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,273
-Saur!
-Pika Pi! Pi, pika, ka.

286
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,152
-[chuckles] Pikachu!
-Pika pi.

287
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,529
Thanks, Bulbasaur.

288
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,323
Try to let the air out of their balloon
with your Razor Leaf attack.

289
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,283
Bulbasaur!

290
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,079
-Oh!
-Bulba.

Venus.

292
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,626
All that's left is a puny, little
Bulbasaur. Should we get it?

293
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,004
[both] A Bulbasaur? Ha, ha.

294
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,589
Who needs a Bulbasaur?

295
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,466
Bulba!

296
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,803
-What a wimp.
-[James] You can keep that runt.

298
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,142
Hey, stop making fun of my Bulbasaur.

00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,978
Bulba! Bulba!

300
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,782
What's that?

<i>Light is collected and formed</i>
<i>into a powerful beam with intensive force.</i>

303
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,960
Like a super strong sunbeam.
I didn't know you could do that.

304
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,295
Bulba.

305
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,381
Okay, Bulbasaur,
get ready to use your Solarbeam.

Hey. The Mysterious Garden.

337
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,276
After the evolution festival,
it must disappear.

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,821
Yeah, I'm sure glad
