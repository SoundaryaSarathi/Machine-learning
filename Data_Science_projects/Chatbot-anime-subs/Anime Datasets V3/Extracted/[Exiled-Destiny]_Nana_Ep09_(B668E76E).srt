1
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,350
Nana had a red tattoo
on her arm.

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,580
It was the lotus flower,
the flower also known as Ren...

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,950
What that flower meant to her,

4
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,860
of course, I had no way
of knowing at the time.

5
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,250
When I was darkness at that time

6
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,090
With trembling lips

7
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,180
In a corner of a room I cry

8
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,260
The more I struggle

9
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,100
The more this wound deepens

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,260
The broken promise hurt me

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,000
Nobody can save me

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,180
God, I have only one request

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,800
Stop tearing apart my love

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,150
I need your love

15
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,380
I'm a broken rose

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,320
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,490
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

18
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,260
I need your love

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,500
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,460
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,430
I wanna need your love

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm a broken rose

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,000
I wanna need your love

25
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,900
Ohh, that's bright.
I've gotta get curtains.

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,580
I've gotta get to work!

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,780
What time is it?

28
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,620
What am I gonna do?!

29
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,460
Good morning, Hachiko.

30
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,890
It's a nice day.
Wanna go for a walk?

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,830
Why didn't you wake me up?!

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,910
- You idiot, idiot, idiot!
- Why should I hafta wake you up?

33
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,940
Because, I have to work!

34
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,970
The shop opens at 11
and I'm late my first day!

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,310
Late? It's still early.

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,470
You don't have to be at work
until about ten, right?

37
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,680
You got lots of time.

38
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,580
You're kidding.
But my alarm clock said eleven.

39
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,720
The clock you got yesterday
at Mizukoshi's?

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,450
You mean it's broken already?

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,030
Nana, I don't think
this clock is moving.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,620
It's still at the time it was
when I set it last night.

43
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm gonna get that Mizukoshi,
just as soon as I get to work.

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,270
The refrigerator better be working.

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,540
Oh good. It's nice and cold.

46
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,670
Were you cooling something?

47
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,540
Beer. Want some?

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,240
Yay!

49
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,110
No, not "yay!"
You got work, remember?

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,250
But I'm thirsty!
No, I'm hungry!

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,190
I should have bought something!

52
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,490
By the way,
I ate the hamburger.

53
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,790
It was awesome good! Thanks.

54
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,160
You ate it all by yourself.
Not fair!

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,330
Well then, write "do not eat"
on the darn thing next time!

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,700
A present for Nana
From Hachi
Well then, write "do not eat"
on the darn thing next time!

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,830
I wonder if there's a classy café
or something like that open right now.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,760
At this time of the morning?
What do you expect?

59
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,900
I'll get you some dog food
at the convenience store.

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,740
Found a cute bakery!

61
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,110
They all look really good!
I don't know which one to get!

62
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,020
You really do have
a good nose, don't you?

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,520
Being a dog.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,790
Let's eat by the riverside.
It looks so refreshing. A mini-picnic.

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,230
We need to get a table.

66
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,870
Hey, Nana.

67
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,970
The gas man's coming to
open the valve today, isn't he?

68
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,070
Oh yeah. He said he could come
in the morning.

69
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,180
I'll be at home,
so don't you worry about it.

70
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,810
You go to work.

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,080
Your stuff from home is
arriving today too, isn't it?

72
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,580
I'll be there to accept it.

73
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,450
Sorry. I've been leaving everything
to you since yesterday.

74
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,720
No worries.

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,290
I got nothing better to do anyway.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,320
But still...

77
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,630
What are you going to do
about work?

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
Don't you have to find a job?

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,930
If you're not particular,
jobs are easy to come by.

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,100
I wonder if that's true.
Like, is life that easy?

81
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,710
Bought on impulse

82
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,210
Bought on impulse
I know it's not for me to say, but...

83
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,910
Bought on impulse
50's headband
I know it's not for me to say, but...

84
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,510
Bought on impulse
50's headband
70's dress and shoes
I know it's not for me to say, but...

85
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,840
I know it's not for me to say, but...

86
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,840
Bought on impulse
50's headband
70's dress and shoes
Hasn't been paid yet.

87
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,240
Hello, how are you today?

88
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,450
Jun-chan!

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,150
This place really suits you.

90
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,950
Shoji came over last night,
you know.

91
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,360
Said you were going
to be working here,

92
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,760
so I thought I'd come by
and check it out.

93
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,320
It's good to see you got
a good job.

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,030
Oh, so Shoji went over
to your place after that!

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,340
Yup. He spent the rest
of the night

96
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,360
drinking with Kyosuke
until morning.

97
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,940
Oh good. I really didn't know
what I would do

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,530
if he had gone to Sachiko's.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,860
Who's Sachiko?

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,880
She's like an apprentice
of the Demon Lord.

101
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,780
If it makes it easier to understand,
she's kinda like the "Muddy Mistress"?

102
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,380
I have no idea what you're saying.

103
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,480
Nana, is this your friend?

104
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,850
Nice to see you, I'm Mizukoshi.
I run the joint.

105
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,520
Oh, Mr. Mizukoshi,
this is my best friend Jun-chan.

106
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,580
She's an art student.

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,450
Thank you for looking after Nana.

108
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,190
Jun-chan?
Not Kyu, Japanese for nine?

109
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,360
Stop that, Mr. Mizukoshi.

110
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,190
By the way, Hachi...

111
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,370
- Hachi?
- About this clock.

112
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,300
Did you fix it?

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,100
Well actually, it's natural
it won't move without batteries in it.

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,370
Oh of course.
How embarrassing. I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,810
No, it's my fault.

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,410
I guess I forgot to put batteries
in the box.

117
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,050
I'll set it for you later.

118
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,420
Sorry to trouble you. Thank you.

119
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,290
Oh, why don't you go for lunch
with your friend

120
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,620
while business is still slow?

121
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,720
Really? You don't mind?

122
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,020
No problem. I'll watch the shop.

123
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,730
Yay! See you in a bit.

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Your disease, it's started again.

125
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,830
You know the Jackson burgers
are really good!

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,910
I should've known
there was something going on,

127
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,970
you finding a job so quickly.

128
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,210
Didn't expect such a young boss.

129
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,380
Koichi Sato! Another burger please.

130
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,550
You got it.

131
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,620
Hey, you know I don't care.

132
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,150
As long as you have a job.

133
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,320
Never mind the reasons
for sticking to it.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Just don't give Shoji a hard time.

135
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,570
Like last night, too, he got drunk
and started saying stuff.

136
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,770
Saying stuff?!

137
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,400
"Last night, too"?
Is he always saying stuff about me?

138
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,930
Uh...

139
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,240
So actually,
Shoji really doesn't like me!

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,870
Because I'm good for nothing!

141
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,340
It's not like that.

142
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,950
Shoji is so in love with you

143
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,420
he doesn't know what to do
with himself.

144
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,330
You're not going to find a man like that
just anywhere, you know that?

145
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,430
You gotta take better care
of him, man.

146
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,120
Otherwise, that's when heaven'll
get you back.

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,190
I know that.

148
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,570
But what do I need to do, and how,
in order to take better care of him?

149
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,040
Actually, I thought I was taking
pretty good care of him.

150
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,640
I wonder if I should have spent
the night with him last night.

151
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,340
Nana, it's eight o'clock,
so I'm going to close up shop now.

152
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,080
Oh, okay!

153
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,090
Thanks for hanging in there.

154
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,560
Must have tired you out being
such a slow business and all.

155
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,680
Not at all.

156
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,400
Just to think that I can work

157
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,170
amongst all this cute stuff
every day from now,

158
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,260
I'm totally happy.

159
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
As long as you don't mind.

160
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,090
Are you hungry?

161
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,170
Do you want to go for something
to eat after we close up?

162
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,700
I'll buy.

163
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,870
Really?

164
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,110
- Heaven'll get you back!
- What do you want to have?

165
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,440
Is there anything you don't like?

166
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Mizukoshi.

167
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,250
I have other plans for tonight.
It totally slipped my mind.

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,580
- A date?
- No! It's not like that!

169
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,650
You don't have to be embarrassed.

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,420
You're that age, you're allowed
to have a boyfriend or two.

171
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,150
Tell him to visit the shop.
I'll give him a discount.

172
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,030
Thank you.

173
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,330
I messed up.

174
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,440
No, no, it's fine.
I've got Shoji.

175
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,370
I'd be in trouble if things started
to look good with Mr. Mizukoshi.

176
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,240
Like, these thoughts alone are
totally inconsiderate of Shoji.

177
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,810
No way. It's not like that.
I can't go on living without Shoji!

178
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,720
Why don't I call him?

179
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,990
Oh, Shoji...

180
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,560
Your phone is being re-directed
to the answering service center.

181
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,660
Please leave a message after, .,

182
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,170
Maybe he's still working.

183
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,610
Call me when you get off work.

184
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,810
Call me when you get off work.
Just because I'm in Tokyo now
doesn't necessarily mean

185
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:42,880
Call me when you get off work.

186
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,340
Call me when you get off work.
that I can see Shoji any time I want.

187
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,380
that I can see Shoji any time I want.

188
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,880
Send
that I can see Shoji any time I want.

189
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,180
that I can see Shoji any time I want.

190
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,310
That's natural,
but it feels kind of lonely.

191
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,740
I should have stayed over
at Shoji's last night, after all.

192
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,960
Shoji's got his job,

193
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,290
and he's going to start going
to school now too.

194
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,290
He'll be busier than ever.
And I've got work now.

195
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,230
And working is kinda tiring.

196
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,500
Are we not going to be able
to see each other when we want?

197
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,900
I guess life isn't so easy, after all.

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,210
I thought that if I at least made it to Tokyo,
I could have everything my way.

199
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,240
In fact, I am getting my way, aren't I?

200
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,410
It's almost scary.
I'm on a roll, even.

201
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,560
But I hardly get the feeling
I've grasped anything in these hands.

202
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,420
I wonder why?

203
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,960
Besides, what is it that I really want?

204
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,500
Time with Shoji...

205
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,400
cute clothes and knick-knacks...
classy apartment and furniture...

206
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,380
Sure they're all important,
but something's missing.

207
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,880
Am I asking for too much?

208
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,930
Oh, hi Hachiko.

209
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,660
How was work?

210
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,460
What are you doing, Nana?

211
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,070
Carpentry.

212
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,240
I'm making a table and some chairs.

213
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,870
Wow! That's awesome!
So elaborate and so cute!

214
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,040
We need a table to eat on, don't we?

215
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,010
I'll be finished in a minute,
so when I'm done, let's eat.

216
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,610
But I didn't buy any groceries.

217
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll go get something
at the convenience store!

218
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,450
I've made some stew, if that'll do.

219
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,080
Huh?

220
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,090
And salad.

221
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,700
This looks so good!
This is super!

222
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,700
Oh and your things arrived,
so I stuck them in your room.

223
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,030
I handed your guarantor papers
over to Mr. Ando, too.

224
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,270
I also received your key.
It's over there.

225
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,350
Thank you, Nana!

226
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,570
What's that?
I didn't really do anything.

227
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,790
Stop crying!

228
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,620
Oh, I am so happy.
I guess I am on a good roll.

229
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,330
Nothing's gone wrong
since I got to Tokyo.

230
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,930
In fact, it's Nana.
It's always fun when I'm with Nana.

231
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,040
I always feel so positive.

232
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,640
It's strange,
because we're so different in every way.

233
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,140
I guess this is what they mean
when people say "you just click."

234
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,050
Incredible! It's perfect!

235
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,980
The size is just right for the window!

236
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,780
Something store-bought
just wouldn't work like this.

237
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,650
Right? Do you like it?

238
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,290
Oh, I do! You are so talented!

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,260
Hey, this is no big deal.

240
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,700
Besides, I got some scraps from
a nearby construction site,

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,860
so it's basically free.

242
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,670
While I was at it,

243
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,830
I got one of the young workers
to help me shave the wood.

244
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,740
Nana, you could be a carpenter!
Cool, a girl carpenter!

245
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,600
Why don't you look for work
in that line?

246
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,550
Might work,

247
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,240
but say I do this every day
and then cut a finger or something.

248
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,820
I won't be able to the play guitar.

249
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh, right, your guitar...

250
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,350
Shall we eat?

251
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,790
Hey Nana, are you looking to be
a professional guitarist?

252
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,350
What, are you kidding?

253
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,060
I'm not good enough to make it
as a pro.

254
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,240
But you used to play in a band,
didn't you?

255
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,230
Well yeah, but I wasn't the guitarist,
I was a vocalist.

256
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,170
You were the singer!

257
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,500
Awesome! Cool! Respect!

258
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,000
About what?

259
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,980
Well...

260
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,110
Tell me that after
you hear me sing, man.

261
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,490
Yeah, I think I'd like
to hear her sing.

262
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,330
There's no doubt in my mind
that she'd be cool.

263
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,890
I'll be her greatest fan, for sure.

264
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,770
Hey Nana?

265
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,210
I've been wondering,
that tattoo on your arm.

266
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,340
Is it real?

267
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,770
It's not a sticker?

268
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,080
Ah, yeah.

269
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,220
I knew it!

270
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,120
Wow! I've heard tattooing
is incredibly painful.

271
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,890
You're so brave! I was scared
just getting my ears pierced.

272
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,630
A bit of pain makes it
all worth doing.

273
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,990
You think so?

274
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,820
Kinda like, being aware
that you're alive?

275
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,520
Are you a masochist?

276
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,260
No, actually if I had the choice,
I'm more the sadist.

277
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,000
So true.

278
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,370
But Nana...

279
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,970
That's the flower of the lotus, isn't it?
Why did you choose the lotus?

280
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,240
Actually, it's the ren.

281
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,800
Huh?

282
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,510
Sui-ren?

283
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,680
Just plain ren.

284
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,840
You mean lotus.

285
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,980
I said no.

286
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,820
But that's totally a lotus.

287
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,120
Oh shut up!

288
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,660
But it definitely is a lotus.
Why are you being so stubborn?

289
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,920
Who's the stubborn one?!

290
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,220
Who could it be at this time of night?

291
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,290
Miss Osaki. I have a delivery for you.

292
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,600
It could be the stuff from Yasu!

293
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,700
That man sure works fast.

294
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,170
What a guy.

295
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,950
Good evening.

296
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,260
Nobu! What the heck
are you doing here?!

297
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,020
Oh wonderful!
The exact response I was expecting!

298
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,980
Good!

299
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,830
Wow! This is delicious!
I am so impressed!

300
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,900
- You'll make a good wife, Nana.
- No... Umm...

301
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,230
You have the same name,
but what a difference!

302
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,960
Thanks for the compliment.
I made that.

303
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,370
Figures. I thought it was a bit...

304
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,870
...sal-ty.

305
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,170
If you don't like it, leave it!

306
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,610
What the heck are you
doing here anyway? You!

307
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,650
Wha? I came to bring you your stuff!

308
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,720
It was an eight-hour drive, man!
You could be thankful!

309
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,550
Well done, then.
Now you may go.

310
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,290
- Get outta here. Go home!
- Nana!

311
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,890
Please! Let me stay here
just one night!

312
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:08,850
No way.

313
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,450
- In fact, I...
- I don't wanna hear!

314
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,830
I ran away from home.

315
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,490
I told you,
I don't wanna hear it!

316
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,330
Nana!

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,600
I have no attraction to
my hometown, whatsoever.

318
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,070
Why do you treat him like that?
He's your friend, isn't he?

319
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,200
Um, Nobu, is it?

320
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,510
Are you all right?

321
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,370
You don't have to be polite to me.
I'm totally used to this.

322
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,240
Don't expect any hospitality,
but you can stay here if you like.

323
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,910
Thanks. You're so kind...

324
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,620
I won't have it.

325
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,820
Nana, what are you going on about?

326
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,330
It's for him.
He needs to smarten up!

327
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Now you listen to me, Nobu.

328
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,360
You are to follow your father's footsteps
and run that huge Japanese Inn.

329
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,000
Get it through your head.

330
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,340
I didn't choose to be born
into that family.

331
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,170
Quit being a brat about it!

332
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,940
You are blessed, young man!
Your future is guaranteed!

333
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,270
What's the need to throw away
that happiness?!

334
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,040
I won't regret it in the least bit.

335
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,410
As long as I can play my guitar,
I'm happy.

336
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,950
And I wanna play for you.

337
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,620
Don't make me repeat myself.

338
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,700
Hey Nana. Let's just at least
let him stay tonight.

339
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,240
It's getting late already. Okay?

340
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,740
Oh, a phone?

341
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,310
Oh, it's mine.

342
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,920
Hello. Hey, Yasu.

343
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,060
Yeah, just got here
a few minutes ago.

344
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,060
Hello Yasu? Do something
about this stupid son, will ya?!

345
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,900
Why'd you get him to bring
my stuff anyway?!

346
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,660
Oh sorry,
but he insisted that he'd go.

347
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,040
What do you mean, "but"?!
What are you gonna do about it?!

348
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,370
No smoking
What do you mean, "but"?!
What are you gonna do about it?!

349
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:57,470
No smoking

350
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,840
No smoking
There's nothing I can do about it, Nana.

351
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,410
No smoking

352
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,440
No smoking
Nobu's serious.

353
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,840
No smoking

354
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,840
Why don't you find some
new band members and start over?

355
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,110
I know you'd prefer
a band to going solo.

356
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,180
Besides, you can write lyrics
but you can't write a tune.

357
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,150
Oh by the way,
did ya listen to the tape?

358
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,250
Tape?

359
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,190
The new number Nobu wrote.

360
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,890
It's good.

361
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,120
If you sing it, in my opinion,
nobody's got a chance over you guys.

362
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,740
This song is the best!
It is so cool!

363
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,880
Did you really write this Nobu?
I am so impressed! Really!

364
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,310
Nana.

365
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,930
Play it for me.
I'd like to try and sing it.

366
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,400
Sure.

367
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, but I left my amp
in the car!

368
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,610
This thing.
No wonder it was so heavy.

369
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,850
What's this? Man, only one guest
in the house tonight?

370
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
Pretty shabby if you ask me.

371
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,990
Oh, well, I guess that's how
it is when just starting off.

372
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,660
One's better than none.

373
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,370
Good evening. We're Blast.

374
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,890
Welcome to our very first
Tokyo performance.

375
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,660
Good evening...

376
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,540
I'll make this a night
you'll never forget.

377
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,810
I still can't forget that night.

378
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
There weren't any words
to the song yet,

379
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,550
so you just sang
a whole bunch of nonsense.

380
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,550
It was almost as if someone
was putting a spell on me.

381
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,430
I became a prisoner of
that voice of yours.

382
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,510
Our table became the stage,

383
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,780
your phone was the mike
and the crescent moon was your spotlight.

384
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,780
Only you could make magic
like that, Nana.

385
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,780
I still believe it.

386
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,060
The more I close my heart

387
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,000
The more this love tangles up

388
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,370
Nice and gently kiss me

389
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,130
Nobody can save me

390
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,000
Like a frozen rose

391
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,010
I want a peaceful sleep for my tears

392
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,810
I need your love

393
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,990
I'm a broken rose

394
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,160
Sorry dying, falling, is my soul

395
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,320
Collapsing in loneliness like a little girl.

396
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,020
I need your love

397
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm a broken rose

398
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,230
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

399
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,360
with your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

400
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,310
I wanna need your love, .,

401
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,310
I'm a broken rose

402
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,550
I wanna need your love, .,
