1
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,600
C- could he have fallen asleep?

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,431
I don't know...

3
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,936
U- um...

4
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:58,883
Because of those villains, most of my
children across this world have been killed.

5
00:00:58,883 --> 00:01:00,874
This is grievous.

6
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:06,891
They appear to be after the Dragon Balls.

7
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:07,892
Yes.

8
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:11,896
To think that this would happen
because of these Balls of hope,

9
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:16,901
testament to the wisdom
and power of the Namekians...

10
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:21,406
Excuse me for coming right to the point,
but could I ask you to let me borrow

11
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:24,239
the Dragon Ball over your
head for a short while?

12
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:29,581
I absolutely will not turn it
over to them! I promise you!

13
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:33,752
You are gathering the
Dragon Balls too, are you?

14
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:38,590
Yes. We would like to bring
our dead friends back to life.

15
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,092
I ask on my behalf, as well.

16
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:44,929
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>, if these people's
friends come back to life,

17
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,533
they may be able
to defeat those bad people.

18
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,202
How do you know of the Dragon Balls?

19
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:53,538
We had them on Earth as well.

20
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,206
What did you say!?

21
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,109
Long ago, during this planet's crisis,

22
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,203
there was a Namekian
who made his way to Earth.

23
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:21,566
That person created our Dragon Balls.

24
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:26,905
Is that so? I remember now.
Katattsu's child. What a surprise.

25
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:31,076
Who would have thought that he
would arrive safely on Earth?

26
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:36,915
That child was a Dragon-type prodigy,
who was capable of creating Dragon Balls.

27
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:44,923
He was killed along with our other friends
by the Saiyan Vegeta, who is now here.

28
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:50,195
The Saiyans are indeed terrible.
That child prodigy, huh?

29
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:54,199
This Saiyan wouldn't happen to be
a Super Saiyan, would he?

30
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,202
Huh? W- what's that?

31
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:03,368
Gentleman from Earth, could I
get you to come over here?

32
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,542
Please allow me to probe
into your past a little.

33
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:14,044
Past?

34
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:44,742
How can this be!? Once evil made its
way inside him, he split into two!?

35
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,043
So in order for him to become Kami,

36
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,881
he couldn't have even the slightest
of evil feelings within him, then?

37
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,885
And as a result,
the evil Piccolo was born.

38
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,720
But what a shame.

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,225
To think that he should divide the
uncanny power he was born with in half.

40
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:32,720
If he had become one, as he was
before, he may not have had to die.

41
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,567
Become one?

42
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:40,572
Well, I guess it would be all right.
Your desires are pure,

43
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,908
and the courage you have displayed
up to now is greatly esteemed.

44
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,912
I will give this Dragon Ball to you.

45
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,072
Terrific!

46
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,518
Thank you very much.

47
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:57,284
So this is a Dragon Ball from
the homeland. It sure is huge.

48
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:08,025
Things sure are slow, huh?

49
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:10,869
Is someone here!?

50
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:15,540
No, I'm bored, so I thought
I would do some training.

51
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,871
Oh...

52
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,213
Six more to go, huh?
I'll do my best.

53
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,550
Still, I doubt you will
have your wish granted.

54
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,552
Huh? Why not?

55
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:32,387
Unfortunately, my life will only
hold out for another few days.

56
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,229
Can you get the Balls that those
bad men have already gathered

57
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,231
away from them before then?

58
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:45,066
I would think that would be
impossible. Once I die...

59
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,514
...the Dragon Balls will also expire.

60
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,750
It's okay! That can't be helped!

61
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,186
For the time being, I will
guard this Ball with my life.

62
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:07,025
That's far better than allowing those guys
to gain eternal life, after all.

63
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:11,863
If you'd be so kind. I cannot guard it
anymore with the power I have left.

64
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,698
I will, for sure!

65
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:17,368
You have such outstanding power.

66
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:21,539
It's such a waste that you
still have power lying dormant.

67
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,207
Power lying dormant?

68
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:27,371
I will awaken that power for you.

69
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:33,384
I couldn't possibly
have any power left.

70
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,875
I've thoroughly trained
myself, after all.

71
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:43,216
I'm beyond my limits now as it is.

72
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:01,236
Please escape from
their clutches somehow.

73
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,247
My power... my power...

74
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:12,748
My power has shot up!
This is awesome!

75
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:19,764
I- I don't believe it!
It feels like I've been reborn!

76
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:21,755
Thank you so much!

77
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:25,536
Um...

78
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:31,876
Can you call forth anyone's power?
Say, even a little kid's?

79
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,945
As long as there is
dormant power within them,

80
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,214
it is possible,
whomever they may be.

81
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:40,551
I- it won't shorten your life
if you do it too much, will it?

82
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:46,224
All I do is provide the occasion.
It has nothing to do with my life.

83
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:50,161
C- could I bring another
one of my friends here?

84
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:54,165
I am positive that he has an incredible
amount of power lying dormant.

85
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:59,504
Bring him here. The more strong
just men we have, the better.

86
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:02,840
Right! I'll go bring him right now!

87
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,843
U- uh... as for this...

88
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:07,578
Please take it with you.

89
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:13,073
I am leaving the future of this world
and the universe to you.

90
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:21,526
Dende, wait here. I'll go get Gohan
and bring him right back here.

91
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,086
P- please be careful.

92
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:49,452
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>!

93
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:05,570
This is awesome! I can't believe
I had this kind of power within me!

94
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,903
I should be able to pick up
Gohan in a few hours like this!

95
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,447
H- how can this be!?

96
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:53,781
A village we haven't attacked
yet has been exterminated!

97
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:18,406
<i>lf I submerge the Dragon Ball here,</i>
<i>no one will be able to find it.</i>

98
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,742
<i>Whatever it takes, I have</i>
<i>to get that Dragon Ball...</i>

99
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,922
What happened?
Who overcame you?

100
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,592
A S- Saiyan... came for the Dragon Ball...

101
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,428
So it <i>was</i> Vegeta, was it?

102
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,919
T- the Dragon-

103
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,091
Know when it's time to die!

104
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:03,051
It couldn't be...

105
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:06,891
<i>Freeza-sama, it is Zarbon.</i>

106
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,722
Come in.

107
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,568
Has a village been located?

108
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:21,572
No, we have not discovered
any villages at this time,

109
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:25,076
but I have just come
from defeating Vegeta.

110
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:28,913
Oh, is that so?
Then Zarbon-<i>san</i>,

111
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,916
that means you transformed
for the first time in ages, yes?

112
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,917
Yes, sir.

113
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:36,254
So, Vegeta did die, then?

114
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:39,924
Well, I did not exactly
check for a body,

115
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:44,929
but even in the unlikely event that he
did survive, he must be gravely injured.

116
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:48,199
Why did you not verify
that he was dead?

117
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:53,204
W- well, Vegeta had been
submerged underwater, so...

118
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,206
You could have dove
into the water, no?

119
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:59,543
You were loathe to get yourself wet,
and neglected to check for his corpse.

120
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:04,548
And trying to kill him right away
was a rash thing to do in the first place.

121
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:09,220
What are we to do if Vegeta has hidden
a Dragon Ball from us somewhere?

122
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,557
I- I am terribly sorry!
I will go check on him at once!

123
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,226
Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

124
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,561
I have- I have discovered a village!

125
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:18,896
What?

126
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:22,233
However, the village
had already been destroyed.

127
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,901
What was that!?

128
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,904
I am afraid it was
the work of Vegeta.

129
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:29,573
Then he <i>has</i> hidden
a Dragon Ball somewhere!

130
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:34,067
There was one surviving villager,
but I disposed of him immediately.

131
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,750
You killed him, then?
The only witness we had?

132
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,081
Y- yes, sir...

133
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:51,529
The thing I hate most is when rash actions
are taken when there is insufficient data.

134
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,533
Be prepared to answer to me
as well if Vegeta is dead.

135
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,935
Bring Vegeta here at once.

136
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:01,539
This time, place your hopes
on the chance that he is still alive.

137
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,542
--Yes, sir!
--Appule!

138
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,710
Yes, sir?

139
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,879
You will contact Planet Freeza

140
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,217
and inform the Ginyu Special Corps
that they are to come here.

141
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:18,222
And of course, tell them
to bring Scouters with them.

142
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:20,891
They should arrive in five days.

143
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,552
Understood.

144
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,898
F- Freeza-<i>sama</i>, why
the Ginyu Special Corps?

145
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:28,899
Forgive me for saying so,

146
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,237
but I believe it is completely
unnecessary to call that group here.

147
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:36,574
I feel an odd foreboding.

148
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:39,577
H- how do you mean, foreboding?

149
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,246
I have been thinking this
for a little while now,

150
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:45,249
but it would seem that there is
a powerful Saiyan being brought up,

151
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,186
and in time, I feel
he will become my foe.

152
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:53,858
At first, I thought it was Vegeta,
but it does not appear to be.

153
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,528
A- are you sure you are not
making too much of it?

154
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:03,868
Aside from Vegeta, there is only
what's-his-name and his child, on Earth.

155
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:09,206
Their battle power is supposed to be
considerably lower than Vegeta's.

156
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:12,543
Are you telling me that my
foreboding is wrong?

157
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:13,878
N- no, sir.

158
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:17,548
Never mind that, I would like you
to hurry and bring Vegeta here.

159
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:18,879
Y- yes, sir!

160
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:27,713
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps...</i>

161
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,895
<i>The Saiyans do indeed</i>

162
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:34,899
<i>appear to have a fathomless</i>
<i>battle power ensconced within them.</i>

163
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,069
<i>Every time they do battle,</i>
<i>it rises greatly.</i>

164
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,906
<i>Naturally, there is no way</i>
<i>that it can stand against me,</i>

165
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:47,078
<i>but when considering the future,</i>
<i>l must nip it in the bud now.</i>

166
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,913
<i>lt would be problematic if one were</i>
<i>to become a</i> "<i>super</i>" <i>Saiyan, after all.</i>

167
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:16,533
That was some good sleep.
I wonder how long I've been asleep.

168
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,703
It's no use! I'm so exhausted,
I can't move at all!

169
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,381
D- damn it!

170
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:43,231
I- I am... not... about... to die!

171
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:57,848
W- what? To think that he'd still
be alive. He's one tough guy.

172
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:01,852
Then again, it's because of that
that <i>l'll</i> be spared this time around.

173
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:05,015
We're going to treat you.
You're one lucky guy.

174
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:22,873
Hey, listen, Gohan-<i>kun</i>,

175
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,534
look at this.

176
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:28,879
One of the Dragon Balls
has started moving.

177
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,549
It's coming straight this way.

178
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,552
Could that be Kuririn-<i>kun</i>?

179
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:37,888
I'm sure it is! He did it!

180
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:42,893
He must have met the Grand
Elder, and gotten his Ball.

181
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:49,230
J- just a moment. Then, what
exactly is this other one here?

182
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:55,839
These five here are probably
the ones that Freeza guy has, right?

183
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,177
But look, there's this one
over here all by itself.

184
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:04,079
Huh? You're right,
and it's close to here.

185
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:09,418
Let's see... that direction, right?

186
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:20,264
Ah! We told you that Vegeta
was attacking a village, remember?

187
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:22,095
It was in that direction!

188
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,769
B- but Vegeta isn't over there.

189
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,768
I can't sense his <i>Ki</i>.

190
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:43,119
I've got it! He attacked the village,
but was unable to find the Dragon Ball!

191
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:50,494
He figured it wasn't there,
and went off somewhere else.

192
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:55,833
Please let me borrow that Radar!
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

193
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:01,066
All right! Luck is turning
in our favor somewhat!

194
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,754
Good, good, now's our chance!

195
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:20,747
I don't sense any
formidable <i>Ki</i> nearby at all!

196
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:52,288
Who would have thought we'd ever
be treating the injuries of a traitor?

197
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:20,584
<i>The scramble for the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>was becoming more and more chaotic.</i>

198
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:24,748
<i>Who will be the one</i>
<i>that laughs last?</i>
