1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:04,576
My hometown, where I was born,
is a city surrounded by mountains -

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:09,386
neither too large nor too small,
neither too rural nor urban.

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,216
There's nothing special about it
to appeal to tourists.

4
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:15,156
I'm the middle of three children,

5
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,526
brought up by parents
neither rich nor poor

6
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:19,856
who didn't pay
much attention to me.

7
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:21,526
I'm a high school student

8
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,926
about to graduate from
just your normal girls' high school.

9
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:50,226
When I was darkness at that time

10
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:53,056
With trembling lips

11
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,156
In a corner of a room I cry

12
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,236
The more I struggle

13
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:04,066
The more this wound deepens

14
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,236
The broken promise hurt me

15
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,966
Nobody can save me

16
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,146
God, I have only one request

17
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,776
Stop tearing apart my love

18
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:22,126
I need your love

19
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:25,356
I'm a broken rose

20
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:28,296
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,466
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

22
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,236
I need your love

23
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:36,536
I'm a broken rose

24
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,476
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

25
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:43,436
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

26
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,406
I wanna need your love

27
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:49,646
I'm a broken rose

28
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,976
I wanna need your love

29
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:04,856
Tokyo?

30
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,206
Yeah. From next week.

31
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,966
It's not a business trip?

32
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:14,236
I'm being transferred.

33
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,546
The head office needs me
to go immediately.

34
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:19,806
- Give me a break.
- But...

35
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:22,376
I can't have this. But wait.

36
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,546
Tokyo is only two hours away
by bullet train.

37
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:27,816
Besides, I only see him
once in a while anyway.

38
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,686
It's gonna be lonely
not being able to see you, Nana.

39
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,726
I had lots of fun until now.
Thank you.

40
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:44,236
That happened on
the seventh month of 1999...

41
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,876
minus four months,

42
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:50,336
when the terrible Demon Lord
fell from the sky, aiming for me.

43
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:56,386
I knew that this love had no future.

44
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:01,756
But for it to end so suddenly...
so easily...

45
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,156
It's so stupid, I can't even cry about it.

46
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,926
But you ARE crying!

47
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,966
But... Jun-chan!

48
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,036
I warned you not to get involved.

49
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,406
Nothing good comes out of
a high school student involved in adultery.

50
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,666
Don't say adultery! Makes it sound
like lyrics to some country song!

51
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:20,766
Then prostitution?

52
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,706
I've never asked for as much
as a penny from Mr. Asano!

53
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:27,016
You idiot! You should've gotten
as much from him as you could.

54
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,206
So he did it with you and fled.

55
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:30,216
Jun-chan! Did it and fled?

56
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:32,546
I'm joking, Nana.

57
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,716
I know you were really serious
about that guy.

58
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,026
Jun-chan...

59
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:41,916
But from his perspective,
you were just an easy teenage girl.

60
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,156
Easy?! What makes you think
I'm easy?

61
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,956
Many older guys look at
all high school students as easy.

62
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,586
Mr. Asano's not one of them!

63
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,606
From a high school girl's perspective,

64
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,966
if he's wearing a suit,
he's one of the "many older guys."

65
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:56,436
Why is it that nothing
goes right for me?

66
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:58,806
It's my name, "Nana."
It's bad luck.

67
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,846
It means seven, the number that appears
in a Nostradamus prophecy,

68
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,376
so it's gotta be cursed.

69
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:04,486
No, even if your name
was "Eight,"

70
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,176
I'm sure he'd still go to Tokyo.

71
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,416
I've decided. I'm going.

72
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:08,506
Huh? To Tokyo?

73
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,186
No, to the beauty parlor that
just opened at the station.

74
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:12,126
I'm gonna change my hairdo
so the next time I fall in love,

75
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,526
I won't be looked at as
an easy teenage girl.

76
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,496
B-But we're graduating today,

77
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,326
so you'll no longer be looked at
as an easy high school girl.

78
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,356
No way! The graduation ceremonies
have started, Jun-chan!

79
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:20,666
Oh, no!

80
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,606
Thinking back, it would not be
an exaggeration to say

81
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:31,046
my high school years started with love
and ended with love.

82
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:35,416
I entered an all-girl high school believing
I'd never find a crush,

83
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,506
until I fell in love with Mr. Okamoto, the art
class teacher. It was love at first sight.

84
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,756
I joined the art club with Jun-chan,
my classmate and best friend.

85
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,456
He-heh!
That's well drawn.
I joined the art club with Jun-chan,
my classmate and best friend.

86
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,516
I joined the art club with Jun-chan,
my classmate and best friend.

87
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:44,556
Thanks to that,
I became fond of drawing pictures,

88
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,456
She's talented in drawing.
Thanks to that,
I became fond of drawing pictures,

89
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,016
Thanks to that,
I became fond of drawing pictures,

90
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,566
but one year later,
he moved to a different high school.

91
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:50,866
I even had my hair done
to resemble yours.
but one year later,
he moved to a different high school.

92
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:51,696
I even had my hair done
to resemble yours.

93
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,966
My next encounter was
fashionable Mr. Nakamura,

94
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,906
who was working at
the neighborhood video rental store.

95
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:58,406
One day, I built up the courage
to talk to him,

96
00:04:58,406 --> 00:04:59,906
Make me your girlfriend.
One day, I built up the courage
to talk to him,

97
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:00,676
Same hairstyle.
Make me your girlfriend.
One day, I built up the courage
to talk to him,

98
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,846
Same hairstyle.
Make me your girlfriend.
but he coldly brushed me aside.

99
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:02,046
but he coldly brushed me aside.

100
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:02,876
Miss Customer,
I cannot do that.
but he coldly brushed me aside.

101
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,466
Miss Customer,
I cannot do that.

102
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,916
Then it was cool Mr. Kawasaki,

103
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,436
a co-worker at the restaurant
I worked at part time.

104
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:10,546
And then the refreshing Mr. Yoshida
who delivered my pizza.

105
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:16,356
But despite all these encounters,
none of them ever led to a relationship.

106
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:19,396
I was convinced that
I wasn't attractive enough,

107
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:20,796
and went on a diet.

108
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,866
It wasn't long after
I was lecturing myself

109
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,886
to first get to know a person better
before falling in love, when...

110
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,906
That was the start of summer
during my senior year.

111
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,236
I finally met him.

112
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,946
Hey, what's the matter?
Are you all right?

113
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,876
Excuse me. I'm fine.

114
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,906
You face is very pale!

115
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,846
Takashi Asano, 29 years old.

116
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:56,256
Thinking back, he might've been using
a fake name and lying about his age.

117
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:57,986
It was love at first sight.

118
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,826
A diet?

119
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,656
Yes. That's why I've been getting
these dizzy spells.

120
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:06,406
There's no need for you
to go on a diet.

121
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,706
You're cute as you are.

122
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,136
I'm cute?

123
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,706
Do you come to
the movies alone often?

124
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:14,036
Yes! Um, I love movies.

125
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:16,916
And I really like going
to the movies on my own.

126
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,916
Sure. I understand.
It's the same for me.

127
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:23,086
But I wouldn't mind
going with you.

128
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,126
Well then, I should be going.

129
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:28,186
Since you seem to
be feeling better now.

130
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,196
Um, I'd like to return
the favor in some way.

131
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:31,956
Don't worry about it.

132
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,656
It's already late, so be careful
on your way home.

133
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,526
He's cool, he's kind,
and he's a gentleman.

134
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,096
He's perfect!

135
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,396
Um!

136
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:46,536
I'm working part time at
a restaurant near here.

137
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:48,616
I'd be thrilled if you would
drop by some time.

138
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,446
To thank you,
let me treat you to something.

139
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,926
Two weeks passed,
but he never came.

140
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,316
My longing for him kept getting stronger.

141
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,696
Then, on that one day,

142
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:06,896
when I left the restaurant
after finishing work...

143
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:11,036
He was outside waiting for me.
The moment I saw him standing there,

144
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,996
I fell so deeply in love, there was
no way my feelings could be stopped.

145
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:21,216
I noticed the ring on
his ring finger right away,

146
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,776
but decided to ignore it.

147
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:29,786
I was really in love with him
and I believed he loved me too.

148
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:36,386
But about the only thing I knew
about him was his cell number.

149
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:41,556
I didn't know where he lived
or where he worked.

150
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,106
We could only meet two,
three times a month,

151
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,676
and our dates would always
be the same.

152
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,146
A drive, then straight to the hotel -
a low risk course of being seen.

153
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:55,536
But like a fool,
I still convinced myself that he loved me.

154
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:01,186
If our relationship had continued,

155
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:04,486
I'm certain my youthful days
would've gone down the drain.

156
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,826
I've decided to think positively

157
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,916
and believe I was fortunate to have been
able to break up with him.

158
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:16,136
The local art school I'll be going to
starting this spring is coed,

159
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,306
so I'll be doing my best
with my studies

160
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,896
while keeping my expectations high
for a wonderful encounter.

161
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,706
Graduate representative, Nana Komatsu.

162
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:29,506
In other words you're here
to meet guys, right?

163
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,286
You're wrong, Jun-chan!

164
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,346
I'm here because
I seriously wanna study art!

165
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,446
That's good.

166
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,676
Because there's no way the guys would
be interested in you with that hair.

167
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:39,346
No way!

168
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:43,256
You know, there's one major thing
I realized.

169
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:46,096
The guys I liked have all
been older than me.

170
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,696
And that's major?

171
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:51,526
Perhaps things never went well
because they were older.

172
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:54,976
There are many guys in this school
who are the same age,

173
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:58,066
so we could have more in common,
opening the door to a love relationship.

174
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,446
She did come here to meet guys.

175
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,676
In any case, stay away
from love at first sight.

176
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,226
Our eyes met.

177
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,756
Me and that boy with pretty eyes.

178
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,656
What?

179
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,396
Why's he coming this way?!

180
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:21,626
Junko!

181
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:22,666
You're Junko, right?

182
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:24,596
Shoji?

183
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,926
That's right. It's me, Shoji!

184
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,306
You've got longer hair.
I didn't recognize you.

185
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:32,176
It's been so long.

186
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:34,406
Since we graduated junior high,
so three years?

187
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:38,276
So, what are you doing here?
What a drag.

188
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:42,486
Yet another noisy one?
Enough already!

189
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,116
Oh, your friend?

190
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:45,986
She's noisy?

191
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:50,356
A friend from high school,
but she's as noisy as it gets.

192
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:51,856
What's your name?

193
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,426
I'm Nana Komatsu.
Nice to meet you.

194
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,426
I'm Shoji Endo. A pleasure.

195
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:58,896
He's got a great smile!

196
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,576
I'm here with a friend
from high school, too.

197
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,906
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kyosuke Takakura.

198
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:08,446
He's good-looking too.

199
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:13,646
The start of a happy campus life.
Right, Jun-chan?

200
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,546
What's that about a campus life?

201
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:20,556
We're not university students,
just students of a specialty school.

202
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:23,326
I'm sorry. But not to worry.

203
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,686
I know, Jun-chan,
Shoji's your trump card.

204
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,796
I'll make sure not to take him
from you.

205
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:32,066
Trump card?
You're greatly misunderstanding something.

206
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:36,646
I'm just concerned about
your ever-worsening lack of fidelity.

207
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,576
Shoji is nothing more than
a friend to me.

208
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:43,186
Liar! If you were in the same class
with a good-looking guy like that,

209
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,976
there's no way you wouldn't
have a crush on him.

210
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,386
I'm not the same as you!

211
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,226
I had many guy friends back
in junior high,

212
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,656
but I didn't go around falling
in love with them.

213
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,456
Many guy friends? I see.

214
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,756
Come to think of it,
I've never had a guy friend. Why?

215
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:03,826
Because you see men as male species
rather than a fellow human being.

216
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,596
I see. That makes sense.
So I need to see them as human...

217
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:13,006
Okay, I've decided!
I'm becoming friends with Shoji!

218
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,136
Huh?

219
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,616
Is becoming friends something
you make a determination to do?

220
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,856
If I don't make that determination
to be friends,

221
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,486
I might fall in love with him.

222
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:27,886
Well, if you fall in love,
you just fall in love.

223
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,096
But in your case,

224
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:32,926
it might be good experience
to start as friends.

225
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,436
Thank you, Jun-chan!
I'll do my best!

226
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:37,536
Best at what?

227
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:41,996
Hello!

228
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,676
Oh, Shoji?

229
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:46,546
No!

230
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,416
- That'll be fine. Then come over.
- I don't hafta become excited.

231
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,646
- Nana's here, too.
- We're just friends.

232
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,316
Hello!

233
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:54,716
Thanks for having us.

234
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:57,586
Wow, such a cool room!

235
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,916
You've got it made, living on your own
even though you're from this city.

236
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:03,256
But my home is far from the school.

237
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:04,726
I live far from here, too.

238
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:07,596
You're just too lonely

239
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,436
to live away from your grandmother,
aren't you, Shoji?

240
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,926
Actually, that's true.

241
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,756
Where do you live, Mr. Takakura?

242
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,226
Close to here.

243
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:16,266
Where exactly?

244
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,766
Behind the convenience store.

245
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,776
- That is close. About a five-minute walk?
- Friends, friends...

246
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,886
You're really quiet, Nana.

247
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:26,776
I thought you were noisy.
Might you be the shy type?

248
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,386
No, that is not the issue here.

249
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:31,216
Oh no! What was that?
That's odd language to a friend.

250
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:35,786
Oh, perhaps you're nervous around guys
because you went to a girls' school.

251
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,496
It is definitely not that.

252
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,636
Nana had a boyfriend until recently.

253
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,656
Jun-chan!

254
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,336
What's wrong?

255
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:46,736
The more you tell them about yourself,
the quicker we get to know each other.

256
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,266
So, let's make a toast.

257
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:53,036
I see. They're guy friends,
so I should disclose more.

258
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,206
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

259
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,906
I should get drunk fast.
That way, I won't feel as nervous.

260
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:03,726
Then after that,
the next love at first sight

261
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,786
was "refreshing Mr. Yoshida,"
the pizza delivery guy.

262
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,116
- Refreshing Yoshida?
- But he was really refreshing!

263
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,486
His smile was totally refreshing!

264
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:12,526
Hey, keep it down, you two over there!
You've had too much to drink.

265
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:17,536
You know, I gained three kilos for him
because I kept ordering pizza.

266
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,136
Yeah?

267
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:21,036
But suddenly, maybe he quit his job,
he stopped coming.

268
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,136
I got fat for nothing!

269
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,076
That's funny!
Nana, you're the best!

270
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,736
Nana, don't drink anymore!

271
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,746
It's okay. She's amusing.

272
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,176
So, what's next? Who was next?

273
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:32,646
The next person was...

274
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,846
So there's still more?!

275
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,186
The next person was...

276
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,686
The man whose name I didn't know.

277
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,876
I thought I'd never see you again.

278
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:03,176
I never asked you your name.

279
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,656
Takashi Asano.

280
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:13,886
Stop.

281
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,086
That name can't be
his real name, anyway.

282
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:19,326
Nana?

283
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:20,786
Does she cry when she's drunk?

284
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,306
Hey, hey, what's the matter,
all of a sudden?

285
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:23,286
No!

286
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,166
Nana! Sorry, Shoji.
Don't worry about it.

287
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:27,736
Jun-chan!

288
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:30,006
Come on, Nana.
You had too much to drink.

289
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:35,646
Don't touch me!
You don't really love me.

290
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:38,246
Don't touch me.

291
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,416
Junko.

292
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:51,256
I should be getting back.

293
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,026
I don't wanna miss the last train.

294
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,566
Oh right, you live far from here.

295
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:59,536
Also, Kyosuke's fallen asleep.
You mind if I just leave him there?

296
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,436
No. I don't care.

297
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:03,366
Thanks. Bye.

298
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:05,866
You know, Shoji.

299
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,516
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

300
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,836
Have you fallen in love
with me, Junko?

301
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,516
What's with that face?!

302
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,316
I had five, maybe ten girlfriends easy
during high school!

303
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,386
I just happen to not have one right now.

304
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:24,156
I knew it. You came here today
to see Nana, didn't you?

305
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:29,226
But Nana hates me.
She said "no"...

306
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,106
I don't believe she does.

307
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:34,306
Her first words after seeing you that
first time were "adorable" and " cool guy."

308
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,436
She kept talking about you.

309
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:36,576
No way!

310
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,036
Well, good luck with her.

311
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:39,806
What's that supposed to mean?

312
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:51,786
Where am I?

313
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:55,126
My head hurts! What's this?

314
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,356
Oh, that's right,
I'm at Jun-chan's place.

315
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,726
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

316
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:04,436
Shoji and Kyosuke brought beer,
and we made a toast, and then...

317
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:08,206
I can't remember much
but I think we were having fun.

318
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:10,406
Oww!

319
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:13,306
But I stayed over
without calling home.

320
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:14,906
I'm in trouble.

321
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,686
Jun-chan, do you have something
for headaches?

322
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,956
Well, how should I put it,

323
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:29,396
we spent the night talking and found
that we really get along, and you know...

324
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:30,986
It just seemed like
the appropriate thing.

325
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,956
Why is she making excuses?

326
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:38,466
Well, I really liked Junko
from the moment I saw her.

327
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:40,496
Way to go, Kyosuke!

328
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:43,536
You said it!
Falling in love is not about logic!

329
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,946
Nana, you're the expert
on love at first sight, after all?

330
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:49,806
Huh? Expert? Why do you know?

331
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:51,906
Jun-chan, you gossip!

332
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,916
You told them yourself!
Don't you remember?!

333
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:54,946
No way!

334
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:57,546
Look at the time.

335
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:01,056
I'm going home to get changed
and then go to school.

336
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,556
Nana, you'll be late for class
if you go home now.

337
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:04,956
Want me to lend you
something to wear?

338
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:08,026
I told them? What did I tell them,
and how much detail?

339
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:11,736
Well, you started with Okamoto
the art class teacher,

340
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:14,406
then Nakamura of the video shop,
Kawasaki the cook

341
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,566
and Yoshida the pizza boy.

342
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,466
You were making a joke out of it all.

343
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:19,236
No way. I did that?

344
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,876
But Nana, I'm guessing

345
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:23,906
you still haven't been able
to forget Mr. Asano.

346
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,716
That's not true. I forgot about him.

347
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:28,516
If I'm making a joke outta him...

348
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:29,986
No, you cried.

349
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,756
When you started to talk about him,

350
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:37,096
you broke down in tears
and stopped talking.

351
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:42,926
Say, Nana, what about Shoji?
If you like him, I'll help.

352
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,766
Jun-chan, are you feeling bad
because you got together with Kyosuke?

353
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,276
That's not it.

354
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,206
Shoji is a really nice guy,

355
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:54,116
so I think he'd be loyal
to his girlfriend.

356
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:58,876
He'd treat you with great care, Nana.
I guarantee it.

357
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:00,716
Jun-chan!

358
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:04,386
If you were a guy, Jun-chan,
I'd definitely be your girlfriend.

359
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,116
No way! I seriously won't
wanna go out with you.

360
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:10,726
But it's all right. I was able to become
good friends with Shoji.

361
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:11,486
Huh?

362
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,726
Shoji's an important guy friend.

363
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,696
It would be a waste
to make him a mere boyfriend.

364
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,326
Mere boyfriend?

365
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,866
Junko! Nana!

366
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:21,976
Good morning!

367
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,776
Thank goodness,
you look fine today, Nana-chan.

368
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,136
I'm feeling super-fine.

369
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,046
I had a hangover headache

370
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,536
but with a little medication,
the pain's gone.

371
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:30,176
When did you go home, Shoji?

372
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,886
- She's taken charge of the conversation!
- I got on the last train.

373
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,356
I can't sleep unless
my grandma sings me a lullaby.

374
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:36,206
Really?!

375
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:37,746
Well, never mind.

376
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:41,296
A movie?

377
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,766
Yeah. You said that
you like movies, right?

378
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,186
If you're free this Sunday,
maybe we could catch a movie together...

379
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,126
No.

380
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,706
I prefer going to the movies
on my own.

381
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,606
Having a friend sit beside me
is so distracting.

382
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:57,036
Yes, I understand.

383
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:58,596
It's the same for me.

384
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,306
Ouch!

385
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,046
Infirmary

386
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,686
Infirmary
Won't you ever forgive me, Demon Lord?!

387
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,446
Won't you ever forgive me, Demon Lord?!

388
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,016
Demon Lord?

389
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:12,586
The lord of all fears.
I've been cursed.

390
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:13,746
What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,416
You were just clumsy.
Here, give me your hand.

392
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,496
- Ow, ow, ow, stop it!
- We've gotta do this.

393
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,496
- It's too painful!
- Or it'll get infected and hurt a lot more.

394
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:25,736
It will hurt more?

395
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,866
I'm guessing you still haven't
been able to forget Mr. Asano.

396
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,116
Not only can't I forget him,

397
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,576
it's like an infection spreading,
Jun-chan.

398
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,576
It gets worse as time goes by.

399
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,846
The more I look back on the memories,

400
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:46,616
the more I start thinking that
every move of his was a lie.

401
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,326
The pain's so bad,
I feel that I'm gonna faint.

402
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,986
At this rate, my body's gonna rot.

403
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:55,736
No way!

404
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,596
Calm down! Your hand will be okay.

405
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,536
The wound will heal quickly.

406
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:03,776
Thank you. You're so kind, Shoji.

407
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,666
Hey, don't mention it.

408
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,176
Yeah, maybe I'm a little kind.

409
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:12,976
Say, Shoji, what should I do
to heal a broken heart?

410
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:14,946
A broken heart?

411
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:19,116
I think the only way is
to find a new love!

412
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:20,186
What do you think?

413
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:22,756
I agree.

414
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,026
Nana...

415
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:28,956
Okay, I've decided!

416
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:32,826
Shoji, where in the city do
the fashionable young people hang out?

417
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:34,226
Young people?

418
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,706
Yes, youngsters not wearing
suits and stuff.

419
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,036
At the arcade, maybe?

420
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,616
No way. There are also kids
and older guys there.

421
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,836
And it's not at all fashionable.

422
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,606
Then maybe a club.

423
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:45,346
Bingo!

424
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:50,716
I will fall in love.

425
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:52,976
I'm gonna find new love.

426
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:56,786
I'll stop crying over a love
that has already vanished.

427
00:20:58,366 --> 00:20:59,456
I should fall in love.

428
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,166
I'll fall in love over and over again,

429
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,996
and throw this pathetic side
of me into darkness!

430
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:13,706
I reached into the sky

431
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:20,216
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

432
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:25,596
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

433
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:31,586
Like colorful balloons

434
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,696
I'm alone

435
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:37,426
My hand had no place to go

436
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:44,066
And gently you took it

437
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:45,246
Starless night

438
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:49,446
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

439
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:55,246
I want to feel your warmth

440
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,126
Tears are falling down

441
00:21:57,126 --> 00:22:01,216
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

442
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:07,726
Of your hand holding mine
