1
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:19,138
Who? Who is calling me?

2
00:00:55,317 --> 00:01:00,778
[Sakura and the mysterious magical book.]

3
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,019
Ah

4
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,429
It was this sound.

5
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,165
Sakura, breakfast is ready.

6
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:18,995
OK!

7
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,265
I’m Sakura Kinomoto.

8
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,540
A fourth grader at Tomoeda elementary.

9
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,110
My favorite subjects are PE and music.

10
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:27,980
My least favorite subject is math.

11
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,484
In short, a girl best known for her energy.

12
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:33,448
My family life is…

13
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:34,784
Good morning.

14
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,189
Why were you rampaging in your room?

15
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:39,885
I wasn’t rampaging.

16
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,859
Even so the stomping was noisy.

17
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,723
I was just walking normally.

18
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,559
Just from you walking

19
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,401
it sounds like a monster is stomping.

20
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,842
I’m not a monster!

21
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:57,702
This bully is my big brother Touya.

22
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,579
He is a junior in high school.

23
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:03,480
He goes to Seijou High
which is right next to my school.

24
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,914
He’s always picking on me.

25
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:07,820
Just because he is a little taller.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,248
I can’t stand it.

27
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,725
Someday

28
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:14,256
I’ll be as big as a utility pole…

29
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,031
I’ll stomp on him.

30
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,968
Getting along well as
always in the morning.

31
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,670
This is my father Fujitaka.

32
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:25,801
He is a college archaeology professor.

33
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,335
He is good at cooking and sewing.

34
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:30,742
I love him.

35
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:31,875
Here you go.

36
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:33,648
It looks delicious.

37
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,415
Thanks for the food.

38
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:37,382
This is my family.

39
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:39,317
What? My mother?

40
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,518
My mother passed away when
I was three years old.

41
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,456
But I’m not lonely.

42
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:45,916
I have my father,

43
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:47,395
and even though he is a bully

44
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:48,491
I have my brother.

45
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:49,788
Is it good?

46
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:50,826
Yeah.

47
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,290
Thanks.

48
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:53,833
You’re leaving already?

49
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:55,901
Morning practice for the soccer team.

50
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:57,000
See you later.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,770
I’m off.

52
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:00,208
Wait a moment.

53
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,108
Thanks for breakfast.

54
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:08,278
Are you done already?

55
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,279
Here is your lunch.

56
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,390
Where is my brother?

57
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:18,520
He left earlier.

58
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:19,586
Geeze.

59
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:20,987
Do you have club today?

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:21,819
Yes!

61
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:22,823
see you later.

62
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,189
Take care.

63
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,236
I wonder how far he went.

64
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,218
Ah, there he is.

65
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,255
Wait a second!

66
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,720
I thought you could
leave a little later?

67
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,124
But…

68
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,459
But my brother always

69
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,059
goes to school with him.

70
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:00,762
Ah, Yuki.

71
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:05,801
Good morning.

72
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:11,337
Hey.

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,305
Good morning, Touya.

74
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:14,840
Good morning, Sakura.

75
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:15,808
You’re up early.

76
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:16,808
Yes.

77
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,617
It’s because she ate
breakfast in five minutes.

78
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,287
You’re cheerful as always today,
Sakura-chan.

79
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,864
This is Yukito Tsukishiro.

80
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:36,999
He is a junior in high school,
in the same class as my brother.

81
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,101
He is such a kind, wonderful person

82
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:41,275
I can’t believe he is friends

83
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:44,143
with this barbaric brother of mine.

84
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:48,348
See you later, Sakura-chan.

85
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:54,946
Here already?

86
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,365
See you later.

87
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:11,934
Yukito-san.

88
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,565
He’s good.

89
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,937
Tomoyo-chan.

90
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:20,140
To give you a present in a parting wave.
He’s smooth.

91
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,380
Good morning, Tomoyo-chan.

92
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,008
Good morning,

93
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:26,284
Sakura-chan.

94
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,015
This is Tomoyo Daidouji,

95
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,419
my best friend.

96
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,692
She is intelligent, beautiful,

97
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:36,062
and the daughter of the president
of a big company.

98
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:39,189
You were so cute just now.

99
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:40,427
What?

100
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:44,327
You were clutching the candy
looking enthralled.

101
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,739
Umm, Tomoyo-chan.

102
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,335
I wish

103
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:50,405
I could have taken a video
or picture of it.

104
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,675
Are you listening?

105
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,382
Tomoyo-chan’s hobby
is taking pictures or videos,

106
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,514
and she takes a lot of me.

107
00:05:58,754 --> 00:05:59,652
Oh yeah!

108
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,249
I just bought a new video camera.

109
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,319
Please let me film you again.

110
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,590
OK,

111
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:06,292
but

112
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:07,960
shouldn’t you film something
more interesting than me?

113
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,354
There isn’t anything cuter

114
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:14,458
Or more interesting
than Sakura-chan.

115
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,303
I’ll bring the camera tomorrow.

116
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,810
I suppose Tomoyo-chan may be
a bit strange after all.

117
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,207
Opening the mouth into an O shape

118
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:29,015
a boy’s face became visible.

119
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:31,476
Surprised aren’t you?

120
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,849
I wonder if it is a magical tangerine?

121
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,882
I wonder if that was me.

122
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,824
What a cute picture, what is it?

123
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,061
Well then, Kinomoto.

124
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:46,492
Yes?

125
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:47,596
Please read on.

126
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:48,402
I’ll tell you later.

127
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:50,803
From line twenty.

128
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,140
I wonder if it is a magical tangerine?

129
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:56,407
After all a butterfly came from it.

130
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:01,342
Incredible.

131
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,311
That’s amazing Sakura-chan.

132
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:04,809
How cool!

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,914
Thank you Miss Kinomoto.

134
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,686
Next we will do toss practice.

135
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,252
Everybody get your baton ready.

136
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:13,561
OK!

137
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,166
That dream worries me after all.

138
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:26,135
I’ll talk to Tomoyo-chan about it later.

139
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:33,142
Yeah.

140
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,987
Sakura-chan is really athletic

141
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,655
and good with the baton…

142
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,659
But she gets like that sometimes too.

143
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:47,987
Yeah.

144
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:52,928
I’m home.

145
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:00,738
Ar?

146
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,779
I’ll be home at nine.

147
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,612
Dad is going to be late.

148
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,150
Ah…

149
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:21,818
Is somebody there?

150
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:35,609
Dad and my brother aren’t home now…

151
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:52,860
It’s coming from dad’s office.

152
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,655
What should I do? What if it is a thief?

153
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,556
I’ll peek in from the door.

154
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,536
If somebody is there I will call the police.

155
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,127
Oh…

156
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,097
Nobody here.

157
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,481
What?

158
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:18,775
Oh!

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,415
It’s that book.

160
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:34,692
Strange?

161
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,663
A card?

162
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:49,676
Win…

163
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,810
Umm…

164
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,017
Win… Windy.

165
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,451
What is this?

166
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,303
How ya doing?

167
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:57,740
Oh?

168
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,544
Thanks a lot for waking me up.

169
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,341
An Osaka accent?

170
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:06,779
This book was in Osaka for a long time

171
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:09,086
so the accent stuck.

172
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,224
Where are the batteries? The switch?

173
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:13,191
What are you doing?

174
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:14,186
Where is the voice coming from?

175
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,690
I’m not a toy!

176
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,931
I am the beast of the seal Cerberus,
who protects this book.

177
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,033
Cerberus?

178
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:22,162
Seal?

179
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:23,671
Cerberus?

180
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,038
Yes!

181
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,064
To make sure that the cards in this book

182
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,737
don’t do bad things

183
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:30,403
is my mission…

184
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:35,538
There are no cards!

185
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:39,251
Why? Why? Where did they go?

186
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:41,987
This?

187
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:46,321
Ah, this. This. This is it.

188
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,353
So, where are the other cards?

189
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,865
I read the windy.

190
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:52,724
Ya.

191
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,329
All of a sudden a wind came.

192
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:55,691
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,402
They all flew away.

194
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,229
I see.

195
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,309
What?!

196
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,241
Thanks for dinner.

197
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:12,811
Where are you taking that?

198
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:14,721
I’m going it eat it in my room while studying.

199
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,426
Well?

200
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:23,287
No good.

201
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,889
I can’t tell at all where the cards are.

202
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:28,196
Here.

203
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,502
That looks good.

204
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,407
The Clow Cards were in this book.

205
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,800
Clow Cards?

206
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:36,771
The Clow Cards.

207
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,007
When their seal is broken

208
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:42,109
chaos will spread in the world.

209
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,414
Those cards are special cards

210
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,617
made by a great magician

211
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:48,081
Clow Leed.

212
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,683
Each one is alive

213
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,524
and holds incredible power.

214
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:55,188
They all act as they like,

215
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:57,360
And normal people can do nothing
against them.

216
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,160
It is because of that
Clow himself made the book

217
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:03,164
and put me as the beast of the seal

218
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:04,766
on the cover.

219
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,970
Anyways,
we need to get back the cards.

220
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,070
So, I’ll have you help me.

221
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:14,645
Eh? Why do I have to?

222
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,449
You’re the one who
scattered the cards

223
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:18,710
with the wind magic.

224
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:22,652
But it’s your job

225
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:24,681
to make sure these cards
are sealed in right?

226
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,487
Well I just fell asleep for a bit.

227
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:28,489
For how long?

228
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,263
About thirty years.

229
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:32,766
Even so you call yourself
the beast of the seal?

230
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,433
A lot of stuff happens in life.

231
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:36,260
All right!

232
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,395
So that sound was snoring?

233
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,838
Anyways, since you opened
this book

234
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,634
it means you have some degree
of magical power.

235
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,511
What is your name?

236
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,076
Sakura.

237
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,380
OK Sakura, stand over there.

238
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:51,743
Eh?

239
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,518
Yeah!

240
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:58,951
Key of the seal…

241
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,763
There is one who wishes
the contract with you here.

242
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,129
The girl by the name Sakura.

243
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:10,136
Key, give power to the girl.

244
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,205
Release!

245
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,708
Sakura, take the rod.

246
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,381
All right!

247
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,959
It’s the birth of a Card Captor.

248
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:37,097
What?!

249
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,196
Impossible! Impossible!

250
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:41,898
It’s absolutely,
absolutely impossible.

251
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:43,601
Ahh, how fluffy.

252
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,266
It’s impossible for me to be a Card Captor.

253
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:49,967
Card Captor.

254
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:51,708
Hunter of the Clow Cards.

255
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,238
Doesn’t it sound cool?

256
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,645
I’m an ordinary elementary school kid.

257
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:58,014
Even if you tell me about chaos in the world…

258
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:01,481
I wonder who it was who
scattered the cards everywhere with this?

259
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,218
Who was it that was sleeping
without guarding the cards?

260
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,289
What an incredible wind.

261
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:14,663
Sakura!

262
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,304
What’s that?

263
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:22,506
It’s a Clow Card.

264
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:23,501
Ah?

265
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,278
That looks like the Fly card.

266
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:28,378
This is no time to be impressed,
can’t you hurry?

267
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,712
And do what?

268
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,481
Card Captor Sakura’s first job.

269
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:34,284
What?

270
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:43,923
Why in my pajamas?

271
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:46,061
Is that what the only Card Captor

272
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,263
in the world would say?

273
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,727
Something that big is impossible.

274
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,537
You trying to be cute?

275
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,558
Sakura, magic!

276
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:14,484
Eh?

277
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,091
The key, use it like I showed you earlier.

278
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:17,293
Key which hides the powers of dark…

279
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,900
Show your true power before me.

280
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:32,076
Under the contract Sakura commands you.

281
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,146
Release!

282
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,390
Listen Sakura,

283
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,817
the Fly card originates from the wind,

284
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:49,558
you should be able to catch it
with the Windy you have now.

285
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:51,532
I wonder.

286
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,291
Anyways, if we don’t get a little closer…

287
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:04,343
What should I do? It came at us.

288
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,974
Sakura, the Windy card.

289
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,649
Oh, no. Here it comes again.

290
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,182
Hurry and use the Windy card.

291
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,321
But like this…

292
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:22,629
It’s impossible.

293
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,931
Isn’t it a Card Captor’s job
to do something about that?

294
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:27,391
Something?

295
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:31,396
There may be something I can do.

296
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,601
What are you planning?

297
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,205
Sakura.

298
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,344
Sakura!

299
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:53,892
Wind

300
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,026
Please become the chains that bind.

301
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:04,237
Windy.

302
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,927
Return to your rightful form,

303
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,992
Clow Card.

304
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:54,011
You did great, Sakura.

305
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,948
I thought I would die.

306
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,127
Just what I would expect
from my chosen Card Captor.

307
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:04,630
I never said I would do it.

308
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,260
The more you experience in life

309
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:08,933
the better person you will become.

310
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:15,139
Well, you went through
all the trouble to capture it,

311
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,475
go ahead and hit it.

312
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,841
What can this do?

313
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:20,609
Well, just try it.

314
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,750
Fly.

315
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:35,761
Well? Feels pretty good right?

316
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:36,857
Yeah.

317
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,998
I’ll be counting on you from now on too,

318
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,358
Card Captor Sakura

319
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:42,894
Yeah.

320
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:44,836
Eh?

321
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:48,774
But I haven’t said I would do it.
