1
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,688
You're Senator Beriam's wife, right?

2
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,704
The order has been switched around.

3
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:17,746
Is that liquor?

4
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,666
Is that box that important to you?

5
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:28,131
There is one way
to keep the Rail Tracer from coming here.

6
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,943
No, um, you see, uh...

7
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:01,790
Um, how can I put this?

8
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:08,607
Yeah, let's, you know,
settle this peacefully, see? Okay?

9
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:12,384
It's okay, I know we can do it. Okay?

10
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:21,367
So... so...
just put the guns down, okay? Okay?

11
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,422
Please, I'm really scared here.

12
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:28,692
Right now, I don't have a penny
on me, so I'll have to apologize.

13
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,445
Put down your guns... put them down!

14
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:37,285
Hey, are you really sure this is the right guy?

15
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,411
He's supposed to be.

16
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:44,457
There's no mistaking the sword tattoo on his face.

17
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:48,211
I have to admit, he's worse than pathetic.

18
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,060
Hey.

19
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,658
W-What?

20
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,765
First, stop your crying.

21
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:56,344
I-I'm not... crying...

22
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,014
You <i>are</i> crying, aren't you?

23
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:02,892
I said I'm not crying!

24
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,102
Fine.

25
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:06,896
Listen here.

26
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:11,359
Unless you want your head ventilated,
tell me your name.

27
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,947
Slowly, and clearly.

28
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:21,161
J-Jacuzzi... Jacuzzi Splot.

29
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:39,179
It's here... I'm too late...

30
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,806
It's already caught up to us...

31
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,517
The Rail Tracer!

32
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,478
No way.

33
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,689
What is all this?

34
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,567
Nice... Donny...

35
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,127
Thank goodness you're both safe.

36
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:59,532
Thank goodness... really, thank goodness...

37
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,938
We're doing all right,

38
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:05,497
but Nick got captured by those black suit guys.

39
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,753
Oh, no!

40
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,839
This is bad! This is bad!

41
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,118
There was that
black-suited orchestra, remember?

42
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:21,012
It looks like they're
here pulling a train robbery.

43
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,617
We'll be sure to help Nick out of there later.

44
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,508
But never mind him, what happened here?

45
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,439
Oh, yeah! It's awful!

46
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:36,250
It's the Rail Tracer!
The Rail Tracer is here!

47
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,837
We have to hurry and get away from here,

48
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,989
or we'll be wiped out, too!

49
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:44,369
So somehow, we have to rescue Nick--

50
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,997
Shooting?

51
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,376
W-What is that?
What is that gunfire about?

52
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,282
What did they shoot? Is anyone dead?

53
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:57,132
Well? Well? Nice? Donny?

54
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,885
We have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here, now!

55
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,582
To think that the boss of the delinquents

56
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:05,918
that have been giving
those of us from the Russo Family

57
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,895
so much trouble was a pantywaist like you...

58
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:12,438
It's disheartening, isn't it, you bastard?!

59
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,012
You dare to run roughshod all over our turf,

60
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,070
so I was expecting someone more remarkable!

61
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:24,534
W-We're bad guys... that's for sure...

62
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,539
B-B-But...
when we first started selling booze--

63
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:35,003
you're the ones who killed eight of our men,

64
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,047
aren't you?

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,884
That's the natural order of things!

66
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,263
So... so we decided...

67
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,628
...that it was all-out war...

68
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,855
...with the Russo Family...

69
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:53,521
Would you quit your babbling?!

70
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,359
B-But if we run away...

71
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,777
everyone else...

72
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,783
Isaac-<i>san</i>, Miria-<i>san,</i>
Mary, Czes, all of them...

73
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,278
Let's all drive away those guys in black,

74
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:12,123
and the Rail Tracer!

75
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,292
Jacuzzi...

76
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,545
All of us, let's get them.

77
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,210
S-Stop!

78
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,470
Put down your guns, quick!

79
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,867
I don't want to kill
you, if I don't have to!

80
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,053
You mean, you don't
want to <i>be</i> killed, don't you?!

81
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,548
No! I don't want to kill you!

82
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:38,968
So, Donny, wait a little longer! Please!

83
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,972
I'm sure these men are
going to put down their guns!

84
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,947
What the hell are you talking--

85
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,973
What are you two doing?!
Shoot him now! Kill him!

86
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,356
How are you feeling?

87
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,821
Run!

88
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,624
I told them, didn't I?!

89
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,550
You...

90
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,553
Barnes-<i>san...</i>

91
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,592
Ennis, why didn't you kill him?

92
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:06,598
Sir, I didn't think it would hurt to wait
until we confirmed what happened first.

93
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,348
Do not employ sophistry.

94
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,188
You are a homunculus that I created.

95
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:14,912
You should be able to kill someone
without any hesitation.

96
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,068
Gentlemen, behold the miserable Barnes.

97
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,238
Why did this man set the fire?

98
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,227
What did he do with the finished product?

99
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:29,237
Gentlemen, will you tolerate any excuses
from the man who lost the medicine

100
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:33,056
that was to have released you
from the terror of growing old?

101
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,462
I will not.

102
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:39,632
But we must pinpoint
the location of the finished product.

103
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,397
What shall we do?

104
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,552
There is one method...

105
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:47,308
A method that you all know well.

106
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,182
--He doesn't mean...
--He couldn't...

107
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:51,032
Barnes's intelligence...

108
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:54,728
Barnes's experiences, Barnes's entire life--

109
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:57,080
there is a way to make them my own!

110
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,082
S-Szilard-<i>sama</i>!

111
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,125
I do this...

112
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,993
Gentlemen, rejoice!

113
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,568
Barnes was apparently
successful in getting two bottles

114
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:42,291
of the finished product
out from the site of the fire.

115
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,003
Although, they appear to have been taken.

116
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,256
Oh, no...

117
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,368
I know the faces of those who took them.

118
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:53,872
With luck, we will be able to get them back.

119
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:54,958
Ennis...

120
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,027
Yes?

121
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,016
There's a man who seems
to be seeking you, as well.

122
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,520
I will tell you about him now.

123
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:17,648
Ennis...

124
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,534
Yes?

125
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,038
Find that group of four first.

126
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,290
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:46,928
Yes... Yes... Well, we're
doing everything we can...

128
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,525
Yes... I'm terribly sorry.

129
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,308
I thought I told you to
find him as soon as possible.

130
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,558
If you don't find Dallas Genoard,

131
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:58,618
it's going to be your neck in the noose.

132
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:03,122
No matter what-- no matter what,
I'll find him, you'll see!

133
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:06,334
I pray those are not just empty words.

134
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,368
You dumbasses!

135
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:17,678
I'm losing face because
you guys are so undependable!

136
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,723
What about that newspaper outfit?!

137
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:25,632
They only have vague
information on Dallas Genoard.

138
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,298
Vague, you say?

139
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,190
That's all the information
we could get them to sell us.

140
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,268
I'm going over there.

141
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:38,616
A lousy newspaper house looks
down on us, all thanks to you guys.

142
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,622
That damned newspaper outfit...

143
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,708
They're definitely hiding something.

144
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:58,302
He's an incompetent man,
perfectly expendable.

145
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,292
Remember, this has to be done quietly.

146
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:05,685
But how is it that a common
juvenile delinquent has an immortal body?

147
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,672
He was supposedly given
some of the unfinished product.

148
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:13,075
He doesn't suffer the influence of
any physical harm, but as for aging...

149
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:14,735
It still has hold.

150
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,988
In other words, no perpetual youth.

151
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,812
What we are pursuing is
complicated, inscrutable, and dubious.

152
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,978
But if I can get my hands on it,

153
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,108
I am promised unprecedented happiness.

154
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:28,666
For that...

155
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,421
...I would not mind losing my soul.

156
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,259
Huey Laforet is in prison.

157
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,762
I can get the jump on him if I move now.

158
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:01,268
Firo Prochainezo, can
you answer the questions

159
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:04,410
I am about to pose to
you honestly and truthfully?

160
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,536
Yes.

161
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:08,914
Do you wish to become a Camorrista?

162
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,153
Yes.

163
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:13,988
The Camorra is an organization
that was born in the prisons

164
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:16,005
of our faraway mother country of Italy.

165
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,828
If you choose to step forward,
there will be times

166
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:22,720
when you will have your freedom
taken from you by imprisonment.

167
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:27,475
You could even lose your life at the end of
what might be termed messy fighting.

168
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,247
Do you understand that?

169
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:31,062
Yes.

170
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:34,008
Your right foot will be in a prison,

171
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:36,802
and your left foot will be in a coffin.

172
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:40,598
Even so, do you wish to
keep your eye on your own path,

173
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:44,075
while at times taking hold
of honor in your right hand?

174
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,284
Yes.

175
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,772
If it is required by us,

176
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:51,930
are you able to take your
own life with your left hand?

177
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,958
Yes.

178
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,658
When your father kills one of us,

179
00:13:56,658 --> 00:14:01,217
will you be able to kill your father,
and exact vengeance for us?

180
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:04,220
Yes.

181
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,722
Firo...

182
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,342
You can still turn back.

183
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:19,276
You, who have lived a life of being used,
will turn to the side that uses others.

184
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,768
You will be no more than
a small part of this secret society,

185
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:26,268
but you will still begin to work the gears.

186
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:29,370
Once you do, you cannot go back.

187
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,902
To be honest, knowing you,

188
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:36,585
I think that you could do plenty well
for yourself in legitimate ways.

189
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,463
You have the means to do so.

190
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,177
Firo Prochainezo, do you still
want to set foot onto this path?

191
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,055
Yes, I have made my resolve.

192
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,060
I see. Then, show us your resolve.

193
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,972
All right, we're going to go look for Jacuzzi!

194
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,478
We're off!

195
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:05,978
We'll find Nice, too!

196
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,199
It's a rescue!

197
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,648
I'm not at all sure what was going on,
what with the black suits,

198
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,232
and the white suits, and that
strange fellow holding a knife,

199
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:17,822
but I'm going to threaten them with my guns,
and then we'll use that chance to escape!

200
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,783
Incredible!

201
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,328
Listen to me, Mary.

202
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:24,345
You and Czes-<i>kun</i> go hide someplace safe.

203
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,748
It's all right. I'm sure that by tomorrow,

204
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:30,014
your father will be coming to rescue us.

205
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,726
Czes-<i>kun</i>, you take care of Mary, okay?

206
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,978
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

207
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,911
Good evening.
You are Senator Beriam's wife, correct?

208
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,858
My name is Guth.

209
00:15:55,858 --> 00:16:01,072
There is a very special matter that
we would like your husband to help us with.

210
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,922
Would you please come with us?

211
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,748
Please promise me that
you will not harm the other passengers.

212
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,555
That will all depend on the response we get
from your husband and the government.

213
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,478
Welcome!

214
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,592
There's something I want to ask you.

215
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:23,178
Well, well, it's Gustavo-<i>sama,</i>
from the Runorata Family.

216
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,570
It is a great honor for one of
the capos to come in, personally.

217
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,547
You know who I am?

218
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:33,438
Yes, there isn't anything that we do not know.

219
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,188
Then this will be quick.

220
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,390
I understand that you took a contemptible
attitude toward some of my young men.

221
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,477
A contemptible attitude? Not at all!

222
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:47,132
We always provide our customers
with the best service we possibly--

223
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:59,218
Why don't you come out and tell me
where that dirty brat Genoard is!

224
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,048
J-Just a moment...

225
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,758
Unless you want an early death,
tell me what you know!

226
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:06,777
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you, just let me go!

227
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,348
Don't make me mad.

228
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,826
Now tell me! Where is Dallas Genoard?!

229
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:18,914
I don't know anything more than
what I already told your men earlier.

230
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,032
However, I can't say that I don't
have any incidental information.

231
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:27,339
Whatever you've got, tell me!

232
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,302
The Gandor Family is also after Dallas.

233
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,053
The Gandors?

234
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,458
Why might that be? Hmm?

235
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,477
Would it be a bad thing
if the Gandors were to find Dallas first?

236
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:44,315
Tell me how to get the jump on the Gandors.

237
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,308
Dallas Genoard has a younger sister.

238
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:52,392
A sister he treats very dearly,
considering the ne'er-do-well that he is.

239
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:53,427
Go on.

240
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:57,202
She would make for some fine bait
to reel Dallas in, wouldn't she?

241
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,042
There are no hard feelings
between you two, right?

242
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:21,548
If you stab your opponent in the chest,
I will kill you on the spot.

243
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,896
Is that clear, both of you?

244
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,696
Very well, you may begin.

245
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,363
Gentlemen, the match is over.

246
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,062
That was amazing, Firo!

247
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:22,621
Imagine, besting Maiza like that!

248
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,068
Oh, no, I even surprised myself.

249
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:27,658
Congratulations, Firo.

250
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,044
Maiza-<i>san...</i>

251
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,003
Your arm...

252
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,828
You've gotten better!

253
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:39,418
I've been an observer for many years,

254
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:43,338
but you're the first capo candidate
that has ever beaten Maiza!

255
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:45,275
There is nothing more to say.

256
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:49,106
You will be a superb Camorrista, Firo.

257
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,108
Yes, sir.

258
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:56,864
To celebrate the birth of a new capo,
I will fire the ceremonial gun.

259
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,581
Isaac has been killed!

260
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,083
Where is your daughter?

261
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,711
What is the matter?

262
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,790
She's been taken away,

263
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,305
by those men in the white suits.

264
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:17,498
Who are they?

265
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,975
I don't know.

266
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:22,042
They seemed to be looking for us, as well,

267
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,668
but they only took my daughter.

268
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,252
I sympathize with you.

269
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:28,896
For now, will you please
come with us to our room?

270
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,315
Excuse me.

271
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,608
Who opened this window?

272
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,778
T-The woman wearing
fatigues who was sitting there!

273
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:51,278
A woman wearing fatigues?

274
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:56,368
Yes! When the shootout started,
s-she opened it and went outside.

275
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:58,217
I-It's the truth!

276
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,368
It's from Comrade Guth.

277
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:41,662
He says to find a woman wearing fatigues.

278
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:44,054
A woman in fatigues?

279
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,588
We're going to go have a look around.

280
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,850
Keep an eye on things here.

281
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,451
What's the matter?

282
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,204
Hey, where's George?

283
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,791
H-He's gone...

284
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,084
Huh?

285
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:19,047
He's gone! When I turned
around, he wasn't there anymore!

286
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:07,501
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

287
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:21,724
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

288
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:33,232
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

289
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:40,282
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

290
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:47,372
<i>I believe so</i>

291
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:54,462
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

292
00:23:54,462 --> 00:24:01,928
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

293
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:08,642
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

294
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:18,698
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

295
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,975
<i>Miria, it's the Rail Tracer</i>!

296
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,051
<i>How scary</i>!

297
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,721
<i>It says it slaughters covertly</i>!

298
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,764
<i>That means it's sneaking</i>
<i>around killing everyone,</i>

299
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,601
<i>again and again, right?</i>

300
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,128
<i>That's amazing, Miria.</i>

301
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:38,061
<i>But what could that</i>
<i>"inside the coaches"part mean?</i>

302
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,022
<i>I'm scared</i>!
