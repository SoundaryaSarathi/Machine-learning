1
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:10,866
Today is the Tomoeda school athletic meet

2
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:12,706
There are kids

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,735
who seem to hate the athletic meet
because it is a pain

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,775
But I love it

5
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,185
[Sakura and the flowery athletic meet]

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,614
Sakura-chan, you really are fast

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,023
Thanks Rika-chan

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,360
Yukito-san!

9
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:40,291
You really are a fast runner

10
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:42,932
It’s because she has no other merits

11
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,844
This is lunch? It’s huge

12
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,139
I made it along with Touya

13
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,945
Dad says he’ll come right after his seminar

14
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:57,579
at the college

15
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:00,347
There is no helping it if he has work

16
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:04,422
My dad teaches archaeology at a college

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,421
He doesn’t just lecture.

18
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:07,954
He goes to excavations

19
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,421
and holds research seminars,
so he is very busy

20
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:14,495
In the afternoon there is a 100 meter
race for parents to participate in

21
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,261
It would be nice if
he made it for that

22
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:18,839
Yes

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,306
Members of the cheer leading club
please gather at the entrance to the grounds

24
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:25,071
Ah, it’s Tomoyo-chan’s voice

25
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,310
I repeat,

26
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:29,709
members of the cheer leading club
gather at the entrance to the grounds

27
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:30,714
Are you in that too?

28
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,449
Yes

29
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,244
I’ll take lots of photos

30
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,947
Take a picture of Yukito-san afterwards

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,953
Make sure to do it

32
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,190
Yeah, yeah

33
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:46,528
That 4th grader Kinomoto is a fast runner

34
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,529
Nobody can seem to beat her

35
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:51,668
Sakura-chan isn’t just a fast runner.

36
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,529
She is also very cute

37
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:54,770
Tomoyo-chan!

38
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,503
Sakura-chan!

39
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:01,240
Is that your outfit for this event?

40
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:02,341
Yeah

41
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:03,411
It’s wonderful

42
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:05,516
But if it had frills at the neck

43
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,977
and a big ribbon.

44
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:09,549
Your mom isn’t here yet?

45
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,690
She had a company meeting

46
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:14,560
and said she would rush here right after

47
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:19,363
Tomoyo-chan’s mother is the president
of a big toy company

48
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,930
Tomoyo-chan’s mother is really busy,

49
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,234
and there are days when
she can’t see her daughter

50
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,108
I also haven’t met Tomoyo-chan’s mother

51
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:29,871
So I’m looking forward to it

52
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:31,542
Now that I think about it,

53
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:34,244
Tomoyo-chan never talks
about her father

54
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,212
I have to go, please watch

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,987
I’ll be cheering for you from here

56
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:42,846
She really is cute

57
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:44,422
Yes.

58
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,017
You’re right

59
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,724
Well then, all set!

60
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:49,857
I must capture Sakura-chan’s exploits

61
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,061
on video!

62
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:08,806
Sakura-chan has gotten good

63
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:10,809
Well, if you compare her to before

64
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,943
When she joined the club

65
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,821
every time she threw the baton

66
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,020
she would catch it with her head

67
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,058
See

68
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:25,557
Next is the last morning event

69
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,992
The fourth grade obstacle course

70
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,494
Everybody please cheer

71
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:33,566
for the competitors

72
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:35,638
as they pass many barriers

73
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:38,208
Sakura-chan, good luck!

74
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,045
Sakura-chan!

75
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:48,213
Good luck!

76
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,850
Take your places

77
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:53,493
Good luck!

78
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:03,200
I won’t lose

79
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:04,666
Me too

80
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,165
Ready!

81
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,776
It’s down to just Sakura-chan and Lee-kun

82
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:51,582
Go for it!

83
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:00,553
Alright!

84
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,891
Your mom isn’t here yet?

85
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,525
Yeah, but I think she’ll be here soon

86
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,933
Then have lunch with us

87
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:13,703
May I? I’d be intruding on your family

88
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,632
Of course you can. The food would taste better
if we all ate together.

89
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:19,337
Thank you

90
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:21,745
Lee-kun

91
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:26,277
Do you want to have lunch with us too?

92
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:29,919
Why with you?

93
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,086
Sakura-chan!

94
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,986
We’re ready with lunch

95
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:35,418
OK!

96
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,192
I’ll eat with you

97
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,093
Eh?

98
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,646
Here, the egg is delicious

99
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,641
Your brother

100
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,609
and Tsukishiro-san made it?

101
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,485
It looks really good

102
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,954
Strange?

103
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,102
Ah, I’m sorry I was eating everything

104
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,868
No, it’s good to eat a lot

105
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,638
The lunch was just so good

106
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,711
When your food tastes good,

107
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:34,083
that is proof of good health

108
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:35,716
That’s right

109
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,286
Thanks for the food

110
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:52,696
Sorry I’m late

111
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,037
Dad!

112
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,376
Ah, I missed the cheerleading
club’s performance

113
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:01,043
I took a video of it

114
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,378
I also took a lot of pictures

115
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,476
Thank you

116
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:07,683
Sorry, Sakura

117
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:10,588
No, I am happy you ran to get here

118
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,589
I made these yesterday

119
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,592
I cooled them with the university refrigerator

120
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:18,895
It should be cold

121
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:27,706
Say, do we have some of this gelatin left?

122
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,932
There is some in the refrigerator at home

123
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:33,039
I’ll let Kero-chan have some when we get home

124
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:36,112
I’ll go throw away the trash

125
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,544
I’ll go too

126
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:38,849
Me too

127
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:44,281
Lee-kun missed out on the delicious gelatin

128
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:45,982
Tomoyo

129
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:48,891
Mother

130
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,023
What a beautiful person

131
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,994
Sakura-chan, let me introduce you

132
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,701
This is my mom

133
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:57,696
Eh!

134
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:07,679
I’m sorry, I’m Sonomi Daidouji

135
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,280
Thank you for always being
friends with Tomoyo

136
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:14,786
Not at all, she is always helping me out

137
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:16,956
You really are cute

138
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,221
You look a lot like a girl I once knew

139
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,663
I have heard a lot about from Tomoyo,

140
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:31,695
but I haven’t heard your last name.

141
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,733
Can you tell me?

142
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,639
Umm, it’s Kino

143
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:36,534
Sakura

144
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:37,502
Dad

145
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,678
Kinomoto-sensei!

146
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,777
Sonomi-kun

147
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,825
I never noticed because
the last name was different

148
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:59,465
When you were a student
it was Sonomi Amamiya

149
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,329
Sakura I should have known from the name

150
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,065
Nadeshiko said

151
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,134
she would give that name if she had a girl

152
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:13,877
I absolutely won’t forgive you

153
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:17,779
At that time Nadeshiko
was still a high school student,

154
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,818
and I had just become a teacher

155
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,381
Yes!

156
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,958
Even as a trusted teacher
you married a student,

157
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,661
and my precious Nadeshiko

158
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:30,123
Excuse me

159
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,598
I was looking over Nadeshiko

160
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,657
ever since kindergarten

161
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,099
So that she wouldn’t
attract any idiotic bugs

162
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,065
Even so,

163
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:41,999
for her to attract
such a dim witted bug

164
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,075
How can you be so cheerful

165
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,613
when you let Nadeshiko
die at only 27 years old

166
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:49,979
Because I promised not to cry

167
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,717
To Nadeshiko

168
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,353
Nevertheless, I won’t forgive you

169
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,728
Dad and Tomoyo’s mom knew each other

170
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:15,000
Parents participating in the 100 meter race

171
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,775
please gather at the grounds entrance

172
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:20,108
Sorry to keep you waiting

173
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:21,138
Dad,

174
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,015
you are taking part in the
100 meter race right?

175
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,617
Shall I go instead?

176
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:26,517
It’s OK.

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,650
I was ordered to take part by Sonomi-san

178
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:31,955
Where is the grounds entrance?

179
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:33,657
Over here

180
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,689
Should I ask the reason?

181
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,460
Or am I better off not knowing?

182
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,228
Sonomi

183
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,127
used to be Sonomi Amamiya

184
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,968
Huh?
Amamiya is your mother’s maiden name

185
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,071
Yes,

186
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:51,874
she was Sonomi’s cousin

187
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,211
My mom was the lone daughter
of a famous company president

188
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,913
Dad had just become a teacher

189
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,942
Even though they knew it would be tough,

190
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,217
my mother got married when she was sixteen

191
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,824
She worked as a model while going to school

192
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:09,591
That wasn’t the reason she got ill,

193
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,355
but there were various issues
with my mom’s parents

194
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,564
Sonomi cared a lot for my mom
since they were little,

195
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,870
and I heard she was the person
most against her marrying my dad

196
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:24,472
But in the pictures of
Nadeshiko at your place,

197
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,435
even the ones not from magazines,

198
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,111
she always looked happy

199
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:34,353
Even so, there are a lot of
flowers out today

200
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:38,589
My mom and your dad seem to
have known each other

201
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:39,850
Yeah

202
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,426
Huh, Tomoyo-chan

203
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,831
What? Mother?

204
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:50,301
Was your mother planning on participating?

205
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:51,636
No

206
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,599
Is your mom a fast runner?

207
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:57,600
I think when she was in high school
she was on the national team

208
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:58,573
Eh!

209
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:02,408
I absolutely won’t lose

210
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,815
Ready!

211
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,882
Good luck! Good luck!

212
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,052
Eh!

213
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:15,452
Your dad is amazing

214
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:16,692
He is fast

215
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:18,993
The most athletic one in our family

216
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,457
is our dad

217
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,467
Where are these flowers blowing in from?

218
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,377
We can’t see anything like this

219
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,138
Could it be a Clow Card?

220
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,418
It’s a Clow Card

221
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,013
Lee-kun, where are you going?

222
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,817
Where? Something terrible is happening

223
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:47,791
Really

224
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,490
It is in times like this we must remain calm

225
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,031
We have to take care of
first aid in the afternoon

226
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,861
Hey, wait!

227
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,728
Oh no you don’t We have to be ready

228
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,437
to help somebody if they get hurt

229
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:06,307
Let go! The Clow Card

230
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:14,517
They’re running

231
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,580
Mother hates to lose

232
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:23,429
I can’t move

233
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,065
We’ll drown in flowers

234
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,033
Are you going to use magic here?

235
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,197
Nobody is looking

236
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:40,169
Key which hides the power of darkness

237
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,312
Display your true form before me

238
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,350
Under the contract, I Sakura command you

239
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:51,085
Release!

240
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:06,205
Fly

241
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,445
I wonder if it really
is the work of a Clow Card

242
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:22,154
It is best to ask an expert
in times like this

243
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,754
Where were you carrying that?

244
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:27,752
Right now! Cerberus super special!

245
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,059
My sure kill technique!

246
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,499
What is it? I am sunk into sadness now

247
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,133
Kero-chan, big trouble!

248
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:42,173
No mistake, that is
the work of a Clow Card

249
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:46,605
So it is The school
is full of flowers already

250
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:52,213
For the time being, check out carefully
where the flowers are flying from

251
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:56,447
Eh!

252
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,256
Over there

253
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:04,057
I absolutely won’t lose

254
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,028
Somebody

255
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,062
help me!

256
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:12,804
I’ll be buried

257
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:14,964
Hurry and move to a higher place

258
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:16,974
We’ll hold this

259
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:23,708
Over there

260
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:25,716
Sakura-chan

261
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,434
Sakura-chan

262
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,866
You’re a Clow Card right?

263
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:54,012
Eh?

264
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,039
How are thing going over there?

265
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:00,209
This has gotten serious

266
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:04,747
Sakura-chan was suddenly invited to dance

267
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,156
It is a girl with curly hair right?

268
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:08,219
Yes

269
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:11,423
No problem, she loves fun things

270
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:13,894
What’s going on?

271
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,232
Sakura-chan, if you don’t hurry
and stop the flowers,

272
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,160
the school will be buried

273
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,835
Return to your rightful form

274
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,298
Flower?

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,031
Yep, it’s the Flower card

276
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:50,960
Your school was having
an athletic meet wasn’t it?

277
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:54,338
Flower gets happy when there is
fun or celebrations going on

278
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:55,865
Huh?

279
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,641
She was probably thinking
to add to things with flowers

280
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:03,173
So what can this card do?

281
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,651
It can put forth various types of flowers

282
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,049
That’s it?

283
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:10,622
Well, you got away without
any danger this time didn’t you?

284
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,423
We were almost suffocated by flower petals

285
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,188
Oh!

286
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:15,758
What’s wrong?

287
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,154
I forgot to take a video

288
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:23,033
Congratulations

289
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,237
What, Tsukishiro-kun and Touya?

290
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,815
With this much we could
make a lot of tea

291
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,850
Why do I have to clean after
coming to an athletic meet?

292
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,219
I hate this I hate this I hate this

293
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,919
It has been like this ever since high school

294
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,694
Because I didn’t want to let you have Nadeshiko

295
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,194
I challenged you countless times

296
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,301
But I always lose

297
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,393
It would be rude to you

298
00:17:58,838 --> 00:17:59,736
if I lost on purpose

299
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,302
Because I knew

300
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:05,473
how much you cared for Nadeshiko

301
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:08,646
So I always tried my hardest

302
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:12,075
I remember it even now,
the house you moved into with her

303
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:14,352
Living together in that tiny apartment

304
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:17,450
Going to school with her even
though you were a new teacher

305
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,753
You made Nadeshiko’s lunch every day
didn’t you?

306
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,653
Both of you with the same lunch,

307
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,930
and then going home holding hands

308
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,734
It looks like they are
quarrelling over something

309
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:30,566
Sakura-chan

310
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:32,735
But

311
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:33,766
It’s OK

312
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,569
Flower. Bestow flowers upon those two

313
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,537
Why are you good at cooking anyway?

314
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:52,822
A nadeshiko flower

315
00:18:57,297 --> 00:19:01,393
Nadeshiko was always entwined
with you With a smile

316
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,133
Even though I was really angry

317
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,200
she would just break down my anger

318
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,232
With her light attitude

319
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,903
She was spontaneous from the core

320
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:13,004
She certainly was a wholehearted person

321
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,173
I loved Nadeshiko the most

322
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,084
Nadeshiko loved you too

323
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:21,750
But

324
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:31,295
Nadeshiko seemed so happy
Ever since she married you

325
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:32,395
She smiled with

326
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,297
Her best face ever

327
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:39,996
How could she leave so soon
when she was so happy

328
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,136
I’m sorry

329
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,335
Why do you apologize?

330
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,903
I took all the time with Nadeshiko

331
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:48,942
from when she was 16 until 27 she was

332
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,044
That is what I hate about you

333
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,815
It must have been my mother

334
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:56,553
who was the girl I resemble

335
00:19:57,824 --> 00:19:59,519
My mom often talked about

336
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:01,292
her cousin named Nadeshiko

337
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,193
It was because she wanted to have
it the same as Nadeshiko’s that

338
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:07,362
my hair was grown out like this

339
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,594
I guess lots of things have
happened to our parents

340
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,804
I wonder if he will tell me
about it sometime

341
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,629
Yes, I’m sure he will

342
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,268
But it seems your mom

343
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,076
She really loved my mom

344
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,714
Oh, but I love you too

345
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:25,885
Me too

346
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,944
Hey! It’s just about time
for the closing ceremony

347
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:30,318
OK!

348
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:32,488
Let’s go, Tomoyo-chan

349
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:33,650
Yes
