1
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,710
I'm heading out.

2
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,460
It's been a week since Hiromi moved out to live alone in an apartment.

3
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,970
After her suspension ended, Hiromi started going to school again.

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,420
As for me,

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,660
things aren't going very well.

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,300
I haven't seen Noe since that time.

7
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,620
Yes, thank you very much.

8
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,320
Yup, we will prepare three dozen right away.

9
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,590
Yes, thank you.

10
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,120
Boss, how many cases of Mugiha wine did we have again?

11
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,230
We have four cases.

12
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,050
Got it!

13
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,180
Doesn't it seem like demand is pretty good this year?

14
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,510
Yeah, we've made around 20% more sales compared to last year's festival.

15
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,980
What do you think? It's quite a nice room, right?

16
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,500
Yeah. It's close to my house too, isn't that nice?

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,730
Yup.

18
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,470
The festival's in three days.

19
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,930
Are you really going to have the inter-school match?

20
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,410
They said we should play a game to show the rookies.

21
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,770
The opponent is Hotarugawa, right?

22
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,580
Won't the boys' basket...

23
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,290
Yup, the boys' basketball team's gonna come cheer as well.

24
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,630
Then, that means he's going to come too.

25
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,150
Why didn't she mention this before?

26
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,990
Not like she had a reason to say it...

27
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,320
Eh? What?

28
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,380
Nah, it's nothing.

29
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,590
Here.

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,960
I like when it's snowing by the sea.

31
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,870
Let's go to the shore!

32
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,500
I'll head out first.

33
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,260
Hey!

34
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,760
Be sure to lock the door!

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,100
Wait... Hold on!

36
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,180
Because... I lost my tears.

37
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,290
It's going to start in three days, huh?

38
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,240
Have you practiced your dancing to perfection?

39
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah. Well, somewhat.

40
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,530
You were just like Raigoumaru!

41
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,260
Looking cool, courageous, shining bright!

42
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm looking forward to see Shinichirou-kun dressed up.

43
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,640
Obaa-san told me that Oji-san once danced as the lead too.

44
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, so you knew that.

45
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,390
I will be at the front row, looking at Shinichirou!

46
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Let's go home.

47
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,930
I have to go to Shinichirou-kun's home this afternoon.

48
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,640
If it's too busy over there, Oba-san might end up in a bad mood.

49
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,220
What the...

50
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,170
Want a nice, cheerful female friend?

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,180
You get all the coke and Imagawayaki you want if you become a friend of hers.

52
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,250
I...

53
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,890
Let's start over as friends again.

54
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,410
Making a sweater was impossible from the start.

55
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,680
We need to start over with something simpler.

56
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,430
But...

57
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,060
I'll be working hard so that one day, you'll make me a sweater.

58
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,310
I'll work to improve my knitting skills until then, too.

59
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm home!

60
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,540
Sorry for intruding!

61
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,000
"The next day, it was raining."

62
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,000
"Beside him, Ground was eagerly and noisily flapping his wings, but..."

63
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,970
"Raigoumaru was resting peacefully."

64
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,620
Hiromi!

65
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,220
Hiromi!

66
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,510
I'm fine...

67
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,050
That was obviously on purpose! How horrible!

68
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,680
Judge!

69
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,500
Hey, what's with you? Get off the court!

70
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,940
What was with that foul play?

71
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,500
I'll be listening if you have any explanations.

72
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,120
You! Get off the court!

73
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,710
Incredible...

74
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,630
Time out! Give us a time out!

75
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,080
Incredible! He confessed in front of everyone?

76
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,660
After doing something like that, she should fall for him instantly!

77
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,640
I...

78
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,540
Okay? We have to get our acts together!

79
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,590
Concentrate!

80
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,850
Yes!

81
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,330
Yo.

82
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,260
Yo...

83
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,490
Listen...

84
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,990
Could you tell Isurugi Noe that her curse didn't work?

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,090
It's fine. She'll get it when you tell her that.

86
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,060
Well, see ya.

87
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,170
I'm working part time at Ai-chan's today.

88
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,570
Hey, hold on!

89
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:19,450
"What's this? Isn't that Ground's upright silhouette, standing against the morning sun on top of the 10 meter-tall cliff?"

90
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,790
Master, spread wider.

91
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,270
I'm home.

92
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,580
I'm...

93
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,300
How are things over there?

94
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,940
Yes, everything's fine.

95
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,140
Hey, come here and take a look at this.

96
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,270
"I will wipe your tears properly"... What was with that?

97
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,540
Shinichirou, you can fly.

98
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,780
You just don't know it yourself.

99
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,370
I didn't do anything properly...

100
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,500
Not for anyone...

101
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,550
Isn't it cold tonight?

102
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah.

103
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,700
Oh, you're home?

104
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm looking forward to the Mugiha dance.

105
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,640
Then, I'm going in first.

106
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,350
Yeah.

107
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,220
So, how's your picture book going?

108
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,000
It'll be finished soon.

109
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,060
I see.

110
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm looking forward to it.

111
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,250
Well anyway, right now you should concentrate on leading the Mugiha dance.

112
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,060
Oh, Master, welcome home.

113
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,750
I'm looking forward to the Mugiha dance.

114
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,770
I'll do my best!

115
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,340
"Ground's shadow left the top of the cliff."

116
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:54,420
"Then, the stalled-in-flight Ground rapidly fell towards the earth."

117
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,650
"Raigoumaru watched it all, from beginning to end."

118
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,200
Hiromi?

119
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,770
Yeah. Thanks for today!

120
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,820
Today, Takaoka got a call from Hotarugawa's team saying that they apologize.

121
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,650
I see.

122
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,840
There was a big commotion about Number 4 being stolen away by a Mugiha girl!

123
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
How stupid.

124
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,720
But he was so incredible, that Number 4!

125
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,840
To say something like that in front of everyone!

126
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,580
Looks like he's serious about you, Hiromi, uh...

127
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,010
It's fine. I don't care about that anymore.

128
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,290
So how is it, living by yourself?

129
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm eating a popsicle right now.

130
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,860
Ah, how unfair! It must be really nice, huh?

131
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,440
Yup, living alone is the best!

132
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
You could bring home all the guys you want!

133
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,580
Yup.

134
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,500
Eh?!

135
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,710
Oh, sorry. My mom's calling for me, I'll call you back later.

136
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,080
Yes?

137
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm sorry about today.

138
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,010
We...

139
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,290
Huh?

140
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,500
I've been causing trouble for a lot of people.

141
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,670
I've caused many people to start feeling bad.

142
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,780
It's me who should be apologizing.

143
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,650
No...

144
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,680
And...

146
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,500
Thank you.

147
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,020
Can't we meet up?

148
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,170
Let's meet, please.

149
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,120
I prepared Yoshida-san's part as well.

150
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,050
I see.

151
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,350
That laundry of Shin-chan's over there...

152
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,370
Sorry, but could you bring it over to his room?

153
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,510
Ye- Yes.

154
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,220
Err...

155
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,890
"The Tale of Raigoumaru and Ground"...

156
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,420
Err... Obaa-san told me to bring your laundry.

157
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,010
I went to see the game yesterday.

158
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,200
I...

159
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Shinichirou-kun, work hard at the Mugiha dance.

160
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,110
Hold on, Hiromi.

161
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,760
That guy's...

162
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,210
Yup.

163
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,160
At that park.

164
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,750
Thanks for coming.

165
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,840
No matter what, I wanted to apologize in person.

166
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,650
Yeah. I understand, so don't worry about it.

167
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,540
Besides, I was happy you did that for my sake.

168
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,980
Was that all you wanted to say?

169
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,300
Don't be so cold.

170
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,000
Want to get a cup of tea?

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,060
Then, it's my turn to talk now.

172
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,400
Let's not meet or call each other anymore.

173
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,750
At this rate, someone else will get dragged into this.

174
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,990
I wanted to tell you face-to-face when I met with you.

175
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,000
What, so it is bothering you after all.

176
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,880
But, like I said last time.

177
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,600
Our agreement is not over yet.

178
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,020
It's not me that you love.

179
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,630
To you, nothing matters but her.

180
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,000
Why don't you understand?

181
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,310
"It was the first flight of a chicken, and the one who held the glory for that failure...

182
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,070
was Ground."

183
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:26,600
"Raigoumaru was just a regular bird in the crowd of cowardly chickens."

184
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,310
"The end."

185
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,250
Who would read a bad ending like this one?

186
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,800
I wonder what Noe would say if she read it.

187
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,910
That's right...

188
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,290
I need to show this to Noe...

189
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,870
I've got nothing more to tell you...

190
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,220
Noe didn't come home.

191
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,390
Oh... I see...

192
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,620
Well, please call him.

193
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,650
Sure...

194
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm sorry... were you asleep?

195
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,510
I'm drawing my picture book.

196
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,410
Hello? Hiromi?

197
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,330
"The Tale of Raigoumaru and Ground".

198
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,190
Eh?

199
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,090
No, it's nothing.

200
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,850
I see.

201
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,540
So, what's the matter? Calling this late...

202
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,440
Isurugi Noe didn't come home.

203
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,890
Eh?

204
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,040
Her brother wondered if Shinichirou-kun would know where she is.

205
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,100
I got it. I'll go look for her right now.

206
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,410
If anything happens over there, call me.

207
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,700
Shinichirou-kun?

208
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,470
Shinichirou-

209
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,750
It seems I can't understand how you feel, after all...

210
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,610
In this world, there are many painful and sad things.

211
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,400
I want to fly. To escape from everything, and spread my wings freely.

212
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,180
It would be simpler to wish for that, Ground.

213
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,230
Ground, I'll help you fly.

214
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,660
Ground...

215
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,150
Noe... did you take him with you?

216
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,640
That's right...

217
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,110
This isn't the place where you take flight.

218
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,080
That was... her way of breaking up...

219
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,150
...cockroach~

220
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,390
Under Shinichirou's shoe, there's a cockroach, too~

221
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,140
In Shinichirou's hat, there's a cockroach, too~

222
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,840
On Shinichirou's~

223
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,480
Butt there's a cockroach~

224
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,980
In Shinichirou's...

225
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,290
Inside Shinichirou's heart, there is...

226
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,230
Yuasa Hiromi.

227
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,500
They're beautiful.

228
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,740
Your tears...

229
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,840
Really, what was I doing?

230
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,890
May I kiss you?

231
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,390
From my eyes that can't see anything...
