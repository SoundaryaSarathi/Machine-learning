<i>[Episode 14]</i>

4
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
I like your eyes the most.

5
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,879
Your Majesty, don't make fun of me.

6
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,000
Tell me.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,599
Where are you?

8
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,759
Aren't I in your arms?

9
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,240
Were you off searching for Li Yuan again?

10
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
Have you found anything?

11
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,319
No clues at all.

12
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,280
You may all go.

13
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
I want to speak with the princess.

14
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,439
- Yes.
- Yes.

15
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,240
It's been 70,000 years.

16
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,000
You should let it go.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,319
Father has already left me.

18
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,680
And Li Yuan's whereabouts are unknown.

19
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,159
If I let it go, I might be
left with nothing.

20
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,000
You still have me.

21
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
Yes, I still have you.

22
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,180
Ever since I was young, you were
the one who treated me best.

23
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,560
You were even nicer to me than Father.

24
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,000
Li Jing.

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,879
Lately, I've been thinking about
our childhood.

26
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,680
You, me, and Li Yuan,
and the lively days we had.

27
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,039
If not for the great war
against the Celestial Tribe

28
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,439
you and Li Yuan could have--

29
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,219
Don't mention him to me.

30
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,839
Do you not miss him?

31
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,519
After all... we are siblings.

32
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
Siblings?

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,399
He and you were born from
the same mother.

34
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,920
I was not.

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
- Li Jing!
- That's enough.

36
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,399
You are you. He is Li Yuan.

37
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,879
The relationship you have with him
has nothing to do with me.

38
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,600
In this lifetime... I only have you,
my only sister.

39
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,279
Yan Zhi.

40
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,279
Don't mention him to me again.

41
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,519
Is it not possible
for you two to reconcile?

42
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,879
Reconcile?

43
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
All right, Li Jing, do not be angry.

44
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,920
I just never thought that
in this big Grand Ziming Palace

45
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,079
only you and I would be left..

46
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, yes, Li Jing.

47
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,120
Look, I found this in the mortal realm.

48
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,399
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

49
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,399
A-Yin's artifact?

50
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,800
Where did you find it?

51
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,360
Did you see him?

52
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,079
Let me explain first.

53
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,560
Where exactly did you find him?

54
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,560
I did not find him.

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,709
I only met a mortal woman
in Zhong Rong State

56
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,720
at the foot of
Mount Junji of the Far East.

57
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
She told me she found this fan
on Mount Junji.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,079
Mount Junji?

59
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,360
<i>Li Jing, have you ever been to
Mount Junji of the Far East?</i>

60
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>My fellow disciples and I
sometimes go to the mortal realm for fun.</i>

61
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>We always go there.</i>

62
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,720
Mount Junji?

63
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,000
Mount Junji. How come
I didn't think of that?

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
Li Jing, what did you say?

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,439
I'm going to see A-Yin.

66
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,439
Li Jing!

67
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,040
Ghost Lord! Ghost Lord!

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,399
Your Majesty, save me.

69
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,360
You didn't kneel to greet me.
You've violated the palace rules.

70
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
The Ghost Lord can't save you.

71
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,839
- I had not seen Her Highness.
- Shut up.

72
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,600
Enough.

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Didn't I tell you
not to come to the hot spring?

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,519
- Why can't I come here?
- You are the queen.

75
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,439
You have to remember your status.

76
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,680
You know I am your main wife.

77
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,399
In these 70,000 years, how many times
have you visited my quarters?

78
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,720
As your main wife, I still have not born
a heir.

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
What does the Ghost Tribe think of me?

80
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,160
The matter of a heir
can be left up to fate.

81
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,439
Your Majesty!

82
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,360
I have an important task to handle.

83
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,720
Behave yourself in the palace.

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,519
Are you going to the mortal realm again?

85
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,079
Do I answer to you?

86
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,800
It's been 70,000 years.

87
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,279
Do you not remember
back at Kunlun Mountain--

88
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,480
Enough.

89
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,519
Don't mention Kunlun Mountain to me.

90
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,199
Why can't I?

91
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,439
It's been 70,000 years.
He's been missing for 70,000 years.

92
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,759
What does Si Yin have that I don't?

93
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,319
Remember your status.

94
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
<i>[Yunji Teahouse]</i>

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,480
It's said the hero,
suited in a helmet and armor of gold

96
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,080
was impervious as he
brandished his spear.

97
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,519
Good...

98
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,919
At this very moment, three arrows
were heard swishing toward him.

99
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,960
With a single somersault,
the hero landed on the roof.

100
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Good...

101
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,039
And just as quickly,
the hero leaped into the clouds.

102
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,039
And disappeared into
the dark of the night.

103
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,399
Good...

104
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,679
Mo Yuan?

105
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,759
I am the Celestial Tribe's
Crown Prince, Ye Hua.

106
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,039
Ghost Lord Li Jing greets Your Highness.

107
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,840
You are Ghost Lord Li Jing?

108
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,679
Please forgive my rudeness.

109
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,240
Your Highness looks very similar
to Mo Yuan.

110
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480
It's no bother.

111
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,799
Do you know this is restricted land
of the Celestial Tribe?

112
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,840
The Scarlet Flame Golden Lion endangered
Zhong Rong State for ten years.

113
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
After I killed it

114
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,546
this place was made into
the Celestial Tribe's restricted area.

115
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,600
I am sorry, Your Highness.

116
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,960
I did not know I trespassed
on to restricted land.

117
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,919
There is nobody on Mount Junji.
You need not search anymore.

118
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,080
Does Your Highness know why I am here?

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,000
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun
you're holding

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
is a Kunlun Mountain artifact.

121
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Is Si Yin the one you are searching for?

122
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,799
Does Your Highness know of
Si Yin's whereabouts?

123
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,000
I only know that after
the war 70,000 years ago

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,183
Si Yin left with Mo Yuan
to live in seclusion.

125
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,440
This remains a complicated matter.

126
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,639
I still have yet to believe it.

127
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,120
Farewell.

128
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,799
Wait.

129
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,399
What orders do you have, Your Highness?

130
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,480
The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun is
a Kunlun Mountain artifact.

131
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
It should be returned to
the Celestial Tribe.

132
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,000
Farewell.

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,960
- What do I do?
- All right, allow me.

134
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,240
There wasn't much rice to begin with
and now it's gone to waste again.

135
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,559
It's all right. When my injuries
are better, I'll find a way to get food.

136
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,919
<i>If you don't get better soon,
I'll have to starve with you.</i>

137
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,080
Why am I sleeping on the bed?

138
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,039
You always sleep until the middle
of the night and climb in.

139
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,745
I am hampered by severe injuries
and naturally could not stop you.

140
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,639
Then...

141
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,200
I also chose to hold you?

142
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes.

143
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
- Then...
- Don't move.

144
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,000
Did I bump into your injury?

145
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Are you asleep?

146
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,740
Your Highness.

147
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,580
What are you doing?

148
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,039
Trimming peach blossom branches
for a vase arrangement.

149
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,519
How nice.

150
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,240
I heard Zhe Yan of Qing Qiu
planted ten miles of peach trees.

151
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,200
It seems Your Highness
hasn't admired them enough

152
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,720
and came to Taichen Palace to
trim these peach blossoms.

153
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,879
Don't make fun of me.

154
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,600
Ever since I entered Taichen Palace,
I haven't even seen the shadow of Dijun.

155
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,879
I'm ordered around all day.

156
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,240
I've forgotten what I came here for
in the first place.

157
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,960
Dijun is in Taichen Palace.
He just rarely comes out.

158
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,240
Why is that?

159
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
Is he shunned by others
in the Celestial Palace?

160
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,279
Your Highness is very funny.

161
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,440
Do you know how others
in the Celestial Palace assess Dijun?

162
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,720
How?

163
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,519
Pays no attention to mundane affairs
or world of mortals.

164
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,879
Other than being concerned about
the peace of the world

165
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,399
he never holds regard for anyone.

166
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,624
He is only a deity best suited for
hanging on the wall.

167
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,879
- Is he really like that?
- Yes.

168
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,320
That is why it is not a major concern
if you repay his kindness.

169
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,480
Dijun wouldn't mind
such a trivial matter either.

170
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,799
Repaying a kindness is necessary,
especially for saving a life.

171
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,600
As you wish.

172
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,440
How about this?

173
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,799
If you want to repay Dijun,
then you must see him.

174
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,039
Pick a few peach blossoms and I will
take them to Dijun and compliment them

175
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,000
so you'll have a chance to thank him.

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,279
How is that?

177
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,679
But if Dijun sees that
I am in Taichen Palace

178
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,559
will he blame me?

179
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,320
In order to repay him, Your Highness has
already humbled yourself to be a maid.

180
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,360
Dijun would only be touched
instead of blaming you.

181
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,480
That's true.

182
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,039
I've never served another
in such a way before.

183
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,799
And this is for repaying him.
Dijun would surely understand.

184
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,360
Quickly bestow the peach blossoms then.

185
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
Star Lord, you're so good to me.

186
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,279
Which branch should I pick?

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,619
These peach blossoms are quite nice.

188
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,920
They're quite nice.

189
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,519
These were picked by a new palace maid
in Dijun's palace who has a good eye.

190
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,839
Palace maid?

191
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,319
- A new arrival?
- What is it?

192
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,759
Is Your Highness
interested in seeing her?

193
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
Let's see her.

194
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
I'll go fetch her.

195
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,000
Greetings, Dijun.

196
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,799
Greetings, Third Prince.

197
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,359
Stand up and let me see.

198
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,359
What does Your Highness want to see?

199
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,960
His Highness is a well-known playboy
in the Celestial Tribe.

200
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,799
Of course he wants to see your face.

201
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,759
Yes.

202
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,079
I want to see your face

203
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,279
and see if it is as mesmerizing
as Si Ming says it is.

204
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,119
No, I didn't say that.

205
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,720
Right, Si Ming?

206
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,920
Yes, Your Highness is right.

207
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,119
Greetings, Dijun.

208
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,960
Did you all agree to come to
my study to act out a play?

209
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,119
What do you mean by that, Dijun?

210
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,640
Do you understand?

211
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,400
No.

212
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,240
Does Your Highness understand?

213
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
I really don't.

214
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,480
You.

215
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,242
You were so disappointing.

216
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,357
You were in Dijun's presence.

217
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,880
But instead of showing your demeanor
as princess of Qing Qiu

218
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,960
you were so docile and submissive.

219
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,680
How humiliating!

220
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,240
Didn't you ruin the opportunity,
Lady Cheng Yu?

221
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,480
I had finally thought of a way to
bring Her Highness in front of Dijun.

222
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,799
You know her?

223
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,471
Yes.

224
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,778
- You also know her?
- Yes.

225
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,960
Then this palace maid's
real identity is...

226
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.

227
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,799
So you are the young princess
of Qing Qiu.

228
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
Why are you dressed like this
in Dijun's palace?

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Repaying a kindness.

230
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Repaying him.

231
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Don't say it. Let me guess.

232
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,079
Is it to repay him for saving your life?

233
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,240
How does Your Highness know?

234
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,519
From experience.

235
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,759
Experience?

236
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,119
A few days ago,
someone took a liking to a woman.

237
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,319
I suggested several methods

238
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,160
ranging from the hero saving the beauty
to using his charms.

239
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,680
In the end, he chose to pretend to be
saved and thus repay the kindness.

240
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,119
Repaying a debt of gratitude,
especially for saving a life

241
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,519
always requires some time.

242
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,960
Over the course of time,
won't affection eventually grow?

243
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,960
So it's like that.

244
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
Your Highness is brilliant.

245
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,359
No! I really did come to repay him.
Dijun really did save my life.

246
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,359
Your Highness must not be aware.

247
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,319
In the hundreds of millennia
that Dijun has lived

248
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,359
the number of women who use the excuse
of repaying him to get close to him

249
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,680
have reached the thousands.

250
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,799
But... I really am here to repay him.

251
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,319
Dijun really did save my life.

252
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,920
Dijun also has a reputation for
not meddling in others' affairs.

253
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,839
So this debt of saving your life
that Your Highness speaks of

254
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,200
is very difficult to believe.

255
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,359
Don't accuse me, Your Highness.

256
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,680
I really am here to repay him.

257
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
- They all know.
- All right.

258
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,759
- I really--
- Enough.

259
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
All right.

260
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,599
Then let me ask you one thing.

261
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,519
Do you feel "that way" about Dijun?

262
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,400
Si Ming.

263
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,415
How did you meet the young princess?
She is so interesting.

264
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:46,119
It'll be difficult for Dijun to
explain himself this time.

265
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,799
He clearly had good intentions,
but instead, he attracted

266
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,743
the romance of one who
doesn't even understand her own feelings.

267
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,079
The way Her Highness and I met
is a long story.

268
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,480
But for Her Highness to be
able to enter Taichen Palace

269
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
was due to help from Cheng Yu.

270
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,359
She has nothing to do with you.
Why did you meddle?

271
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,599
Can't I stand up against injustice?

272
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,188
Is that how the phrase
"Standing up against injustice" is used?

273
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,680
I just can't bear to see
the young girl wholly infatuated.

274
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,920
I want to help her.
Am I not allowed to?

275
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,200
You can. As long as you're happy.

276
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,200
Si Ming.

277
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Men can't afford to offend the women
of their past.

278
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
If they've ever been in love,
even if the relationship is over

279
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
he'll still have to yield to her
his whole life.

280
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,880
Otherwise, she'll hold you in contempt.

281
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,279
Yes, I understand the lesson.

282
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,519
This is the last of the rice.

283
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,880
Ye Hua.

284
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,359
Go ahead.

285
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,319
I have something to say.

286
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,440
You see, I have no problem living on
this mountain by myself.

287
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,039
I can take care of some
of the small animals.

288
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,720
But taking care of a man like you...
is difficult.

289
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,799
I obtained this rice by trading
two week's worth of fruit.

290
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,960
It's only been a few days
and it is all gone.

291
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,440
There is no more food in the house.

292
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,759
Not having any provisions is an issue.

293
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
It is late autumn.

294
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,960
Getting through the winter
will be a problem.

295
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,960
It's not the issue of passing the winter.

296
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,200
Then what is it?

297
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,319
Your injuries look fairly healed.

298
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,680
Isn't it...

299
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,759
time to leave?

300
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,279
You want me to leave?

301
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,720
I... I don't mean to drive you away.

302
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,640
It's just that although I saved you,
I can't afford to take care of you.

303
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,599
You saved me.

304
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,880
Naturally, I should stay to repay you.

305
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,359
You don't need to repay me.

306
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,599
When I saved you, I wasn't thinking of
how you were going to repay me.

307
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:21,880
Whether you thought it and whether
I'm doing it are two different matters.

308
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,680
I am not an ungrateful person.

309
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,079
I must pay this debt of gratitude.

310
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,160
But I am not lacking.

311
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,799
You can take some time to think about it.

312
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,720
If you really want to repay me, why don't
you devote yourself entirely to me?

313
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,920
It's because I don't lack anything
living on this mountain.

314
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,240
I just don't have anyone
to keep me company. It's so lonely.

315
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,200
So if you really want to repay me

316
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,759
why don't you devote yourself to me
and be my companion?

317
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,839
Of course, if you don't agree,
it would still be reasonable.

318
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,599
After all, I only took you in
and didn't do much else.

319
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,599
It's not considered much of a favor.

320
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,700
All right.

321
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
All right?

322
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,680
I agree.

323
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
To devote myself to you.

324
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,119
I thought you were going to take
two or three days to think.

325
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,960
You agreed so quickly.

326
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
Nothing... has been prepared.

327
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,119
Prepare what?

328
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,599
Since you've agreed to
devote yourself to me

329
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,400
then shouldn't we kneel in front of
the Lakes of the Far East

330
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,480
bow to heaven and earth,
and make a pledge

331
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,240
to become husband and wife
and never abandon each other?

332
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,680
Though I don't have parents

333
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,680
if we also leave out this step,
would it be improper?

334
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,240
You want to marry me?

335
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,559
I want to marry you.

336
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,519
I have never bowed to
heaven and earth with anyone else.

337
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,000
I haven't either.

338
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Then let's keep everything simple.

339
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
Formalities are not important.

340
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,119
Keep everything simple?

341
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,200
Then what do we do next?

342
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,079
Buy things.

343
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,960
Buy things?

344
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,240
Aside from a crimson wedding quilt

345
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,400
we need to add some other items
to this house.

346
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,599
It isn't a wedding quilt.

347
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,400
The one in Your Highness's heart
is clearly the Crown Prince.

348
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,759
Despite that, why did you request
to be made consort?

349
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,079
Moreover, the Heavenly Lord
is of old age.

350
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,759
He no longer has the energy to
give his affections to the harem.

351
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,759
Among all the consorts,
Your Highness is the youngest one

352
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,039
yet, you are the least powerful.

353
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
Look.

354
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,880
The decree was made just yesterday

355
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,599
and you already have to
move in such a hurry today.

356
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,920
Aside from the wedding outfit
you are wearing

357
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,359
there is no festive air in the palace.

358
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,440
- You don't understand.
- How do I not?

359
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,200
I have been serving Your Highness
since I was young.

360
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,680
Heavenly Lord being unable to attend to
his harem is exactly what I want.

361
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,759
Your Highness, don't tell me that
you wanted to get married

362
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,064
to be left alone in your quarters.

363
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,079
Isn't that great?

364
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,920
Your Highness.

365
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,799
Your Highness.

366
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,519
What are you thinking? Can you tell me?

367
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,359
My rank may be low, but I have been
loyal to you my whole life.

368
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,880
If you cannot tell me
what is on your mind

369
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,359
who else could you tell?

370
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,839
You don't even have parents or siblings.

371
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,920
Take a look around. What do you need?

372
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,400
In broad daylight...

373
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,759
I am the Jade Emperor's son-in-law!

374
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,480
He's gone crazy.

375
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,200
Let's go.

376
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,240
Looks like he's lost his mind.

377
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,279
<i>[Yunji Teahouse]</i>

378
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,200
- He's crazy now.
- What happened?

379
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,039
Do you know why
that Daoist priest turned crazy?

380
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,799
- Why?
- Let me tell you.

381
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,720
This Daoist priest has a wife.

382
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,079
They separated earlier in the year.

383
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,039
A few days ago, she came back,
and with a child in tow.

384
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,680
He had just brought the child
to visit his ancestors

385
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,599
and at that very moment,
the child's real father appeared.

386
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,000
He found the Daoist priest,
beat him up, and took the child.

387
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,559
He even stole all the money
the Daoist priest had earned in his life.

388
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,039
This was when the Daoist priest
truly lost his mind.

389
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,480
It's only been a few days. The gossip
is more dramatic than the opera.

390
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,720
What is the matter? Do you know that
Daoist priest?

391
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,440
He is a bad person.

392
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,240
He offended you before?

393
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,119
Twice he has put me
in a difficult situation.

394
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,839
It seems he has received his retribution.
There's no need to mention it again.

395
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,319
Is there anything else to buy?

396
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,920
Is there anything else you need?

397
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,000
You've already sold
your only jade pendant

398
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
in exchange for so little.

399
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,799
Are you going to sell your sword as well?

400
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,200
I didn't have you marry me
to buy things for me.

401
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,519
But, speaking of which, Ye Hua...

402
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,480
I only have that hut.
You're going to marry me just like this?

403
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,599
You're really not lying to me
about marrying me?

404
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,240
You're the one who wanted me
to devote myself to you.

405
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,519
Are you regretting it?

406
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,440
Don't worry, I don't find you unpleasant.

407
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,440
But if you marry me just like this
how will you answer to your family?

408
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Or are they not around?

409
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,680
We'll worry about that later.

410
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,720
Take a look.

411
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,359
- I'll have some of this.
- All right.

412
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,720
- And this.
- All right.

413
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,760
- Take this, Miss.
- Here.

414
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,940
<i>A-Yin?</i>

415
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,679
This outfit is so beautiful.

416
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,880
Isn't wearing it for
only one day a waste?

417
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,800
If you like, nobody would stop you
even if you wear it year-round.

418
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,320
Ye Hua.

419
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,400
If you spend more time with me

420
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,840
and find our personalities are not
a match, then what will we do?

421
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,719
Are we being too hasty?

422
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,599
You haven't brought me
to see your parents.

423
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,400
If your parents find out
you took a wife on your own

424
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,679
will they be displeased?

425
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:47,679
And, I forgot to ask you.

426
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,760
Do you already have
a marriage arrangement?

427
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:57,320
In town, I've seen men your age
already married and with children.

428
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,719
Are you already engaged?

429
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,599
Su Su.

430
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,360
My family's situation is complicated.
It is hard to explain.

431
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,559
But, you just have to remember

432
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,320
from this day forth,
you are my wife.

433
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,039
Since I have married you,
I will not betray you.

434
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,000
All right, I trust you.

435
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,800
That must be lifted by your husband.

436
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't know what to say.

437
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,719
Just repeat what I say.

438
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,559
I'm a little nervous.

439
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
It's fine.

440
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,320
It's just bowing to heaven and earth.

441
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,840
All right, let's do it.

442
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,760
I, Ye Hua, ask all the gods
of the world to bear witness

443
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,519
in front of the Lakes of the Far East.

444
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,199
From this day forth,
I will be married to Su Su.

445
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,559
I will love her with all my heart
for all eternity

446
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,199
and never part from her
regardless of fortune or calamity.

447
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,880
I, Su Su, ask all the gods
of the world to bear witness

448
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,199
in front of the Lakes of the Far East.

449
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,000
From this day forth,
I will be married to Ye Hua.

450
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,719
I will love him with all my heart
for all eternity

451
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,559
and never part from him
regardless of fortune or calamity.

452
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Now that we are married there are some
things I must say.

453
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,199
Go ahead.

454
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Since we have made an oath
to the Lakes of the Far East

455
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,880
we are to be husband and wife
for all eternity.

456
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,360
You must not do me wrong
for all eternity.

457
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,159
I have always held a clear distinction
between love and hate.

458
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,119
I can tolerate no wrong.

459
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,639
If you betray me...

460
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,420
What would you do?

461
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,440
If you betray me, those oaths
will become null and void.

462
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,800
I will leave you, never to see you again.

463
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,679
If I betray you, you will leave me.

464
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,440
Then wouldn't you be
giving me exactly what I want?

465
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,519
I am not joking.

466
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,119
Su Su.

467
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,679
Close your eyes.

468
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,760
I will never betray you.

469
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,199
