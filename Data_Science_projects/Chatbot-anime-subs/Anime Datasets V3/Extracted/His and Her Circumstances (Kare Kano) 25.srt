1
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:11,884
In the second half of the 20th century,
Japan was suffering the greatest
economic recession since the War.

2
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:15,789
What with the repeated chain
reactions of bankrupcies...

3
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,319
...an increasing unemployment rate, atrocious
crimes committed by juveniles, and so on...

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,731
...it had become an era and a place fit...

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,934
...to be manipulated by
the image brought to mind...

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,064
...by the phrase
The End is Near.

7
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:29,706
Meanwhile, the masked honor
student Miyazawa Yukino...

8
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,101
...in class 1-A of the Kanazawa
Prefectural Hokuei High School...

9
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,910
was the ultimate Queen of Vanity.

10
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,011
Arima Souichirou, the one who changed her...

11
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,683
...was a real model student who
never made enemies...

12
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,577
...and tried to bear all
his misery by himself.

13
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:45,981
Although how they came about was different,
the two came to share a secret as...

14
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,418
...model students with
dual personalities...

15
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,225
...and after passing through phases as...

16
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,687
...partners in the Student
Assembly, good friends...

17
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,396
...and more than friends
but not quite lovers...

18
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:57,696
...they finally became a couple.

19
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:02,903
And they decided to live for
their own true happiness.

20
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,939
But the storms of life  subjected them to an...

21
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:09,213
...almost harsh series of ordeals.

22
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:11,208
Go for it, Miyazawa Yukino.

23
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:13,116
Don't lose heart, Arima Souichirou.

24
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,847
This world exists for you!

25
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,454
Whatcha doing standing there
daydreaming? You'll be late!

26
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,365
Hey, Tsuki!

27
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:30,828
I'm Miyazawa Kano,

28
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,861
currently in eighth grade.

29
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:34,829
I'm at a sensitive age!

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,507
My family has five members,
including me.

31
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,073
My mother, and father,
and two sisters.

32
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:44,344
Oh, and our Pero-Pero.

33
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:46,546
That makes five people and one dog.

34
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:47,941
My father's a big kid.
Very naive.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,050
Yuki calls him our big little brother,

36
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:52,784
and I have to agree.

37
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,289
My mother's nice.

38
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,687
She only talks about simple things,
but she's warm and kind.

40
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:00,829
Even from our perspective,
they seem to be a happy couple.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,092
My immediate older sister is Tsukino.

43
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:05,493
I have NO clue what she's thinking.

44
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:09,238
She says zany things all the time, so I

45
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,603
Hey! What've you been mumbling about?

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,078
Tsuki...

47
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:16,244
Hi there.

48
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,546
Hi

49
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:20,880
As a whole, my family keeps up a good facade.

50
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,411
The oldest sister is Yukino.

51
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,786
Put us together and we're
snow, moon, and flower,

52
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,589
the nice things to look at in the seasons.

53
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,448
I do think we sisters are all
rather good looking.

54
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:32,228
Yuki is especially pretty,
just like our mother.

56
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,598
Argh! I'm going home,

57
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:35,922
GOT IT?!

58
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,560
She's smart, and gets things done.

59
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:39,929
But she's a little...

60
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,764
...er... really extreme.

61
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,071
That's the eldest daughter, Yukino.

62
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,307
Ahem

63
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,069
I'm in eighth grade,

64
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,744
but I've read lots of books
and seen lots of plays.

65
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:52,113
I think I observe people rather
objectively too.

66
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,114
I look carefree, but I
really have it together.

68
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:02,960
That's me!

69
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:04,326
No matter what happens,

70
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:05,591
the family will be safe as
long as I stay strong.

71
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,224
Maybe that's a little too pompous.

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,462
What's pompous?

73
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,003
O-oh, um, nothing.

74
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,031
Gee sis, you're home early!

75
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,473
What's with everyone?
What are they excited about?

76
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:16,872
The lottery!

77
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,834
Dad said he got tickets
from someone at work.

79
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,769
If we win, he said we could
go somewhere for New Years!

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,007
Sheesh, why does our family always count
the chickens before they're hatched?

83
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,016
Well, you could say that we're
just typical middle class,

84
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:29,385
and that would be the end of it but...

85
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,253
Doing intense reading again?

86
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,021
Yeah. It's old, but it's
quite touching.

87
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:38,261
Touching is good, but try to cry
about it only when you're awake.

89
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,188
Your face is going to bloat.

90
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,028
What? Was I crying again...?

91
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:46,162
Don't just stick to sad stories
and read something fun too, ok?

93
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,603
Want to borrow one of mine?

94
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,271
I'm a kid.

95
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,144
A kid... but an adult.
I'm a grown-up compared to my
sisters Yuki and Tsuki.

96
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:57,942
I think I have good discretion.

97
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,644
Praiseworthy but audacious.

98
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,916
But I'm really carefree.

99
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,190
Bye.

100
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,251
Don't forget about tomorrow.

101
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:10,717
Bah-bye!

102
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:12,360
Bye.

103
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:16,758
The Culture Fair's so fun.

104
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,897
Everyone gets so psyched up
during the preparations.

105
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:21,969
But I can't believe how
carefree our club is.

106
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,275
There's nothing for the Literature
Club to get psyched up about.

108
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,275
I guess. They do the same thing
every year.

109
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,440
It might be different if we did a poetry
reading or something.

110
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:30,371
No way!

111
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:31,477
Nobody would listen to that.

112
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,874
I don't know. There might be
people who'd like it...

113
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,081
You're late, Kano!

114
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,680
Oh, Tsuki.

115
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,790
Hello.

116
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,454
Sis Tsuki, don't you have
to do anything?

117
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,825
Oh, it's fine.

118
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,132
My sister's sick, and I have
to take her to the doctor!

120
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,235
So, you're going to walk
home with me today.

122
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,095
Am I your excuse?

124
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:56,640
Well, my class is going to do
a maze and a bazaar...

125
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,407
...and I was told that it would be...

126
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:00,074
...more muddled and maze-like if we...

127
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,413
...do it all the day before,
helter-skelter-like.

128
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,872
Who told you that?

129
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,715
Dad.

130
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,718
Figures.

131
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,250
What is it?

132
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,080
I thought there was someone
watching us...

133
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,256
Maybe it's a stalker.

134
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:16,151
Oh, is it now?

135
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,185
Well, I'll have to excuse myself now.

136
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:19,454
Bye.

137
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:20,762
Bah-bye!

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,961
Take care!

139
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:30,902
It's often just your imagination
at times like this.

140
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,603
You know, when people take the same
path home and you get too self conscious.

142
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:38,513
If it's just our imagination
it'll be gone before we know it.

144
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:45,547
S-s-sis...

145
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,186
Looks like we had the
wrong misunderstanding...

147
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,630
How long did the silent battle go on?

148
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,727
It might have been only 4 or 5 minutes.

149
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,706
But the tension .was too much for us!

151
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,840
S-s-sis...

152
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,447
We've failed in giving our
tail the slip.

153
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:20,547
Okay. I'm okay.

154
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:23,493
It's dusk. If we make it to a main
street there'll be people there.

155
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,896
We should try to find a way
out of this mess...

156
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:27,290
Wait.

157
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,132
Here we go!

158
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:33,296
1,

159
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:34,434
2,

160
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,765
3!

161
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,377
We're sorry!

162
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,351
Sis, you moron!
We made a fool of ourselves!

163
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:58,685
But it looks like it was a
misunderstanding after all!

165
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:02,390
However...

166
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:07,035
This was nothing but the prelude to the
terrifying incident that was about to unfold.

168
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,110
See you later!

169
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,306
She's off early again.

170
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,512
It's for her play.

171
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:23,420
Yukino's an actor as she is,
so why does she need to practice?

173
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,488
Dear, you know how it is.

174
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,084
The springtime of her life, huh?

175
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:28,084
That's right!

176
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,755
My battle began on that day.

178
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:32,620
Seconds please!

179
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:40,802
What's wrong, Kano?

180
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,538
Tsuki hasn't noticed.

181
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,744
She's convinced that that incident
yesterday was a misunderstanding.

183
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,676
But I can see it.

184
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,248
The dark shadow, following me...

185
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:01,954
You didn't see it at all.

186
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,352
Morning. What's the matter?

187
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't you stand behind me!

188
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:07,732
Who?

189
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,326
Kano's been reading too many books.

190
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:10,826
Well, I'll go on ahead.

191
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,500
Can't let your gloomy mood drag me down
or I'll bomb first-period English!

193
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,036
Is something bothering you?

194
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:20,770
Yeah, a little...

195
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,943
What?

196
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,120
Come to think of it,
I've seen her around a lot lately.

197
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,817
I think she's in 2-D...

198
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:38,656
Who on earth could the shadow be?

199
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,897
There are cases of people getting caught
up in a crime without their knowledge...

201
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,669
Wait, dad's lottery ticket
they must be after them...

202
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:47,869
...and they're going to kidnap me?!

203
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:49,001
No... it couldn't be.

204
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:52,632
We haven't even won yet.
However...

206
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,235
I'm home. Is anyone here?

207
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:30,046
Mom? Sis?

208
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:04,380
Y-yes... this is the...
Miyazawa residence...

209
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,686
Hello? Hello, mom? Hello

210
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,130
Tsuki! Welcome back...

211
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,431
I'm home.

212
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,680
Maybe it's someone who likes you, Kano.

213
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,708
What the heck are you thinking?
I can't believe you.

214
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:42,379
You're still talking about that?

215
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,912
I told you it's your imagination.

216
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:45,652
But even today...

217
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,514
Wow, you're so popular!

218
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:48,517
Sis!

219
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:49,655
What, you wanna rumble?

220
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:50,426
I'm going to the bathroom.

221
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:56,762
I swear! Those sisters of
mine are no help at all.

223
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:03,701
Why...

224
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:06,875
You're sure taking your time.

225
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:08,407
Tsuki...

226
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,386
See, I told you! That
girl from 1-D is following

227
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:18,986
Kano around because she likes her!

228
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:21,321
That happens sometimes.

229
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:22,919
Maybe it's admiration.

230
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,659
At the stage when they're still
not comfortable with boys...

232
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:29,431
...girls look up to female
upperclassmen or teachers.

233
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,235
That's so beautiful.

234
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,765
An episode of the good
old years, right dear?

235
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,601
Well, good luck Kano.

236
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:38,736
Thanks a lot!

237
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,877
Well, I'm too busy right now,

238
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:42,869
between love, the play, and studying.

239
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,714
You understand, right?

240
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,640
And I'm doing the maze and the bazaar.

241
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,382
I thought you said it's supposed be
all helter-skelter and muddled.

242
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,610
The helter-skelter part just started.

243
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,023
Kano, you're always reading
those difficult books,

244
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,322
so solve this one yourself.

245
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,924
Oh, it's wonderful to be young!

246
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:06,529
My two sisters are heartless.

247
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,337
My father realized it's not a guy
so he could care less.

248
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:10,638
I have no allies.

249
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,168
Love is something you have to
face by yourself...

250
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:16,007
Wait, why am I taking this seriously?!

252
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:32,753
Hey, isn't that the girl?
Why don't you go talk to her?

253
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:33,822
No way!

254
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:35,430
Then I will!

255
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:48,906
You'd better be careful.

256
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:56,186
Maybe that dark shadow following
me around was the girl from 2-D

258
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,319
Then what was that figure this morning...

259
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,249
Miyazawa-san!

260
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:12,599
Kano, this way!

261
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:13,526
Tsuki.

262
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,572
What am I doing?

263
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:23,104
But first, we have to get out of here fast.

264
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,579
Let's go.

265
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,776
Hey, what's going on anyway?

266
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,683
Say something, will you?!
Wait!

267
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:41,559
You OK?

269
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,370
I'm sorry. I can't tell you now.

270
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,499
But please trust me.

271
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,307
I trust you.

272
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:59,439
I won't have it! I WON'T HAVE IT!!

273
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:01,480
Dad...

274
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:03,245
I changed my mind.

275
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:06,987
Nobody will dare marry my little
princess, not even a girl!

277
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,392
What're you talking about, Dad?

278
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,918
We're not going to get... married or...

279
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:16,664
Get married?
I said, don't take this seriously.

281
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,565
Oh?

282
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,438
What's this?

283
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,774
A gentian. So pretty!

284
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,470
Oh! Let's see... I'm always watching you.

286
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:39,780
In short, I am at a loss.

287
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,384
Excuse me, What would you do if a girl
you didn't know told you she liked you?

289
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:44,351
I'd be happy.

290
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,818
It's all cool with me.

291
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,492
Sorry, I don't understand that kind of thing.

292
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,499
Being liked by someone is so bewildering.

293
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,859
There are no words to describe it.

294
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,102
Well, this sounds like a good opportunity
for an armchair love counselor like you.

296
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,298
Experience increases your understanding...

297
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:00,000
...wasn't that the basis of
learning or something?


299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,440
But I honestly don't need to
experience this kind of thing.

300
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,281
Oh, there you are, Kano.

301
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:09,012
She had this threatening look on
her face. Is this a challenge?

302
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,145
That girl?

303
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:11,110
Yeah, that girl.

304
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,451
After school.

305
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,154
The school back yard.
And make sure she doesn't run away!

306
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,918
If she said all that, what's this for?

307
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:18,517
Isn't it just a formality?

308
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:20,324
It's a challenge after all.

309
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,431
Come on, come with me.

310
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:27,030
You can be my chaperone, or just a witness.

311
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:28,095
What are you talking about?

312
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,564
This is serious! I'm scared.

313
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,909
So a crisis finally befell
even you, the theorist!

315
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,946
What should I do, what should I do?

316
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,044
If she, you know, starts
crying all of a sudden, or...

317
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,378
How could you!
How could you dump me!

318
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,948
Well, that's not what I mean...

319
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,482
Let me die! If we can't
be together, I'd rather die!

320
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:55,796
Tsuki... you're laughing too much.

321
00:15:58,836 --> 00:15:59,803
I've decided.

322
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:02,763
I'm just going to take the plunge.

323
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,674
You're going to plunge?

324
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:05,667
Nothing's going to happen anyway.

325
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,533
I'm just going to say how I feel right now.

326
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:08,740
Want me to go with you?

327
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,579
That's okay. I'm just going to plunge.

328
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,481
Don't secretly watch or anything.

329
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,282
Of course I won't!

330
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,956
Ooh, there she is waiting.

331
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:25,957
What a strange turn of events,
don't you think, Rika-chan?

332
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,799
When it gets this far even her cool is affected.

333
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:38,733
I gotta say it. I gotta say it.

334
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:43,846
On your mark... get set!

335
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,541
Do you like me or something?
Do you like me or something?

336
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:47,578
What?

337
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,187
Like me... aren't you
the one who's after me?

339
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,146
I'm not after you! You're the one!

340
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:53,955
You're looking at me all the time!

341
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:58,923
I looked at you because you were there. I mean,
aren't you the one who was always following me?

344
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:03,232
At school, and on the way home, and you were
even looking up at me in front of my house!

347
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,059
I live in the neighborhood, so I can't help it!
I have to go that way to get home.

349
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:08,596
Why were you looking at me?

350
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,471
Because you were looking at me!

351
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:11,508
What about you?

352
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:12,874
Because you were looking at me...!

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,300
Too self-conscious?

354
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:24,885
Way too much.

355
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:28,355
I thought you were staring
at me all the time...

357
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,625
That's what I thought too.

358
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,526
I thought, she must've fallen for me.

359
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:32,624
Yeah, me too.

360
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:33,895
And then I started blushing myself...

361
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,220
And turning away if I made eye contact...

362
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:36,861
And losing sleep worrying...

363
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,232
And thinking that I'd have

364
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,467
to take responsibility.

365
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:44,968
What, they solved it?

366
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:51,570
Thank goodness. Kano, I'm sorry.

367
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,745
What, so both of you were
jousting the windmill?

368
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,279
Yeah, seems Megumi-chan was troubled too.

369
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:00,453
So her name's Megumi-chan?

370
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,485
Yeah, Megumi-chan the
armchair love counselor.

371
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,225
Birds of a feather huh?

372
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:05,924
This is great.

373
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,363
Well, we didn't become a couple,
but we did become friends.

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,558
Huh? Then what about that gentian?

376
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:12,795
Tsuki...

377
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,066
Tsukino?

378
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:15,200
Yeah. It was all her evil plot.

379
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,039

380
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:18,835
Evil plot huh?

381
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:23,974
Tsuki had Yurika follow me around.
Can you believe that?!

384
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:30,011
But Kano always looks so unruffled
and all-knowing and couldn't care
less no matter what happens,

387
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:33,818
so it just makes me want to
have a little fun with her.

388
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,520
That's true.

389
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,924
Sis, not you too!

390
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,527
So in the beginning, it was just to scare me,

392
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,091
but after Megumi-chan came into the picture,

393
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,762
they changed plans and got the gentian!

394
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,190
It was more fun that way!

395
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:50,799
Tsukino... maybe you're...
picking on Kano too m...

397
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:53,103
What?

399
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,081
Why, Why...?

400
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,794
Will you accept the gentian this time?

401
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:15,359
What?  Then was the gentian
last time for me too?

403
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:18,297
I just assumed that was to trick Kano...

404
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:20,661
I gave them to you.

405
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,731
What? But why me...?

406
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,367
I'd always thought Kano
had such a nice sister...

408
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,971
Oh, I get it. So that's it!

409
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,415
Otherwise, there's no way

410
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,875
Yurika would have helped her fool me.

411
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,679
Would you please be my sister?

412
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,551
Um... I...

413
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:40,749
Tsuki.

414
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:44,161
Kano! Help... me...

415
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,553
Solve this one by yourself!

417
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,630
Sis thoughtlessly doesn't realize that
something's wrong with Arima-kun!

418
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:56,521
But unrelated to that,

419
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,127
Tonami Takefumi finally realizes his feelings!

420
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:01,732
And people don't realize what's going on!

421
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,571
If you want to know, pls. See next Act.
