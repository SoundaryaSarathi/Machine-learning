1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,109
It's not fair to control an innocent
boy's mind against his will!

2
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:08,490
As long as the moon shines
in the night sky,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,822
I will not overlook any evil deed!

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,328
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice!

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:19,363
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward,
I can say it in my dreams

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
My thoughts are about to short circuit,
I want to see you right now

8
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:08,312
Moonlight that makes me want to cry,
midnight that keeps me from calling

9
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Because I'm so innocent, what should
I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,535
Guided by the light of the moon

11
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
We will meet again and again

12
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:36,115
I count the sparkle of constellations
to foretell the future of my love

13
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:42,714
We were born in the same land,
miracle romance

14
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
I believe in it, miracle romance

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,160
Hi, I'm Usagi Tsukino.

16
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:02,408
As you know, I am the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

17
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,467
Sailor Moon!

18
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,737
At last, the fourth member of
our group appeared!

19
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:11,951
She's sweet and she's strong.

20
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,182
Makoto Kino is Sailor Jupiter!

21
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,025
With all four sailor warriors
together now,

22
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:21,823
it's like we're unbeatable now,
you know?

23
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,337
Love For Ami?!
A Boy Who Can Predicts The Future

24
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,441
There are a total of seven
rainbow crystals.

25
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,376
If we do not collect them all,

26
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,402
we cannot obtain the legendary
Silver Crystal.

27
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:43,482
I assume you are aware of this.

28
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,917
Yes, my lady.

29
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,147
Yes, we do have one
in our possession,

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,123
but another was taken by this
so-called Tuxedo Mask!

31
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,958
This is an appalling blunder.

32
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,949
I am terribly sorry.

33
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,860
Please do not worry, Queen Beryl.

34
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:01,323
He is certain to come after the
other rainbow crystals.

35
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,102
If we attack him then,

36
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:06,605
we will surely take back the
rainbow crystal from him.

37
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,808
Then, get a hold of the other
five rainbow crystals

38
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,643
at once.

39
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:15,214
Search them out so we can
revive our great ruler!

40
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:17,182
Safety + First

41
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:22,221
Safety + First
Danger Overhead

42
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,688
Math

43
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:24,957
Miss Mizuno!

44
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:25,691
Pardon the inconvenience
Miss Mizuno!

45
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,860
Pardon the inconvenience

46
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,418
Pardon the inconvenience
Oh, Urawa. Good morning.

47
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,194
Good morning. Well...

48
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,065
What is it? Is something the matter?

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,364
Watch out!

50
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,857
Are you all right?! Are you injured?!

51
00:03:57,857 --> 00:03:59,722
Juban Municipal Junior High School

52
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,431
It's the results of the midterm exam!

55
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,536
Oh, my mom's gonna get
mad at me again.

56
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:16,402
Oh man, your grade is bad, Usagi.
You should study more.

57
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,477
You, too, Mako!

00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:23,549
Oh, this is depressing.

61
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:24,850
Who's this Ryo Urawa in the top spot?

62
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,185

Ami's ranked second?!

65
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:31,551
Wow, I guess there's always
someone better.

66
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,720
Ami, you were so close!

67
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,763
I know. One more point would have
gotten me a perfect grade,

68
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,733
but I guess I still don't study enough.

69
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,936
She lives in a completely
different world than I do.

70
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,539
That kid who got a perfect score
in every subject

71
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,340
is in the same class as you, isn't he?

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,110
Yes, he is! He just transferred
to this school the other day!

73
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,578
Isn't it amazing how he did
so well so quickly?!

74
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,045
Oh, Urawa!

75
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,373

You should relax a little more.

78
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,810
Good luck!

82
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,658
So, you do like Ami!

83
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:43,362
That's from when Ami ranked
number one in the nation, right?!

84
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:46,565
Have you had feelings for Ami
since that long ago?

85
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,200
No...

86
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,171
I studied hard because my goal was to
be like Miss Mizuno and that's why...

87
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:57,476
I see, but you surpassed your goal.
Good going!

88
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:58,773
No, I'm not...

89
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:02,374
I just happened to be right about
what would be on the tests.

90
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,150
Miss Mizuno is far more
gifted than I am.

91
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,518
Here!
Miss Mizuno is far more
gifted than I am.

92
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,119
Okay!
Miss Mizuno is far more
gifted than I am.

93
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:07,517
Okay!

94
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,847
Besides, no matter how much
I care for Miss Mizuno...

95
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:14,159
No, it's nothing.

96
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,751
Here! Oh!
No, it's nothing.

97
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:27,606
I understand! Usagi will lend
you a helping hand!

98
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,403
Just leave it to me!

99
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:31,804
Miss Tsukino!

100
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,547
You should be careful
around water today.

101
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,310
What? Water?

102
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,683
There!

103
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:44,782
Shoot! It was too late.

104
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh, I'm so sorry!

105
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:54,897
Mamoru, where shall we go next?

106
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,130
Oh, right...

107
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,973
I'm getting a better idea about
my past, bit by bit,

108
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,373
but a lot of it is still unknown to me.

109
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,178
Do I have no choice, but to
become Tuxedo Mask

110
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,874
and get a hold of the legendary
Silver Crystal?

111
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:11,317
Mamoru!

112
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:14,019
Oh, sorry. What did you say?

113
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,789
Mamoru, you've been
acting weird lately.

114
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,490
Did something happen?

115
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,026
No, it's nothing. Shall we go?

116
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:21,627
Okay!
No, it's nothing. Shall we go?

117
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,093
Okay!

118
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:27,088
Parlor
Bear

119
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:32,664
Here, open it!

120
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:38,410
Is this for me?

121
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,741
Yeah, yeah!

122
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:45,451
It's not great, but isn't it so much
better than a newspaper clipping?

123
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:49,221
And she looks nice with that
sort of silly look on her face.

124
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,214
The Crescent Moon Wand is
responding! Could this boy be...

125
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,762
Thank you. I'll treasure this picture.

126
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,627
It's no problem at all.

127
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:02,534
So anyway, when are you going
to tell Ami that you like her?

128
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:06,505
Well, when I learned that I would
be transferring to this school,

129
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,507
I made up my mind.

130
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:11,377
That if I could do better in school
than her, I'd tell her how I feel!

131
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,445
That means you can do it
any day now, right?

132
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,844
Oh, but...

133
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,416
All right, when Ami gets out
of cram school tonight,

134
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,044
Usagi will bring her to you!

135
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,021
So, be ready!

136
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,181
Excuse me...

137
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,384
Miss Usagi!

138
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:28,287
2 Ice Cream Sodas
Parlor Bear

139
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,924
Miss Mizuno...

140
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,708
So, this boy is one of the
great Seven Monsters,

141
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,939
who possesses a rainbow crystal.

142
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,583
OK Cram School

143
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,618
OK Cram School
Hey, Usagi.

144
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,086
Hey, Usagi.

145
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:57,656
I've been meaning to say this
for a long time now, but...

146
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:57,856
OK Cram School

147
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:58,257
OK Cram School
What is it?

148
00:08:58,257 --> 00:08:58,857
OK Cram School
Really?
What is it?

149
00:08:58,857 --> 00:08:59,658
OK Cram School
Really?

150
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:00,090
Really?

151
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,425
Ami!

152
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:07,327
Oh, Usagi, what are you doing here?

153
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,467
I want you to come with me for a bit.

154
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:12,604
Let's go, Ami!

155
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:13,472
Wait...
Let's go, Ami!

156
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,166
Wait...

157
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,183
I've been waiting to see you, boy.

158
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,459
So, you're Zoisite?!

159
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,721
What?!

160
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,395
How do you know my name?
Explain yourself.

161
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:43,765
Ever since I was a kid, I've had
the power to predict the future.

162
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:47,470
And my power's been getting
stronger these days.

163
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:50,932
Thanks to that, I've also
figured out who I am.

164
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,941
An identity that I never
wanted to know about.

165
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:57,382
Then that simplifies things.

166
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:01,614
Now, turn into one of the greatest
monsters and kneel before me.

167
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,715
No!

168
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,224
I'd rather die

169
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,762
than become a pawn for the Devil!

170
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:13,826
Zoi!

171
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,334
Be a good boy and just surrender.

172
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,340
Hurry, hurry!

173
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,413
That's Zoisite!

174
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,558
Oh, no! Urawa's being attacked!

175
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,594
Both of you, transform now!

176
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,722
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

177
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:28,029
Mercury Power Makeup!

178
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,076
Stop right there!

179
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,407
Zoisite!

180
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:06,913
As long as the moon hangs
in the night sky,

181
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,781
I will not overlook any evil deed!

182
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:13,081
I'm the sailor warrior of love
and justice, Sailor Moon!

183
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:16,214
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!

184
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,385
We have arrived!

185
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:23,788
Are you planning to stop me?

186
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:28,067
Mercury, take Urawa somewhere safe.

187
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,261
Okay!

188
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,042
I don't have time to play with you.

189
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:42,574
Zoi!

190
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,188
Huh? What the?

191
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,892
I think we've come far enough
that we'll be safe here.

192
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,505
Thank you for rescuing me,
Miss Mizuno.

193
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,033
What?!

194
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,541
Why does he know my name?

195
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:19,083
Oh, how far did Mercury go?

196
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:20,985
Hey, Sailor Moon!

197
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:22,822
If you use the Crescent Moon Wand,

198
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,725
you'll be able to find both Urawa
and Sailor Mercury.

199
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:28,328
They'll definitely be where it responds!

200
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,762
What are you saying?!

201
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:32,799
That's like saying Urawa is a
rainbow crystal monster!

202
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,133
He is!

203
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,623
What?!

204
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:39,272
If you don't hurry, Sailor Mercury
will be in danger.

205
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:40,340
Are you sure about this?

206
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,773
Positive!

207
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,052
Oh?

208
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,892
It's a picture of me.

209
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,601
It happened again.

210
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,144
It seems like you were having
a bad dream.

211
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:22,012
It was not a dream. I was seeing what
would happen in the future.

212
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,483
What?!

213
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,213
I have a strange power that allows
me to predict the future.

214
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,945
That's why I was able to get
perfect scores on those exams.

215
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,358
What are you talking about?

216
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,622
You don't need to hide it
from me, Miss Mizuno.

217
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,824
I have idolized you for
a long time now,

218
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:43,262
but we are fated to fight one another!

219
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,728
You don't believe me?

220
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,573
Well, I don't know.

221
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:51,304
Because everything you've said
is completely off the mark.

222
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,075
And you're mistaking me
for Miss Mizuno.

223
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:59,775
I see. If you say so,
I will leave it at that, but...

224
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,154
But what?

225
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,884
If I turn into a monster,

226
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,723
please do not hesitate to kill me!

227
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:11,488
Because that, at least,
seems to be real.

228
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:18,535
Urawa, the future is yours to create!

229
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:21,474
If you give up, everything will happen
just as you think it will.

230
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:23,376
But as long as you have
faith in yourself,

231
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:26,709
you should be able to create
any future for yourself.

232
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,215
Miss Mizuno... No...

233
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:32,407
Sailor Mercury...

234
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,520
My, my, what an open display
of affection.

235
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,321
Do you think you can get away
from the Black Crystal?

236
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:44,664
Zoisite!

237
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,933
Oh, you're so protective.

238
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,701
But I wonder if you'll still do the same

239
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,931
when you see the boy's true form?

240
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:56,275
Urawa!

241
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,744
Look very carefully!

242
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:01,646
At the monster Bunbo, one of the
great Seven monsters.

243
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:12,825
Go, monster Bunbo!
Defeat that sailor warrior!

244
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,156
Urawa...

245
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,708
Bunbo!

246
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,471
Urawa...

247
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,884
The future is yours to create!

248
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,121
Bunbo!

249
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,927
This guy still has the heart of human!

250
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:02,803
Monster Bunbo, your opponent
is the sailor warrior!

251
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:09,177
Now, get the rainbow crystal
back from her!

252
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:12,880
Bunbo!

253
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,220
Zoisite!

254
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:24,024
It's not fair to control an innocent
boy's mind against his will!

255
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,292
I think you're misunderstanding!
That is the boy's true form!

256
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:35,508
Unforgivable!
You'll never get away with it!

257
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,568
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

258
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:43,311
Sailor Moon! Please turn Urawa
back into himself first!

259
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,313
Okay!

260
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,821
Moon Healing Escalation!

261
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,757
Bunbo!

262
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,798
Why didn't he change back?!

263
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,066
It's no use, Sailor Moon!

264
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:03,433
He's completely being controlled
by the evil power right now!

265
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,832
To restore him, you need to
weaken his energy first!

266
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,542
We just have to do it, Sailor Moon!

267
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:23,252
If I turn into a monster, please
do not hesitate to kill me!

268
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:25,291
Don't worry, Urawa.

269
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,426
We'll make sure to restore you
to your old self.

270
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,654
Bunbo!

271
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:38,335
Bunbo!

272
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:42,832
Fire

273
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:47,777
Soul!

274
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,843
Supreme

275
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:56,681
Thunder!

276
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:05,898
We almost missed our chance
to be in the spotlight.

277
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:07,024
No kidding.

278
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,127
Bubble

279
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,272
Spray!

280
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:23,078
Sailor Moon, now's our chance!
Hurry! Please help Urawa!

281
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:40,496
Moon Tiara Action!

282
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,405
Bunbo!

283
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:52,540
The monster's powers have been
weakened! Now, Sailor Moon!

284
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:01,712
Moon Healing Escalation!

285
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:06,949
Refresh!

286
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:13,260
Urawa!

287
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:19,336
Just you remember this!

288
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,874
Urawa, are you all right?

289
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,610
Miss Mizuno...

290
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:37,684
So, the third rainbow crystal has
gone to the sailor warriors.

291
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:41,053
I will quietly take my leave for today.

292
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,936
You're transferring again?
You sure don't settle down much.

293
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:53,906
Well, I have to go wherever
my dad's work takes him.

294
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:55,574
So it can't be helped.

295
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:58,304
And we'd just gotten
to be friends, too.

296
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,771
Um, Miss Mizuno...

297
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,113
Ryo, you can just call me, Ami.

298
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,753
Miss Ami, I want to return this to you.

299
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,220
Oh, shoot!
Miss Ami, I want to return this to you.

300
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,845
Oh, shoot!

301
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:18,898
When I get a better score than you
with my own abilities,

302
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll come back for that picture.

303
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,228
Ryo...

304
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,135
I like that picture better,
so take that with you.

305
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,820
Don't worry about grades.
Come and see me anytime, Ryo.

306
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,758
During the day,
the fragrance of flowers

307
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,373
During the night,
the twinkle of the stars

308
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:25,109
It's a world no one knows about

309
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:29,012
With white shoes clicking

310
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,822
Cross the white moon bridge

311
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:40,922
And there lives a princess,
dreaming of a sweet kiss

312
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:47,566
Offer a prayer to the moon

313
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:56,306
It will surely bring you happiness

314
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:03,514
Go round and round,
the moon's merry-go-round

315
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:11,790
Make that serene dress made of glass
flutter in the wind

316
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:19,335
She's always watching over us

317
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:25,831
Moon, moon princess
