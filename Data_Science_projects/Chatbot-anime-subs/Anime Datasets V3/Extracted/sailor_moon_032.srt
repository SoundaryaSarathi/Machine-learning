1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,869
How dare you manipulate the
children's hero, Red Man,

2
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:06,604
and turn the special natural treasure,

3
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:09,474
Lake Akan's Marimo Balls,
into weapons?!

4
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:11,809
The Hokkaido Tourist Association

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,175
never gave you permission
to do that, did they?!

6
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:19,241
In the name of the moon,
Sailor Moon will punish you!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,874
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute
yume no naka nara ieru

8
00:00:54,874 --> 00:01:01,336
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen
ima sugu aitai yo

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:08,311
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight
denwa mo dekinai midnight

10
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,752
Datte junjou dou shiyou
heart wa mangekyou

11
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:22,292
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare

12
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:28,667
Nando mo meguriau

13
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:35,808
Seiza no matataki kazoe
uranau koi no yukue

14
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,712
Onaji kuni ni umareta
no miracle romance

15
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:49,150
Shinjite iru no miracle romance

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,465
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

17
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,466
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of
love and justice, Sailor Moon.

18
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,278
But it's not easy, you know.

19
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,214
I have to get a hold of the
legendary Silver Crystal

20
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,216
before the bad guys get it,

21
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:15,087
but to do that, I have to find the
seven rainbow crystals!

22
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:19,525
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got
four sailor warriors now,

23
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,356
so it'll work out somehow.

24
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:32,032
Umino's Resolve! I'll Protect Naru

25
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,774
Code name 0091. This is Luna.

26
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:50,356
My secret password is "The rabbit
on the moon makes rice cakes."

27
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,789
Please respond.

28
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,328
"The moon rice cakes are sticky."

29
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:58,161
"When I grilled them, they puffed up."

30
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,256
So, how are the Sailor Warriors
coming along?

31
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,870
Well, one of them still needs
to be more self-aware,

32
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,173
but the rest of them are
doing fairly well.

33
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:10,276
The day when all five sailor warriors
will come together is near.

34
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,944
What? Really?

35
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:14,780
Yes. Therefore, I think it may be good

36
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,149
to tell them about that issue soon.

37
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,151
Are you sure?

38
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,955
The Dark Kingdom seems to be
getting impatient these days.

39
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:26,652
We need to heighten the sailor
warriors' awareness of the situation.

40
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,517
I understand.

41
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,289
Finally, it's time to tell
them everything.

42
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,138
What does Luna want with
us in the middle of night?

43
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,220
Everyone's here, I see.

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,415
Has another monster appeared?

45
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,165
You must not be surprised!

46
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,100
Oh, you scared me!

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,625
Listen very carefully to what
I'm about to say.

48
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:18,477
I was sent here from that moon!

49
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,078
What?!

50
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:19,879
From the moon?!
What?!

51
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,246
From the moon?!
Why?!

52
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,380
No way!
Why?!

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,709
No way!

54
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:27,386
Why did you come to Earth?

55
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,650
To awaken you girls.

56
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,351
This is sort of unbelievable.

57
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:36,353
But if Luna says so,
I'll believe her.

58
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,457
Thank you, Ami.

59
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:43,634
The princess you're looking for is a
descendant of the Moon Kingdom.

60
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,271
A descendant?

61
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,829
Of the Moon Kingdom?

62
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:50,009
There's a kingdom on the moon?

63
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,111
It's like a fairy tale.

64
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:55,514
You girls are certain to
find the princess.

65
00:04:55,514 --> 00:05:00,110
And you have to protect the princess.
There's not a moment to lose.

66
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:03,656
Hey, Luna.

67
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,293
Is there really a rabbit on the moon
that makes rice cakes?

68
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,124
Excuse me!

69
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,039
Beautiful.

70
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,136
They really are pretty.

71
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,812
However. The true beauty of the
rainbow crystals is only revealed

72
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,643
when all seven are gathered together.

73
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,481
Do you not think so?

74
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,574
For you, Master Kunzite,

75
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:36,717
I shall get a hold of the rest
of the rainbow crystals.

76
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,952
I will be counting on you.

77
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:41,760
Once we get all seven
rainbow crystals,

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,627
we will be able to obtain the
legendary Silver Crystal.

79
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,501
I want the legendary Silver Crystal
as soon as possible,

80
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,403
so that I may see Queen Beryl
smile with delight.

81
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:54,167
Oh! This is not fair!

82
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,885
That fried shrimp looks so good.

83
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,453
Trade it for my green pepper?

84
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,921
If you want it, here you go.

85
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,490
Thanks!

86
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,493
Woohoo! You two make
a perfect couple!

87
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,162
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend now?

88
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,754
Do we look like it?

89
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:23,700
We're not like that! We're just
friends. Just friends.

90
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:27,729
Just friends?

91
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,173
Friends, huh?

92
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,850
Umino's not a bad person,

93
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,978
and he helps me study
since he's smart...

94
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:46,120
But I just don't have that
special feeling for him.

95
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,996
You can't be so moony!

96
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,798
This is where you have to
be more aggressive!

97
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,028
But I don't know what to do.

98
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:58,637
Then, since I have lots of
experience in romance,

99
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:00,332
I will tell you what to do.

100
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,800
Here it is! You need to transform
into a cool guy!

101
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:07,712
A cool guy? For example?

102
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,449
Be just like Tuxedo Mask!

103
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,542
Tuxedo Mask would be?

104
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:15,510
Tuxedo Mask is...

105
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,763
I see! So, if I become
this Tuxedo Mask,

106
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:27,366
I'll get to be Naru's boyfriend?!

107
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,668
What? No, uh, that's
not what I meant.

108
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:32,605
You need to learn from Tuxedo
Mask's example and...

109
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:36,234
Okay! Starting today, I will
be Tuxedo Mask!

110
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,041
This is the birth of
Tuxedo Umino Mask!

111
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,856
Hey, has someone been following
us for a while?

112
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,323
What?

113
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,503
Be good, be good now! Stop it!

114
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,805
Tuxedo Umino Mask is here!

115
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:08,874
Evil minion, baring your
fangs at Naru!

116
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:11,104
In the name of justice,
I will punish you!

117
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,111
What are you doing?!

118
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:18,039
Excuse you! How frightened you
must be, my poor doggy.

119
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,044
What are you doing, Umino?

120
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:25,179
I am not Umino.

121
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:30,359
I am Tuxedo Umino Mask
of love and justice!

122
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,032
Well, then. Good-bye!

123
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:34,590
What the heck?

124
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:41,106
Crown

125
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,474
Crown
Hey, you wanna go in for a bit?

126
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:43,075
Crown
Good idea.

127
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:43,666
Good idea.

128
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:48,207
No! You must never make stops
on your way home!

129
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,849
You will end up spending
all your allowance, too.

130
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,419
However, if you absolutely
insist on it...

131
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:57,355
You have to step over
Tuxedo Umino Mask!

132
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:00,551
Excuse us, then!

133
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:08,699
Tuxedo Umino Mask may die,
but justice will live on!

134
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,864
What's wrong with Umino?

135
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,375
Who knows...

136
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,043
Hi, Usagi!

137
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,510
Motoki!

138
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:23,148
Oh, that's right. I have
two free tickets.

139
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:24,316
Are you interested in going?

140
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:27,219
Free tickets?! For two?!

141
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,388
He's asking me out on a date!

142
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:33,722
A movie with Motoki!
Yes! I feel a little shy!

143
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,330
I'm too old for the Red Man Show
at the amusement park, so...

144
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,854
Red Man Show?!

145
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:44,530
Oh, I guess you guys are too old
for the Red Man Show, too.

146
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:47,673
I'll take them!

147
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,834
What?! You're going to go?!

148
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,378
No, you and Umino are going!

149
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,612
What?!

150
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:55,705
I shall accompany you!

151
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,179
I'm not sure about this.

152
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:03,322
Umino's trying really hard
in his own way.

153
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,057
You should be understanding of that.

154
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:07,685
That's okay. I'm not...
I'm just not...

155
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:14,865
Okay, okay. I get it. I'll go.
Happy now?

156
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:22,799
Yes! Tuxedo Umino Mask is
cheerful yet again today!

157
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,375
Come forth, my new power!

158
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,047
I have managed to improve
the Black Crystal.

159
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:44,818
With this, I'll be able to transform
humans into monsters.

160
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,559
Master Kunzite,

161
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:55,340
soon, I shall steal the rainbow crystals
back from the sailor warriors.

162
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,814
Jewelry

163
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,257
In order to lure Sailor Moon
out into the open,

164
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,226
I'll use Naru Osaka by turning
her into a monster.

165
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:20,756
Who is it?

166
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,328
Tuxedo Mask!

167
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:29,641
He found out what I was going
to do already? Impressive.

168
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:33,600
Out of respect for you, I shall
withdraw this time.

169
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,679
What the heck was that?!

170
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:47,290
But I'm glad I was here.

171
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,796
Who's there?

172
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:53,196
It's Tuxedo Umino Mask!

173
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:56,735
What time do you think
it is right now?!

174
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:01,604
Well, we haven't decided on a meeting
time for tomorrow, so...

175
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,576
Naru!

176
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:08,273
When should I be at the amusement
park tomorrow?!

177
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:13,616
9 o'clock? 10 o'clock? 11 o'clock?!
12 o'clock?! Hello?!

178
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,048
Okay, I'll see you at 12 o'clock.

179
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:20,124
Okay, 12 o'clock then? Let's
have lunch together!

180
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:26,253
Tuxedo Umino Mask will make lots
of your favorite fried shrimp!

181
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,932
Usagi, what happened to your
task of finding the princess?!

182
00:12:58,932 --> 00:12:59,966
After everything I told you!

183
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:00,800
Monster Fighter
Red Man Show
After everything I told you!

184
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,569
Monster Fighter
Red Man Show
You weren't listening to a
word I said, were you?

185
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:06,739
Monster Fighter
Red Man Show
I was listening. But see,
as a sentimental girl,

186
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:09,375
Monster Fighter
Red Man Show
I'm worried about how my friend's
romantic life is going.

187
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,740
Monster Fighter
Red Man Show
Can you understand that?

188
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:14,581
Honestly! You have absolutely
no sense of duty.

189
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,183
Anyway, why are you following me?

190
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,352
As a sentimental messenger
from the moon,

191
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:21,754
I'm worried about my foolish
sailor warrior's actions.

192
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,244
Can you understand that?

193
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,725
Oh, there they are!

194
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,527
Hey, Usagi!

195
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,688
Monster Fighter, Red Man

196
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,926
Red Man has arrived!

197
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,236
Monster Fighter, Red Man

198
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,828
Monster Fighter, Red Man
Red Man, Leg Attack!

199
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:43,503
I'm glad you didn't come
in that weird outfit.

200
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,380
Are you kidding? It's right in there.

201
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,872
If something should happen, I'll
transform, so please don't worry.

202
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,151
Oh, boy...

203
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,219
Red Man, Punch!
Oh, boy...

204
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,413
Red Man, Punch!

205
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:02,887
Black Crystal, transform
that girl into a monster.

206
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,706
Zoi!

207
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:17,667
Victory! Red Man!

208
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,195
He transformed into a monster!

209
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,197
It's a monster against monster fight!

210
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,766
Monster Akan has arrived!

211
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:42,201
Monster?!

212
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,331
Oh, I cannot believe I messed up.

213
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:48,974
Go! Go!

214
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:54,237
Take these Marimo Balls
from Lake Akan!

215
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:00,420
What the heck are you doing?!

216
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,887
It's dangero...

217
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,057
Luna, what's going on?!

218
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,592
This must be the work of
the Dark Kingdom!

219
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:08,059
Naru!

220
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:14,367
Take these Marimo Balls
from Lake Akan!

221
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,069
Run, Naru!

222
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:17,303
Usagi!

223
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:18,538
You cannot run now!

224
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,005
Stop it!

225
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:24,877
Umino!

226
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:27,869
Tuxedo Umino Mask will protect Naru!

227
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,549
Take these fried shrimp!

228
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,680
Don't! Umino!

229
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,681
Why you!

230
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:42,761
Akan!

231
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:44,829
Umino!

232
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:50,263
Tuxedo Umino Mask will protect Naru,

233
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,406
even if it costs me my life!

234
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,807
Umino...

235
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:01,240
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

236
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:38,716
Eat this!

237
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,648
Akan! Akan! Akan!

238
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:44,456
Umino!

239
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:52,331
Naru, hurry! Run!

240
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,669
Umino!

241
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,136
Akan!

242
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,175
No!

243
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:06,212
How dare you turn the
natural treasure,

244
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:08,214
Lake Akan's Marimo Balls,
into weapons!

245
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,583
The Hokkaido Tourist Association

246
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,085
never gave you permission
to do that, did they?!

247
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:14,554
Akan!

248
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:20,049
I'm the sailor warrior
of love and justice,

249
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,695
Sailor Moon!

250
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:30,995
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

251
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:36,375
All's well that ends well, I guess.

252
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,677
Zoisite!

253
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:42,815
I was waiting for you, Sailor Moon.
I have a favor to ask.

254
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,282
What?!

255
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:49,717
Please give me the rainbow
crystal that you have.

256
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,991
You've gotta be kidding!

257
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:55,261
Then, you don't mind if everybody
wrapped in Marimo Balls

258
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,529
suffocates and dies?

259
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:57,330
What?!

260
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,030
In a couple more minutes,
What?!

261
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,798
In a couple more minutes,

262
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,858
the people trapped inside will begin
to have difficulty breathing!

263
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:16,238
Now, hand over the rainbow crystal!

264
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,811
Come on now! I'm waiting here!

265
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,155
Okay...

266
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,826
Here.

267
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,386
Good girl.

268
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,768
You're...

269
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:37,429
Tuxedo Mask!

270
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:41,107
I cannot let you have that
rainbow crystal!

271
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,574
Shut up!

272
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,847
Akan!

273
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,286
Zoi!

274
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:09,624
Tuxedo Umino Mask... is fighting.

275
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:33,581
Moon Tiara Action!

276
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,621
Just a little bit, okay?!

277
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:50,441
Moon Healing Escalation!

278
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,069
Refresh!

279
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:13,892
Wow, Usagi did pretty
well on her own.

280
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,537
Oh! No!

281
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,095
The rainbow crystal!

282
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:21,840
What?!

283
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:25,411
I have the rainbow crystal now.

284
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,845
No way! Give that back!

285
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:29,837
Good day.

286
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,606
Darn that Zoisite!

287
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,243
The rainbow crystal!

288
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,952
I will get that rainbow crystal back!

289
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,630
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!

290
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,365
You do not need to thank me.

291
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:49,163
When I have gotten the rainbow
crystal back, I will take it.

292
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:51,436
What?

293
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:53,801
Good-bye. We shall meet again.

294
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:58,401
Monster Fighter, Red Man

295
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,845
Red Man has arrived!

296
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,185
I guess that was part of the show!

297
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,421
That was amazing! I've never seen
something like that before!

298
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:08,554
Monster Fighter, Red Man
That was amazing! I've never seen
something like that before!

299
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,989
Monster Fighter, Red Man
Red Man, Leg Attack!

300
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:11,422
Monster Fighter, Red Man

301
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,062
Thank you, Umino. You were very cool!

302
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,963
Just call me Tuxedo Umino Mask.

303
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:22,724
Tuxedo Umino Mask...

304
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,014
Usagi!

305
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:39,318
Letting the rainbow crystal get
stolen was a huge failure.

306
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,252
Are you listening, Usagi?!

307
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,018
Please tell me, music box...

308
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:54,328
I don't understand what's on
Tuxedo Mask's mind.

309
00:21:57,536 --> 00:22:00,266
I will take the rainbow crystal.

310
