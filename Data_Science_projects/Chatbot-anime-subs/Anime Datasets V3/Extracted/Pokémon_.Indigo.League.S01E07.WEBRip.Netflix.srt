Ah, it's a great day
to just enjoy the sunshine.

26
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,529
And while you're enjoying
the sunshine,

27
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,448
-Gary's catching more Pokémon.
-Ah!

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,285
But I guess a Pokémon trainer can capture
Pokémon and enjoy the sun.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
Pika.

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,040
Hey! Wait a minute!

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,250
Cha.

32
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,795
-Where do you think you're going?
-Oh, I know where we're going.

33

-We're going to Cerulean City.
-Ah! Cerulean City?

34
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,800
What are you going there for?

35
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,970
Well, it's none of your business,
but I'm going for more badges.

36
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,016
Uh, Ash, you don't want Pokémon
from there. Trust me.

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,685
-Why not?
-Because they're all...

38
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,020
All what?

39
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,315
...very scary ghost Pokémon
that look like this.

40
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,776
Like monsters.

41
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,698
[laughs]

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,493
Nice face, Misty. Come on, Brock.
Let's go, Pikachu.

43
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,497
Hey, hey! Wait a second!
Hey, what about Vermilion City?

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,208
It's right on the water
and there are lots of neat Pokémon

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,794
and you can watch all the giant yachts
pulling into the harbor.

46
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,755
And there's a little park way up
on a hill

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,466
where you can sit and watch the sunset.
That's so romantic.

48
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,550
Uh-huh.

49
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,763
It's much nicer than that old
Cerulean City, so let's get going!

50
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,391
-Okay. Let's go.
-Really?

51
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,977
-To Cerulean City.
- Ah. Unh!

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,939
[Ash] I've got to get
more trainer badges, Brock.

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,233
And since there's a Gym
in Cerulean City

54
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,442
[Brock] Yeah, makes sense to me.

55
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,822
Ah, I never wanted to wander back here.
Oh.

56
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,086
-The coast is clear.
-Nothing to fear.

57
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,548
Nobody here. Meowth.

58
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,224
Well, looks like we found it.

59
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,352
[Jessie] Just what we need
to get just what we want.

60
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,313
Pokémon.

61
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,905
-So this is Cerulean City, eh, Brock?
-Pretty nice place, isn't it?

62
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,075
Yeah, pretty cool.
Hey, look. That's weird.

63
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,203
-Misty's not following us anymore.
-Chu.

64
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,415
She really didn't want to come
to Cerulean City, did she?

65
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,126
I wonder why she hates
this place so much.

66
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,296
-Hmm.
-Ah, we'll never figure out girls.

67
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,882
[sirens wailing]

68
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,010
-The police. Wonder what happened.
-Yeah.

69
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,767
Excuse me.
Do you know what happened here?

70
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,060
Some burglars broke
into that store last night.

71
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,520
Burglars, huh?

72
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,856
[girl] What do you know about burglars?
-Huh?

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,818
You two look very suspicious
to me.

74
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,363
Hey, you're that motorcycle officer
from Viridian.

75
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,992
Huh? Ah, you must have met
my sister-in-law.

76
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,577
If you know my sister-in-law,

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,830
that means you probably had some
dealings with the police in Viridian.

78
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,290
Well, I...

79
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,877
Now, maybe you just stopped
to ask her for directions,

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,963
or maybe you found a wallet
on the street and turned it in to her,

81
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,758
or maybe you're a burglar
who broke out of jail!

82
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,594
-I've never been to jail!
-Neither have I, ma'am.

83
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,262
That's what they all say.

84
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,139
We just got into town
and saw the crowd

85
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,974
so we came over to see
what was going on.

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,937
The criminal always returns
to the scene of the crime.

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,357
-We're not, uh...
-Maybe this'll help clear things up.

88
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,569
<i>I'm Dexter, A Pokédex</i>
<i>program by professor Oak</i>

89
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,655
<i>for Pokémon trainer Ash Ketchum.</i>

90
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,616
Yeah and I was the Leader
of the Pewter City Gym.

91
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:29,329
-Well, that's evidence enough for me.
-I'm sorry I was suspicious.

92
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:34,209
Now I'm suspicious of my sister-in-law.
She sure has weird taste in friends.

93
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,293
-[Brock] Um, miss?
- Hm?

94
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,754
I was wondering,
since I'm new in town,

95
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,340
maybe we could get together tonight
and you could show me around.

96
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,301
Well, I'm not off duty
till past your bedtime

97
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,055
and I may even have to work
round the clock to catch these burglars.

98
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,850
-Well, what exactly did they steal?
-That's the strange thing about it.

99
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:55,230
They didn't take any money,
just a massive vacuum and a giant hose.

100
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,691
But what would anybody
want that stuff for?

101
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm sure I don't know, young man,

102
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,070
but I do know I don't have time
to play guessing games with you

103
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,948
because I've got a job to do,
and it's time for you two to move along.

104
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,907
Come on, let's go.

105
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,618
All right, everybody.
The show's over.

106
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,370
Nothing to see here.
Break it up. Break it up.

107
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,957
Good thing I had Dexter
and you had your badge.

108
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,918
Yeah. Shouldn't you head
for Cerulean City Gym?

109
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,670
Yeah. Hey, Brock.

110
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,131
You got any inside info
on the Gym Trainer there?

111
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,924
-Huh?
-Ha-ha.

112
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,218
I just want to find out
as much as I can about him

113
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,303
before we have our match.

114
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,765
Know yourself, know your adversary
and you hold the key to victory.

115
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,642
You sure know
some pretty deep stuff.

116
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,186
Heh, I learned that one from Dexter.

117
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,231
Well, I never actually met
the trainer here but I know

118
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,941
his Pokémon special move.

119
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,484
Yeah? What is it?

120
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,362
I'm sorry, Ash, but I can't
give you that information.

121
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,990
-Why not?
-I'm a Gym Leader, too, after all.

122
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,742
I can't tell you out of respect.

123
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,994
-You understand.
-That's cool.

124
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,371
Well, I have some stuff
I need to check out.

125
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,916
-What stuff?
-Just stuff. See you later.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,129
-Bye. Well, let's get going, Pikachu.
-Pika.

127
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,552
Cerulean City Gym.
Cerulean City Gym.

128
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,639
Should be right around here someplace.

129
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,392
Huh? There it is.

[music playing over speakers]

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,186
But I thought this was
the Pokémon Gym, Pikachu.

138
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,146
Pika.

139
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,914
I can't understand it.

140
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,796
Huh? It's like an aquarium.
How can this be a Pokémon Gym?

141
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,216
-[girl 1] The crowd was totally awesome.
-[girl 2] I know. That was so great.

142
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,595
-Daisy, the dive you did was super.
-The practice really paid off.

143
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,557
Totally.
[all giggling]

144
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,058
-[Ash] Uh, excuse me.
-I'm sorry

145
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,228
but if you want an interview,
you have to, like, call our manager.

146
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,064
-No, it's not that.
-We don't do autographs.

147
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,149
I don't want one.

148
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,068
I really just wanted to know
if this is a Pokémon Gym.

149
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,236
[Girl]
It sure is.

150
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,698
- Well, I'm looking for the Gym Trainer.
-[Girl] You're looking at them.

151
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,699
Huh?

152
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,495
The three of us
are the Gym Trainers here.

153
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,665
-We're The Sensational Sisters.
-We're world famous.

154
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,043
Huh? But what's with
all that swimming?

155
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,337
It's, like, our hobby,
and our fans love to watch us perform.

156
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
We pool our talents
to make a big splash.

158
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,386

-I challenge all of you.
-Pika.

-Um.
-What?

161
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,644
We don't feel much like
battling anymore.

162
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,065
-What do you mean?
-We just got beaten three times in a row

163

by kids from this nowhere place
called Pallet Town.

164
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,613
-Not again.
-It was just one defeat after another.

00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,448
My eyes were spinning from all the losses.

166
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,867
We had to, like,
practically rush all our Pokémon

167
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,787
-to the Pokémon center.
-This is the only one left.

168
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,504
Goldeen. Goldeen. Goldeen.

169
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,215
You mean all you have
is a Goldeen?

170
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,053
If it would evolve into Seaking,
we could use it.

171
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,263
But all it can do now
is its horn attack.

172
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,808
So, like, there's no point in battling.

173
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,518
Now, Instead of having matches

174
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,687
we have time to make ourselves
look more beautiful than ever.

175
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,232
-Ah.
-I know what you want.

176
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,400
Seel?

177
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,780
Seel.

178
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,991
A cascade Badge.
This is what you want, right?

179
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:21,579
-You can have it.
-Thanks. Uh, I'd rather earn my badges.

180
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,540
Take it. A badge is a badge.

181
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,628
[sighs] Here.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,465
Hold it right there!

183
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,342
-[Ash] Misty?
-Cha!

184
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,053
Hi-yah!

185
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
All right, Daisy. If you don't want
to battle him, I will.

186
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,724
[gasps]

187
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,018
If you don't want to battle him,
I will.

188
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,395
What do you mean?

189
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,982
-I'm a Cerulean City trainer too.
-[Pikachu and Ash gasp]

190
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:54,028
-I'm the fourth Sensational Sister.
-There are only three Sensational Sisters

191
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,572
and one runt.

192
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,698
[grunts angrily]

193
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,410
So, little sister, it's a surprise
to see you back so soon.

194
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,371
That little girl with a big mouth
who said she wouldn't come back

195
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,707
till she was a great Pokémon trainer.
Wasn't that you?

196
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,127
Huh? I guess I did say something
like that when I left.

197
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,214
So that's why Misty was so dead set
against coming here.

198
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,302
Misty, you left here pretending you wanted
to become a Pokémon trainer

199
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,429
because you couldn't compare with us.

200
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,558
Because we're obviously much more
talented and beautiful than you are.

201
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,185
-Uh-oh.
-That wasn't the reason!

202
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,396
Well, then, I guess,
like, you came back

203
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,523
because you couldn't make it
as a Pokémon trainer.

204
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,317
It wasn't my idea to come back here.

205
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,986
The only reason I'm here
is because he wanted to come.

206
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,489
Well, he's totally not someone
I'd choose for a boyfriend.

207
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,533
-Ah!
-But you're no prize yourself.

208
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,287
My boyfriend? If I battle him,
that'll prove I'm not a quitter

209
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,164
and I'm just as good a trainer
as you three.

210
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,418
Well, you are the only one of us
with a Pokémon that can actually battle.

211
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,379
All right, Ash.
Are you ready to rumble?

212
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,048
Uh.

213
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,306
I wasn't planning
on challenging you

214
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,559
till you paid me back for my bike,
but this is as good a time as any.

215
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,938
If you want that cascade badge,
you're going to have to beat me.

216
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,106
It'll be my pleasure.

217
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,901
Pikachu, this one's
going to be a piece of cake.

218
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,239
-So how many Pokémon?
-Two against two works for me.

219
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,243
You got it.
All right, then, Pikachu, I choose you!

220
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,204
-Huh?
-Chu.

221
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,124
-Pikachu, what are you doing?
-Chu. Chu.

222
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,962
Uh, what? Are you saying you
don't want to battle with Misty?

223
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,506
-Pikachu.
-Well, I guess it's okay

224
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,132
If you don't want to battle a friend.

225
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,259
Pikachu, you're a Pika pal!

226
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,013
-Pikachu!
-Thanks a lot, Pikachu.

227
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,146
Butterfree, I choose you!

228
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,608
[chitters]

229
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,736
Well, in that case, Misty calls Staryu!

230
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,784
-[grunts]
-Huh? Hmm.

231
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,747
[Pokédex]
<i>Staryu, the core of this water Pokémon</i>

232
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,958
<i>shines in a rainbow of seven colors.</i>

233
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,961
<i>A core that is valued</i>
<i>by some as a type of jewelry.</i>

234
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,921
Oh. Wow.

235
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,341
Leave it to a girl
to show off her jewelry.

236
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,385
Quit stalling and let's get
this show on the road.

237
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,848
-Do you think Misty could really win?
-Like, in her dreams, maybe.

238
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,436
Butterfree, you can blow that thing
away with one blast. Tackle it!

239
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,896
[squeals]
[grunting and groaning]

240
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,484
-Staryu, counter attack!
-Butterfree, dodge!

241
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,071
[chitters]

242
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,282
[groans]

243
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,202
-Ha-ha! I'm going to win this.
-Staryu, water gun.

244
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,256
In that case, Stun Spore now.

245
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, no.
Staryu looks like it's in real pain.

246
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,728
It doesn't even have a face.
How can you tell?

247
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,814
Because I'm sensitive
to others' feelings, that's how.

248
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,527
-Oh, yeah? Like, I'm not?
-Which side are you clapping for?

249
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,780
Staryu, wash it off.

250
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,789
Yay! Too bad you didn't know
that Stun Spore doesn't work

251
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,040
if you wash it off in water.

252
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,211
She thinks she knows everything.
Butterfree, Sleep Powder.

253
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,802
Tackle it from underwater.

254
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,479
If Staryu can get butterfree underwater,
I win.

255
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,774
Water Pokémon
always have the edge in the water.

256
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,192
[laughs]

257
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,443
[grunts]

258
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,155
Pikachu, you're supposed
to be on my side.

259
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,116
Misty's totally awesome.

260
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,368
Well, we three
got the good looks in the family

261
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,620
so I guess she had to get
some talent.

262
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,794
Butterfree, return.

263
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,217
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

264
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,430
[grunting]

265
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,683
Oh, yeah? Staryu, return!

266
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,813
Misty calls Starmie!

267
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,068
Pidgeotto, Whirlwind it away!

268
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,823
Dive under, then up.

269
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,912
-[squawks]
-Strike back with wing attack.

270
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,254
-[squawks]
-Give it a gust to blow it away.

271
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,217
[squawks]

272
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,680
-[sighs]
-Starmie!

273
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,931
[Starmie dings]

274
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,643
Oh, no. Starmie's energy
is just about to run out.

275
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,605
All right, Pidgeotto.
Let's get that trainer badge.

276
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,648
[rumbling]
Huh?

277
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,733
[screaming]

278
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,784
-Check out that hair.
-Like, who invited the party crashers?

279
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,786
[Jessie] Sorry to break in on you, ladies.

280
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,622
[James] Allow us to introduce ourselves.

281
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:42,793
-To protect the world from devastation.
-To unite all peoples within our nation.

282
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,924
-To denounce the evils of truth and love.
-To extend our reach to the stars above.

283
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,301
-Jessie.
-James.

284
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,889
Team rocket.
Blast off at the speed of light.

285
00:16:54,972 --> 00:17:00,311
-Surrender now, or prepare to fight.
-Meowth, that's right.

286
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,941
-The water Pokémon have the advantage.
-But if we steal that water away.

287
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,986
-The Pokémon are ours for the taking.
-And Meowth knows just how to do it.

288
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,448
What are they trying to prove?
[gasp]

289
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,409
[engine rumbling]

290
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,122
A massive vacuum and a giant hose.

291
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,210
Ah! Team rocket were the robbers
who broke into that store back there.

292
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,380
-I should have known it was them.
-Our swimming pool.

293
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,799
-They're sucking it dry.
-That's our water.

294
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,260
Right. I should give it back.

295
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,388
[screaming]

296
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,100
-We've got to protect the Pokémon.
-Like, what about my hair?

297
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,811
All right, now's the time to suck them up.

298
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,234
[groaning]
Come back, Seel.

299
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,194
[Ash]
Oh, Pikachu.

300
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,240
[Pikachu screams]
Pikachu!

301
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey, wait a second.
Water conducts electricity.

302
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:02,164
-Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
-Pikachu!

303
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,837
[screaming]

304
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,007
It's times like these
that make me want to go straight.

305
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,883
[groan]

306
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,345
Now I know how it feels
to be all washed up.

307
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,057
We'll never come clean.
[screaming]

308
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,018
[Seel cheering]

309
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,979
[All] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again!

310
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,691
[screaming]

311
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,443
-Oh, no.
-Pikachu!

312
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,446
[panting]

313
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,827
Pikachu!

314
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,333
Pikachu.

315
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,174
-Hey, we never got to finish our match.
-Yeah.

316
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,135
-And I was just about to win it too.
-What?

317
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,222
You could say your match had
to be postponed, like, due to drain.

318
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,059
-At least nobody lost.
-I wanted to win.

319
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,686
I guess I'm not going to get
that Cascade Badge.

320
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,398
-Wrong. We're giving this badge to you.
-Huh?

321
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,817
How come he gets the badge?
He didn't win.

322
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,945
Pikachu was the one that,
like, totally saved us all.

323
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,906
And if he'd used Pikachu from the start

324
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,784
there was no way your
water Pokémon could have won.

325
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,036
-Oh, man.
-Take the badge, Ash.

326
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,246
-You deserve it.
-Gee, thanks.

327
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,169
-Heh, I'll take it!
-Cha!

328
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,715
[narrator] <i>And so Ash earns</i>
<i>his second Pokémon trainer badge.</i>

329
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,637
Misty, you just go right on
trying to be a Pokémon trainer.

330
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,349
You might as well be good at something
'cause you'll never be stars like us.

331
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,601
You keep that up,
and you'll be seeing stars.

332
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,812
-Chill out.
-Misty, be careful.

333
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,022
-You know we love you.
-Yeah.

334
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,025
-Ash. Hey, man.
-Yo, Brocko.

335
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,277
-How'd it go?
-See for yourself.

336
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,114
-Cool. Let's go.
-Right.

337
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,241
You're not leaving without me.

338
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,743
Misty, you're not going be
a sore loser, are you?

339
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,704
I didn't lose anything. It was a draw.

340
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,497
[Ash] Well, I'm the one who got the badge.

341
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,708
[Misty] What?
You know you lost with Butterfree.

342
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,127
[Ash] That was just round one.
I made a great comeback.

343
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,671
[Misty] If team rocket hadn't busted in,
I would have destroyed you.

344
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,798
[Ash] You're lucky they showed up.
You were about to lose.

345
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,425
[Misty] Lose? I was just getting started.

346
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,676
-[Ash] Oh, yeah?
-[Misty] Oh, yeah.

347
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,635
[Brock] Oh, brother.
