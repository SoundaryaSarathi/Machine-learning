00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

Neon Genesis

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's eating the Angel?

23
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,790
Those bindings were what allowed
us to control the Eva's power.

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,720
But now the Eva is removing the
web that binds it to our will.

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,890
Unit 01's been awakened
and set free.

26
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,730
SEELE won't stay quiet for this.

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,070
The Eva series aren't capable of
generating S2 organs themselves.

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,340
But we never imagined it'd be able
to take one into itself this way.

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,980
This incident is at extreme odds
with the scenario SEELE created.

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
It will not be easy to correct this.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,280
It was a mistake to entrust NERV
to Gendo Ikari, wasn't it?

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,320
But he was the only one who could
achieve this project's goals.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,260
Ikari, what's going on
in your mind?

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,660
It's begun, hasn't it?

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,160
Yes, this is the beginning.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
Episode 20
Shape of the Heart

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,000
Damage on both Evas

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,440
is over the Henflick limit, beyond
any normal restoration.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,940
It may be a while before we can
restore everything to normal.

40
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,880
Fortunately, the MAGI system can
be transferred to a new location.

41
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,580
We may be able to start
working tomorrow.

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,080
But this place will have
to be scrapped.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,790
It's just a matter of time before the
brass decides to abandon it.

44
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,190
That's true.

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,360
For the time being, we'll have to
use the Secondary Control Center.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,530
You mean, without the MAGI?

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,030
That's right.

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,130
We can clean the dust off, and be
working again by this afternoon.

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,600
But those chairs are cramped, and
the sensors don't operate well.

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,570
It's difficult to work there.

51
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,870
But at least the layout is the same
as our original control center.

52
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,610
It just feels like we don't
belong there.

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,340
At least we have an alternative.

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,240
We have no choice when it
comes to using Unit 01.

55
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,020
It may be restrained by the cage,
but are you sure it's safe?

56
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,060
No heat emissions, free electrons,
electromagnetic fields

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,960
or chemical reactions
are being detected.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,260
The S2 unit is completely inactive.

59
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,030
Nevertheless, on three
separate occasions,

60
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,900
Unit 01 has moved without power.

61
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,940
You can't judge this situation

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,740
just by the things you can
see and measure.

63
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah, we can't take any chances,
that's for sure.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,810
It's as unpredictable as
you are, Katsuragi.

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,590
However, our concerns are
not limited to Unit 01.

67
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,520
Correct. Serious damage was
sustained by Units 00 and 02.

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,200
Headquarters was partially ruined,
exposing Central Dogma.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,000
The destruction was enormous.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,200
We can't even estimate how much
money and time have been lost.

71
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,140
This all is because we didn't put
a bell around Ikari's neck.

72
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,940
A bell was there, but
it didn't ring.

73
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,040
A bell that doesn't ring
serves no purpose.

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,030
We'll make sure the bell
works next time.

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,740
My, my, what an unexpected
situation!

76
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,480
The committee... I mean, how will
you explain this to SEELE?

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,460
Unit 01 wasn't under our control.

78
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,630
This was an accident.

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,560
Unit 01 will stay frozen until the
Committee gives us further orders.

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,500
That's a very appropriate decision.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,400
However, isn't your son still
trapped inside it?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,740
It's hopeless. It's not accepting
the code to eject the entry plug.

83
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,240
What about the backup codes?

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,300
Also refused. Even a direct circuit
isn't getting through.

85
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,120
The plug's video monitor
is active though.

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,670
Switching to main screen.

87
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,480
What in the hell is this?

88
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,890
I'd say that's the truth behind
a 400% synch ratio.

89
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,160
I can't believe it.
What happened to Shinji?

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,700
Apparently the Eva has
taken him into itself.

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,470
What does that mean?!
Just what is an Eva?!

92
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,900
It is something created by man
in Man's own image.

93
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,400
I really can't describe it
any other way.

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
You didn't create anything!

95
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,240
You just copied something you
found in the Antarctic.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,010
What was the original? That's what
I want to know, Doctor.

97
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,920
This is not just a copy.
A human will is inside it.

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,020
Are you saying somebody
willed this to happen?!

99
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,510
No, the Eva did.

100
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,790
Do something, damn you!

101
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,160
You created this, didn't you?!
Take responsibility for it!

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,300
I am still alive.

103
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,210
I know that Wonder Girl
is still alive!

104
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,980
Why are you bothering me with
trivial crap like that, Misato?!

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,990
I can't believe it. I couldn't
do anything.

106
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,590
I can't believe that stupid Shinji
outperformed me.

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,090
Not again!

108
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,700
What do you mean, you're going
to "salvage" Shinji?

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,740
Well, theoretically, Shinji's life
force still exists in there.

110
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,840
And you'll be respecting
that life this time?

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,180
Losing Shinji is out of
the question now.

112
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,350
I don't know.

113
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,950
What NERV wants is Unit 01
as their tool, not Shinji.

114
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,050
I don't deny it.

115
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,120
Our assumption is that Shinji's
body lost its Ego Border,

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,060
and he's floating in the entry
plug in quantum form.

117
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,060
You're saying that Shinji has
shifted into a form we can't see?

118
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,130
Yes, the LCL has
chemically altered

119
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,010
into something very similar to the
sea water of primitive Earth.

120
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,840
You mean, like a primordial soup?

121
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,810
All of the substances which
composed Shinji

122
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,080
are still preserved in the plug,

123
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,550
and his soul exists there as well.

124
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,590
In fact, his Ego Image is giving a
sort of substance to his plug suit.

125
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,050
In other words, this
salvage operation

126
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,190
must both reconstruct his body
and fix his soul in it.

127
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,790
Is that possible?

128
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,360
With the Magi's support, yes.

129
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,700
This is all theoretical, isn't it?

130
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,990
You won't know what will really
happen until you do it.

131
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,510
What is this?

132
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,000
Where am I?

133
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,210
In the entry plug?

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,510
That's right. But there's nobody
here. Not even myself.

135
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,350
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

136
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't understand.

137
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,690
These people...

138
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,760
Yes, they're people I know,
people who know me.

139
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,250
I understand now.
This is my world.

140
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,760
What is this?

141
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,230
This is supposed to be my world,
but this I don't understand.

142
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,140
An image from outside?

143
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,500
A hostile image?

144
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,200
That's right! The enemy!

145
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,530
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!

146
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,400
Our enemies are called Angels.
They have the names of Angels.

147
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,310
They are the targets of
Eva and NERV.

148
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,250
This is our revenge for the
death of Misato's father!

149
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,490
Why do I fight? Despite all the
pain and suffering?

150
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,760
What are you, stupid?

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,820
An unknown enemy is attacking,
of course we have to fight them!

152
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,360
Am I odd to try to find a
reason to fight?

153
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,560
Am I not supposed
to think about it?

154
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,270
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!

155
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,680
All are my enemies!

156
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,380
Us... That which threatens
us is the enemy.

157
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,050
Of course, how can I be faulted

158
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,050
for protecting my own life and
those of others?!

159
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,090
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!

160
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,080
My enemy! My enemy!

161
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,230
Damn! Damn! Damn!

162
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,100
You hurt Toji and killed
my mother! Father!

163
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,710
Why do you hate your father?

164
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,650
Anyone would hate such a father!

165
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,680
You don't understand him, do you?

166
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,850
Of course not. I've hardly
ever seen him.

167
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,820
Is that why you hate him?

168
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,590
Yes, my father doesn't need me!
My father deserted me!

169
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,390
And am I his substitute?

170
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,030
Yes, it must be so!

171
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,630
He abandoned me because
he had Ayanami!

172
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,900
As if you didn't run away
all by yourself.

173
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,640
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,740
It's all his fault!!

175
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,180
That time I was actually going
to tell him I hate him!

176
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,320
Did you tell me to pilot this just
to make me suffer, Father?

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Correct.

178
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,890
That can't be true! It can't be!
How can you say that?!

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,760
You don't need me, do you?!

180
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,850
I called you because
you had a use.

181
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,630
Why me?

182
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,830
Because there was no
one else who could.

183
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,630
No way, I've never seen this
before. It's impossible!

184
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,110
Yes, I knew it was true.

185
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,940
It's true! I knew Eva.

186
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,580
Then I escaped!

187
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,410
I really escaped! Leaving my
father and mother behind!

188
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,900
<i>Concentration of LCL is currently</i>
<i>stable at 36%.</i>

189
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,600
<i>No problem with oxygen</i>
<i>concentration.</i>

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,770
<i>Electromagnetic radiation pulse</i>
<i>is normal. Wave pattern is 0.</i>

191
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,370
<i>Counters are functioning normally.</i>

192
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,850
Salvage Plan Guideline
and Procedures...

193
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,450
It's amazing that you could create
all this in only one month.

194
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,190
Thanks for giving me credit,
but it wasn't my idea.

195
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,620
This was already experimental
ten years ago.

196
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,130
This kind of thing happened
during the development?

197
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,730
It was before I worked here.

198
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,560
My mother was here, though.
I only know the data.

199
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,230
And how did it come out?

200
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,860
I've heard they failed.

201
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,360
Kindness...

202
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,810
Warmth...

203
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,140
Is this the warmth of a human?

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,770
I was never aware of it.

205
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,340
What is loneliness?

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,190
I was never aware of it, but
now I think I know it.

207
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,960
What is happiness?

208
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,000
I was never aware of it, but
now I think I know it.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,660
Are others kind to you?

210
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,310
Why?

211
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,610
Because I am Eva's pilot.

212
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,580
Because I pilot Eva,
they treat me well.

213
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,880
That is the reason I can exist.

214
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,180
That is the everything to support
my reason to be.

215
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,920
So, I must pilot Eva.

216
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,250
And then?

217
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,630
Enemy! Yes, I must fight what
they all call the enemy!

218
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,990
And then?

219
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,400
And I must win!

220
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Right, I can't lose.

221
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,230
As they tell me to,
I must pilot Eva.

222
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,600
As they tell me to, I must win!

223
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,340
Otherwise...

224
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,670
Nobody...

225
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,310
Nobody...

226
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,800
Nobody...

227
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,110
<i>Do your best.</i>

228
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,110
<i>Do your best.</i>

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,520
<i>Get to work, idiot.</i>

230
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,680
<i>Do your best.</i>

231
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,020
<i>Do your best.</i>

232
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,010
<i>Good work, Shinji.</i>

233
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,930
Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka,
Toji, Kensuke

234
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,390
and Father.

235
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,760
They all respect me.

236
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,830
When I pilot Eva, they
all respect me.

237
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,830
They respect this worthless being.
Everyone says to pilot this.

238
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,460
I'll prove to my dad
I'm worthwhile.

239
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,340
Do your best.

240
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes, I'm doing my best.

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,530
I am doing my best!

242
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,450
Somebody be nice to me.

243
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,490
I fought so hard.
I'm doing my best!

244
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,890
Treat me well! Be nice to me!

245
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm nice to you.

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,240
Tell me, Shinji, do you want
to become one with me?

247
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,810
To be of one mind and body?

248
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,940
It could be very, very nice.

249
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,340
Ask me anytime. I'm ready.

250
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,980
Hey, Shinji-idiot, don't you
want to be one with me?

251
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,050
To be of one mind and body?

252
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,690
It could be very, very nice.

253
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,780
You ought to appreciate your
good fortune. Come on.

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,530
Ikari, do you want to become
one with me?

255
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,200
To be of one mind and body?

256
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,270
It could be very, very nice.

257
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,360
Ikari?

258
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,500
Do you want to become
one with me?

259
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,810
To be of one mind and body?

260
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,240
It could be very, very nice.

261
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,070
Relax and release your soul.

262
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,250
<i>All investigative needles fixed.</i>

263
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,220
<i>Fixed at electromagnetic radius</i>
<i>of zero minus three.</i>

264
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,860
Ego Border pulse connection
is complete.

265
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,160
Roger. Start salvage.

266
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
Roger, transmitting first signal.

267
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,260
Eva has received the signal.
No rejection confirmed.

268
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,570
Proceeding to second
and third signals.

269
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,900
<i>Subject cathexis is normal.</i>

270
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,810
<i>Destrudo is not confirmed.</i>

271
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,430
Roger, shift the subject
to stage two.

272
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,510
Shinji!

273
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,880
Hey, Shinji-idiot!

274
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,010
Shinji!

275
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,610
Hey, Shinji!

276
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,920
Yo, Shinji!

277
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Ikari...

278
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,550
Shinji!

279
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,380
Shinji-idiot!

280
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,090
Shinji!

281
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,750
Hey, Shinji!

282
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,490
Yo, Shinji.

283
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,120
Ikari...

284
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,650
Shinji!

285
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,420
Shinji-idiot!

286
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,960
Shinji!

287
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,460
Hey, Shinji!

288
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,960
Yo, Shinji.

289
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,420
Ikari...

290
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,790
Shinji!

291
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,220
Shinji-idiot!

292
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,630
Shinji!

293
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,060
Hey, Shinji!

294
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,460
Yo, Shinji.

295
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,890
Ikari...

296
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,600
It's no good. The Ego Border
is frozen in a loop.

297
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,860
Irradiate the wave patterns
in all directions.

298
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,710
It won't work. The signals are
trapped in Klein space.

299
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,210
What does that mean?

300
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,070
It means we failed.

301
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,250
Abort intervention.
Reverse tangent plug.

302
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,780
Return additions to zero.

303
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,750
Yes, Ma'am.

304
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Destrudo reaction in the old area.
Pattern sepia.

305
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,580
Destrudo reaction in the old area.
Pattern sepia.

306
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,350
A change is confirmed on the core
pulse too! Plus 0.3 is confirmed!

307
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,290
Maintenance of the status quo is
top priority. Prevent back flow.

308
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,760
Yes, Ma'am.

309
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,300
Plus 0.5... 0.8... This is odd.
I can't stop it!

310
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,460
What is this? Why? Don't you
want to come back, Shinji?

311
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,820
I don't understand.

312
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,060
I don't understand.

313
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,470
I... I...

314
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,780
What do you wish?

315
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,380
What do you wish?

316
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,980
What do you wish?

317
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,640
What do you wish?

318
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,050
Eva has rejected the signal.

319
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,190
LCL self-replenishment
is dropping.

320
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,760
Pressure in the plug is increasing!

321
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,890
Abort all operations.
Cut the power.

322
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,160
It's not working. The plug
is being ejected.

323
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,860
Shinji!

324
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,240
Where am I? Inside of Eva?

325
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,610
Inside of Eva?

326
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,450
Did I pilot Eva again? Why?

327
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,110
You won't pilot the Eva anymore?

328
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,950
I've decided I will never
pilot Eva again.

329
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,050
But you have just piloted
Evangelion Unit 01.

330
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,530
Shinji, you are here because
you have piloted the Eva.

331
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,020
Piloting the Eva has created
your present.

332
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,700
You can never deny
your past, Shinji,

333
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,340
nor can you deny that you did
indeed pilot it once more.

334
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,030
That which is, is. It's true.

335
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,210
I just wanted to tell you that
only you can decide.

336
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,600
It's your future.

337
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,780
I... I...

338
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,420
What good is damned science?
It can't even save one small life?!

339
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,420
Give me back my Shinji!
Give him back!

340
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,400
That scent?

341
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,890
A human smell?

342
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,900
Misato?

343
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
Ayanami?

344
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,700
No, not them.

345
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,710
That's right.

346
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,370
This is the smell of my mother.

347
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,990
Second Impact has occurred.
Will he live in this hell?

348
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,360
Anywhere can be heaven
if you try to live.

349
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,030
Because he has a life,

350
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,070
as long as he lives, he will have
the chance to attain happiness.

351
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes, you're right.

352
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,430
Mom...

353
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,570
Have you decided yet?

354
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,480
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl,
I'll name the baby Rei.

355
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,780
Shinji... Rei...

356
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,640
Mom...

357
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,920
Shinji!

358
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,670
<i>Let's speak of what psychologists</i>
<i>used to call the Oral Stage.</i>

359
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,110
Unit 01 will be restored in two days.
<i>Let's speak of what psychologists</i>
<i>used to call the Oral Stage.</i>

360
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,510
Even given divine power, humans still...
<i>Let's speak of what psychologists</i>

361
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,210

<i>It's when someone is dependent</i>
<i>on another, like his mother.</i>

362
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,980
...treat it as a matter of fact.
<i>It's when someone is dependent</i>
<i>on another, like his mother.</i>

363
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,880
I can hardly agree.
<i>It's when someone is dependent</i>

364
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,320
I can hardly agree.
<i>I know a lot of guys like that, and</i>
<i>your letter sounds just like them.</i>

365
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Speaking of which, the committee
is considering freezing Eva.
<i>I know a lot of guys like that, and</i>
<i>your letter sounds just like them.</i>

366
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,350
<i>I know a lot of guys like that, and</i>

367
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,290
The Evangelion android...
<i>I know a lot of guys like that, and</i>
<i>your letter sounds just like them.</i>

368
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,550
The Evangelion android...
<i>I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She</i>
<i>can't be your mate and mother.</i>

369
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,090
<i>I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She</i>
<i>can't be your mate and mother.</i>

370
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,920
It's man-made, but who knows
what lurks inside that black box?
<i>I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She</i>
<i>can't be your mate and mother.</i>

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,860
<i>I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She</i>
<i>can't be your mate and mother.</i>

372
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,800
Well, I'm just glad Shinji was saved.
<i>Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you</i>
<i>just taking advantage of her?</i>

373
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,360
<i>Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you</i>
<i>just taking advantage of her?</i>

374
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,870
That wasn't me. It was you, probably.
<i>Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you</i>
<i>just taking advantage of her?</i>

375
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,670
That wasn't me. It was you, probably.
<i>Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are</i>
<i>sensitive to how they're loved.</i>

376
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,200
<i>Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are</i>
<i>sensitive to how they're loved.</i>

377
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,440
Why don't we go to a bar tonight?
<i>Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are</i>
<i>sensitive to how they're loved.</i>

378
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,010
Why don't we go to a bar tonight?
<i>So she's already been aware that</i>
<i>you want her as your mother.</i>

379
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,040
<i>So she's already been aware that</i>
<i>you want her as your mother.</i>

380
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,740
Sorry, I've got to go somewhere.
<i>So she's already been aware that</i>
<i>you want her as your mother.</i>

381
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,480
<i>So she's already been aware that</i>
<i>you want her as your mother.</i>

382
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,350
I see.
<i>So she's already been aware that</i>
<i>you want her as your mother.</i>

383
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,970
I see.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

384
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,000
See you!

385
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,790
Seeing her man as soon
as Shinji is saved?

386
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,250
Well, I can't criticize her.

387
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,760
Ritsuko must be thinking
I'm pretty disgusting.

388
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,030
Appearing to give in to our
desires looks more human.

389
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,540
We might even fool them.

390
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,670
Fool the Intelligence Department?

391
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,040
Or the Commander and Ritsuko?

392
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,610
Or me?

393
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,550
No, I meant myself.

394
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,540
You want to fool the others?

395
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,460
You never show interest in others,
but you want their attention.

396
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,320
You really are just like my dad.

397
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,260
A cigarette? I didn't know
you still smoked.

398
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,490
I only smoke after this
sort of thing.

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,520
So nobody knows but you.

400
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,800
I see. I'm honored.

401
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,670
And how's Instrumentality going?

402
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,310
Adam could wipe out mankind.

403
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,010
Why is it being kept there?

404
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,050
Did you come to see me
just to learn that?

405
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,780
Well, that's one of the reasons.

406
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,260
It would be my honor to be used
as my lady's cat's-paw,

407
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,230
but I can't tell you right now.

408
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,030
I just want you to know
what I want.

409
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,000
What are NERV and Commander
Ikari really planning?

410
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,500
I'd like to know that myself.

411
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,080
Hey, you can't dodge my
questions by doing that.

412
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,310
Hey, no!

413
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,140
Don't put strange things in there!

414
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,780
I can't believe this. What is it?

415
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,340
A present for you, the
first in eight years.

416
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,350
And maybe the last as well.

417
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>To be continued...</i>

418

Preview

419
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki has
been abducted by SEELE.

420
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,990
The memories form the present
as others delve into NERV.

421
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,200
Could NERV really be a
fortress for all Mankind?

422
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Next time,
"NERV Arises"
