1
00:00:02,137 --> 00:00:04,490
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,349
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,442
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:09,724
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:14,883
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:18,929
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,208
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:26,343
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:30,473
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:32,298
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,487
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:38,190
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:41,785
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:17,439
The only reason you should be interrupting me is
if you have news about the Avatar.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,071
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko,
but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.

16
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:27,087
Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head
is a sign of a great leader.

17
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,004
Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it.

18
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,907
Okay, then... we have no idea where he is.

19
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,308
What?!

20
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,471
You really should open a window in here.

21
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:39,570
Give me the map!

22
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,959
Ah, There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar,...

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,134
...but he is impossible to track down.

24
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:47,696
How am I gonna find him, Uncle?

25
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:52,330
He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.

26
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,242
You have no idea where you're going, do you?

27
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:57,666
Weeelll, I know it's near water...

28
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,409
I guess we're getting close then.

29
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,211
Momo, marbles please.

30
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:10,792
Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!

31
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,344
That's great, Aang.

32
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,656
You didn't even look.

33
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:18,530
That's great!

34
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,065
But I'm not doing it now.

35
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,650
Stop bugging her, airhead.
You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.

36
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,049
What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?

37
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,396
Simple, girls are better at fixing pants than guys,...

38
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:33,207
...and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.

39
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:34,678
It's just the natural order of things.

40
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:39,193
All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!

41
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:44,070
Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these! Katara, please!

42
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,436
Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!

43
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,910
We just made a pit stop yesterday.

44
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:58,270
Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?

45
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,670
He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.

46
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:09,879
But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy?

47
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:16,537
Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.

48
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,366
Look!

49
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,178
That's why we're here...

50
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:28,065
...elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me!

51
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:32,678
Cold!

52
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,093
He looks pretty good out there.

53
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:01,169
Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.

54
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:05,579
No, Appa! Don't eat that!

55
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,674
Aww, man...

56
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,764
There's something in the water!

57
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:23,420
What's wrong?

58
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,204
Aang's in trouble. Aang!

59
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:27,291
Get out of there!

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,559
- Come back here! Aang!
- Aang

61
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,546
What was that thing?

62
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:55,707
I don't know.

63
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,996
Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.

64
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,519
Or we could stay a while...

65
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:20,556
You three have some explaining to do.

66
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,667
And if you don't answer all our questions,...

67
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,062
...we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.

68
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:28,306
Show yourselves, cowards!

69
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:32,363
Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?

70
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,708
There were no men. We ambushed you.

71
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,441
Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?

72
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:40,585
Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.

73
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:44,881
A bunch of girls, huh?
The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.

74
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:49,948
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it.
My brother is just an idiot sometimes.

75
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,650
It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here.
I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

76
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:58,028
How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies?

77
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,708
Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far.
And we intend to keep it that way!

78
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:06,325
This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!

79
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:09,398
Ha! How could you possibly know her?

80
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:16,751
Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago.
She's been dead for centuries.

81
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,302
I know her because I'm the Avatar.

82
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:20,613
That's impossible!

83
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,223
The last Avatar was an airbender
who disappeared a hundred years ago.

84
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:25,270
That's me!

85
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,999
Throw the imposter to the unagi!

86
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:34,325
Aang... do some airbending...

87
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,904
It's true... you are the Avatar!

88
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,484
Now... check this out!

89
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:58,596
Did you hear the news?
The Avatar's on Kyoshi!

90
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:00,560
Huh?

91
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,037
The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?

92
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:14,644
Uncle, ready the rhinos.
He's not getting away from me this time.

93
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,233
Are you going to finish that?

94
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,911
I was going to save it for later!

95
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:41,913
All right! Dessert for breakfast!
These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!

96
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,266
Mmm... Katara you've got to try these!

97
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,636
Well, maybe just a bite...

98
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,248
Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!

99
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:52,463
Not hungry.

100
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,359
But you're always hungry!

101
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,158
He's just upset because a bunch of girls
kicked his butt yesterday.

102
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,818
They snuck up on me!

103
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,174
Right. And then they kicked your butt.

104
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,172
Sneak attacks don't count!

105
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:09,585
Tie me up with ropes!
I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.

106
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:14,056
Who do they think they are anyway? Mmm... this is tasty.

107
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:19,285
What's he so angry about? It's great here.
They're giving us the royal treatment.

108
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:23,852
Hey, don't get too comfortable.
It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.

109
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,933
I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides,
did you see how happy I'm making this town?

110
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,312
They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!

111
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:33,660
Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.

112
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,823
I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.

113
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:40,192
Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.

114
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,480
Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...

115
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh... there's another one...
I'll make an adjustment here, and...

116
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,960
There's more... what...

117
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,902
Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.

118
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,569
I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?

119
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,378
Well, you're in the right place.

120
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,243
Sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.

121
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,058
It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge,...

122
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,006
...but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls,
I'll make an exception.

123
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:11,381
I should hope so.
A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.

124
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:15,349
True. But don't feel bad.
After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.

125
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,126
Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village?

126
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:23,115
Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.

127
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,209
Oh... well... I mean... I...

128
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,515
Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?

129
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:35,906
Well, if that's what you want,
I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. Now.

130
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:40,602
This may be a little tough, but try to block me.

131
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:45,600
Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you.

132
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,681
Of course.

133
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,535
Let's see if you can handle this!

134
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,453
That does it!

135
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,490
Anything else you want to teach us?

136
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:16,387
There she is, girls. Me in a past life.

137
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,672
You were pretty!

138
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:24,070
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

139
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:29,564
Oh, good! Can you help me
carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.

140
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,306
Actually, I can't right now.

141
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,496
What do you mean you can't?

142
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,924
I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa.

143
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:37,089
Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!

144
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,680
Watching you show off for
a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.

145
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,183
Well, neither does carrying your basket.

146
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:46,692
It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip.

147
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,678
I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.

148
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,729
I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet.

149
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,988
I can't put my finger on it,
but there's something I really like about this place.

150
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:59,343
What's taking you so long, Aangy?

151
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,196
Aangy...

152
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:02,007
Just a second, Koko!

153
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,517
"Simple monk," huh?

154
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,864
I thought you promised me that
this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.

155
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,294
It didn't. You know what I think?

156
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,525
You just don't want to come because you're jealous.

157
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:13,577
Jealous? Of what?

158
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:15,707
Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.

159
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,851
That's ridiculous.

160
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:21,118
It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.

161
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:34,137
Uh... hey, Suki.

162
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,120
Hoping for another dance lesson?

163
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,815
No... I... well, let me explain.

164
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:42,504
Spit it out! What do you want?

165
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,619
I would be honored if you would teach me.

166
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,222
Even if I'm a girl?

167
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:51,603
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.

168
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,056
We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.

169
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,828
Please make an exception. I won't let you down.

170
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,608
All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.

171
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:03,716
Of course!

172
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,216
And I mean all of them.

173
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:11,061
Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.

174
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:13,998
It's a warrior's uniform. You should be proud.

175
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:18,015
The silk threads symbolizes the brave blood
that flows through our veins.

176
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:22,855
The gold insignia represents
the honor of the warrior's heart.

177
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,921
Bravery and honor.

178
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:28,642
Hey Sokka! Nice dress!

179
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:41,343
Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?

180
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,182
Yeah.

181
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,971
Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be real dangerous.

182
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,063
Good for you.

183
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,272
You're not going to stop me?

184
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,431
Nope. Have fun.

185
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,423
I will.

186
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:50,976
Great.

187
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:51,849
I know it's great.

188
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,817
I'm glad you know.

189
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:53,705
I'm glad you're glad.

190
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,169
- Good! - Fine!

191
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:06,382
You're not going to master it in one day.
Even I'm not that good.

192
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:09,213
I think I'm starting to get it.

193
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,241
It's not about strength.

194
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:24,829
Our technique is about using
your opponents' force against them. Loosen up.

195
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,987
Think of the fan as an extension of your arm.

196
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:31,158
Wait for an opening and then...

197
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,392
I fell on purpose to make you feel better!

198
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:41,234
I got you! Admit I got you!

199
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:47,190
Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again.

200
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,164
What's taking so long?

201
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:58,079
I'm sure it will be here any second!

202
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,873
Um... What about this?

203
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,632
Not that again. Boring.

204
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,690
Where's the unagi? It's getting late.

205
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:09,292
Where're you going? Don't leave!

206
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:13,580
Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.

207
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,624
Katara! You show up!

208
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,109
I wanted to make sure you were safe.
You really had me worried.

209
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,663
Back there you acted like you didn't care.

210
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:25,805
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:30,951
Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.

212
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:35,497
Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!

213
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,850
On my way!

214
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:23,764
Hang on, Aang!

215
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:36,033
Aang...!

216
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,845
Zuko!

217
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,919
I want the Avatar alive.

218
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,451
Wake up, Aang!

219
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:48,402
Katara...

220
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:54,101
...don't ride the unagi. Not fun.

221
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:00,699
Not bad.

222
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:05,798
Firebenders have landed on our shores!
Girls, come quickly!

223
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,037
Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!

224
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:19,604
Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!

225
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,512
Find him.

226
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,559
I guess training's over.

227
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:20,478
Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.

228
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,725
Hey! Over here!

229
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,835
Finally!

230
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,096
Get inside.

231
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,978
Look what I brought to this place.

232
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,256
It's not your fault.

233
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:17,443
Yes, it is. These people got their town
destroyed trying to protect me.

234
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:20,838
Then let's get out of here.
Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

235
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,783
I know it feels wrong to run,
but I think it's the only way.

236
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:27,542
I'll call Appa.

237
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,881
There's no time to say goodbye.

238
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,595
What about, "I'm sorry"?

239
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:37,459
For what?

240
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,684
I treated you like a girl
when I should have treated you like a warrior.

241
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:47,566
I am a warrior. But I'm a girl, too.

242
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:51,859
Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.

243
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,122
Appa, yip yip!

244
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:02,920
Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!

245
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,813
I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.

246
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,680
Zuko would have destroyed
the whole place if we had stayed.

247
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:13,646
They're going to be okay, Aang.

248
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,511
What are you doing?!

249
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,997
Thank you, Avatar.

250
00:21:56,998 --> 00:22:00,670
I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.

251
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:03,833
Yes, it was.
