00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,330
Your Highness,
Her Highness would like to see you!

5
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,069
Her Highness says
she has a way to save Su Su!

6
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,370
Your Highness,
please go see Her Highness.

7
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,810
She'll definitely tell you the way.

8
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,610
Your Highness,
please go see Her Highness.

9
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,039
Do you know it's a crime to
deceive an heir to the throne?

10
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,849
Your Highness, I wouldn't dare.
I wouldn't dare.

11
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,389
I wouldn't dare to deceive Your Highness.

12
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,219
Please go see Her Highness.

13
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,889
She'll definitely tell you the way.

14
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,819
That's what Her Highness told me.

15
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,819
I wouldn't dare to deceive Your Highness.

16
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,819
Please go see Her Highness.

17
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,780
Ye Hua, we should be
celebrating our marriage today.

18
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,139
It's the day I've been longing for
for thousands of years.

19
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,340
I know you're waiting
for me to tell you the way.

20
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Ye Hua, we've known
each other since childhood.

21
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,789
You know how much I hate her.

22
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,050
But I still have to help you save her.

23
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,280
Even though I've been
an orphan since I was young

24
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
everything has been going
smoothly for me for 70,000 years

25
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,460
except for my desire to marry you
which never went my way.

26
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,590
I won't be resigned to this.

27
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,020
I won't.

28
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,060
What do you want?

29
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,250
I want to live in Xiwu Palace.

30
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
I won't lie to you.

31
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,959
No one can lie to an heir
of the Nine Heavens.

32
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,779
You just have to use
the Soul-gathering Lamp.

33
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,480
If it's using the Soul-gathering Lamp,
I can just ask Dong Hua Dijun.

34
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,240
No. He only knows how to bring
immortal souls together with it.

35
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,310
He doesn't know how the lamp can
create a mortal body.

36
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,689
Only I know.

37
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,970
Keep going.

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,050
So you're agreeing to my deal?

39
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,560
Even if you live in Xiwu Palace,
I won't marry you.

40
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,500
It's okay.

41
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,000
It's okay.

42
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,740
I just want to be able to see you often.

43
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,910
Just like when we were kids.

44
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,500
Okay. Tell me.

45
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,509
I'll agree to your deal.

46
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,699
Thank you, Your Highness.

47
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,769
Your Highness, if you take things that
once had a mortal's breath in it

48
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,240
and burn it with the Soul-gathering Lamp

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,930
so that the lamp can
identify the mortal's breath

50
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,879
it will slowly absorb

51
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,930
what's left of that mortal's breath
within a thousand li's circumference.

52
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,459
When that mortal's breath within
a thousand li is fully absorbed

53
00:05:53,459 --> 00:06:00,439
it will create a copy of the mortal
who died.

54
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,279
Ye Hua! Don't you want to see her?

55
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,399
Even so, she'd be a fake!

56
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,379
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!

57
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,600
Your Highness.

58
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,699
His Highness has asked that
I take you to Xiwu Palace.

59
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,860
He also said that
no matter what the imperial decree is

60
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,829
there will only be one consort
of Xiwu Palace. Consort Su Su.

61
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,980
After Consort Su Jin
arrives at Xiwu Palace

62
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,089
she must not go anywhere near
Hall of Beautiful Youth.

63
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,459
Without His Highness's permission

64
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,720
you must not go anywhere
near Imperial great-grandson.

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,540
Yes.

66
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,560
As long as His Highness
will let me in Xiwu Palace

67
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,939
I will comply with his wish.

68
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,029
Go prepare a carriage.

69
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,410
Yes.

70
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,680
Your Highness.

71
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,060
Your Highness.

72
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,830
<i>[300 years later]</i>

73
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,409
Father, I've caught you.

74
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,149
<i>When I was born 300 years ago</i>

75
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:39,120
<i>everyone in the Nine Heavens
called me Imperial great-grandson.</i>

76
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,919
<i>My father is the
eldest Imperial grandson</i>

77
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,629
<i>and the crown prince of
the Celestial Tribe, Ye Hua.</i>

78
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:51,120
<i>My mother's name is Su Su.
She's a beautiful woman and a mortal.</i>

79
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,019
<i>For the past 300 years</i>

80
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,379
<i>Father brings me to
Mount Junji of the Far East</i>

81
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,200
<i>in the mortal world every year to
live there for a few months.</i>

82
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,769
<i>He says that's where Mother
made him give her his heart.</i>

83
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:11,159
<i>Father also said that Mother
will come back eventually.</i>

84
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,919
Father said tomorrow is the
anniversary of when you met.

85
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,409
We will treat it as your birthday.

86
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,750
Although I think it's
perfunctory to do that

87
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,120
it's better than not knowing
when to celebrate your birthday.

88
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,019
Mother, I am going to Mount Junji in
the Far East tomorrow to pick peaches.

89
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,909
It'll be too late to wish you a
happy birthday before your portrait.

90
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:36,779
So I will wish you a
happy birthday here right now.

91
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>I've been burning the
Soul-gathering Lamp for 300 years.</i>

92
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,779
<i>Su Su, where are you?</i>

93
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,919
Mother, A-Li is here again to live in
the place where you married Father.

94
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,360
Father, can I live here for a few days?

95
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,000
Father.

96
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,000
Father, play with me.

97
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,980
Okay.

98
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,000
Little Princess, drink a glass of water.

99
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,200
Little Princess.

100
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,330
Mi Gu, is there anything Aunt wants?

101
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,409
I want to give it to her
for her birthday.

102
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,740
I don't know either, Little Princess.

103
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,754
Yeah. There's nothing Aunt is lacking.

104
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:29,879
And she doesn't have
any unfulfilled wishes.

105
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,639
Unfulfilled wishes?

106
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,929
She does have one.

107
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,440
What? Tell me.

108
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Little Princess

109
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,240
did you forget about the guy
in Yanhua Cave that we can't talk about?

110
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,929
That's right! How could
I have forgotten him?

111
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:52,929
From when I was born, Aunt has
always wanted Mo Yuan to wake up.

112
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:00,120
But it's something that even Grandfather,
Grandmother, and Zhe Yan can't do.

113
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,570
How could I do it?

114
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,840
I heard a rumor lately.

115
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,000
Maybe it'll help you do it.

116
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,720
What is it?

117
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,240
To save the crown prince 300 years ago

118
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,559
Consort Su Jin brought back a treasure
from the Sea of Innocence.

119
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,129
It's called the Soul-gathering Lamp.

120
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,759
I heard it can gather immortal souls
and create mortal bodies.

121
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,059
His Highness almost couldn't wake up
but was able to because of it.

122
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,580
Really?

123
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,379
I'll go borrow it.

124
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,475
Little Princess

125
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,570
I'm afraid the Celestial Tribe
won't lend us such a treasure.

126
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,690
Then I'll just go get it
myself in secret.

127
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,259
Besides, the crown prince
is engaged to Aunt.

128
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,480
After he finds out I took it,
he probably wouldn't say anything it.

129
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,259
Furthermore, I'm saving
Celestial Tribe's God of War.

130
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,789
They should lend it to us.

131
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,769
That's true.

132
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,450
I'll use this awful woman's appearance.

133
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,380
Consort Su Jin.

134
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,930
Where is His Highness?

135
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,490
His Highness?

136
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Every year around this time,
His Highness goes

137
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,740
to live in Mount Junji of the Far East
to live for a few months.

138
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,410
Did Your Highness forget?

139
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,190
I really did forget.

140
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,329
What is Your Highness trying to do?

141
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,730
I'm going inside to take a look.

142
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:19,369
What? Even though I'm his consort,
I can't go inside Zichen Hall?

143
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,779
You can. It's just that...

144
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,470
It's just what?

145
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,829
Are you going to stop me
from going inside?

146
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,970
I wouldn't dare.

147
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,869
- Your Highness.
- What is it?

148
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,630
Consort Su Jin suddenly barged into
Zichen Hall.

149
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,859
I didn't dare to stop her.

150
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,670
Then I remembered that the
Soul-gathering Lamp was inside...

151
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,589
What?

152
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,869
Ye Hua.

153
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:10,349
Where is the Soul-gathering Lamp?

154
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,140
Soul-gathering lamp?

155
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,910
Isn't the Soul-gathering Lamp
in Zichen Hall?

156
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,539
Where is it?

157
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,730
Ye Hua, what's wrong with you?

158
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,740
Don't forget that you were only able to
live in Xiwu Palace because of the lamp.

159
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,549
Ye Hua, you must be
mistaken about something.

160
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,880
I gave you the lamp 300 years ago.

161
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,339
I haven't touched it since then.

162
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,720
I wouldn't dare. I really wouldn't
dare touch it.

163
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,599
I know how much you care about that lamp.

164
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,299
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

165
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,170
You better not be lying to me.

166
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,059
Your Highness, are you okay?

167
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,230
What's with His Highness?

168
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,099
I've never seen him so angry before.

169
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,009
It's because of that mortal.

170
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:26,609
It's been 300 years.

171
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,069
She's been dead for 300 years!

172
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:39,529
Because of that lamp...
she's still in my way.

173
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,960
Hey.

174
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,299
Third Prince...

175
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,049
Why are you all so panicky?
Is the world falling into chaos?

176
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,440
Does Your Highness not know?

177
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,990
The Soul-gathering Lamp in
Zichen Palace has gone missing.

178
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,079
We don't know who took on Consort
Su Jin's appearance to steal the lamp.

179
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,309
Crown Prince is extremely angry.

180
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,329
He's investigating
every maid in the palace.

181
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,660
The Soul-gathering Lamp is missing?

182
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,190
That's Ye Hua's life.

183
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,420
Ye Hua.

184
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,509
I know the Soul-gathering Lamp
is missing.

185
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,039
But look.

186
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,259
It's been 300 years.

187
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,690
If that lamp could create a Su Su,
it would have already.

188
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,019
Why do you have to be at a loss

189
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,000
because of woman
who's been dead for 300 years?

190
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,769
Don't say any more, Third Uncle.

191
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:47,849
Su Su is telling me in this darkness
that she still won't forgive me.

192
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,579
She won't even let me
create a fake version of her.

193
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:15,759
How do we use this lamp?

194
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,180
I heard that you have
to keep it burning for a few days

195
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,009
and watch after it yourself.

196
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,839
You can't use your magic powers.

197
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,930
Then wouldn't we get caught?

198
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,039
Aunt comes to see him
twice a day without fail.

199
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,779
What do we do if she finds out?

200
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,849
I don't know.

201
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:35,390
What are you guys doing?

202
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,309
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

203
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,140
What are you guys up to?

204
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,119
I... I borrowed a lamp
from the celestial palace.

205
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,869
I wanted to help you
restore Mo Yuan's soul.

206
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,890
What is it?

207
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,730
Soul-gathering Lamp.

208
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,079
Soul-gathering Lamp?

209
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,849
That's the Celestial Tribe's sacred item.
How did you get it?

210
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,740
I borrowed it.

211
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,450
Tell me the truth.

212
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,000
I took on Consort Su Jin's appearance
and stole it from Zichen Palace.

213
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,430
Stole it?

214
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,779
Who gave you the courage
to do such a thing?

215
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,789
Aunt, I heard that the
Celestial Palace had a lamp

216
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,089
that saved the crown prince
when he was unconscious.

217
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,720
So I brought it here
so you could save Mo Yuan.

218
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,759
Get on your knees.

219
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,779
Aunt.

220
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,859
How have I been teaching you?

221
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,880
You're from the Qing Qiu royal family.
How could you do such a thing?

222
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,130
If your father finds out,
how could I explain this to him?

223
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,940
Aunt, I was wrong.

224
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,079
What should you do since you're wrong?

225
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,990
I'll offer a humble apology.

226
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,980
I'll take responsibility
for my wrongdoing.

227
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,039
Go.

228
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,410
Huh?

229
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,930
You're scared?

230
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,130
I'm not scared.

231
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,259
It's just that it wasn't easy
for me to get the lamp.

232
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,049
Aunt, you really don't
want to give it a try?

233
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,809
There's no point in trying.

234
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:19,690
I've heard about this lamp before.

235
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,109
But to use it, you must
have a part of the soul

236
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,299
for it to bring the
remaining parts together.

237
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,000
For the past 70,000 years,
although Master's body is here

238
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,390
I don't know where his soul is.

239
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,839
So this lamp is useless.

240
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,630
You really don't want to give it a try?

241
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,329
Return it.

242
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,460
Okay.

243
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,059
Little Princess, why are you here?

244
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,089
I took on Consort Su Jin's appearance
and stole the Soul-gathering Lamp.

245
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,509
You took on Consort Su Jin's appearance
and stole the soul-gathering lamp?

246
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:41,880
Yes.

247
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,960
You've stirred up trouble. Big trouble.

248
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,559
I just stole it for a few days.
It's not that big a deal.

249
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,220
Do you know why this Soul-gathering Lamp

250
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,529
has been burning for
300 years without going out?

251
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:56,250
Crown Prince was using this lamp
to create Consort Su Su's body.

252
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,970
What? Su Su's body?

253
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,609
Even now, he hasn't given
up on his mortal wife?

254
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:05,680
Crown Prince has been guarding the this
lamp's flame day and night for 300 years.

255
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,279
No one even dares
to go near Zichen Palace.

256
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,730
How could you dare to go
inside and steal the lamp?

257
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,369
Is the flame still burning?

258
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,339
It's out.

259
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,779
You're done for.

260
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:25,119
Dijun is in seclusion,
so he can't help you.

261
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,250
I'll see if there's any other way
for you to get through this.

262
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,880
Little Princess, just wait here.

263
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,119
Third Prince and I will go
inside to persuade him.

264
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,089
Hopefully His Highness will be
magnanimous and let bygones be bygones.

265
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:57,410
Thank you, Third Prince.

266
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,920
Don't be so quick to thank me.

267
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,460
You don't know how important this
Soul-gathering Lamp is to Ye Hua.

268
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,369
Let's see what happens
after Si Ming and I go inside.

269
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,740
It's out.

270
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,450
It's out?

271
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,799
Who was it?

272
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,720
Qing Qiu's Little Princess, Bai Feng Jiu.

273
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,200
Bai Feng Jiu.

274
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,269
She didn't know you were using this
Soul-gathering Lamp to make Su Su's body.

275
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,960
She just thought it was interesting
so she took it to play with it.

276
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,339
Interesting?

277
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,000
Ye Hua, let's not make Qing Qiu look bad.

278
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,039
Let's not dwell on this.

279
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,950
Besides, her aunt will be
your princess consort.

280
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,039
If you pick a fight with Qing Qiu
because of a dead mortal woman

281
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,490
it will cause chaos.

282
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,099
We won't be able to justify it
no matter what our reasons.

283
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:37,200
What if I insist on making
this a big deal?

284
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:48,059
Then I can only ask Dong Hua Dijun
to come ask you for a favor.

285
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,799
I'll be direct.

286
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,119
Dijun is going to the mortal realm
today to go through a trial.

287
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,869
The trial is to return the
little princess a favor.

288
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:05,980
So on account of Dong Hua Dijun,
I ask that you forgive Bai Feng Jiu.

289
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,009
Don't make Qing Qiu look bad.

290
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,450
Don't make Dong Hua Dijun look bad.

291
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,339
Don't make a big deal out of this.

292
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,190
Even if this lamp could
create a new Su Su

293
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,400
it would only be a substitute.

294
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:45,539
- I ask that Your Highness--
- Let her leave!

295
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,059
Thank you, Your Highness.

296
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,240
How did it go?

297
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,269
His Highness doesn't plan
on making this a big deal.

298
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,099
Little Princess, you can't be
so unruly like this anymore.

299
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,569
I didn't know he was trying
to recreate Su Su's body.

300
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,420
I thought no one was using this lamp

301
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,519
after it was used to save
Crown Prince 300 years ago.

302
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,240
Little Princess, go back home.

303
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:52,829
What about Su Jin?

304
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:55,369
Consort Su Jin is easy to take care of.

305
00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:00,039
If I go with Third Prince to plea on
your behalf with Heavenly Lord

306
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,950
based on Consort Su Jin's personality

307
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,539
she wouldn't make a big deal out of it
in Heavenly Lord's presence.

308
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,989
Anyway, from now on, you must remember

309
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:17,710
not to offend anyone
outside of Taichen Palace.

310
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,900
Don't create anything you
need to take responsibility for.

311
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,139
Otherwise, things will
be really hard for me.

312
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,079
I got it.

313
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,780
Is Dijun doing well?

314
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,110
He's doing well. Very well.

315
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,599
I will probably go to Qing Qiu
in a few days to see you.

316
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,559
- To see me?
- Yes.

317
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,670
I've thought of a way
for you to repay Dijun.

318
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,519
- Really?
- Really. But I can't tell you now.

319
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,849
Don't be impatient.

320
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:46,289
Please wait for me patiently
at Qing Qiu Fox Den.

321
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,050
Okay.

322
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,380
Have you gone mad?

323
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,579
Third Uncle, let go of me.

324
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:21,889
Let go of me.

325
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:30,039
You're using your own soul to ignite
the Soul-gathering Lamp?

326
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:33,300
I have no other choice.

327
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,079
I have nothing else that has
anything to do with Su Su to burn.

328
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,900
Besides my own soul

329
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,210
there's nothing else in this world
that has anything to do with Su Su.

330
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,909
That's enough!

331
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,050
Have you forgotten that you're
the crown prince of the celestial tribe?

332
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,170
Have you forgotten that
you and Su Su have a son?

333
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,769
So what if you can ignite it again?

334
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:01,809
So what if you create a new body?

335
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,519
Will it be the same Su Su?

336
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,130
Think about it carefully.

337
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,369
Is it worth it to create a fake person?

338
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,090
After you die...

339
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:35,469
A-Li will become an orphan.

340
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,380
Is it worth it?

341
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,659
If you don't want your own life...

342
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,190
it's fine.

343
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,650
But what about A-Li?

344
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,380
He's still waiting for
you in the Far East.

345
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,110
For 300 years, you've been
his father and mother.

346
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,400
It wasn't easy for you
to raise him to this age.

347
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,179
Who would you leave him with
that you'd be able to rest peacefully?

348
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,630
The fake person that you create?

349
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,230
Or Su Jin, who hates Su Su to the core?

350
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,670
Let it go.

351
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,920
It's been 300 years.

352
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,550
Stop torturing yourself.

353
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,239
Forget about it.

354
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:05,000
Did that lamp really go out?

355
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:11,699
Father, it really has gone out.

356
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,610
It's good that it's gone out.

357
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,699
This matter has been wearing
Ye Hua down for 300 years.

358
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,889
I also couldn't rest easy because of it.

359
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:20,170
Su Jin.

360
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,210
Present.

361
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,820
Even though Qing Qiu's Little Princess

362
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,420
took on your appearance
and stole the Soul-gathering Lamp

363
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,570
she returned it in the end.

364
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,260
Ye Hua just yelled at you for a bit.

365
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,380
You see, Si Ming and Third Prince
are here on her behalf.

366
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,059
Why don't you just let it go?

367
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,860
I understand.

368
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,389
I will pretend this never happened.

369
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:58,159
Good. You always understand
the bigger picture.

370
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:22,670
Ye Hua, from today on
no one will ever come be between us.

371
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,860
Your Highness, it's time to wake up.

372
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,619
Your Highness?

373
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,300
Your Highness?

374
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,869
Your Highness?

375
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,489
Oh no. Where did His Highness go?

376
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,860
Little rabbit, are you lost?

377
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,579
I'm lost too.

378
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:46,019
How dare you, Evil Spirit! How dare you
follow the Imperial great-grandson?

379
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:49,679
Imperial great grandson?
I'm the king himself!

380
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,500
This mountain is so weird.

381
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,969
It's like someone has gotten
rid of the celestial shield.

382
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,449
Help!

383
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,380
Help!

384
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,469
Help me, Miss!

385
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,559
You're not going to go after it?

386
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,530
This mountain is really dangerous.
It's better to be careful.

387
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,360
What's a little immortal like
you doing in the mortal world?

388
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,730
Thank you for saving my life.

389
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,360
I just happened to be here.

390
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,840
Where is your house?
Should I take you there?

391
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,260
It's at a hut nearby.

392
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,019
Hut?

393
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,559
<i>It must be a place
with a celestial shield.</i>

394
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,500
I lost His Highness.

395
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,460
I deserve death.
Please punish me by death.

396
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,000
- Keep looking.
- Yes.

397
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,619
Your Highness, he's back.
His Highness is back.

398
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,860
A-Li.

399
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,329
Father.
