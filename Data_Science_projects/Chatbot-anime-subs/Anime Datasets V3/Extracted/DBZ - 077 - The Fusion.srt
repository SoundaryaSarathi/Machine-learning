"Birth of the Mightiest Warrior?
Nail and Piccolo Merge"

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,070
There are no readings for the Ginyu Toksentai.

3
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,360
Are you the ones that killed them?

4
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,210
It is unfortunate that the Dragonballs have turned to
stone just before I could have used them...

5
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,950
Unfortunate for Vegeta-san, to be sure,
but perhaps more so for myself.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,860
This is the first time anyone has been stupid
enough to make this big a fool out of me.

7
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,330
I did not expect things to come
to such a result.

8
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,510
You're going to pay!

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,100
You're going to pay for this, you puny worms!!

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm going to kill you all an inch at a time!!

11
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,850
There's no escape for you! Say your prayers!

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
So you finally show your true nature.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,400
Do your worst! If you think I'm going to be that
easy to defeat, you're greatly mistaken!

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,100
Of all the things you might have said...

15
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,370
Apparently, you have forgotten
how terrifying I really am.

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Let me refresh your memory!

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,490
Impossible!

18
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,160
I didn't think he'd be this awful!

19
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,540
That enormous Ki is getting a lot larger.

20
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,080
This Freeza is about to make his move
against the others.

21
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,860
I feel a faint Ki. No, it couldn't be Gohan!

22
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,240
A Nameksei-jin, the spitting image of myself.

23
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,300
You're near death.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,110
You must be the... Nameksei-jin the
Earthlings spoke of.

25
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,760
So, their wish has been granted. Good.

26
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,320
You seem to have all the facts.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,340
Then you must also know that I'm
rushing to help those brats out right now.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,270
You'll excuse me for leaving you here to die.

29
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
Surprising...

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,050
I don't know what discipline you've used, but you've managed to gain incredible power.

31
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,750
And yet, it's such a pity...

32
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,720
If you had returned as a single,
complete Nameksei-jin,

33
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,660
you might have been able to beat Freeza.

34
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,000
You're saying that if I had reunited with Kami
and become a single individual again,

35
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,200
only then would I be able to overcome
Freeza's power?

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,770
That's right. I may have been utterly
overwhelmed by Freeza,

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,250
but I know his powers quite well.

38
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,590
No use arguing over it now.

39
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,990
For that matter, I have no intention of
ever reuniting with that guy.

40
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,690
Unite with me.

41
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,940
I am the... last Warrior-Type Nameksei-jin
left on my world.

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,840
What? With you?

43
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,580
That's right. Your current power will be
increased several times over.

44
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,290
Thanks for the offer, but I'd rather be
who I am.

45
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,390
I don't want to combine my individuality
with yours.

46
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,160
Such a proud fellow...

47
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,230
Hurry! ...There's... no time.

48
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,640
I am about to die. Quickly, place your
hand on my body.

49
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,100
Do not worry.

50
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,480
Your individuality will be yours. I will be
yours. I offer no more than this opportunity.

51
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,940
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

52
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,290
If that's what you think, you can go on
ahead and get killed by Freeza.

53
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,970
All right.

54
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,570
Fine, then. I'll try you out.

55
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,320
But if I don't like what happens, I'll
drive you out again.

56
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,230
What a thing to say, while I'm offering such a wonderful
present to you of my own good will.

57
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,260
I'm in a hurry. If we're going to do this, let's get it over.

58
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,330
Be sure... you kill... Freeza.

59
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,270
I don't need you to tell me.

60
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,280
If I can, I'll do it for my own sake.

61
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,090
Impossible... How can this be?

62
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,110
What incredible power!

63
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,970
What an unbelievably fearsome power this is!

64
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,380
Is this what uniting with someone is like!?

65
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,520
I will win! Regardless of the opponent,
I cannot lose now!

66
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,160
I have now obtained the ultimate power!

67
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,870
Gohan! At this rate, Vegeta will be
beaten in no time.

68
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,540
We have to act now. It's our only chance!

69
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,620
Right!

70
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,100
Krillin-san!

71
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,840
Su- Such a Ki! There's no way we can win!

72
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,640
Of course not.

73
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,990
Did you think that only three ants could
defeat a whole dinosaur?

74
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,790
We can win!

75
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,960
If the three of us fight together,
we'll find a way to beat you.

76
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,310
What's that? You can beat me?

77
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,270
That's right.

78
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,810
That's the last thing I expected you to say.

79
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,820
Apparently, not even the great Freeza
realizes that these two guys' battle powers
have been rapidly increasing.

80
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,190
Especially the shorter one, he's sitting on a power
reserve that not even he is fully aware of.

81
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,860
And as for me, I'm in the process of becoming
the Super Saiyajin you've always feared.

82
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,610
You brag quite well, what with that talk
of Super Saiyajins.

83
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,610
YOU IRRITATING RAT!

84
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,720
What!?

85
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,790
What's this?

86
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,370
So, apparently you aren't just talk, are you?

87
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,900
He's right...

88
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,380
If the three of us fight together, there's
a definite chance of us making it through.

89
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,220
He's certainly very powerful, but
our power has risen too.

90
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,360
That's right, ever since Vegeta has
come here, he's managed to keep
overcoming his limits and grow stronger.

91
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,760
So, why is Freeza still so calm?

92
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,870
Transform yourself, Freeza!

93
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:20,710
Transform?

94
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,510
Transform?

95
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,780
He can transform?

96
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,320
Let's get right to it. Why don't you
transform and show us your true self?

97
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,880
So, you knew about that, did you?
How did you come to find out?

98
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,300
That punk Zarbon let it slip.

99
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,460
What are you talking about?

100
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,970
Among the universe's races, there is
a very small number that have the odd
ability of changing their forms when needed-

101
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,810
- Whether for camouflage, or to conserve
energy consumption when it's unnecessary.

102
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,950
In my case, the reason is different. I have so much power,
it's difficult for me to control it otherwise.

103
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,320
What was that?

104
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,190
Don't let him scare you. He's bluffing,
he won't change all that much.

105
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,490
Is that so?

106
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,840
Fine, then. If you want to die that badly, I'll show you.

107
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,080
Watch very carefully.
This is not something you'll see every day.

108
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,280
When I attacked the planet Vegeta,
home to the Saiyajins,

109
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,750
you realize there was utterly no reason
for me to transform.

110
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,600
Vegeta-san, your father, the king of Planet Vegeta,
was none too spectacular a warrior, you know.

111
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't flatter yourself too much about that.

112
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,400
I had overcome the king's power way
back when I was still little.

113
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,940
Then the Saiyajin's planet was destroyed by him?

114
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,570
Now then, marvel at this!

115
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,420
At last, Freeza begins to change. However,
how much terror will this account for?

116
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,930
And will Piccolo and Goku arrive in
time for this terrific battle?

117
