<i>[Episode 8]</i>

4
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,971
This baby came very strangely.

5
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:32,061
In just a few days, it's ready for birth.

6
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,100
Perhaps it's because this baby
was exposed to the divine energy

7
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,781
of Kunlun Mountain, and has
the blessings of the golden lotus.

8
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,350
That's right.

9
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,070
Mo Yuan isn't an ordinary immortal.

10
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,741
He is the son of the Heavenly Father,
and one of his only descendants.

11
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:51,800
To have the blessings of the
golden lotus that he was nurturing

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,441
this baby must be out of the ordinary.

13
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,871
Her Highness has been
in labor for seven days.

14
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:12,151
I'm really scared.

15
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,200
Don't be scared, okay?

16
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,830
Heavenly Lord, Your Highness,
it's a prince.

17
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,711
It's a prince!

18
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,290
Congratulations, Heavenly Lord.
Congratulations, Your Highness.

19
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,721
Is this an auspicious sign?

20
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,031
Heavenly Lord.

21
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,431
Father, this was a sight from
when Mo Yuan was born.

22
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,581
How amazing.

23
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,261
The Celestial Tribe finally has another
heir to the throne.

24
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:28,661
I will give him a name today.

25
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,860
Ye Hua.

26
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,230
Congratulations, Heavenly Lord,
on another heir to the throne.

27
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,860
Su Jin, he is 20,000 years
younger than you.

28
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,380
You have to take good care of him, okay?

29
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,321
Yes, Consort Le Xu.

30
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,951
Good girl.

31
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,151
Where's that snake spirit?

32
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,021
How dare she trespass into Zhe Yan's
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods?

33
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,151
I came to see Bai Zhen.

34
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,730
See me?

35
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:49,730
Zhe Yan, why would someone
come here to find me?

36
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,341
I think everyone in the realms knows

37
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:59,521
that they don't need to go to your
manor in the north to find you.

38
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,911
They just need to come
to my Peach Tree Woods.

39
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,891
Isn't that the jade bottle that
Fifth Sister often uses to drink?

40
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,451
That's the jade bottle that
Mo Yuan took from here.

41
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:18,401
Where did you get this? Kunlun Mountain?

42
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,350
You're stealing from us?
I'll beat you to death.

43
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,790
Stop!

44
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,740
That... she's from Kunlun Mountain.

45
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,211
Kunlun Mountain!

46
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,221
Run!

47
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:43,271
Don't you know to retaliate
when they hit you?

48
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,940
If I retaliate, they beat me even more.

49
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,651
So you'd just let them
beat you to death?

50
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,370
They won't be able to beat me to death.

51
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,100
Hurry and go home.

52
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,341
I don't have a home.

53
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,901
I don't know who my
mother and father are.

54
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:07,971
I'm here at Kunlun Mountain
for the divine energy.

55
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,821
I trained for hundreds of years
to get a human form.

56
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:18,761
If you don't have a family,
how about I find you a new family?

57
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,471
A new family?

58
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,880
It'll be in a beautiful place.

59
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:37,961
Take this bottle as a message
to this person, and he will take you in.

60
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,690
But she didn't tell me her name.

61
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,641
She just gave me this bottle

62
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,300
and told me to come to Ten-Mile Peach
Tree Woods to find Bai Zhen

63
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,161
and ask him to take me in.

64
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,300
Ask me to take you in?

65
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,630
I am yours now.

66
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,730
I am willing to follow you
for all my life.

67
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,831
No. I don't need that.

68
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:10,100
You won't take me in?

69
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,081
Don't be upset. It's not you.

70
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:16,420
I've never needed a servant.

71
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,461
Si Yin wants me to take you in?

72
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:21,841
Is it because you have nowhere to go?

73
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,151
I don't have a home.

74
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:28,350
I've always been bullied
by others in my tribe.

75
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,841
Fortunately, High Immortal was
passing by and saved me.

76
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,551
In that case, I'll take you
with me to the Fox Den.

77
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,230
My mother is there.

78
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,721
She doesn't have any servants.

79
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,850
You can stay with her.

80
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,160
Thank you.

81
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,711
Since Fifth Sister chose her,
she can stay here.

82
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,701
Mi Gu.

83
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,321
Here.

84
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,990
I'll leave this lady to you.

85
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,041
When Bai Qian come back,
Fox King and I plan to move out.

86
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,000
We'll leave this Fox Den to her.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,051
In the future, you can look after
each other here and serve Fifth Sister.

88
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,451
Yes.

89
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,250
Follow me.

90
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,030
Your peach blossom is blooming well.

91
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,941
Huh?

92
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:41,630
Among my five children,
Zhen Zhen is the best looking one.

93
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,260
If he was a girl,
even Qian Qian would lose to him.

94
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,561
Mother.

95
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:50,321
All right, I'm going back
to the Peach Tree Woods.

96
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,370
My son has been glued to
you since he was one.

97
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,880
You're not annoyed by it?

98
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,480
Without him, I'd feel lonely.

99
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,971
Oh?

100
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,331
Where are all the fish?

101
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,701
Don't be impatient. Here.

102
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,841
Zhe Yan. Bai Zhen.

103
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,181
The Peach Tree Woods have been
bustling the past few days.

104
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:32,360
For Die Feng to have come here,
there must be an urgent matter.

105
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,640
I can't find Seventeenth.

106
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,961
No, it's not just Seventeenth.

107
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,600
I can't find Master's corpse either.

108
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
What?

109
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,010
- Qian Qian!
- Qian Qian!

110
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,961
Qian Qian!

111
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,201
- Qian Qian!
- Qian Qian!

112
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,280
Silly girl! She was seriously
injured from the war.

113
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,931
How could she treat her
life so carelessly like this?

114
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,191
What do we do? What do we do?

115
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:32,301
She's about to stop breathing.
Come up with something! What do we do?

116
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,160
Don't worry. We can save her.
Don't worry.

117
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,921
Qian Qian fed a lot of blood
from her heart to Mo Yuan.

118
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:46,801
It's already very difficult for her to
still be alive.

119
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:51,321
Now, only cross essence repair
can save her.

120
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,071
I'll do it.

121
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,221
It will take more than
half of your essence.

122
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,860
If I can save Qian Qian,
so what if I use half my essence?

123
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,211
No! You're the Fox King of Qing Qiu.

124
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,110
You have to rule over the five lands.

125
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,921
How can you just lose half
of your essence like that?

126
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,240
I'll do it.

127
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,711
Hold on.

128
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,370
Let me finish.

129
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:19,061
Each immortal has a different breath.

130
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,140
If we use too much
essence in a cross repair

131
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,081
it could affect our magic breath.

132
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:26,841
In that case, you and Qian Qian
could both fall into the demon path.

133
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,490
Then you wouldn't be
able to save Fifth Sister

134
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,461
and would cause yourself harm.

135
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:35,260
I can't worry about that now.

136
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,640
Zhen Zhen, please have Zhe Yan leave.

137
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,510
- Mother!
- Hurry!

138
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,870
Why are you always like this?
Always so anxious.

139
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,480
Let me finish.

140
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,490
What?

141
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,931
I'm stopping you
because we still need one more thing.

142
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,451
What thing?

143
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:51,850
Divine fungal grass.

144
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,120
With that, you can purify your magic
breath, which would protect both of you.

145
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,721
Where is that grass?

146
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,520
Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea.

147
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,841
But Heavenly Father thought that
this thing went against heavenly law

148
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:09,041
so he had four beasts guard it.

149
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,181
Those four beasts?

150
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,650
That's right, those four beasts.

151
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,921
Heavenly Father also gave them
more than half of his essence.

152
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,620
Even if Mo Yuan was alive

153
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,331
I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to
get anything from them either.

154
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,301
I'll go.

155
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,030
I'll go with you.

156
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,230
Mother, let me go.

157
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,280
All right. Don't fight over this.

158
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,301
You guys stay here.

159
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,191
Even if I can't fight them off

160
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:36,591
you will still be able to lead Qing Qiu.

161
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,520
Don't worry. Leave them with me.

162
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,961
But you only have twenty-some hours.
Go quickly and return quickly.

163
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,961
Wait for me to come back.

164
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,030
Li Jing, even though the Celestial Tribe
and Ghost Tribe are allies

165
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,380
Kunlun Mountain and Grand Ziming Palace
have a score that can never be settled.

166
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,051
Ninth and Master died
because of your father.

167
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,360
How dare you come to Kunlun Mountain?

168
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,640
I have inadvertently offended you all.

169
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,591
I came to see Si Yin.

170
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:39,510
Si Yin? You dare to come see her?

171
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,961
Who was the one who came up the
mountain every day to see Seventeenth?

172
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,610
Who was the one who
joined hands with Xuan Nu

173
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,390
to kill my master and fellow disciple?

174
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,250
You dare to come here to see Si Yin?

175
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:57,061
Please let Si Yin know that
I'm here to see her.

176
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:59,291
Please leave.

177
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,201
Please let Si Yin know that
I'm here to see her.

178
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:11,451
I've brought the item
that she wanted with me.

179
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:17,461
Si Yin has left Kunlun Mountain
and is roaming around on a cloud.

180
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:21,061
So no matter what you've brought
with you, she doesn't want it.

181
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,760
A-Yin left?

182
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,551
Please leave.

183
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,341
Master.

184
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:52,120
I haven't taken good care of
Seventeenth as Kunlun's senior.

185
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,721
Don't worry.

186
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,671
No matter where Seventeenth took you

187
00:15:57,671 --> 00:16:00,010
I will find you both.

188
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:12,150
Today, I will go down the mountain.

189
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,221
No matter how far I have to go
and how long I have to search

190
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:20,650
I will find Master's body
and Seventeenth.

191
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,041
You all have your parents.

192
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,350
Since Master isn't here

193
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,730
don't waste your time
here on Kunlun Mountain.

194
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,221
Leave the mountain.

195
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,600
- Senior!
- Senior!

196
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,561
Remember my words.

197
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,260
Master sacrificed his soul to destroy

198
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,270
the Bell of the East
Emperor for all the realms.

199
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,270
It wasn't because of a personal grudge.

200
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,880
Since the Celestial Tribe and
Ghost Tribe have formed an alliance

201
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,791
and there is peace

202
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,500
you must not go to the
Ghost Realm to seek revenge.

203
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,061
There is no more war in all the realms.

204
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,890
There aren't any refugees.

205
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,320
This is what Master wanted.

206
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,040
Si Yin is a troublemaker.

207
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,530
It's already enough that
he wouldn't let us bury him

208
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,730
but now he's taken away
Mo Yuan's corpse?

209
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,651
How can I explain this to the
immortals of the Celestial Tribe?

210
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:46,320
Don't you have many officials
who record history?

211
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,730
Just give them something to write about.

212
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:53,441
What do you mean?

213
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:56,270
Find a dignified reason

214
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,520
and just let the later generations
know where the God of War has gone.

215
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,951
What reason would be
convincing for everyone?

216
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:13,760
In the 63,082 autumn of Hao De's rule

217
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,661
after the war with Ghost Tribe

218
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,330
Heavenly Father's son Mo Yuan

219
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,911
and his seventeenth disciple Si Yin

220
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:22,020
have gone to live in seclusion.

221
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,010
They quietly disappeared
and are untraceable.

222
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,601
How about that?

223
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,260
They've gone to live
in seclusion together?

224
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,750
That's right.

225
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,401
They've gone to live
in seclusion together.

226
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:44,060
Dijun, you favor
Kunlun Mountain's disciples.

227
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,050
Judging from Heavenly Lord's complexion

228
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,201
it looked like he wanted to send
a hundred thousand soldiers

229
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,111
to arrest Si Yin.

230
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:57,050
You were able to soothe his anger.

231
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,111
What's the point in arresting him?

232
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,191
Si Yin was Mo Yuan's favorite.

233
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:11,851
It's probably his wish...
to be with this disciple after death.

234
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:29,040
Father! Father!

235
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,211
Hurry. Go.

236
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:45,611
Give this to Zhe Yan.

237
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,840
Okay.

238
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,240
Time is of the essence.

239
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,421
There's not enough time to
turn your essence into a pill.

240
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,330
When you cross repair
your essence with Fifth Sister

241
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,961
if you're interrupted by
the sound of the devil

242
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:15,230
you must not let it stop you.

243
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,740
Continue with the cross repair.

244
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,951
Leave the rest to me.

245
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:20,590
Okay.

246
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,391
You're awake.

247
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,161
Mother.

248
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,990
I'm not dead?

249
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,431
I've cross repaired half of your essence.

250
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:00,131
I've got you your life back.

251
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,181
Half of my essence...

252
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,310
Since a high immortal repaired
half of my essence

253
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,201
does that mean my powers are unlimited?

254
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,711
I don't have to be scared
of any calamities.

255
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:17,651
Yes, you can go around
causing trouble again.

256
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,840
Where's Master?

257
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,421
Mother, where's Master?

258
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,290
He's in Yanhua Cave.

259
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,921
That's the best place
to preserve a corpse.

260
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,330
That's good.

261
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,250
Mother, I've missed you.

262
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,681
I've missed you too.

263
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:45,211
I can't believe you came back half dead.

264
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:48,461
Looks like even though Mo Yuan
protected you from lightning

265
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:52,230
you still can't come down
from your godly ascension.

266
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,401
God has changed
his way of tormenting you.

267
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,770
You're right.

268
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,550
Godly ascension is too easy for me.

269
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,090
God can't stand the sight of it.

270
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,500
You used blood from your own heart

271
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,171
to preserve your master's body.

272
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:15,181
You've repaid the debt of his protecting
you from three bolts of lightning.

273
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:18,871
But Fifth Sister, you must know

274
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:22,590
since Mo Yuan has used your
blood to preserve his body

275
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,820
he has to keep using it.

276
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,550
He can't use another fox's.

277
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:31,151
I know, Mother.

278
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,560
But Master has showed me such grace.

279
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,840
What I'm doing for him is nothing
compared to what he's done for me.

280
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,871
Mother, do you think Master
will come back alive?

281
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,810
You're awake.

282
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,961
Is this my second brother's daughter?

283
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,790
Yes. I've brought her over
here for you to see her.

284
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:58,421
Come closer. Let me see.

285
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:00,111
Come quickly.

286
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:02,480
Here.

287
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,240
She's so pretty.

288
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:10,040
She has a birthmark on her forehead.

289
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,681
This birthmark...

290
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,601
Plumed cockscomb.

291
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,651
It's because of this plumed cockscomb

292
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:20,310
and because she's born in September

293
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,770
that I've named her Feng Jiu,
an ordinary name.

294
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,330
Combined with our last name Bai,
her name is Bai Feng Jiu.

295
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,250
Bai Feng Jiu?

296
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,340
Little Feng Jiu, did you know that

297
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,601
I tried to sneak down the mountain
with Ninth to come see you?

298
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:47,971
After many accidents, I ended up
in Grand Ziming Palace.

299
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:50,590
Fifth Sister, I don't mean to lecture you

300
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,990
but in all the realms

301
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,590
only you would dare to bring
Mo Yuan's body out here with you

302
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,490
causing trouble with Kunlun Mountain
and Celestial Palace.

303
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,141
Your fellow disciples are going crazy
looking everywhere for you and Mo Yuan.

304
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:07,750
At first, it was because
of my heavy injuries

305
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,260
and because I didn't know when
Master would vanish away

306
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,451
that I thought I'd come here to see
if there was a way.

307
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:18,621
Do you remember that
you're not actually Si Yin?

308
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:21,280
You're Qing Qiu fox clan's Bai Qian.

309
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,141
You have a mother, father,
and four brothers.

310
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,080
If you wanted to feed your
master blood from the heart

311
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,871
you could have just acted cute with me

312
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:30,431
and I'd feed him my blood for you.

313
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:33,921
Fourth Brother, I needed
to repay Master's kindness.

314
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,840
It has nothing to do with you.

315
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,621
Silly girl.

316
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,711
Fifth Sister is right.

317
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:44,000
Mo Yuan protected her
from the lightning.

318
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,421
She repaid him by using the
magic blood from her heart.

319
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,861
That is reasonable.

320
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:55,701
But if you did it,
and Mo Yuan comes back one day

321
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,820
he would have received
your kindness gratuitously.

322
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,361
How would he repay you?

323
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,451
You're right, Mother.

324
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:06,651
You.

325
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,040
All right, forget it.

326
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,810
Take care of Fifth Sister.

327
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,790
I am going to the Celestial
Palace with your father.

328
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:17,020
Because of the new heir that was born?

329
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,560
Yes.

330
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,441
I have to go now.

331
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:23,330
Oh yeah, don't be too naughty.

332
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,641
Fifth Sister is really weak right now.
You can't play around her.

333
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:27,941
Don't worry, Mother.

334
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:32,371
Zhe Yan and I will just chat
with her and play with Feng Jiu.

335
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,040
- Don't worry, Mother.
- Don't worry.

336
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,270
You two are the most alike.

337
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,480
But you are the most disobedient.

338
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,290
Little Feng Jiu.

339
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,161
Master.

340
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,641
After getting half of Mother's essence

341
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:17,361
I'm able to preserve your body.

342
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,840
I will wait here for you to come back

343
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,010
and for you to grandly
reappear in Kunlun Mountain

344
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,631
where everyone will worship you.

345
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,361
Ever since taking you away from
Kunlun Mountain on my own accord

346
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,431
for the past 70,000 years

347
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,320
I haven't stepped foot
outside of Qing Qiu.

348
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,441
I heard all my fellow disciples have
returned to their own tribes.

349
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,290
The Kunlun Mountain where crowds
of immortals go for worship

350
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,361
has become an uninhabited holy land.

351
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,340
The Celestial Tribe and
Ghost Tribe are friends again.

352
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,101
Gradually, the names of the God of War
Mo Yuan and Ghost Lord Qing Cang

353
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:29,310
have been buried under Kunlun Mountain's
endless leaves and river sediments.

354
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,800
No one mentions them anymore.

355
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,971
<i>[70,000 years later]</i>

356
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,451
Master, in seven days

357
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,790
it'll be the day when
Qing Cang breaks the seal

358
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,101
and comes out from the bell.

359
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,050
Don't worry, Master.

360
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,461
Even if I have to sacrifice my life

361
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,861
I will seal him again.

362
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:51,810
I won't let you down.

363
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:18,671
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

364
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,851
Aunt, you're so beautiful.

365
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,471
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

366
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:26,971
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

367
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,621
Here, what do you think of this one?

368
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,070
This one is good.

369
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,090
Yes.

370
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,931
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

371
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,270
Hello, Aunt.

372
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,411
Aunt, are you going to the mountain pass?

373
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,290
It's all my fault.

374
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,300
I shouldn't have kept you
and Shao Xing in the cave.

375
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,480
You look awful.

376
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,131
You're not even married yet.

377
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,980
Do you have that much to worry about?

378
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,851
Aunt, something big has happened.

379
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,371
What happened?

380
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,881
Forget it. Come here, Aunt.

381
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,141
Mi Gu, what happened? Tell me quickly.

382
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,411
Sang Ji came to the Fox Den.

383
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:23,480
Then I'll keep going
to the mountain pass.

384
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,020
No, Aunt.

385
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,760
Even if you can hide away for a month,
you couldn't possibly do it for a year.

386
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,181
Your marriage to the second prince was
arranged by Heavenly Lord and Fox King.

387
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,861
You'll have to marry him eventually.

388
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,951
The second prince came
to Fox Den to see you.

389
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,961
That's a given.

390
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,721
Life is unpredictable.

391
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:42,550
I could die and vanish in a few days.

392
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,270
I have to waste my time serving him?

393
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,060
Why should I suffer like that?

394
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,961
Aunt, if you don't want to marry,
then don't.

395
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,881
Why are you cursing yourself?

396
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:56,631
I won't talk about this anymore.

397
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:01,750
Mi Gu, you and Shao Xing
take care of that person at Fox Den.

398
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,780
I'll go hide for a bit in
the Peach Tree Woods.

399
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,320
Aunt, he is the second prince
of the Celestial Tribe after all.

400
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,480
You can't just keep hiding from him.

401
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,020
You're not going to do as I say?

402
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,820
I wouldn't dare.

403
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,500
Then hurry and go.

404
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,750
When he leaves, come find
me in the Peach Tree Woods.

405
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,471
Okay.

406
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,161
What?

407
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,580
She's gone to mountain pass
to train again?

408
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,461
Yes, Your Highness.

409
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,411
Doesn't she know that I came?

410
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,030
She knows.

411
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,601
But as the ruler of eastern Qing Qiu

412
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,361
she has to put her people first.

413
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,800
Training and ascending
as soon as possible

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,570
is a part of her duty as a ruler.

415
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:59,560
You're right, but I've been
waiting here for her for a month.

416
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,520
I've never even seen her face.

417
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,681
Isn't that ridiculous?

418
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,851
Your Highness, please have some fruit.

419
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:14,590
I just bought these.

420
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,760
<i>Second Prince treats
Shao Xing pretty well.</i>

421
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,861
<i>That's good.
I don't have to deal with him.</i>

422
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,310
Second Prince.

423
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,320
In the Nine Heavens,
I am the most favored prince.

424
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,901
But why is it so hard for me
to be with the one I love?

425
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,540
If Your Highness really
wants to be with me

426
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,931
then please honorably break off
your arranged marriage with Aunt.

427
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,300
She is my savior,
and treats me really well.

428
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,090
I can't just leave with you.

429
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,050
Bai Qian does treat you well.

430
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,141
She even gave you
Lord of Numinous Treasure's

431
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:28,010
Cloud Clearing Fan for protection.

432
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:31,851
Do you know what kind of person
Lord of Numinous Treasure is?

433
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,440
I don't know.

434
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,510
He is the last disciple of Lord Yuan Shi.

435
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,621
No, that's not right.

436
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:45,981
He's not the last disciple.

437
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,911
I forgot.

438
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:52,851
My nephew Ye Hua is actually
Lord Yuan Shi's last disciple.

439
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,280
The name Ye Hua...

440
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,280
I've heard Fourth Uncle and
Zhe Yan talk about it.

441
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,300
But speaking of that fan

442
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,161
I've heard that Lord of Numinous
Treasure gave it to someone.

443
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:13,851
But how did Bai Qian end up with it?

444
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,181
I heard Aunt say that

445
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,440
Lord of Numinous Treasure gave this fan

446
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,481
to the high immortal Si Yin
from Kunlun Mountain.

447
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:29,050
Later, Si Yin gave it as
a birthday gift to Zhe Yan

448
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,920
so he sent it over to
the Peach Tree Woods.

449
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,951
And then, this cloud clearing fan
ended up with Aunt.

450
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:39,871
It went through a lot.

451
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:44,130
Later, Aunt gave it to me
for another reason.

452
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,221
So it was Si Yin.

453
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,451
Let's not talk about others.

454
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,851
Shao Xing, listen to me.

455
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:59,440
My marriage with Bai Qian was arranged
by Celestial Lord and Fox King.

456
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,221
So we must take our time
and come up with a way.

457
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:08,721
Since you were young, you've had a
sad life without any family or friends.

458
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,791
Even though Bai Qian took you in

459
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:13,641
you can't always stay by her side.

460
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,411
According to Qing Qiu's rules

461
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:19,251
if you get married, she has to
be the one to arrange it for you.

462
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:22,411
Do you want to spend the rest of
your life with a man you don't know?

463
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,670
No! I won't marry any other man.

464
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,931
Since Your Highess is the one in my heart

465
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:32,260
I will stay by your side
even if it's just as a servant.

466
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,360
Since you think that way,
then why delay it?

467
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,760
Let's go. Come with me to
the Celestial Palace now.

468
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,490
Second Prince.

469
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:45,101
You and I have already
been together for a month.

470
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,521
Can't you tell how I feel about you?

471
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,951
But I can't betray Aunt.

472
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,920
I've never even seen her.

473
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,751
How is this betraying her?

474
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,661
We're just binded by
an arranged marriage.

475
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:01,181
Think about it.

476
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:03,791
If it wasn't because she wouldn't
meet with me this whole month

477
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:08,490
I wouldn't have had the chance to get
to know you at Qing Qiu Fox Den.

478
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,911
Isn't this fate?

479
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,710
I will protect you from now on.

480
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,990
I won't let you be a servant.

481
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,851
I will marry you.

482
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,871
I will see you out on behalf of Aunt.

483
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:47,840
We've finally gotten rid of that VIP.

484
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,021
Shao Xing, hurry and tidy up.

485
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:52,351
I'll go to the
Peach Tree Woods to get Aunt.

486
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,871
Shao Xing?

487
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:58,201
Shao Xing?

488
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,931
Where did she go?

489
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,820
Second Prince.

490
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,510
Second Uncle.

491
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,121
Crown Prince.

492
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,371
Has Heavenly Lord been back
to the Palace in the past few days?

493
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,380
I heard he came back today.

494
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,360
Third Uncle.

495
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,481
You wanted to see me?

496
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,920
The memos to the emperor
the past few days

497
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,641
all talk about disasters
in Zhong Rong State.

498
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:47,971
I was wondering if you knew anything
about the Scarlet Flame Golden Tiger.

499
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:49,380
Huh?

500
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,800
Scarlet Flame Golden Tiger was
Qing Cang's underling.

501
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,981
After Qing Cang was sealed in the Bell of
the Eastern Emperor 70,000 years ago

502
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,021
he disappeared without a trace.

503
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:02,661
He only reappeared today at Mount Junji
of the Far East in Zhong Rong State.

504
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:06,490
This beast is fierce, belligerent,
and recklessly wreaks havoc.

505
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,141
Not only has he caused Zhong Rong State
to be in a ten year drought

506
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,760
but he also captured
Zhong Rong State's queen.

507
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,840
The king was so ashamed
that he killed himself.

508
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,561
What a pity. Then?

509
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,630
That king was an immortal
appointed by Dong Hua Dijun.

510
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,460
He came to Celestial Palace after death

511
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,931
and told us all the details of
Scarlet Flame Golden Tiger's evil.

512
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,960
You wanted to see me because of this?

513
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:55,760
From when you turned 50,000, you've gone
through all the memos to the emporer.

514
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,601
You never spoke much to me.

515
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:01,001
What's with you today?

516
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,340
I saw Second Uncle today.

517
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,400
Second Brother came back?

518
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,840
So soon?

519
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,721
Didn't Father want him to live
in Qing Qiu for at least three months

520
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,201
to talk more with Bai Qian
to grow their relationship?

521
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,371
I don't know what happened
between Second Uncle and Bai Qian.

522
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:22,050
I just know that he brought a snake
spirit with him when he came back.

523
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,630
A snake spirit?

524
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,440
A lady.

525
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,320
A lady?

526
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:31,501
Oh no.

527
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,721
Your Highness, I don't understand.

528
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:40,811
So what if it's a woman?

529
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,440
It's not like there are
no women in the Palace.

530
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,411
Qing Qiu's Bai Qian once took in
a snake spirit 70,000 years ago.

531
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,791
It's that lady.

532
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,561
What you mean is

533
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:56,900
Second Prince sneakily brought
his fiancee's servant back?

534
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:03,800
Your Highness wanted Third Prince
to come up with a plan early on.

535
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,940
Qing Qiu's Bai Qian is a strange lady.

536
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,911
She gave away Lord of Numinous
Treasures's cloud clearing fan

537
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,280
to that snake spirit.

538
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,871
Talk of that was spread
all over the realms.

539
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,960
You may leave.

540
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,701
- Yes.
- Yes.

541
