00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:03,372
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.

2
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:04,872
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.
Something's off.

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:05,812
So far, he's hit a right fly
and been struck-out.

4
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:07,012
There's the first pitch.
It's a ball.

5
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:08,712
There's the first pitch.
It's a ball.
Something's off.

6
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:09,752
Kumamoto's pitcher, Suzuki,
had started the game...

7
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:11,112
Kumamoto's pitcher, Suzuki,
had started the game...
Something's off.

8
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:11,642
Kumamoto's pitcher, Suzuki,
had started the game...

9
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:12,152
...having already pitched
fourteen innings.

10
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,382
...having already pitched
fourteen innings.
Something seems off.
It just somehow felt that way.

11
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:14,482
Something seems off.
It just somehow felt that way.

12
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,292
What an incredible spirit, he's able to
keep going despite giving up seven runs.

14
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,922

I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

15
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:19,562
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

16
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:20,992
The second pitch is...
I had absolutely no interest in the
prefectural baseball game on TV,

17
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:24,562
And it's up... a left fly ball.
One out.
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

18
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:24,632
But I kind of ended up
rooting for the losing side.

19
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:24,732
The score is still seven to zero.
But I kind of ended up

The score is still seven to zero.

21
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,272
The score is still seven to zero.
Once I did, I kind of got the feeling that
Haruhi was going to start something.

22
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,232
The score is still seven to zero.

23
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:31,032
The score is still seven to zero.
Incoming call: Haruhi Suzumiya

24
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:31,902
The score is still seven to zero.

25
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,292
The gap between the
scores is big,

26
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:37,972
but Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.

27
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:38,342
But Kumamoto still has a chance
if they can hold out here.
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

28
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:38,842
Kyon, the phone's ringing.

29
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,182
The passionate voices cheering from the
third base bleachers have not died down.

I know, you don't
have to tell me.

32
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:42,542
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

33
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:47,122
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?

34
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:47,352
There's Suzuki, they need him to do
his best, don't they, Mr. Kiru?
You're not doing anything today, right?
We're meeting at 2PM in front of the station.

38
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,852
After all, you never know how a match is
going to turn out. They still have hope.

I didn't even
say anything...

43
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:55,262
I didn't even
say anything...

44
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:56,782
Right.
I didn't even
say anything...

45
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,362
Next, stepping up to the batter's box we
have number four, Kashima, a senior.

48
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:02,802
After last year's summer tournament, he
was chosen for the team that went to Cuba.

And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

55
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:07,502
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

56
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,372
And there's Suzuki
with a big windup...
And be sure to bring your bike.
That's all, over and out!

57
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,512
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.
I still haven't...

58
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,172
And the first pitch is a strike.
No problems there.

59
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:14,442
That was a good pitch.

60
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,982
That was a good pitch.
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

61
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:16,082
I had the feeling that I knew
what Haruhi was going to say.

62
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,822
That was a strong, straight pitch,
thrown a little high and inside.

No, not quite.

65
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:19,752
No, not quite.

66
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:20,182
Perhaps he feels like
he's got nothing left to lose.
No, not quite.

67
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:20,282
Perhaps he feels like

68
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,522
Perhaps he feels like

To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

69
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:22,622
To be precise, it felt like this exact
same conversation had happened before.

70
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:24,222
We don't know that yet.
He winds up for the second pitch...

He winds up for the second pitch...
I guess it's what you
would call deja vu.

73
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:32,222
It's a hit! And it's a big one!
It's headed for left field...

74
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,232
And it's good!
It's a single-run home run!

75
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:40,772
Jyonan has gotten their eighth run!
This gives them yet another point.

76
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:42,542
Kashima is slowly rounding
third base.

77
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,532

You're late, Kyon!
Show some more motivation!

95
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:23,792
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry I made you wait.

96
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:26,302
I just got here, too.

97
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:30,882
- Okay, we're all here, so let's go.
- Where are we going?

98
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:34,342
To the public swimming pool,
of course!

99
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,852
Well, I guess that makes sense
considering what I brought.

100
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:40,512
We have to do summer vacation-y things
during our summer vacation!

101
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:44,322
We can never get back the time
that we've lost!

102
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:49,362
And so we're going to do them now, in our
one and only summer as tenth graders.

103
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,132
By the way, we're going
to the pool by bike.

104
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,702
Did you ride
your bikes, too?

105
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:59,432
No, the only two bikes we have
are yours and mine.

106
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:04,442
Kyon, you'd better not lose
to Koizumi.

107
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,012
This train is leaving
the station!

108
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:14,852
Come on, you two, hurry up
and park your bikes.

109
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:20,032
Hey now, Kyon, we're about to go have
fun. This is no time to be exhausted.

110
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:22,032
Whose fault do you think
this is?

111
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:27,032
Oh, the scent of chlorine.
This really makes it feel like a pool!

112
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,912
Come on, let's get in!
We're going to race!

113
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,172
No diving
It's dangerous
Come on, let's get in!
We're going to race!

114
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,742
Oh, Miss Suzumiya, wait!

115
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,072
That looks like fun.

116
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:38,612
It sure does.

117
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,622
This makes me smile, though.
It feels peaceful.

118
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:48,722
She has some rather normal ways of
enjoying her time, don't you think?

119
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:52,822
Calling out of the blue to invite someone
out to do something and only giving

120
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:56,832
a general idea of what's going to
happen isn't what I'd call "normal".

121
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,932
In my opinion,
that's really nothing.

122
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:04,172
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having
a good time like that,

123
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,672
isn't likely to shake up
the world, after all.

124
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,742
I hope that's
the case...

125
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,052
What's wrong?

126
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:18,352
It's nothing... It's probably
just my imagination.

127
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,392
Because so much has happened
since the beginning of spring,

128
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,192
I've become
a little paranoid.

129
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,802
Oh, I lost again!

130
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,022
Yuki, let's go
one more time!

131
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,162
Here I come!

132
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:43,812
Delicious!
This is delicious, Mikuru!

133
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:50,022
Jeez.

134
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:55,112
I think it would be better to call this place
a communal pool than a public pool.

135
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:58,592
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

136
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:01,222
Jeez.

137
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:06,232
I think it would be better to call this place
a communal pool than a public pool.

138
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:09,462
I wonder why Haruhi
chose this place.

139
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,342
What is this feeling?

140
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:21,982
Right, and then Haruhi
says this...

141
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,482
"These two are my
brigade members."

142
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:28,082
"They'll do anything you ask,
so ask for anything you want!"

143
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,662
Okay, let's have some fun!
We're going to play water soccer.

144
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:34,502
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,932
Well, deja vu isn't
all that uncommon.

146
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,072
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...

147
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,432
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival
fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...
What is that?

148
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,772
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the
rest of our short summer vacation.

149
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:51,202
I realized that we only have two weeks
of summer vacation left.

150
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,182
We're going to pick up
the pace!

151
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:56,612
All this in just
two weeks?

152
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,352
Is there anything else
you want to do, Mikuru?

153
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:05,952
Umm... I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

154
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:11,062
Okay!
Goldfish scooping...

155
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:12,632
Done!

156
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,462
Pardon me
for a moment.

157
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,502
- Thank you.
- Done already?

158
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,402
Yes.

159
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:23,072
Okay then,
we're starting tomorrow!

160
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:28,212
Is there a place nearby with a Bon festival?
A fireworks show works, too.

161
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:30,082
I'll check around.

162
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,052
Don't forget about the
goldfish scooping!

163
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,822
Roger that.

164
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,462
I'm paying again?

165
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:45,072
All right, then,
we're done for today!

166
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,562
If you'll excuse me.

167
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,462
I have to go, too...

168
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:57,882
Nagato!

169
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,722
Umm... no, it's
nothing important.

170
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:07,182
How have you been?
Everything fine?

171
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,482
Fine.

172
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,322
That's good to hear.

173
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,682
Right.

174
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:17,032
S-Sorry about
stopping you.

175
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:19,462
Sorry!

176
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:24,132
What the heck?
Why did I talk to her?

177
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:34,222
The next morning, it was a call from
Haruhi that awoke me from my slumber.

178
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:39,052
They found a place having a Bon festival.
It was tonight at a public park.

179
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,022
Kyon! You're last again!

180
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,492
Jeez.

181
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:49,162
Oh well. Let's go
buy yukata!

182
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,832
Haruhi entered a women's
clothing outlet store.

183
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,572
Come on, hurry up!
She just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

184
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:55,672
She just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

185
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:56,412
Leave it to me!
She just went and chose yukata
for Miss Asahina and Nagato,

186
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:56,512
Leave it to me!

187
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:57,572
Leave it to me!
And then headed straight
for the changing rooms.

188
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:58,872
And then headed straight
for the changing rooms.

189
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:04,842
After making us wait about an hour or so,
the three of them finally came out at once.

190
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,382
What do you think?

191
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,082
We're pretty hot,
aren't we?

192
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,052
You all
look wonderful.

193
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:15,382
Of course! I chose
these yukata, after all.

194
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,292
Especially Mikuru!

195
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,892
It's so cute on you!
It's just too cute!

196
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:22,052
Just what you would expect
from my choice!

197
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,792
O-Of course.

198
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:26,772
Miss Asahina!
Twirl... twirl!

199
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,532
Wow, this is amazing!

200
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,372
Yeah! It's nice and lively!

201
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:35,242
A Bon festival, huh?

202
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:39,402
I guess it makes sense for there
to be this many... people.

203
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:45,652
There... there it is again.
What is this feeling?

204
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:47,682
Mikuru!

205
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:50,952
They have goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

206
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,822
Be sure to catch
a bunch!

207
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:53,692
Okay!

208
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:57,732
Shall we play, too?
How about a competition?

209
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,132
I'll pass.

210
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:02,832
What about you, Nagato?
Want to eat something?

211
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:09,772
Oh, you're interested
in that stuff?

212
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,512
- Which one?
- It's all right.

213
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:18,242
- This one.
- Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.

214
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,192
I kind of got the feeling that
Nagato had been helping us out,

215
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:24,422
so I thought it would be appropriate
for me to at least buy her that, but...

216
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:29,462
Thirteen! But I don't need
so many, so I just kept one.

217
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,572
That's amazing.

218
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,092
You can have one,
but only one.

219
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:35,772
Thanks.

220
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,672
Huh? What's with
the mask?

221
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:41,942
I bought it.

222
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,272
Huh. I see.

223
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:48,972
Now then, next up is fireworks! Let's
launch some fireworks to end the day!

224
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,182
It was summer,
and summer vacation.

225
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:53,962
I won't let you destroy it!

226
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:56,292
I won't let you destroy it!
That's why I wanted to forget about it,

227
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,122
but there was one thing
lingering in my mind.

228
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:03,292
All right, tomorrow we'll be
catching bugs!

229
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:04,522
Haruhi.

230
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:08,002
It's fine to want to play around, but are you
finished with your summer homework?

231
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:13,002
What? You can finish homework
like that in just three days.

232
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:14,072
Three days!?

233
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:19,482
You get that stuff out of the way so you can
have fun without having to worry about it.

234
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:22,612
That's how you enjoy
your summer vacation.

235
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:25,982
Why is she
so smart?

236
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:28,382
It seems like the guys up in
heaven that were divvying up

237
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,522
the stats for us were being
pretty lax about it.

238
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,562
And so, tomorrow we'll
be catching bugs!

239
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:37,362
Whoever catches
the most bugs...

240
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:42,872
Okay, they'll get to be the
brigade leader for a day!

241
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:43,972
No thanks!

242
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:47,772
That sounds interesting.
Are any bugs okay?

243
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:52,112
Hmm... only cicadas!

244
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:56,412
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's
Cicada Capturing Competition!

245
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:02,152
The next day was yet again
a beautiful day.

246
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,232
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

247
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,062
Oh, no!
It was on this day that we had the SOS
Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.

248
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:06,162
Oh, no!

249
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:06,732
Oh, no!
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

250
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,362
It looks like each of us did try,
in their own way,

251
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:12,432
but of course, or something to that effect,
the winner ended up being Haruhi.

252
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:16,732
A catch and release attitude
is important, right?

253
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:20,542
If we let them go, then they
might come back to repay us.

254
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:24,182
What could a cicada do,
even if it did come back?

255
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,612
There you go! Go back
to the mountains!

256
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:35,552
For some reason, I kind of feel like
Pandora opening her box.

257
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,722
W-Welcome!

258
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:40,832
The next day, even though we had
no idea what was going on,

259
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:45,732
we were made to wear frog costumes for
our part-time job at the supermarket.

260
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,232
Good work, everyone.

261
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:51,202
What's with this difference
in how we're being treated?

262
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,332
Thanks for the hard work.
The manager is thankful.

263
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:59,042
I don't care about his thanks.
Where's our pay?

264
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,342
That's it.

265
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,152
I've wanted that
for a while.

266
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:09,022
The owner said that he'd give it to us
for Mikuru's sake.

267
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:13,152
We worked, sweat pouring down
our foreheads, for that?

268
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:15,922
Let's hang that up in the
clubroom as a memento.

269
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:21,802
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever
you want. You have my permission!

270
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:34,612
That night, a single phone call
stole me away from my slumber.

271
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:42,022
Oh, come on!
Hello?

272
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:46,322
Kyon...

273
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,162
Miss Asahina!?

274
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,062
Yes, it's me...

275
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:58,572
Something... very not good has...
At this rate, I...

276
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,802
What do I...

277
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:03,382
- Umm...
- Hello, this is Koizumi.

278
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:06,652
Why are you with
Miss Asahina?

279
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:09,142
Certain circumstances
came up.

280
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,882
Would it be possible for you
to come join us right now?

281
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,892
Why you... why you!

282
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,422
What in the world happened,
Miss Asahina?

283
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,392
Kyon...

284
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:28,632
I... can't go back
to the future...

285
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,502
I can't understand
what she's saying...

286
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,772
In other words,
this is what's going on.

287
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:38,512
We are going through an eternal loop
of the same time period.

288
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:42,512
Even if you say something as impossible
as that with a smile on your face...

289
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:46,952
Koizumi, do you realize what
you're saying? Do you?

290
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:51,052
I do. Much more than
I wish I did.

291
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:54,462
I had just been speaking
with Miss Asahina.

292
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,162
Call me too.
And then don't come.

293
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:59,962
And as a result, what we realized
was that recently,

294
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:02,832
the flow of time
was a bit strange.

295
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,432
You might want to credit this
to Miss Asahina.

296
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,272
Thanks to her,
I was able to confirm it.

297
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,172
Confirm what?

298
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:16,152
That we have experienced the same
span of time numerous times.

299
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,982
You said that earlier.

300
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:23,022
To be precise, we've been repeating
the time from August 17th to the 31st.

301
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:26,792
We're in the middle of an
endless summer vacation.

302
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,402
Well, it is summer
vacation, but...

303
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:32,522
It's a never-ending
endless summer.

304
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:38,102
This world has lost all time
after September 1st.

305
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:41,432
Who'd believe that?

306
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:45,042
We'd like for you
to believe it.

307
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:51,282
Are we trapped inside one of
those closed spaces?

308
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,122
That's not it.

309
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,722
A single portion of time
has been torn away.

310
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:02,562
At exactly the point when it becomes
midnight on August 31st,

311
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:07,762
everything resets, and we go back
to August 17th. That's the process.

312
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:10,632
So what about our...
no, humanity's memories?

313
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:15,232
Those are reset as well. Everything
starts over from the beginning.

314
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:20,412
So you mean that time does that
thing that you mentioned.

315
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:24,612
Well, we do have someone from the
future here, I guess it can't be helped.

316
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:28,282
Oh no, Miss Asahina
isn't involved in this.

317
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,762
Okay then,
what's the culprit?

318
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,762
I would guess
Miss Suzumiya.

319
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:39,562
I'm sure she doesn't realize it,
but somewhere inside of her

320
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:42,472
is a desire to not let
summer vacation end.

321
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,102
What the heck? Do you mean she
feels regret over something?

322
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,112
That's what
I believe.

323
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:50,582
Perhaps she feels that there's
something left

324
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,412
that she wants to do during
our summer vacation?

325
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:57,852
Man, the hopeless situations she causes
unfold on a galactic scale.

326
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,412
So, what are you saying
I should do?

327
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,052
If we knew that, we would
have this problem solved.

328
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:08,562
I've been wondering this since I got here,
but you seem awfully cheerful about this.

329
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,062
It's because we've finally
been able to solve the mystery

330
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:14,162
of the frequent feelings of
deja vu that I've had recently,

331
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,572
and that you may
have had, too.

332
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:19,972
Now that I think about it, those inexplicable
feelings may have been

333
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,482
remnants from when our
memories have been reset.

334
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,942
Is it possible that other people
across the world feel this, too?

335
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:31,452
It doesn't seem that way.
You and I are a special case.

336
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,922
What about Haruhi? Does she
sense any of this at all?

337
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:42,002
Not at all, it seems. It would
probably be bad for us if she did.

338
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:48,832
However, I believe that there is
one person who remembers everything,

339
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:52,872
more than the
deja vu that we do.

340
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,802
And who would
that be?

341
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,502
I think you know,
even without my saying.

342
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,812
- Is that right?
- It is.

343
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,352
- You remember all of it?
- Right.

344
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:09,322
So, how many times have we repeated
all of this, this time?

345
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:13,522
This is the 15,527th time.

346
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:16,222
15,527?

347
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:21,432
What do you mean by 15,527?
Nagato, what are you saying?

348
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,372
Are you serious?

349
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:26,602
I am.

350
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:31,242
You're saying that we've done the
exact same things that many times?

351
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:33,372
They're not all guaranteed
to happen.

352
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:37,852
Out of 15,527 repetitions,
there are two occasions,

353
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,982
#2,391 and #11,054, where we
did not go to a Bon festival.

354
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,292
A pattern where we did
go to a Bon festival,

355
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:47,882
but did not go to a goldfish scooping
stand, occurred 437 times.

356
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:51,092
We've had a part-time job 9,052 times,
and when we did,

357
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,202
there were six different
kinds of jobs that we did.

358
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:55,702
In addition to handing out balloons,
we also worked as movers,

359
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,272
cashiers,
we handed out flyers-

360
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,012
That's... enough.

361
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,442
See you later.

362
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:16,252
15,527 times,
that's what Nagato said.

363
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:22,122
Times two weeks,
hmm, that's around 595 years.

364
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:30,002
She alone has memories of all that time,
repeating it all over and over...

365
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:36,182
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that
same period of time over and over again?

366
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,312
The next day,
we went stargazing.

367
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,312
The location was
Nagato's apartment,

368
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:46,822
and the telescope was one that
Koizumi had gotten for us.

369
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,052
I wonder if they exist.

370
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,992
- If what exist?
- Martians.

371
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,662
I kind of don't
want them to.

372
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:56,292
When man finally
sets foot on Mars,

373
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:59,962
I'm sure that they'll come out
from under their cover and welcome us,

374
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,202
saying, "Welcome to Mars!"

375
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:07,702
Oh, I'm bored of this.
UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.

376
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:14,682
Exactly what does she
want to do?

377
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:17,222
Now what could
that be?

378
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:20,792
If we could figure that out,
this would all be solved...

379
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:24,722
How about trying
this out?

380
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,792
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden
embrace from behind,

381
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:30,862
then whisper "I love you"
into her ear.

382
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,732
And who would
be doing that?

383
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,702
Is there anyone else who could
fill the role other than you?

384
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:41,372
I love you... No, I'm graduating
from your control.

385
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,012
All right, how about
if I do it?

386
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:50,312
I'm kidding. I'm lacking a certain
something for the role.

387
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:54,212
And all that would do is cause unnecessary
confusion in Miss Suzumiya.

388
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:01,792
Next, we went off
to a batting center.

389
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,902
Hey, Nagato,

390
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:08,132
you were aware of this loop before
Miss Asahina said anything, right?

391
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:09,242
Yes.

392
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,272
If that's the case,
why didn't you say anything?

393
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,532
It's my job
to observe.

394
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,852
I see.

395
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:21,582
Home run

396
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,982
We continued to run through a torrent
of summer vacation events.

397
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,152
A fireworks show.
Goby fishing tournament.

398
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:34,192
Test of courage. Movie watching.
We went to the beach.

399
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:37,262
We just kept going.

400
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:41,102
Of course, I knew that this
wasn't going to satisfy Haruhi.

401
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,502
Even still, there wasn't anything
I could do about it,

402
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:48,802
and so we ended up
at August 30th...

403
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,782
With this, we've finished
everything on our list.

404
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,612
Hmm. I wonder if this
was good enough.

405
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,682
But, hmm, well...
I guess this works.

406
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,792
Hey, is there anything else
you want to do?

407
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,232
That's fine, then.

408
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:16,602
We were able to do a lot this summer,
so that's enough, right?

409
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:21,032
No, it's not.
You're still not satisfied.

410
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,372
Okay, we're done
for today.

411
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:27,882
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

412
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,012
Let's meet again in the clubroom
the day after tomorrow.

413
00:22:33,822 --> 00:22:35,192
W-Wait, Haru-

414
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,482
Okay, we're done
for today.

415
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:42,362
I had tomorrow set aside just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

416
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:43,592
There it is again!

417
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:46,292
And it's a strong one,
stronger than ever before.

418
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,432
I can't let Haruhi leave.

419
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:51,832
If she goes, we'll end up repeating
these past two weeks

420
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:54,912
for the some-thousandth
time again.

421
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,442
But what should I do?

422
00:22:57,582 --> 00:23:00,642
There must have been a hint
somewhere in what Haruhi said.

423
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,372
But what was it?

424
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,522
What has she said
up to this point?

425
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:08,652
I don't know...
I can't remember...

426
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:16,992
August 31st.

427
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:18,702
Impossible

428
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,202
Impossible
I haven't touched my homework.
Whatever, it doesn't matter anymore.

429
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:21,862
I haven't touched my homework.
Whatever, it doesn't matter anymore.

430
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:29,342
If we're just going to do it all over again,
then there's no point to doing it.

431
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:35,942
Whether tomorrow comes or not, I'll leave
it to the me at that time to deal with it.

432
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,932
Sora kara ochite kitanda
It fell from the sky

433
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:49,662

With all of the wishes
that were made upon it

434
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:54,632
hitotsu no hoshi niwa

Maybe it was a little too heavy
for a single star

435
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,532
yappari nanika henda yo
Something just doesn't
seem right

436
00:23:57,672 --> 00:24:00,142

The image of you in my mind
has vanished

00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:04,442

Can I say that
I remember you clearly?

438
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:05,942
Tomare!
Stop!

439
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:09,742
Kako wa jibun no mono
The past belongs

440
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:14,262

Of course I don't want to trade it

441
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,622

That's because

442
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:20,822
basudei datta watashitachi niwa
It was my birthday,
and when we saw each other

00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,662

We could see

Worrying about
