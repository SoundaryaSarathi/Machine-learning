00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,790
"Is This the End!? A Brutally Transcendent
Power Attacks Gohan"

2
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,050
Bungling jackass! That's what you get for
being distracted by that Nameksei-jin kid!

3
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:52,630
K- Kakarotto, that smooth-headed one, and so on,
all those guys from Earth take things too easily!

4
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,840
Oh, my fault, my fault. It seems I have too much power, and can't control myself all that well.

5
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,460
Krillin-san!

6
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,470
Who would have thought you could still be this spirited?

7
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,690
Gohan...

8
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,780
How does that feel?

9
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,850
Not yet?

10
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,860
Not yet?

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,460
Damn it, not yet? Then how long?

12
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,230
Calm down, Yamcha!

13
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,940
It's not good to get so carried away!

14
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,510
How am I supposed to be calm about this?

15
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Right now, Goku and Krillin and the others are off
fighting for their lives against someone so awful,

16
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,310
they don't know if they can beat him or not!

17
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,050
And yet, here I am, so far away...

18
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,830
I want to go and fight as well. However,
getting worked up won't help.

19
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,800
Goku and Piccolo are sure to do well!

20
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,570
You must realize the only thing we
can do is to continue our training now,

21
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,300
so that if we do get to Namek, we'll be
able to fight as hard as we'd like to.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,500
Goku, after how I warned you against getting near Freeza...

23
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,140
He wields enough terrifying power
to destroy the entire universe!

24
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,580
Kaio-sama?

25
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,680
What is it, you guys?
Why aren't you training?

26
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
What is the matter? You are so absorbed in thought.

27
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,220
Your face is so pallid. Are you all right?

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,520
M- My face has been this color since birth!

29
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,730
I- I trust nothing bad has happened on Planet Namek?

30
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,230
Is it Goku?

31
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,830
Or maybe Piccolo?

32
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,910
I'm finished!

33
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:47,290
I've had it! I want a bed! I want a shower! I want cake
with strawberries, and lots of strawberry cake!

34
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,040
I want to be a cloud, too.

35
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,950
Oh dear, that looks just like Krillin!

36
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,290
Speaking of which, what could he possibly be dilly-dallying
around about right now? I mean, really!

37
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,620
I don't suppose they could have left me
behind and gone back to Earth,
could they?

38
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,930
Or maybe they've been wiped out
by Vegeta, or that Freeza guy!

39
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,070
No, that couldn't be! I mean, Son-kun is here, after all!

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
They're okay, for sure!

41
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,670
They're okay...

42
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:04,840
So, this is the end for me? What a shame!
I wanted to get married, even just once...

43
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,850
Krillin's Ki is dropping rapidly.

44
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Hold on just a while longer, everyone.
Just until I've fully recovered. Please!

45
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,270
So, you've finally snuffed it, then?

46
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,510
Krillin...

47
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,550
Krillin-san!

48
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,200
So fast!

49
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,770
You're thinking of saving him?
It's pointless, he'll die momentarily.

50
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,220
How about instead, you worry about your own safety?

51
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,620
Then again, you can worry all you like,
it doesn't matter if you're a Nameksei-jin...

52
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,020
...or an Earthling...

53
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,200
...or a Saiyajin...

54
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,840
...it won't, of course, change the fact that you're going to die.

55
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,370
Out...

56
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,650
Out...

57
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,310
OUT OF MY WAY!!

58
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,510
What!?

59
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,870
That kid's power is rising so fast!

60
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,160
How can this be? Such incredible energy!

61
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,440
I can't believe it! When that kid loses his senses and flies
off the handle, he can call up that much power!?

62
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,350
U- Unbelievable!

63
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,650
H- He may be closer to becoming
a Super Saiyajin than anyone else!

64
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,130
K- Krillin-san!

65
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
Krillin-san...

66
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,300
Krillin-san!

67
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,220
It's okay! He's managed to hang on!

68
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,260
Don't die, Krillin-san!

69
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,400
We don't have time to be worrying about him!

70
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,570
Do you think Freeza would die from just that?

71
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,890
You aren't any ordinary runt, are you?
Even I found that to be a little bit painful!

72
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,550
You did that to the wrong person.

73
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,960
Of course, like I said before, the fact
that you're going to die remains.

74
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,550
For all your effort, you've only managed to incur my wrath.

75
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,630
Damn it.

76
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,040
It looks like we were hoping for too much
after all. Now we're a laughingstock!

77
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,110
Impossible! His Ki just keeps growing stronger and stronger!

78
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,450
Who could have known he can control his battle power this much!?

79
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,390
I will take the pain I have felt, and
return it to you many times over!

80
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,370
Freeza's power just billowed up suddenly!
At this rate, everyone will be...

81
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,240
You idiot! Get out of there!

82
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,060
Oh no, don't you suffer any damage just yet.

83
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,260
The fun is just beginning, after all.

84
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,040
You're just a kid after all, aren't you?
Is that the extent of your power?

85
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Fool! You got full of yourself and dropped your guard,
didn't you? You caught all of that blast!

86
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:08,090
All right! Once again! I'll pound you with
yet another intensive shot!

87
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,170
Take this!

88
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:30,850
And you said I wasn't going to be a match for you!
You look awfully stupid now, Freeza-san.

89
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,950
Don't be in such a hurry, Vegeta.

90
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,350
Once I finish with the runt, I'll have
plenty of time to play with you.

91
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,730
Our fates are sealed...

92
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,350
So then, how would you like me to deal with you, hmm?

93
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,140
He's gone!

94
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,770
Here I am!

95
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,530
What's wrong? Can't you move?

96
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,560
This is where it ends, isn't it?

97
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,800
Die!

98
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,630
Gohan's Ki is falling rapidly!

99
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm coming! Wait there, Gohan!

100
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,900
Gohan...

101
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,410
Gohan's death draws near. But what of Piccolo? What of Goku?

102
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,010
Can those that love him do anything to save him?

103
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,010

104
