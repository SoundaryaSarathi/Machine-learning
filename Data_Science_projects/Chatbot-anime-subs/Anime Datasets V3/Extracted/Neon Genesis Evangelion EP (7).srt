00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>

<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,325
Once again, I owe you.

23
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,528
<i>You're not going to pay me</i>
<i>back anyway, are you?</i>

24
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:40,198
<i>About the materials they wanted</i>
<i>under Freedom of Information,</i>

25
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:43,034
<i>I handled it by giving them</i>
<i>some falsified data.</i>

26
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,703
<i>The government is proceeding</i>
<i>with legal action,</i>

27
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:47,772
<i>but that will be blocked</i>
<i>any day now.</i>

28
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>So, should I do something about</i>
<i>that project as well?</i>

29
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,746
No, judging by the material you
sent me, it would appear

30
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:55,914
that further intervention
is unnecessary.

31
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:57,673
<i>Then, I'll continue with the plan.</i>

32
00:01:57,673 --> 00:02:00,400
Episode: 7
A Human Work

33
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,556
Good morning.

34
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:17,924
G'morning.

35
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:29,247
This is the way to start
your morning!

36
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:30,982
Not with coffee?

37
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:37,922
A traditional Japanese breakfast
begins with rice, Miso and sake.

38
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,924
Not all Japanese breakfasts,
just Misato's.

39
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,593
What's that suppose to mean?

40
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:45,763
By the way, who was supposed
to do the cooking today?

41
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:50,635
Now I know why you're still single
at your age, Misato.

42
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,171
Well, excuse me, but are you
saying that I'm lazy?

43
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,973
And sloppy too.

44
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,475
Leave me alone!

45
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,965
I'm done.

46
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:03,014
Are you really going to come
to school today?

47
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:06,451
Of course. It's your parent-teacher
meeting after all.

48
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,319
But you're so busy with your work.

49
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,623
No problem. This is part of my
responsibilities anyway.

50
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,113
It's part of your job?

51
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,396
Hi!

52
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:22,901
Oh, thanks for coming!
Yes, he's getting ready.

53
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,904
Misato, you shouldn't go
out like that.

54
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,472
It's embarrassing.

55
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:28,962
I know.

56
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,845
Good morning, Mr. Ikari.

57
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:36,314
We're taking off now, Misato!

58
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,804
Take care!

59
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,284
Come on!

60
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,292
How ironic.

61
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:51,285
It's good that it's getting easier
for him to express himself.

62
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:00,832
Yes? He just left. Please
stand guard over him.

63
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,709
There! She came!

64
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,460
Cool! Who is she?

65
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,695
Is she Ikari's guardian?

66
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,998
What?! He's got a babe like
that for a guardian?!

67
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,022
Those guys are such dorks.

68
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:33,538
She's gorgeous, truly gorgeous!

69
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,739
Is that so?

70
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:38,276
It's amazing someone so beautiful
could be NERV's Ops Director.

71
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,641
Is that so?

72
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:41,279
<i> </i>
<i>My mom dressed up just for a counseling session...</i>

73
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,115
Thank God that Shinji's such a baby, Kensuke.
<i>My mom dressed up just for a counseling session...</i>

74
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:44,716
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!
<i>My mom dressed up just for a counseling session...</i>

75
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:45,149
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!
<i> </i>

76
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:46,985
Yeah, Shinji's no rival for us!
<i>Don't you think she's silly?</i>

77
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,622
You guys don't know what a slob she is.
<i> </i>

78
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:54,459
Man, I wish she were my girlfriend!

79
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,527
Yeah, and you'd have to put
up with a lot of trouble.

80
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:58,463
You just don't get it, do you,
Mr. Big Shot?

81
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:01,633
You just keep the Earth safe,

82
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,897
and we'll take care of Misato!

83
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,940
<i>Unit 01 has achieved the</i>
<i>required cooling level.</i>

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,008
<i>Shifting operations to Stage 2.</i>

85
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,209
Keeping the Earth safe...
<i>Shifting operations to Stage 2.</i>

86
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,243
Keeping the Earth safe...
<i> </i>

87
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,540
That's what Eva is for.
<i> </i>

88
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,881
Come to think of it,
just what is the Eva?

89
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,117
The entry plug smells
a lot like blood.

90
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:21,813
But I feel so comfortable and
relaxed here. Why?

91
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,888
Now that I think of it, I don't
know anything about Eva.

92
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,327
What's the status of Unit 00's
bio-chest components?

93
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,162
It was seriously damaged.

94
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,666
We'll have to make a new one,
even if it requires a bigger budget.

95
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,603
Will our job get any simpler
when we get Unit 02?

96
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,338
It could go just the other way.

97
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,241
Disposing of the dead Angels
costs a bundle.

98
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:46,411
Yeah, this place is ridiculously
under-financed,

99
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,613
especially since mankind's future
rests on what we do here.

100
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,115
It can't be helped.

101
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,183
"Man cannot live by Eva alone."

102
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:55,520
All those survivors need
money to live too.

103
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,155
Money!

104
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,823
So, is the Commander off
to another conference?

105
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:01,192
Yes, he's on board,
and en route now.

106
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:04,390
Thank God, a little
peace and quiet.

107
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:16,003
Excuse me, do you
mind if I sit here?

108
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,311
The revised budget for the
sample collection

109
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,113
passed quite easily, didn't it?

110
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:25,917
The Committee's main concern
is for their own survival.

111
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,052
They aren't stingy when their own
lives are at stake.

112
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:31,889
Yes, they used to think there
were no more Angels.

113
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,292
But I have more good news.

114
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,794
All of the permanent members
of the Security Council

115
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:39,664
except the U.S. have approved the
budget for Eva Unit 06.

116
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:43,000
It's just a matter of time before
the U.S. approves it as well.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,171
The Americans seem to be allergic
to unemployment.

118
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,506
And what about your country?

119
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,775
We will participate beginning with
the construction of Unit 08.

120
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:54,078
The plans for the second
installation project are still viable.

121
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:58,316
However, a pilot has not
yet been found.

122
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:01,152
The Angels have returned.

123
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:04,288
We have no choice but
to defeat them.

124
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:08,793
We don't want another
Second Impact either.

125
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:13,731
You're saying that the Second
Impact wasn't...

126
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:19,070
Yes, the history texts say it was a
disaster caused by a meteorite,

127
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,240
but sometimes the true facts
have been concealed.

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,308
Fifteen years ago in Antarctica,

129
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:28,646
we discovered the being known
as the first "Angel".

130
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,081
However, in the middle
of the investigation,

131
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,184
for unknown reasons,
the Angel exploded.

132
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,953
That is the real truth behind
the Second Impact.

133
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:38,422
Then, the things we're
doing here are to...

134
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,726
To prevent a probable Third
Impact from happening.

135
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:44,820
That is the purpose of NERV
and the Evangelions.

136
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,697
By the way, the event will occur
tomorrow as scheduled.

137
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,891
I understand.

138
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,883
Good morning.

139
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,718
Good morning.

140
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,421
I'm going to Old Tokyo
on business.

141
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,591
I'll probably be back late tonight,
so have delivery for dinner.

142
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,827
Later.

143
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,351
Okay.

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>Abandoned Area #28</i>
<i>(Former Tokyo Metropolis)</i>

146
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,546
It's hard to believe this used to be
the flourishing capital of Tokyo.

147
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:37,036
We're here.

148
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:41,719
Why are they having it
in a place like this?

149
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,522
Is the SSDF getting involved?

150
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:48,459
The Strategic Self Defense Force?
No, they're not allowed to.

151
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,393
I see, so that's why they can
do whatever they like.

152
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,038
Good afternoon, welcome
to this demonstration

153
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:01,680
of Japan Heavy Chemical
Industrial's new product.

154
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,376
<i>Reserved for the guests from NERV</i>
of Japan Heavy Chemical
Industrial's new product.

155
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,241
Thank you for attending.

156
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,318
You will be observing the offical
demonstration in the control room,

157
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,988
but we'll be taking your
questions here.

158
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:17,688
Yes!

159
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,489
Yes!
The famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

160
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,858
The famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

161
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:23,094
It is our honor to have you here.

162
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,329
May I ask a question?

163
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,265
Of course, certainly!

164
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,933
According to our earlier briefing,

165
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,968
this unit is equipped with an
internal nuclear reactor, correct?

166
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:33,738
Yes, this is one of our product's
most distinguished features.

167
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:37,942
150 days of consecutive operating
power is assured.

168
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:42,713
But from a safety perspective, isn't
incorporating a nuclear reactor

169
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:46,284
into a weapon designed for
hand-to-hand combat risky?

170
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:50,288
It's better than a weapon that
won't work for over five minutes.

171
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:53,457
But in an emergency there could
be problems with remote control.

172
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,992
Still it's more humane
than a system

173
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:58,963
that induces great mental stress,
and causes mental instability.

174
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:01,198
Cut it out. It just makes you look childish.

175
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,167
And there's still the issue
of manual control.

176
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,635
A weapon that cannot be
controlled is insane.

177
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:09,240
I believe that it is safer than an
extremely dangerous weapon

178
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,410
that can run out of control,
and go berserk.

179
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,446
It's like a hysterical woman!

180
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:16,936
In other words, completely
out of control!

181
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,019
Our pilots and technology are up
to the task of controlling it.

182
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,524
So, you're saying that science and
courage will tame that beast?

183
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,792
Are you serious?

184
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,560
Yes, of course I'm serious!

185
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,463
Because it depends on something
as vague as the human heart,

186
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:35,333
NERV has allowed the situation
to get completely out of control.

187
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,836
That's why the UN had to approve
a huge increae in your budget.

188
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:42,373
As a result, 20,000 people in
several countries are starving.

189
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:47,478
Of course, the actual cause of all
this is still under investigation.

190
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:51,315
Why don't you at least take
responsibility for your handiwork?

191
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:58,089
I envy you. It must be nice to be
protected by a supra-legal act.

192
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,657
It doesn't matter what you say.

193
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,160
The fact is that NERV has the only
weapon that can best the enemy.

194
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,129
You mean the AT field?

195
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,765
It's just matter of time now.

196
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,461
NERV's day in the sun
will not last forever.

197
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>Reserved for the guests from NERV</i>

198
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:20,277
Damn it! Idiot! Who does
he think he is?!

199
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:24,015
That S.O.B.'s just pissed at being
cut out of the profit loop!

200
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,717
That god damn son of a bitch!

201
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,252
Damn it! Damn it!

202
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,855
Cut that out. Behave yourself.

203
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,924
He's just a show-off, begging
for praise and adulation.

204
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:36,227
He's petty, not worthy of attention.

205
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,363
But how did he know about
the AT field?!

206
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,232
How could something so
classified leak out?

207
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,166
Intelligence must be
dragging its ass.

208
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:59,583
<i>We're about to start the</i>
<i>JA activation test.</i>

209
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,414
<i>Don't worry, there's no risk at all.</i>

210
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,921
<i>Make yourselves comfortable,</i>
<i>and watch through that window.</i>

211
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,193
<i>Ready to begin.</i>

212
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:10,428
<i>Start the test.</i>

213
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,929
<i>Discharge the power core.</i>

214
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,431
<i>Pressure levels nominal.</i>

215
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,433
<i>Coolant system circulation nominal.</i>

216
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,134
<i>Release the control rods.</i>

217
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,903
<i>The reactor has exceeded</i>
<i>threshold levels.</i>

218
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,571
<i>Output is nominal.</i>

219
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:21,806
Begin walk cycle.

220
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,308
Walking. Forward ahead, slow.
Forward right leg.

221
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,844
Roger. Walk, forward ahead slow.

222
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:27,936
Forward right leg.

223
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:34,985
<i>Balance is nominal.</i>

224
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,387
<i>Power core status nominal.</i>

225
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:37,321
<i>Roger.</i>

226
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,256
Now, forward left leg.

227
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,484
Keep her steady.

228
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:46,995
It walks! Now that's something
to be proud of.

229
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,601
What's wrong?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

230
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,402
What's wrong?
This is odd. The pressure inside
the reactor is increasing.

231
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,105
This is odd. The pressure inside
the reactor is increasing.

232
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,874
The temperature of the primary
coolant system is also rising!

233
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,142
Open the release valve.

234
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,543
Insert the neutron-
deceleration fluid.

235
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:00,444
No effect!

236
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:02,036
The pump output isn't increasing!

237
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,918
Shut off the power.
Emergency stop!

238
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,354
<i>Abort signal transmission confirmed.</i>

239
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,322
<i>It's not accepting it!</i>

240
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,090
<i>The radio circuit is being blocked!</i>

241
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,391
It's out of control!

242
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,860
It can't be!

243
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,660
No! Oh, God! Run away!

244
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:32,972
That robot is as badly behaved
as the guy who built it.

245
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,416
The compression valve is
operating irregularly!

246
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,018
The control rods aren't working!

247
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,420
Possibility of meltdown imminent!

248
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,789
It's unbelievable.

249
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:52,429
JA's been programmed to handle
all possible contingencies!

250
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,698
This kind of thing can't happen!

251
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:58,369
Yet, the fact is, the danger of a
meltdown is now before us!

252
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:02,873
Under the circumstances, our only
option is to wait for it to stop.

253
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,408
And what is the estimated
probability of an automatic stop?

254
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,978
0.00002%! We'd better
hope for a miracle!

255
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,447
Determined efforts are better
than a miracle!

256
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,483
Tell me how to stop that thing!

257
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,051
We've tried every possible option.

258
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:18,822
No, there's got to be a last resort,
a way to wipe everything out.

259
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,591
Give me the password.

260
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,360
The password to delete all
programming is top secret.

261
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,862
I can't authorize it.

262
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,363
I'm not allowed to tell you!

263
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,165
Then get the clearance!

264
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,598
Right now!

265
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:33,237
It's me. Let me speak to
Mr. Manda in Tokyo 2.

266
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,973
That's right, the Director
of Internal Affairs.

267
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:39,807
Well, I'll have to delegate this
to Mr. Yasugi. Ask him.

268
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,448
I can't give authorization for such
an important matter on the phone.

269
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,984
Could you submit a
written request?

270
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:50,254
So, now I need to get
Mr. Yoshizawa's permission?

271
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:53,123
What? Yes, I've already got an
approval from Mr. Witz.

272
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,226
Yes... yes, okay.

273
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,694
The evasion of responsibility...

274
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,629
A written order of clearance
will be sent.

275
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,164
That will make this an
official operation.

276
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:04,294
We can't wait for it! Once that
thing explodes, it'll be too late!

277
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:11,442
<i>Jet Alone is heading for Atsugi.</i>

278
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,810
Time is running out.

279
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,813
I'll take responsibility
for this myself.

280
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,381
Excuse me.

281
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,816
Hey, Hyuga?

282
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:23,354
I've arranged it with Atsugi. Bring
Shinji, Unit 01 and the F module.

283
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,922
Yes, this is an emergency.

284
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:27,291
This is pointless. Call this off,
Captain Katsuragi.

285
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,027
Do you have any idea as
to how to stop it?

286
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,018
By inputting a direct
command manually.

287
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,634
Are you serious?

288
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,568
Yes.

289
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:41,205
But the interior must be flooded
with radioactivity!

290
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,206
It's too risky!

291
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,436
But if I make it,
everyone will be saved.

292
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:50,347
The hatch can be opened as
soon as our signal is cut off.

293
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,747
You'll be able to enter through
the back pack.

294
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,313
"Hope".

295
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,947
That's the password to delete
the programming.

296
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,514
Thank you.

297
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,598
JA is the target.

298
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,301
There's a danger of meltdown
in five minutes.

299
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:14,772
Therefore, we cannot allow it to
get any closer to a populated area.

300
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,406
Hyuga?

301
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,106
Yes, Ma'am?

302
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:20,277
As soon as you drop off Eva,
ascend to a safe altitude.

303
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,045
Affirmative.

304
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:21,779
And Shinji...

305
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,279
Yes.
<i> </i>
And Shinji...

306
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes.
Run alongside the target,
and place me on its back.

307
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,516
Run alongside the target,
and place me on its back.

308
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:29,119
Then restrain the target
as best you can.

309
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,588
Are you going to get inside?

310
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,156
Yeah.

311
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,057
That's crazy!
Yeah.

312
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:33,724
That's crazy!
<i> </i>

313
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,827
I know, but there just
isn't any other way.

314
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,629
But it's too dangerous!

315
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,897
No problem.

316
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,766
Eva can withstand a
direct explosion.

317
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,302
Not that! I meant for you, Misato!

318
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,339
Well, I've got to give it
my best shot,

319
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,000
or else I'll regret it for
the rest of my life.

320
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:54,904
Target sighted.

321
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,573
Here we go.

322
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,690
<i>Eva approaching drop position.</i>

323
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,925
Docking release!

324
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,415
Roger!

325
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:28,445
We've caught up with it!

326
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:30,936
We've got less than four minutes.
Put me on, now!

327
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,283
Don't think! Just do it!

328
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,991
Misato!

329
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,396
Be careful.

330
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,113
Talk about hot.

331
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,948
This looks bad.

332
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,041
Stop, you bastard!

333
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,248
Misato! Hurry!

334
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:17,983
I'm here.

335
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,777
Error?

336
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:34,971
What in the hell is this?

337
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:43,417
There's no doubt! The program
must have been altered!

338
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:53,130
The power reactor is just 0.2
points short of critical!

339
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,199
The control rods won't function!

340
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,190
Guess I'll try the long shot.

341
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,854
Misato, get out of there!

342
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:20,119
Move! Move, damn you!

343
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,051
Misato!

344
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,636
0.1 to critical!

345
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,538
My God! It's going to explode!

346
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,006
Christ, it's all over.

347
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,496
Misato!

348
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:01,665
She did it!

349
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:02,599
Internal pressure decreasing!

350
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,166
All readings are nominal!
Internal pressure decreasing!

351
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:03,767
All readings are nominal!

352
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:04,995
We're saved!

353
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:09,573
Hooray, hooray! She's done it!

354
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,208
That crazy fool.

355
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,110
Misato, are you all right?!

356
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,144
<i>Misato?!</i>

357
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:18,048
Yeah, I'm okay, not in the
greatest shape though.

358
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:24,254
<i>You're alive! I'm so glad! You're</i>
<i>all right! You're really all right!</i>

359
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:28,859
<i>Oh, thank Heaven. I'm so</i>
<i>impressed! It's a miracle!</i>

360
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,260
Yeah...

361
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,127
But the miracle was set
up by someone.

362
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,601
Recovery of Unit 01 is complete.

363
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,836
No danger of radioactive
contamination.

364
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,405
Except for Captain Katsuragi's
operation,

365
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,206
everything went according to plan.

366
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,696
Good work.

367
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,608
G'morning.

368
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,797
Now, let me at that shower!

369
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,493
Where are my bra and panties?

370
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,672
Good morning, Mr. Ikari!

371
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,107
Good morning.

372
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,542
I'm taking off!

373
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,032
Take care!

374
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:25,382
Misato is just so cool!

375
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:32,914
I thought so too, but she's sloppy,
embarrassing and lazy at home.

376
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,393
She's not embarrassed
about it, but I am.

377
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,384
How nice for you.

378
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,065
What do you mean?

379
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:44,835
He really is a kid.

380
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:46,069
Yeah, he sure is.

381
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,404
How come?

382
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:51,341
She lets you see a side of her that
she won't show to anyone else.

383
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,275
That means she's your family.

384
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,700
TO BE CONTINUED...

385
