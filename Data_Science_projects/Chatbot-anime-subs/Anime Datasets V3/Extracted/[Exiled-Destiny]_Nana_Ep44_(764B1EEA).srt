1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:04,848
The moment I saw that empty room,

2
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:12,748
I felt that I had become lost in
a lonely world where only I existed.

3
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:22,058
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

4
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,928
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

5
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,778
Baby I'm standing alone

6
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:34,578
An unforgettable rainy day

7
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:37,588
Chasing after your shadow

8
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,458
And it's over, it's like sand now

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,758
I sigh every night

10
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:45,788
I scream like a child and cried

11
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:48,528
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

12
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:52,588
Please, please God, forgive my sins

13
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:55,328
I don't need to hide no more

14
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:58,268
Flowing toward the turquoise light

15
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:02,308
Just keep going on

16
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:03,908
You've got the chance now

17
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,108
You've got the power

18
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,618
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

19
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,248
I show you my life now

20
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:10,688
I show you my love now

21
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:13,918
I show you my everything yeah yeah

22
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,158
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

23
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,958
Don't ever change so be yourself

24
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,398
I'll show you my strength now

25
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:21,758
I'll show you my love now

26
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,028
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

27
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:29,058
Baby don't be afraid

28
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,708
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

29
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,398
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

30
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,178
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

31
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:41,078
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

32
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,198
What?! She moved?!

33
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:58,668
Mhm. She says she lives
a lot farther away,

34
00:01:58,668 --> 00:01:59,998
so she doesn't think she can
come by much.

35
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:02,098
She asked me to give her best
to everyone here at Jackson's.

36
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,808
Wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?

37
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,198
That's making me feel real lonely.

38
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,198
Who moved?

39
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,468
Nana. She moved to Shirogane.

40
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,638
Why Shirogane, all of a sudden?

41
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:15,148
Minami Aoyama, Hiroo, Azabu.

42
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:18,038
Each one of those properties
was spectacular as well.

43
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,678
They're all in really expensive districts!

44
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:23,918
But I thought right from the beginning
that Nana would choose Shirogane.

45
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:24,818
Why's that?

46
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,488
Because it's the place that
young wives dream about.

47
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:28,758
Young wives?

48
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:32,928
She probably wants to be
called Shiroganese.

49
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:34,688
What the?!

50
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,158
Personally, I'm a bit relieved.

51
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,768
I'm looking forward to seeing Nana
in a wedding dress.

52
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,238
Even if she's doing it for
her child's sake,

53
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,738
I can't understand how she could marry
a guy she doesn't even love.

54
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:48,108
No, if she didn't love him
she wouldn't do it.

55
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,348
But what about Nobu?!

56
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,748
She probably loves them both.

57
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,518
That's something
you can relate to, isn't it?

58
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,118
I'm home!

59
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:58,688
Huh? You're here, Shoji.

60
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,788
So you've finally run outta money
to drink at Jackson's?

61
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,318
A toast to Nana,
who's marrying a rich guy.

62
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,428
So you heard.

63
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,228
Although she probably wouldn't
want you to celebrate it.

64
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:14,298
But how rich is this guy,
who can afford a million-yen rent?

65
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,028
No, it's 700,000 yen.

66
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:21,268
She persuaded him to save some of
the rent money for the child.

67
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:23,748
Nana's starting to mature.

68
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,878
That's the strength of becoming
a mother, I guess.

69
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:27,948
But even 700,000 yen
is plenty expensive!

70
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:29,188
What is this guy?!

71
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,088
He's a musician.

72
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:35,598
Someone close to that guru again?

73
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,558
I guess. He's Yasu's friend, I hear.

74
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,098
If it's one of Yasu's friends,
there's no need to worry.

75
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:45,438
But for him to have that much income
would mean, unlike BLAST,

76
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,528
this guy's a professional musician, right?

77
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:47,998
Is he famous?

78
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,868
Naw, one would hafta be a major star
to make that much in music.

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,748
He's likely some carefree son of
a rich family.

80
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:59,248
Besides, why would a famous star
want to marry someone like Nana?

81
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,788
Also, with how excited Nana gets
when it comes to celebrities,

82
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,878
there's no way she would've kept quiet
about it if he were even a little famous.

83
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:08,288
But maybe she's forced to keep it
a secret because he's a celebrity!

84
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:09,188
Huh?

85
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:10,288
What's his name?

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,128
Takumi.

87
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,428
Takumi is so cool!

88
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:15,288
Of Trapnest?!

89
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:18,568
That's impossible!

90
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:19,568
Are you dumb?

91
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,108
Why are you following me?

92
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,608
See ya.

93
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,718
Why not?! I'll leave right away!

94
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:32,618
Just let me get a glimpse of Hachiko!

95
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:33,688
All right.

96
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:37,758
Welcome home.

97
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,248
This is really nice.
Is it a new building?

98
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,588
The rent is very reasonable
for the space, right?

99
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,418
Because you've gotta walk
a bit from the train station.

100
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:46,538
You never use the train anyway.

101
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:48,198
This is nice.
Like a hidden residence.

102
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,508
Is it your first time to this place, too?

103
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,568
'Cuz we were confined to the studio
the whole time?

104
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,808
No. I came to see this place once
when I signed the contract.

105
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:58,878
Really?

106
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:03,018
I needed to check the neighborhood
and the security system.

107
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,248
Or else I'd be worried.

108
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:05,638
Hello?

109
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,238
I'm home.

110
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,588
Ah, um, ., Welcome home!

111
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:13,348
She's tripping on her words.
She's too cute.

112
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,648
You seem to be having fun, Takumi.

113
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,718
Because we're newlyweds.

114
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,728
But you're not legally married yet.

115
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,558
Are you really serious about
getting married?

116
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,898
You're still renting the place
in Akasaka too, right?

117
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:23,998
Are you planning to live separately?

118
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,598
Shut up. I'll move outta
that place eventually.

119
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,138
Eventually?

120
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:36,648
There's an auto-lock on each floor too.
Talk about high security.

121
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:42,118
I'm seldom at home, so this is to
ensure the safety of my wife and child.

122
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,888
Especially since you have
many extreme fans.

123
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:48,158
Why are they so fixated
on chasing an illusion?

124
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,958
I have trouble understanding it.

125
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,428
It's because it's an illusion!

126
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:58,568
In reality, there is no person who
would do exactly as you'd wish.

127
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,708
But Takumi, you are getting married
to the exact type of woman

128
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,408
you have trouble understanding.

129
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,378
I have trouble understanding that.

130
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:12,678
Nana knows that reality and illusions
are two different things.

131
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:16,258
She knows that, and she still dreams
without getting discouraged.

132
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,248
That's what's so cute about her.

133
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,728
Then Hachiko and I are the same!

134
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,248
So that makes me cute, too!
Right, Takumi?

135
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:23,788
I wanna smack him.

136
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:27,068
Yes?

137
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,058
I'm home.

138
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,298
What am I gonna do?

139
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,058
I'm getting nervous.

140
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,938
Please don't stay long.

141
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,728
Don't intrude on our first night
as newlyweds.

142
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,998
But you're not newlyweds,
and it's not your first night together.

143
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,708
Welcome home!

144
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,548
Hi. Good evening.

145
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:44,548
Who is this guy?!

146
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:44,588
WHO IS THIS GUY?
Who is this guy?!

147
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:45,018
WHO IS THIS GUY?

148
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:49,088
Good evening...

149
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:49,828
NAOKI
Good evening...

150
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:50,518
NAOKI

151
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,958
Hachiko's so cute!

152
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,188
THE REAL NAOKI
Hachiko's so cute!

153
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:52,328
THE REAL NAOKI

154
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,428
THE REAL NAOKI
If you're satisfied, go home.

155
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,358
If you're satisfied, go home.

156
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,298
This place is like a castle!

157
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,368
What part?!

158
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:01,398
WHAT PART?!
What part?!

159
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:01,988
WHAT PART?!

160
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,268
You must be exhausted from
your recording.

161
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,738
How thoughtful of you.

162
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,138
If it's not inconvenient,
won't you stay for dinner?

163
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:11,028
Yes!

164
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,908
Don't bother.
He'll be leaving right away.

165
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:17,908
Then I'll have dinner ready right away.

166
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,518
I got carried away and
prepared too much,

167
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,108
so it would be a great help
if you'd eat with us.

168
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:24,888
Yes.

169
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:25,688
MORNING SICKNESS
COUNTERMEASURE

170
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,958
Wow! Thanks for the food!

171
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,198
Delicious!

172
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,198
Yeah? I'm glad.

173
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,408
You're a great cook,
just like I'd heard.

174
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,668
No wonder he'd want you
as his wife.

175
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:46,768
That's not why I decided
to marry her.

176
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:49,078
If that's what I want,
a housekeeper will do.

177
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:53,778
But, there aren't many girls
who can cook like this.

178
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,628
On top of that, it must've been
a lot of work

179
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,718
to make this place so livable
so soon after moving.

180
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:03,358
Actually, I had a professional coordinator
do the interior design before I moved in.

181
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:07,328
But I found it difficult to express
the image I had in mind,

182
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:08,988
so it ended up looking
a bit over the top.

183
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:09,928
I see.

184
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:12,768
We can gradually change things
as we like.

185
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:14,478
Speaking of which,

186
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,308
what about the furniture
you were using at your last place?

187
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:17,178
Did you throw them away?

188
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:20,608
No. I put them all in a room for now.

189
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:21,908
Your private room?

190
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:24,878
No, I plan to make that
the baby's room.

191
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,478
I can use a lot of my furniture as is.

192
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,518
I even had the wallpaper changed,
and the room looks so cute now!

193
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:31,618
I wanna see it!

194
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:32,518
Take a look!

195
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,458
So cute!

196
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,288
Isn't it?!

197
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,718
Thank you, Mama!

198
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,188
A flower pattern?!

199
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,638
There's nothing wrong with that.
It looks really cute.

200
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:43,968
Like a Princess' room.

201
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,298
What if it's a boy?

202
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,478
What'll we do?

203
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,938
I felt so sure that it's gonna be a girl.

204
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:54,138
Then I'm sure it will be a girl.

205
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,478
I don't understand how
you could be so sure.

206
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,818
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

207
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:03,678
Don't worry.
Wallpaper can be changed anytime.

208
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:07,618
And we can keep trying until
we have a girl.

209
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,158
Geez...

210
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,118
Well then...

211
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,898
SATISFIED
I guess I'll be going now.

212
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,528
Just ask at the front desk,
and they'll call you a taxi.

213
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:21,168
Yeah. Thanks for having me over.

214
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,098
And thanks for the great meal, Nana.

215
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,908
Please come again anytime, okay?

216
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:26,808
I'll come when Takumi's not around.

217
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:29,038
No way, that would be a problem!

218
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:35,048
Naoki's really funny.
I never imagined him to be so outgoing.

219
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,948
I think we could get along.
That makes me happy.

220
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:41,618
Really? He made me super exhausted.
Fill up the tub for me, will you?

221
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,158
Oh, I did that already.

222
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,168
You don't need to try
and be the perfect wife.

223
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,968
Let's take a bath together and relax.

224
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,228
I can't relax doing that.

225
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,128
Did you lose weight?

226
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,018
Mhm. About three kilos.

227
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,308
Is your morning sickness that bad?

228
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:06,788
But I've been feeling a lot better
these past two, three days,

229
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,278
perhaps because of the change
in atmosphere after moving.

230
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,788
Besides I was getting a bit chubby,
so it's perfect now.

231
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,418
I guess so.

232
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:19,028
I'm sure you'll become chubby
once the morning sickness is over.

233
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:19,728
No way!

234
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,098
I'll bet you'll become really fat.

235
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:25,268
What'll I do?!
In fact, I tend to gain weight easily!

236
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,238
My mom and older sister
are both chubby,

237
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:31,008
and my younger sister goes through
great effort to maintain her great figure.

238
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,278
How many siblings do you have?

239
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:34,338
Two!

240
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:35,548
Both girls?

241
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:36,268
Mhm!

242
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:38,208
Wow, that's kinda scary.

243
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,008
There's nothing scary about it.

244
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,448
My older sister is
as kind as a bodhisattva.

245
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:43,878
Did you talk to your parents?

246
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:49,348
Yeah. I called my mom.

247
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,858
How much did you tell her?

248
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:58,838
That I'm pregnant,
so I might get married.

249
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:04,108
What do you mean "might"?
Can't you trust me?

250
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:05,138
But!

251
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,448
Oh well.

252
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,838
And what did Mommy say?

253
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:09,518
Mommy? M-Mommy said...

254
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:10,188
MOMMY
Mommy? M-Mommy said...

255
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:11,648
Mommy? M-Mommy said...

256
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,948
Oh, really? Congratulations.
You did well.

257
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:16,978
Like that.

258
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,828
What kind of mom is that?

259
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,748
She's that kind of mom.

260
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,958
But I'll bet your Dad
is furious, isn't he?

261
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,398
Not really.

262
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,788
Right after that call, he called me.

263
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:29,798
Rather than angry,

264
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,428
he just sighed and went on about
what a foolish daughter I am.

265
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,978
He asked me
what kind of man you are,

266
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,738
so I told him that you work
in the music industry. Then...

267
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:42,538
He works at a karaoke shop?
Is it all-you-can-sing?

268
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,548
That's what he said.

269
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:49,388
So I summed it up and told him
that you write music and stuff.

270
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:50,948
Summed it up?

271
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,558
Because if they found out
it's Takumi of Trapnest,

272
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:57,048
my younger sister will get all excited
and tell all her friends!

273
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,318
I haven't even told
Jun-chan about this yet.

274
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:01,628
Jun-chan?

275
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,838
She takes care of me like a mother,
even more than my real mother.

276
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:08,408
She always lectures me,
but I feel her love for me.

277
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,768
Maybe Jun-chan's the one
who gave birth to me.

278
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,408
There's no need to be secretive about this
to the people close to you.

279
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,268
I do have permission from the agency.

280
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:20,608
We've decided to notify the media by fax
when the marriage becomes official.

281
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,858
Rather than trying to hide it,
it's better to inform them and

282
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:26,488
make a request not to make a fuss about it
because I'm marrying an ordinary girl.

283
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,598
I've kept this coming Sunday open,

284
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,088
so tell your parents that
I'll be coming to meet them.

285
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,768
I'm hoping to discuss details such
as the wedding date then.

286
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,798
We should make it soon before
your belly begins to show.

287
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:46,808
FROM: NAOKI

288

GOOD NIGHT. HEART
Good night. Heart.

301
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,258
You're disturbing my sleep!

302
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,818
You'll catch a cold.
Why don't you smoke inside?

303
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:30,488
It's all right. Just one cigarette.

304
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,558
I don't wanna be hated by the Princess
in your tummy.

305
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:38,028
It was really nice taking
a bath together.

306
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:41,528
It resolves the lack of communication
we've had.

307
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,768
Let's take a bath together again, okay?

308
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,598
You like doing it in small spaces?

309
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:49,508
You've gotta tell me
these important things.

310
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:17,228
SHIN

311
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,668
Oh, hello. Hachi?

312
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:25,768
Mhm.

313
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,338
Sorry for calling this late.

314
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,748
You hafta go to work
early tomorrow too, right?

315
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:34,648
No.

316
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:36,808
I'm not calling about anything
in particular.

317
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,818
It's just that I haven't seen you
since the fireworks,

318
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,658
and was wondering how you're doing.

319
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,098
Fireworks were fun, huh?

320
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:46,358
That was the first time
I had ever done fireworks.

321
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,898
We wrote wishes on tanabata, too,
this summer.

322
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,698
Everything was so much fun.

323
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,548
Let's light fireworks with everyone again.

324
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,768
You think they still sell them at
the convenience store?

325
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:09,418
I'm sorry, Shin.

326
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,548
What for?

327
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,118
Because I'm a traitor.

328
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,068
I can't look you guys
in the eyes anymore.

329
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:26,928
I'll always be on your side,
no matter what, Hachi.

330
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,338
Nana, where's the hair dryer?

331
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,318
I'm sorry, Jun-chan. Good night.

332
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:41,488
Found it.

333
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,788
What's wrong? Did Jun-chan lecture
you about something?

334
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:02,768
I just got a bit homesick.

335
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,028
SEPTEMBER 1020:32
HACHI

336
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,808
Don't you ever mention
that name again.

337
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:11,448
Even Nobu has a thing or two
he would rather not talk about.

338
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:17,818
So that's what's going on.

339
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,498
Because I'm a traitor.

340
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,468
I can't look you guys
in the eyes anymore.

341
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:40,908
I believe people are bound by trust.

342
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:46,618
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,018
Please give me Yasu's cell number.

344
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,888
Reira was in love with Takumi.

345
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,688
Looking back, I know it was
just petty jealousy, .,

346
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:03,328
I couldn't support her when
she needed me the most.

347
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:08,138
But couldn't you support her now, Yasu?

348
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,478
Right now my hands are full
taking care of you guys.

349
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:18,178
Shin!

350
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,578
Ren, you're here!

351
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:20,378
You...

352
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,688
I hate to say this since
I haven't seen you in a while,

353
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:26,418
but I hafta leave again
right away. Sorry.

354
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,318
Can't you at least be a little sorry?

355
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:32,198
Nana began crying all because of you.
It was a mess!

356
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:35,198
I'm sorry. I got angry, so...

357
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:36,768
That was childish of me, wasn't it?

358
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:40,068
No, actually it's Nana
who was acting childish.

359
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,538
When I see her at the studio,
I'll apologize to her.

360
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:46,708
Where are you going in the middle of
the night with your acoustic guitar?

361
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,408
Are you also a street musician?
How cool.

362
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:51,218
A street musician?

363
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,658
The lonely hero who wanders
the streets looking for love.

364
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,118
That is so cool!

365
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,458
Bye! Let's play mahjongg
again sometime!

366
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,918
He's so cute, isn't he?

367
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:09,428
And sexy too.
Don't you get horny living with him?

368
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,228
Of course not!

369
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:12,198
But you've had enough with women,
haven't you?

370
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,578
Never! I've gotta whole life
ahead of me.

371
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:37,918
To Nana. Sorry for being so selfish.

372
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:43,298
You probably will never forgive me,

373
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:49,238
but I will never forget the six months
we lived together.

374
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:55,518
It will be lonely not being able
to see you,

375
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,708
but I don't know what to do.

376
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:05,458
So I hope that your major debut comes
soon and that you'll be on TV a lot.

377
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,388
Let me see you as you continue singing.

378
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:16,388
No matter who I'm in love with,
you will always be my only hero, Nana.

379
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:21,208
There's nobody as cool as you.

380
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,978
Until now, ., and from here on.

381
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:26,578
P.S., UNTIL YOU FIND A NEW
ROOMMATE, PLEASE LET ME
CONTINUE PAYING FOR MY SHARE
OF THE APARTMENT. I WILL LOCK
THE DOOR ON MY WAY OUT. I'LL SEE
TO IT THAT REN GETS MY KEY.

383
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,988
Why are you so sad?

384
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:41,188
This is not a break-up letter,
but a passionate love letter.

385
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:46,688
You will always be my only hero, Nana.

386
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,198
Go and visit Hachiko.

387
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,538
You do wanna see her tears of joy
when she sees you, right?

388
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:57,908
Why should I hafta go see her?!
That's irrational!

389
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,908
That's what a hero does.

390
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,178
Good evening. Street Musician here.

391
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:09,558
Huh?

392
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,458
MR. STREET MUSICIAN?!
Huh?

393
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,288
MR. STREET MUSICIAN?!

394
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,678
Are you alone? Can I come in?

395
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,298
Sure.

396
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:25,828
Um, Shin... Mr. Street Musician.
I'm sorry about the other day.

397
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:28,778
I, Shinichi Okazaki, will now sing.

398
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:50,598
Hey, Hachi... No matter how much or
how often people hurt each other...

399
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:55,088
Loving someone is never a waste.

400
00:20:57,738 --> 00:21:04,468
Even now, I still cherish that
love letter you gave me then.

401
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:13,118
I can't count
how many nights

402
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:17,888
I wished tomorrow
would never come

403
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:24,658
To live as I am
without being fake

404
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:28,258
What do I need

405
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:36,398
If I don't believe in myself,
what can I believe in

406
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:41,568
The answer is
too close to see

407
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:47,818
Black tears are
falling down

408
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:54,758
I have nothing,
only sadness

409
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:59,858
I can't put it
into words

410
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:05,928
My whole body
starts to ache

411
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:11,338
I can't stand it anymore
on my own
