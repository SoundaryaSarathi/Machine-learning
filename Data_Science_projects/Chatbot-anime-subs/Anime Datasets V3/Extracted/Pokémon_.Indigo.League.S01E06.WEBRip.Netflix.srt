Um, anyway, why were the Zubat
attacking you, mister?

Ah. Never call me mister!
My name's Seymour!

I'm Seymour, the scientist!

65
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,824
See? The cave is all lit up inside.

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,119
Somebody has strung these lights
through the whole cave.

67
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,830
But the Pokémon
in this cave need the dark.

68
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,125
These lights are upsetting them
and making them confused.

69
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,546
Which is probably why the Zubat
left the cave and attacked you.

70
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,049
[Seymour] Look here. These Paras
are planting their mushrooms everywhere,

71
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,969
and the hot lights are drying up
these sandshrew.

72
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,014
-Pi.
-That's why I'm here.

74

from the troublemakers' attack
against these caves.

75

Troublemakers?
Why attack a cave?

76
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,817
I'm afraid it's because of the Moon Stone.

77
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,278
-The Moon Stone?
-Exactly.

78
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:44,284
The Moon Stone is an awesome boulder
a million years old or even older!

79
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,787
Deep in these caves, the meteor hides,

80
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,249
though no explorer has found the place
of the legendary rock from space!

81
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,127
We've studied its fragments
for many an hour

82
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,546
and discovered it increases
a Pokémon's power!

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,632
And that is why the attackers are here!

84
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,676
They've come to take the Moon Stone
or so I fear!

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,428
The Moon Stone?

86
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,597
Ever since I was a little boy,

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,683
I've believed the Pokémon
came to earth from outer space.

88
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,269
-[all] From outer space?
-Yes.

89
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,314
And where, you ask, is the spacecraft
that brought them to earth?

90
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,690
In this cave!

91
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,778
-It's the Moon Stone!
[Misty] It sure is an original theory.

92
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,532
But, don't you see? It means the
Moon Stone belongs to the Pokémon!

93
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,243
We humans must not take it from them!

-Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.

00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,326
Hmm. Sure, Seymour.
I understand.

110

-Clefairy!
[all] Huh?

111
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,914
Clefairy.

00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,042
Its time Team Rocket blasted off!

171
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,003
You may have won this round,
but we'll be back!

172
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,215
-We did it! Yeah!
-Excellent teamwork!

173
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,843
Hey, wait a second.
Aren't we forgetting something?

174
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,928
Yeah, something's missing.

175
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,972
[both]
Ah. Where's Meowth?

176
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:20,518
-Clefairy! Clefairy!
-Oh, no! Clefairy's running away!

177
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,021
Clefairy! Clefairy!

178
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,691
Clefairy, come back!

179
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,527
-Clefairy.
[Meowth] Meowth's got you now.

180
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,863
[Clefairy] Fairy!
- Clefairy!

181
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,281
Clefairy!

182
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,949
[grunts]

183
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,243
[both scream]

184
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,288
[both groan]

185
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,999
All right, give Meowth that Moon Stone.

186
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,000
Huh?

187
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,961
Meowth, I'm sure we can be
reasonable about this.

188
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,799
-No we can't.
-Not so fast, Meowth!

189
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,643
-Staryu! Swift Attack!
-Yow!

190
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,855
-Yow! Yow!
-Water Gun, Staryu!

191
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,408
[screams]

192
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,538
-Bye, Meowth, have a nice drip!
-Clefairy!

193
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,997
Staryu, return!

194
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,753
Hey! Is everybody all right?

195
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:33,174
We won't be bothered by Meowth anymore,
thanks to Misty the mighty!

196
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,178
[Ash] What's that?

197
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:41,266
This is Pokémon food
made from my own secret recipe.

198
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,519
The ingredients are specially blended
for each Pokémon.

199
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,771
Mm.

200
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,440
[trills]

201
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,775
[Ash] How's it taste?

202
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,613
I've been developing it for years.
I keep improving on the recipe.

203
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,783
-I'll make a batch for Pikachu.
-I'll try some.

204
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,787
Mm. Not bad.

205
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,581
Really? Let me taste.

206
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,542
Mm, ugh.

207
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,545
Well, you might not like it,
but the Pokémon sure do.

208
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,591
-Pikachu.
-Clefairy. Clefairy.

209
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,052
Pika? Pikachu?

210
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,056
-Clefairy.
-Pika.

211
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,060
Pikachu makes friends so easily.
I wonder what they're talking about?

212
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,062
-Pika, pi!
-Clefairy!

213
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,149
-What's up, Pikachu?
-Clefairy.

214
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,409
-Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy...
-Pikachu. Pikachu...

215
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,412
Pikachu, where on earth
are you are you taking us?

216
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,750
[Ash] It's another cave!

217
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,716
[all gasp]

218
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,971
[Seymour]
It's the core of the Moon Stone!

219
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:08,603
-This feels like a dream!
-So the Moon Stone legend is true.

220
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:13,441
-Look, Clefairy's doing something!
-Clefairy.

221
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,367
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.

222
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,370
There are so many of them!

223
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,376
[gibbering]

224
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,545
-Heh, I think its saying hello.
-Yeah!

225
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,214
Look at them!

226
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,176
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.

227
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,389
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.

228
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,725
Amazing.
These Clefairy formed their own society.

229
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
This is an incredible sight!

230
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,901
[both gibbering]

231
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,405
Hey, Pikachu! What's Clefairy been
telling you, anyway, huh?

232
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,158
[gibbering]

233
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:08,162
-You understand that?
-Of course I do. It's my Pokémon!

234
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,374
[Ash] The Clefairy
collect all of these rocks and...

235
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,417
Pika, pika.

236
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,669
...do the Macarena.

237
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,045
Pika, pika.

238
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,216
[Ash]
The Clefairy... Pick up?

239
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,094
[Seymour] A pick-up truck?
-Raising.

240
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,513
-I got it!
-Pika, pika.

241
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:30,226
-Sounds like raising?
-The Clefairy like raisins? Ugh.

242
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,439
-Ow!
-Pi, pika.

243
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,191
-What rhymes with hair?
-With hair?

244
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,528
-Hey, how about prayer?
-Pikachu.

245
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,532
-The Clefairy pray to the Moon Stone!
-Pikachu. Pikachu.

246
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,537
[Seymour] Is it because the Moon Stone
fell from the heavens?

247
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,748
[Woman]
Then maybe the legends are true.

248
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,625
Maybe the Moon Stone
really did come from space.

249
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,297
-Yeah.
-Of course! It all makes sense now!

250
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,008
-What does?
-Outer space!

251
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,846
Pokémon and the human race
will ride the Moon Stone into space!

252
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,559
First to the moon! Then to Mars!
Then together to the stars!

253
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,187
[Meowth]
Stars? That's our cue!

254
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,857
You guys don't know when to quit.

255
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,735
You keep away from the Moon Stone
or else!

256
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,154
-Pikachu.
-Clefairy!

257
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,657
-Or else?
-I think we've been threatened.

258
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,161
[Seymour] The Moon Stone belongs to
the Clefairy, not to you troublemakers!

259
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,207
-Leave this cave at once!
-What's that unusual sound?

260
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,668
-His knees are shaking!
-Hmm, sounds like a wimp!

261
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,587
-I'll show you.
-Don't, Seymour.

262
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,672
[grunting and shouting]

263
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,261
Huh? Did you have a nice trip?

264
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,181
My glasses. I can't see a thing.

265
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,683
-Oh, Seymour.
-That wasn't fair!

266
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,604
-All is fair in a Pokémon match, boy!
-Enough talk!

267
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,400
-I agree! Let's go, Pikachu.
-Pika!

268
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,528
-Onix, let's go!
-Koffing!

269
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,029
[whimpering]

270
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:12,036
[all grunting]

271
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,539
Pikachu!

272
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,084
Let's show them that size doesn't matter!
Ekans, underground.

273
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,544
Koffing, smokescreen!

274
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,462
Ekans!

275
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,965
Koffing!

276
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,384
Pikachu...

277
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,593
[coughing]

278
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,848
Smoke won't stop us!
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

279
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,393
Pidgeotto!

280
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,895
Pidgeotto, whirlwind the smoke!

281
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,113
-Huh? The Moon Stone is gone!
-Team Rocket stole it!

282
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,658
The match was just a trick
so they could sneak away with it!

283
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,621
All right, Onix!
Follow them underground!

284
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,543
[Ash]
There's still a chance to catch them!

285
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,379
[muttering indistinctly]

286
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,756
-Clefairy?
-I beg your par--

287
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,842
-Clefairy.
-Oh, thank you!

288
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,678
But why aren't you chasing after
the robbers who took your Moon Stone?

289
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,430
Clefairy?

290
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,348
The Moon Stone is sacred to you,
isn't it?

291
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,518
It's your responsibility
to take it back from those robbers.

292
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,855
-Do you understand me?
-Clefairy.

293
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,691
[all laughing]

294
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,111
-Nice guys always...
-Finish last!

295
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,114
We just went from worst to first, heh!

296
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,035
[Onix roars]

-Got them!
-Nice work, Onix! Grab them, now!

-Onix!
-Hey, look!

304

[Woman]
It's Seymour!

00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,731
[all gibbering]

306
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,317
Meowth! What's going on?

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,360
Clefairy!

<i>♪ Clefairy, Clefairy, Clefairy ♪</i>

309
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,282
-What are they doing?
-Waving their fingers.

310
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,410
This way and that way,
this way and that way.

311
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,413
I'm getting dizzy.

312
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,334
This is an attack that Clefairy use
called the Metronome?

313
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,836
Pika?

314
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,924
I've never seen the Clefairy
use the Metronome before.

315
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,261
-Who knows what'll happen!
-Clefairy!

316
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,112
-Well, it looks like Team Rocket is...
-Blasting off again!

317
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,990
-That was the Metronome?
-I give it two thumbs down.

318
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,828
[James] Me too!
[Meowth] Meowth three!

319
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,456
Wow!

320
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,713
The Moon Stone.

<i>Clefable. An advanced form of Clefairy.</i>

<i>These unique creatures are among</i>
<i>the rarest Pokémon in the world.</i>

325
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,074
The power of the Moon Stone did this.

326
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:45,666
[gibbering continues]

327
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,925
I've decided to live here
with the Clefairy.

00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,510
Huh?

329
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,805
It's been my life's dream to find
the Moon Stone.

330
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,433
Someday, I will travel to the stars
with the Clefairy.

331
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,976
Wow!

332
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,938
When you do visit outer space, I hope
you'll remember to send us a postcard.

333
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,024

[Ash]
So long, Seymour! Goodbye, Clefairy!

336
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:24,830
[Seymour] Goodbye, Ash.
Goodbye, Pikachu. And thank you all.

337
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,209
[Ash] Do you think the Clefairy
really came to earth from outer space?

338
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,961
[Woman]
It's fun to imagine they did!

339
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,807
