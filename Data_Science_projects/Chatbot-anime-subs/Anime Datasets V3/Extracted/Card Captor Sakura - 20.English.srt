1
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,027
Hey, Sakura!
You’re an early riser today, eh?

2
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,301
Because today starts a new semester.

3
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,434
I’ll get to see everyone and…

4
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:34,272
…I can go to school
with Yukito-san again.

5
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,772
What? Your face is red.
Do ya have a fever?

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,717
No. I’m alright!

7
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:41,710
Thank goodness.

8
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,216
I thought you caught a cold
from falling in the water.

9
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:45,624
Tomoyo-chan!

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,860
I’m okay, but Li-kun’s…

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,092
Ni Hao!

12
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:00,134
SHAO LAN! I missed you so much!

13
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,440
Mei-Lin!

14
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:04,003
Why’re you here?

15
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,011
But who is that girl?

16
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,645
Who knows?

17
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:12,644
Sakura-san! Lunch is ready.

18
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,975
Okay!

19
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,190
Well then, I’m off.

20
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,755
Hey! Hey!
Weren’t you going to take this too?

21
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,086
Oh, that’s right!

22
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,692
Thank you, Kero-chan.

23
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:30,760
My, oh my…

24
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:36,870
[Sakura and the transfer student
who fight with her]

25
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:43,278
You’re early.

26
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:44,546
Ahem!

27
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:45,850
Is it going to rain today?

28
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:46,913
What did you say?

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,711
Neither of you has club today, right?

30
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,012
Yeah.

31
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,717
I’m early today too,

32
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,025
so I’ll make a feast for dinner, okay?

33
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:55,894
Feast?

34
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,907
Seems like you’re having fun.

35
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,799
Is… is that so?

36
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,711
It’s because today’s
dinner’s going to be a feast.

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,381
There’s that, too.

38
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:19,944
But… because
I’m with Yukito-san, so…

39
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,314
So there’s a feast at your house
tonight, Sakura-chan?

40
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,824
Yes! Father said it’s because
he’s coming home early today.

41
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,752
Lucky!

42
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:31,229
Speaking of which,

43
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,197
Sakura, did you see yesterday’s news?

44
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,224
What?

45
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,229
The one about the karate black belt

46
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,865
that was walking the streets at night
and got beaten to a pulp.

47
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:43,469
I saw that! The story’s that
the opponent was a little girl, right?

48
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,306
I didn’t know.

49
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,835
I thought for sure the suspect was you!

50
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:48,941
‘Cause you’re a monster, and all…

51
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,812
What did you say?

52
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:05,986
Morning.
Morning.

53
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,159
Morning.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,658
Morning, Tomoyo-chan.

55
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,637
Sakura-chan, did you not catch a cold?

56
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:14,663
Nope!

57
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,041
Where’s Li-kun?

58
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,905
It seems he hasn’t come yet.

59
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:22,671
I wonder if he’s alright.

60
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,648
What do you think happened
yesterday, afterwards?

61
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,986
Shao Lan!
Why are there GIRLS here?!

62
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,885
No, this is… umm,
you know…

63
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:37,919
Shao Lan!

64
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,363
Who do you think that little girl was?

65
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,956
I dunno.

66
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,765
It’s Li-kun.

67
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:04,545
Li-kun, thank you for this yesterday.

68
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,922
Ok!

69
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,191
You don’t look well,
are you okay?

70
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,289
I’m starting Home Room.

71
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,264
From today on, it’s second semester.

72
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,566
Did you all do your
summer vacation homework?

73
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:21,930
Yes!

74
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:28,205
And now with this new semester,
it happens that
a new friend will join us.

75
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,174
Let me introduce you.

76
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,722
That person from yesterday…

77
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:42,016
Ah, you! I’ll introduce you to everyone,
so come this way.

78
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,066
And I even said, Let’s go together.

79
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,734
SHAO LAN, YOU MEANIE!

80
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:04,372
This is our transfer student
from Hong Kong, Mei Lin Li.

81
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,016
Li Mei Lin

82
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,116
It seems that she’s
Shao Lan-kun’s cousin.

83
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:10,950
Oh! She’s his cousin!

84
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:12,785
Right, Li-kun?

85
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:16,885
Shao Lan is my fiance, you know!

86
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:18,228
Don’t lay a hand on him!

87
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:23,457
Fiance?

88
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:24,526
Erm, no…

89
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,495
It’s true!

90
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,374
Eh?

91
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,680
I was so surprised.

92
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:39,847
After all it’s

93
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:42,278
“I’m his fiance! Don’t lay a hand
on him” all of a sudden.

94
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:45,581
But it seemed like Li-kun was
sorta depressed, though…

95
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:46,888
That’s true.

96
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,526
Yamazaki-kun!

97
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,627
That sure looks good.

98
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,394
Is it lunchtime for you too,
Yamazaki-kun?

99
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,662
Yeah. I thought I’d eat
in the cafeteria with Li-kun.

100
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:57,365
Shao Lan!

101
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,565
I made lunch!

102
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:02,296
Well, now! Let’s eat it together.

103
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,439
A moment, Mei Lin.

104
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,643
What? What is it?

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,374
Mei Lin!

106
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:10,238
What?

107
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,115
This is school, you know!

108
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:15,013
That’s why I put it in a lunch box.

109
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:17,117
If it was home, then I’d
pile it on a plate, right?

110
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,982
It’s not that…

111
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:21,955
Oh, you still don’t like
konyaku, Shao Lan?

112
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:23,718
It’s all right, there’s none in here.

113
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:25,061
It’s not that…

114
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,260
Don’t worry!

115
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:29,599
I was sure to make your
favorite shrimp shumai, Shao Lan.

116
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,031
You know!

117
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:32,335
Here.

118
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:34,938
Aren’t I good at cooking?

119
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,066
Yeah… well, sorta.

120
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,336
That’s not it!

121
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,687
Why in the world did
you come to Japan, Mei Lin?

122
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:46,815
Because you just won’t come home
no matter how long I wait, Shao Lan.

123
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:50,172
Because when I capture
all the Clow Cards…

124
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,920
Isn’t there some other
kid who captured them?

125
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,293
Just like it said in that fortune
telling you did in Hong Kong.

126
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:58,321
I explained it to you yesterday,
didn’t I?

127
00:06:58,563 --> 00:06:59,723
It’s that kid, isn’t it?

128
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,027
What’s happened?

129
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,137
I just got this chill…

130
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,331
And so that’s the case.

131
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,539
To capture them all,
it’ll take some time.

132
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,178
Mei Lin, you should hurry up,
go back to Hong Kong.

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,478
Okay! I’ll help you Shao Lan,

134
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,047
so you won’t lose to that kid!

135
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,109
Leave it to me!

136
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,545
If we put our strengths together,
we’re invincible!

137
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:29,858
Totally invincible!

138
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:31,357
It looks like they’re
having fun over there.

139
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,529
Tha… that’s true.

140
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:41,062
Okay! Now gather ‘round!

141
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:42,766
Yes!

142
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:45,766
Today, it’s mat exercises.

143
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,072
We’ll do cartwheel practice.

144
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,973
Oh! Don’t!

145
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,213
Sakura-chan, for you something
like a cartwheel is easy, isn’t it?

146
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:14,463
Next.

147
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:15,363
Yes.

148
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,012
Next.

149
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:21,802
Yes!

150
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,184
Amazing!

151
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,782
She’s so good!

152
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:38,791
Eh!

153
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,631
Next, Kinomoto!

154
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:43,928
It’s your turn now, Sakura-chan.

155
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:44,893
Yes!

156
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:54,711
Just as expected of Sakura-chan!

157
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,121
Both Kinomoto and Mei Lin are amazing!

158
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:09,125
Okay, let’s have you do some
free style exercises.

159
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,393
You both don’t have to
overreach yourselves,

160
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,660
so do whatever mat exercises
you can do, okay?

161
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,862
Yes!

162
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:33,746
Amazing, huh?

163
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,443
Yeah, kinda.

164
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:05,073
Why?!

165
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,324
That was scary.

166
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,933
That brat’s fiance, eh?

167
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,057
And it’s not just during P.E.

168
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,804
All day long, I was being watched.

169
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,196
Like she was glaring at me.

170
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,175
Are you sure you didn’t do
something weird to that kid, Sakura?

171
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,204
Nope.

172
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,569
It’s done!

173
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,138
Okay!

174
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,313
Today’s supposed to be a feast!

175
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,442
I’ll bring you some later,

176
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:41,615
so wait okay, Kero-chan?

177
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:47,682
Din-ner… Din-ner… Fun din-ner!

178
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:51,252
I wonder what today’s main dish is?

179
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:52,830
It’s supposed to be steak.

180
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:56,432
Yukito-san! Why?

181
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:58,199
I heard that he was alone tonight,

182
00:10:58,603 --> 00:10:59,399
so I invited him.

183
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:08,309
Itadakimasu!

184
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:15,614
Delicious!

185
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,086
Sakura-chan, your face is red.

186
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:19,621
Do you have a fever or something?

187
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:20,853
I’m okay!

188
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,658
It it’s for dinner’s sake,

189
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:26,189
even a 40 degree Celsius won’t bug her.

190
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:28,827
Huh!

191
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,503
Is this the incident you were talking about
this morning, Brother?

192
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,869
Nope, they say it happened again.

193
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,273
They had it on the news,
earlier, too.

194
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,479
At Tomoeda-cho
Park another incident

195
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,749
involving a black belt
in martial arts…

196
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:48,914
At the park?

197
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,578
Could you let me see?

198
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:56,592
They wrote it was a person
of Judo level 3rd dan, huh?

199
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:59,395
Was the suspect a girl again?

200
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:02,096
But why are people

201
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,426
doing Karate and
Judo being targeted?

202
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:08,235
It seems that no money had been taken.

203
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,433
According to the victim’s story,

204
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:13,667
it sounds like

205
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,013
they are testing their skills.

206
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,476
Touya-san, you’re a Karate student too,

207
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:19,806
so please be careful.

208
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,313
It won’t be a challenge since
I’m just without a belt level.
I’m an unworthy opponent, right?

209
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:26,319
Strange.

210
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:27,453
The girl is reported to be

211
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:30,123
in strange attire.

212
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,687
Strange attire?

213
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,221
Uh huh.

214
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:39,802
A girl in strange attire?

215
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,037
It always turns out this way, huh?

216
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:52,138
What? What?
And such a depressed face!

217
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,380
Heya! Let’s scoot and get that Card!

218
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:57,982
Kero-chan is so pumped up,
isn’t he?

219
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,216
It seems today’s dinner and
dessert were really good then…

220
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:03,657
That makes sense.

221
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,668
It is the presence of a Clow Card.

222
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,178
Yes, I feel it too.

223
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,307
Then the girl who
assaults martial artists,

224
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,480
wearing strange attire is…

225
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:28,514
…a Clow Card.

226
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:32,320
Mei Lin-chan!

227
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,089
The one they call the brat’s fiance?

228
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,756
You guys have come to look
for the Card too, then?

229
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:42,864
Then, you too…?

230
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,426
I’m going to capture it
and give it to Shao Lan.

231
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,863
The Card is Shao Lan’s!

232
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:48,932
What?

233
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,072
I won’t let you have your way!

234
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:52,465
Sakura is the ONLY Card Captor

235
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,277
I’ve approved!

236
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,108
What is this?
Your fairy godmother?

237
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:58,614
Let go!

238
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,846
Kero-chan is the guardian
beast of the Clow Cards!

239
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,946
This thing that looks like
a bath sponge is…?

240
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,187
Just let me see you say that
one more time, little wench!

241
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,725
Well, even if the guardian
beast is with you.

242
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:13,826
Shao Lan has me, so…

243
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,997
Shao Lan wins.

244
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,030
Eh?

245
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:27,639
That’s probably the girl
in strange attire

246
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,536
that they were talking
about in the news.

247
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:32,877
Oh, I don’t think she’s
so strange, though…

248
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,624
Sakura! That’s the FIGHT Card!

249
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:41,582
Eh?

250
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,192
What’s with it?

251
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,496
FIGHT is a martial arts
specialty Card.

252
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:53,902
So, it has an instinct
to challenge strong opponents.

253
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:57,134
I can’t do any martial arts!

254
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:06,913
What does that mean?

255
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:10,243
FIGHT is challenging the little wench.

256
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,122
Well, come get me!

257
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:21,422
Amazing!

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,594
You can’t even do
something this basic

259
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,269
and you’re trying to capture Clow Cards?

260
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,534
Shao Lan is going to capture
the Cards, after all.

261
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,306
You haven’t had enough yet?

262
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:51,558
Watch out!

263
00:15:59,204 --> 00:15:59,932
Shao Lan!

264
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:01,429
I told you not to come!

265
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,166
B… but…

266
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,408
Are you alright? Mei Lin-chan.

267
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,673
It’s only that my foot
slipped a little.

268
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,340
Oh, so you aren’t working with the brat.

269
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,047
What do you mean by brat?!

270
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,348
Brat and Little Wench are good enough.

271
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:15,414
What did you say?!

272
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:20,547
You had Wei use it, didn’t you?

273
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,756
Really! And I TOLD him not to tell!

274
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:27,190
Wei told me because
he was worried about you, Mei Lin!

275
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:28,896
What do you mean?

276
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,231
It seems this little wench

277
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,831
can’t figure out the
location of the Cards by herself.

278
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:36,704
Well, it seems that she doesn’t
have any magic whatsoever, y’know.

279
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,207
Is that true?

280
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,101
That’s a real oddity in the Li Family!

281
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:42,877
Leave me alone.

282
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:48,681
‘Cuz it won’t work with me,

283
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,786
so I had Wei help me.

284
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:55,290
But even Wei couldn’t
figure out the exact location,

285
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,457
and I had a hard
time finding it.

286
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:58,318
Mei Lin!

287
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:00,854
Capturing Clow Cards
is not a game!

288
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,493
There’s the possibility of danger,
like earlier.

289
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:06,360
Earlier, I just let my guard down.
That’s all.

290
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,502
That letting my guard down might
be what costs you your life!

291
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,869
Li-kun is pretty cool, huh?

292
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:16,305
Compared to me,
he’s still pretty green, though…

293
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,181
Anyway, you go home first,
and with Wei…

294
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:28,484
Mei Lin!

295
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:35,694
Shao Lan!

296
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:38,133
Shao Lan!

297
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:38,992
Li-kun!

298
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,027
Shao Lan! Shao Lan!

299
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:44,806
I’m okay.

300
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,170
Sorry… because of me…

301
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,274
Don’t cry.

302
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,786
How dare you do that to Shao Lan!

303
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,489
Don’t!

304
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,463
Are you okay?

305
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:11,696
Yeah.

306
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,726
Mei Lin-chan’s strong, huh?

307
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:17,937
But, can she win against
a Card created by Clow?

308
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:27,649
Mei Lin-chan!

309
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:33,255
Mei Lin-chan!

310
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:39,495
What’ll we do?
At this rate, Mei Lin-chan will…

311
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,459
You have to hurry up
and return it to the Card!

312
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:42,696
What should I do?

313
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,360
Well, it is FIGHT, so… 
The only way is to fight it and win.

314
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:51,872
Fight?
But I said that I can’t do martial arts.

315
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:58,205
But even so, there’s no other way
to return FIGHT to the Card
than to fight it and win!

316
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,283
But that’s…

317
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:02,843
It seems just like the time
with the POWER Card, a while ago…

318
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:07,922
Mei Lin!

319
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:09,258
Wait, Li-kun!

320
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,893
Leave it to me!

321
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,568
All power, come to this wand!

322
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:24,436
POWER!

323
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:43,491
You wait!

324
00:19:58,242 --> 00:19:59,641
Sakura! Behind you!

325
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:06,042
Don’t come here!

326
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:15,756
Now!

327
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,727
To the true form return,

328
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:24,134
CLOW CARD!

329
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:34,075
That was wonderful!

330
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,546
It’s because you talked about POWER,
Tomoyo-chan.

331
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,110
Are you okay, Mei Lin?

332
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:41,916
Shao Lan.

333
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,156
How mortifying. Mortifying! Mortifying!
Mortifying! Mor-ti-fy-ing!!

334
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:54,591
But Mei Lin-chan, it’s all because the
Card was tired because you fought it…

335
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,564
It seems like you can do
a little something after all…

336
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:01,496
But! Shao Lan is going to
capture the Clow Cards!

337
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,087
It seems that this relationship
is getting a little complicated.

338
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,782
This is another one of those
crosses that a Card Captor must bear.

339
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:15,216
Is that so?

340
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:18,015
Oh… probably.
