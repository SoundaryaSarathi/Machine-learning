<i>Dammit... l've got a bad feeling</i>
<i>about this. Hurry! Hurry!</i>

2
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,767
C- Chaozu...

3
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:52,032
Who's going to play with me next?

4
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,209
I- it had no effect at all!

5
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,446
Chaozu won't be able
to rest in peace like this!

6
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,880
Looks like his death was for nothing.

7
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,554
Chaozu!

8
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,862
Be grateful! I'm going to send you to meet him
again in the Next World soon enough!

9
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,142
Y- you'll pay for this!

10
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:34,077
You're definitely going to pay for this!

11
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:45,423
Incredible!

12
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:47,550
You can't be too careful
getting near him!

13
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,800
Tenshinhan! Get him back
for Yamucha and Chaozu!

14
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,030
Hang in there, Tenshinhan!

15
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,442
The only thing driving Tenshinhan
is his determination.

16
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,740
He's fighting on determination alone.

17
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,442
More trouble with this?
What on earth is the problem!?

18
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,732
Hey! Can't you get any closer!?

19
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,601
T- this is intense!

20
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:19,011
Out of breath already? You should
start seeing the Next World soon.

21
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,463
At this rate, Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>
will be done in, too.

22
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,798
I've got to do something!

23
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:36,134
Stop!

24
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:39,804
We've got a slight, momentary opening
on him when he moves to attack.

25
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,567
We'll watch for that moment.

26
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,416
Got that, Gohan?

27
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,084
Yes...

28
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,420
That's a good strategy.

29
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,911
I hope it goes well for you.

30
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,763
Are you sure you should be looking away?
You'll miss your chance.

31
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,134
You sure are confident.
But you won't be able to stand there

32
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,270
with that stupid look on your face
once Son Goku arrives.

33
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,469
Oh? And who is that?
Your ace-in-the-hole?

34
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,169
You just look forward to it.

35
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,145
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

36
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,071
Looks like this is
the end of the line for you.

37
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:49,869
I'll put you out of
your misery right now.

38
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:02,143
See you in hell!

39
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,759
Now! Scatter, Kuririn, Gohan!

40
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,748
Yeah!

41
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,757
You're finished! Die!

42
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:19,562
What!?

43
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:26,005
Gohan! Now! Shoot him!

44
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:32,784
Gohan!

45
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,581
Take aim!

46
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,450
I'm scared!

47
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,740
You dirty brat!

48
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,173
No!

49
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:15,358
We missed him!
Our timing was too late!

50
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:23,932
I- I'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo!

51
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:33,111
You really did a number on me.
You've shortened your lives even further.

52
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,782
Fine! I've decided to change the order
in which I'm going to kill you.

53
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,477
Brace yourselves!

54
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:46,391
What the matter, Kami-<i>sama</i>?

55
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,894
It looks like my life
will only last a little longer.

56
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:53,731
Death... death is close at hand.

57
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:57,735
Which means... don't tell me!

58
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:00,071
Piccolo is going to be killed.

59
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:02,471
And so will everyone else.

60
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,744
W- what about Goku?

61
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:09,747
I still cannot sense his presence.

62
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:13,615
Goku, hurry! Hurry, Goku!

63
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,762
That was some awesome speed <i>oni</i>!

64
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:27,458
Hang in there <i>oni</i>!

65
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,700
<i>Guys, sit tight!</i>

66
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:06,266
C- Chaozu...

67
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:12,143
You guys aren't too bright
to be making me angry.

68
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll get you two together!

69
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,742
What do we do?

70
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,251
That brat!

71
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,828
Well now, which one will
I amuse myself with first?

72
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:36,501
I'll leave the Namekian there alive,
but barely breathing.

73
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:41,506
We have to find out more
about the Dragon Balls from you.

74
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,741
You're lucky, Piccolo.

75
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,111
They think that you're the only one
who knows about the Dragon Balls.

76
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:51,343
It's all the same. They're planning
to kill us all, in any case.

77
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,819
All right, we go on the offensive first!
We're going to attack him!

78
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,655
Crafty...

79
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:31,986
Here goes!

80
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,696
Uncle!

81
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,471
Uncle...

82
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:25,966
We don't need any cowards like you.
Go on home to bed, right now!

83
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,817
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>! Are you dead?

84
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,097
Piccolo, now what?
Is there anything we can do?

85
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,291
No.

86
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,770
I didn't think he was going
to be this big a monster.

87
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,139
He goes far beyond
the Saiyan that came earlier.

88
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:01,612
It's too late for regrets
to do any good now!

89
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,443
Here I come!

90
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:32,006
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

91
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:35,813
C- Chaozu...

92
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,816
Ten-<i>san</i>...

93
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,485
Chaozu!

94
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:44,977
Ten-<i>san</i>, I'm sorry.
I didn't do any good.

95
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:49,817
Chaozu...

96
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,860
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>...

97
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,573
Ten-<i>san</i>, I'm sorry...

98
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,143
Chaozu!

99
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:04,769
Chaozu, I will avenge you!
And then I'll be coming.

100
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,567
I won't let you be lonesome
all by yourself!

101
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:24,649
This... this will be my final...

102
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,292
...<i>Kikoho!!</i>

103
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:48,708
Did he get him!?

104
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:11,435
You gave me a start...

105
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,105
It didn't work at all against him!

106
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:16,403
Don't tell me he's immortal!

107
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:22,636
N- no!

108
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,862
Miserable fool!
He could have just lain there,

109
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:40,131
but he instead used up his power
and died for nothing.

110
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,801
I- it can't be!
Not Tenshinhan too!

111
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:49,205
This is awful. It's a nightmare.
How can everyone be dying, one after another?

112
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,746
Goku! Get here soon!

113
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,705
Goku! Goku!

114
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,256
Please! Goku!

115
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,848
Goku?

116
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,929
They've been saying that for a while.

117
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,123
Hang on...

118
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:19,770
Another one has been taken care of!
Your turn comes next!

119
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,972
Let's go down on the ground and fight.

120
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,600
He's far more used
to mid-air fighting than us.

121
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,781
It'll all end up the same,
no matter where it happens.

122
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,681
Writhe! Writhe!

123
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,787
Here goes!

124
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,051
--H- he's coming!
--Father!

125
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,558
Wait, Nappa!

126
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:49,066
W- what is it?
Why don't you let me get them?

127
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:52,736
Don't be hasty. There's
something I want to ask them.

128
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:56,073
This Son Goku person you're
talking about is Kakarrot, isn't it?

129
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:58,541
That's right. What of it?

130
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,749
To think that you are
falling back on Kakarrot...

131
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:09,153
He couldn't even stand against Raditz.

132
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,422
What good will it do you
when he gets here?

133
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:15,759
He won't be the same as he was back then!
He's sure to be much, much stronger!

134
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,990
Don't you look down
your noses at Son Goku!

135
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:25,035
But for all that, he's not here, is he!?

136
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,438
Are you sure he hasn't
gotten scared and run away!?

137
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:31,442
H- he'll be here!
Father will surely be here!

138
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,777
He's going to take care of you guys!

139
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:36,780
That reliance of yours is something else.

140
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,117
Interesting. We're going
to wait until he gets here.

141
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:44,388
Ah, that's lame! Let's put
these guys away right now!

142
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,523
However, only for three hours.

143
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,514
We won't wait any longer than that.

144
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,423
That's absurd! I'm going
to play with them right now!

145
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,856
Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said!?

146
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:02,740
S- sorry. I got carried away.

147
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,234
That's how it's going to be. Your lives
have been extended somewhat. Be grateful.

148
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:20,118
Be reasonable. This is his
first actual fight, after all.

149
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:25,296
I'm the pathetic one
for expecting anything from you.

150
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,957
Get out of here, you coward!

151
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:34,171
<i>Be that as it may, the way</i>
<i>that huge guy just got timid</i>-

152
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:39,510
<i>does that mean that Vegeta runt over there</i>
<i>is even more ridiculously strong?</i>

153
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,375
<i>How can that be?</i>

154
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:49,787
I'm just itching to do something here!
Let's get them, right now!

155
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:54,858
Just wait. Three more hours.
Wait three more hours,

156
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:57,383
and you'll be able to watch
a magnificent, hellish show.

157
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,067
<i>Vegeta's scheme is appalling.</i>

158
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,969
<i>What exactly will this</i>
<i>hellish show in three hours be?</i>

159
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:11,975
<i>ls he saying that the extinction</i>
<i>of earth will happen in three hours?</i>

160
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:16,139
<i>Will Goku arrive in time?</i>
