1
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,681
There we go...

2
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,241
Make sure you listen to your uncle.

3
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,401
Yeah.

4
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:01,361
Do you have your handkerchief?

5
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,281
Your ticket?

6
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,401
A nice pair of shoes?

7
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,801
Wait, don't tell me that's everything?

8
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:06,721
It's fine.

9
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,081
I made sure I packed
the black ones.

10
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,681
Make sure you don't forget your luggage
on the bullet train, okay?

11
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,841
Don't zone out and miss your stop.

12
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,321
Yeah, I got it!

13
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,281
Jeez.

14
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,161
I've been going there every year,
so I'll be all right.

15
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,001
Hey, put on a hat.

16
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,241
You'll get heat stroke.

17
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:23,721
It's alright!

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,081
I'm fine.

19
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:28,681
See you!

20
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:59,241
<i>The first time I met him</i>

21
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,601
<i>was when I was six.</i>

22
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:12,881
<b>The Light of a Firefly Forest</b>

23
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,441
<i>On a hot summer day,</i>

24
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:19,281
<i>I got lost in the forest of
the mountain god,</i>

25
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,001
<i>which was said to be
where spirits lived.</i>

26
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,561
<i>After running around
searching for an exit</i>

27
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,641
<i>I became so tired
I couldn't move.</i>

28
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:35,161
<i>When I started crying
from fear and loneliness,</i>

29
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,201
<i>he appeared before me.</i>

30
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:41,681
Hey!

31
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:42,841
Shorty!

32
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,561
Why are you crying?

33
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,721
It's a person!

34
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,401
I'm saved!

35
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,201
S-Sorry.

36
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:31,241
You're a human child, right?

37
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:35,881
If a human touches me,
I'll disappear.

38
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,441
If a human...?

39
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,041
You're not a human?

40
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,881
I'm...

41
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,201
something that lives in this forest.

42
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:47,961
What?

43
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,841
Then...

44
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,601
you're one of the spirits?

45
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:53,641
But...

46
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,441
what do you mean by disappear?

47
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:24,481
Y-You're really not human after all...

48
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:31,481
N-No human would hit
a child like that!

49
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:37,161
To disappear means
to be obliterated.

50
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:42,841
That's the spell that the mountain god
placed upon me.

51
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,441
If I get touched by a human,

52
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:49,281
that's the end.

53
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,081
I-I'm sorry.

54
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,681
Here, shorty.

55
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,921
Grab the other end.

56
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:01,361
You're lost, aren't you?

57
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,481
I'll lead you out of the forest.

58
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:08,041
Thank you!

59
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,081
Didn't I just tell you?

60
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,121
Sorry, I just...

61
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,441
It's just like going on a date!

62
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,001
Not a very romantic one...

63
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,041
You...

64
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,001
aren't afraid.

65
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:49,641
Of what?

66
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,681
Never mind.

67
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:58,401
If you go straight,
you'll hit the mountain path.

68
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,441
Bye.

69
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,281
Are you always going
to be here?

70
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,121
If I come back here,
can we meet again?

71
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,881
This is the forest where
the mountain god and spirits live.

72
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,001
Set foot within, and you'll lose
your way and be lost forever.

73
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:17,961
You shouldn't come here.

74
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,121
That's what the villagers say, right?

75
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:27,681
I'm Takegawa Hotaru.

76
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,121
You?

77
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,281
Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow
with a thank-you present!

78
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:53,521
Bye!

79
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,881
It's Gin.

80
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:14,641
Hotaru!

81
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,121
Ah, Uncle!

82
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,041
Hotaru, you idiot!

83
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,121
If you go into the forest on
your own and get hurt,

84
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,881
what are you gonna do?

85
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,681
Uncle.

86
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:39,401
Huh?

87
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:43,121
Is it true that there are
spirits living in that forest?

88
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,681
Oh, the mountain god's forest...

89
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,961
Who knows.

90
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,801
That's what they say.

91
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,441
When I was little,
I wanted to meet the spirits,

92
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,841
so my friends and I often
went into the forest.

93
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,481
In the end, I never met any,

94
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,761
but I had the feeling
I'd occasionally spot something

95
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:05,361
from the corner of my eye.

96
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,521
On summer nights,

97
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,441
you could hear the sounds of
the river coming from the forest.

98
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,561
And now that I think about it,

99
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,681
Iwa said she and
her friends went and had fun

100
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,041
at a summer festival
in the forest.

101
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,841
But there's no way the villagers
would've held a festival in the forest.

102
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,961
So then, whose festival
could it have been?

103
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,841
It started this crazy story that

104
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,521
they must've snuck into
a festival for the spirits.

105
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:38,241
Man, that takes me back!

106
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,521
We were so stupid back
when we were kids.

107
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:15,081
<i>This is the forest where
the mountain god and spirits live.</i>

108
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:19,121
<i>Set foot within,
and you'll lose your way and be lost forever.</i>

109
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,601
You came.

110
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,361
I didn't think you'd really come back.

111
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,241
You...

112
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,601
You waited for me!

113
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,481
You just don't learn, do you?

114
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,241
I was so happy, I just...

115
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,401
Sorry.

116
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:08,801
It's a bit hot here.

117
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,121
Shall we go somewhere cooler?

118
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,121
What?

119
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,201
Don't worry.

120
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,121
I'll see you out of here again.

121
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:12,521
Gin.

122
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:16,521
Is that a human child?

123
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,281
Can I eat it?

124
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:22,961
No.

125
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:24,761
She's my friend.

126
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,601
Is that so?

127
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:28,641
Human child.

128
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:32,041
Please don't touch Gin's skin.

129
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:38,281
If you do, I'll eat you!

130
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:44,121
Oh!

131
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:45,521
Is that a fox?

132
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,561
He's another one of the spirits.

133
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,481
He transforms to scare people,
but he's all bark and no bite.

134
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,001
Amazing!

135
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,041
This is the first time
I've seen a real spirit!

136
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,481
So they really do exist!

137
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:06,121
Amazing!
So what did you think I was?

138
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,281
So what did you think I was?

139
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,281
So amazing!
So what did you think I was?

140
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:07,521
So what did you think I was?

141
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,281
Incredibly amazing!
So what did you think I was?

142
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:15,561
Gin, are you
a No-Face or something?

143
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,881
Why do you wear a mask?

144
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,801
No particular reason.

145
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:22,881
Never mind me.

146
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,841
Tell me about yourself.

147
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:27,841
Are you curious?

148
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,841
That's why I waited for you.

149
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:43,721
<i>The next day and the day after that,
I went back to the forest.</i>

150
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:50,121
<i>Those summer days,
I ran and played all around the mountain.</i>

151
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,441
Over here, over here!

152
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,521
It's better over there.

153
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,121
There.

154
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,361
Thank you!

155
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,201
<i>Even though it was silly,</i>

156
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:18,121
<i>it was so much fun.</i>

157
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,161
Did Gin fall asleep?

158
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,321
<i>It's fine if I touch his mask, right?</i>

159
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,041
Ah, sorry!

160
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,041
Ouch!

161
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,681
Attacking someone
while they're asleep...

162
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,161
You sure are a scary little lady.

163
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,521
I'm sorry, but

164
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:27,321
you were pretending to sleep,
weren't you?

165
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,121
I looked normal, didn't I?

166
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,601
Why are you wearing that mask?

167
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,401
If I don't wear this mask,

168
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,801
I don't look like a spirit, do I?

169
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,881
You're weird.

170
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:03,681
Um, Gin.

171
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,281
I won't be able

172
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,001
to come here tomorrow.

173
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:12,921
I told you about it before, right?

174
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,561
That I'm just staying at
my uncle's place for the summer?

175
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,801
So I have to go home tomorrow.

176
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,841
Will you be able to
come again next year?

177
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,081
Yeah!

178
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,481
<i>This is how summer</i>

179
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>became something
I looked forward to.</i>

180
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:57,481
<i>Gin waited for
our promised summer.</i>

181
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:00,841
It's cold!

182
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,241
You're weird.

183
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,561
Of course the water is cold.

184
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:20,081
Gin!

185
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,161
Gin!

186
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,801
It's dangerous, Gin.

187
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,601
That's a human child.

188
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:31,001
If she touches you,
you'll disappear.

189
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,001
Thank you.

190
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,001
I'm fine.

191
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:45,121
Please don't touch him,
human child.

192
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,401
Yes.

193
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:57,761
Gin.

194
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,201
Be careful.

195
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:08,281
<i>The spirits can touch him, right?</i>

196
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,481
<i>Two summers passed.</i>

197
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,681
<i>Then three.</i>

198
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:16,161
Hotaru!

199
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:19,321
Where are you?

200
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:23,001
Hotaru.

201
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:24,601
Hota-

202
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,681
What're you doing?

203
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:37,001
I wanted to see
your startled face, but...

204
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,241
At least when I'm around,

205
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,161
can you take off your mask
every once in a while?

206
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,241
That's fine,

207
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,481
but is there a reason?

208
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,321
Not really, but-

209
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,481
Watch out, Hota-

210
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,361
That was close.

211
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,361
Yeah...

212
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,961
I'm sorry, Hotaru.

213
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:20,801
Are you okay?

214
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,601
Thank goodness.

215
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:29,601
Hey, Gin.

216
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:39,241
No matter what,
don't ever touch me, okay?

217
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:45,641
Okay?

218
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,161
No matter what!

219
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,041
<i>The next summer and
the summer after that</i>

220
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,321
<i>I visited the forest.</i>

221
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,361
I'm leaving!

222
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,001
Gin!

223
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,281
I'm here again this year.

224
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:30,921
Ta-da!

225
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,561
I've become a fifth grader.

226
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:37,241
Somehow,

227
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:39,641
you're starting to
look like a woman.

228
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,361
I am a woman.

229
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,401
Shall we go?

230
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,361
Yeah.

231
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,081
<i>Huh?</i>

232
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,601
<i>This is...</i>

233
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,441
Oh.

234
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:58,881
Huh?

235
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:00,281
Nothing.

236
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:02,721
Even though
I'm in middle school now,

237
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:06,161
a lot of my elementary school friends
are in the same classes,

238
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,841
so it doesn't really feel like
anything changed.

239
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:11,601
<i>Our ages are gradually getting closer.</i>

240
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,681
<i>Somehow,</i>

241
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:23,641
<i>Gin ages much more
slowly than humans.</i>

242
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:31,201
Like this?

243
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,041
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,481
When I start running, let go, okay?

245
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:39,161
Here I go!

246
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:19,041
<i>As the years go by,
my appearance changes,</i>

247
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:24,281
<i>but Gin is almost
the same as the day we met.</i>

248
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:06,441
<i>Someday I'll be older
than Gin, won't I?</i>

249
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:38,041
Oh, Hotaru.

250
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,681
I cut some watermelon.

251
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:40,121
Let's eat.

252
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:41,161
Okay.

253
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:42,921
Yay!

254
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,401
Where's Mom?

255
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,521
Out shopping with your aunt.

256
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,481
They went to buy gifts for
friends in Yokohama.

257
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,161
What time are you taking
the bullet train tomorrow?

258
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,561
I don't know,

259
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,121
but they said I'll still be here
until the afternoon.

260
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,361
Is that so?

261
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:12,001
This summer's weather was good,
so the watermelons are sweet.

262
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:17,441
If it continues like this,
then winter will be freezing.

263
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,761
Is it like that?

264
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,721
It's like that.

265
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:29,001
Since this area's located between
mountains and the ocean's far away,

266
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,921
the temperature difference between
summer and winter is huge.

267
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,801
The cold of a winter that follows
an especially hot summer

268
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:40,281
could probably freeze
the mountain god himself.

269
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:48,961
Um, Uncle...

270
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:53,801
A scarf?

271
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:55,041
Yep!

272
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,081
Please use it in the winter, okay?

273
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:00,241
Bye!

274
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:03,681
Okay.

275
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,801
See you next year!

276
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,801
Takegawa?

277
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,761
Shouldn't you be heading
to your next class soon?

278
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,081
Ah, you're right!

279
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:31,681
Everyone left already.

280
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:33,241
I'll see you later.

281
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:34,001
Okay!

282
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,961
Thanks.

283
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:57,881
Thank you for the food.

284
00:24:57,881 --> 00:24:58,441
What?

285
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,201
You're done?

286
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,681
Ah, you probably ate before dinner,
didn't you?

287
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,441
If you snack,
you'll gain weight.

288
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,041
I didn't eat anything!

289
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:07,641
Jeez.

290
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:08,921
I'm gonna take a bath!

291
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,001
Takegawa.

292
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,161
Ta-ke-ga-wa.

293
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:46,321
Oh, good morning.

294
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:47,561
Good morning.

295
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,601
There, near your feet.

296
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:50,561
It's frozen.

297
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:56,681
You'll slip.

298
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,441
Be careful.

299
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:02,841
Thank you.

300
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,161
It's cold today.

301
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:17,841
Haven't you been
a little out of it lately?

302
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:21,041
Actually, you've always
been that way, but...

303
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,881
<i>I want to</i>

304
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,161
<i>see Gin.</i>

305
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:53,881
<i>I want to</i>

306
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,361
<i>touch Gin.</i>

307
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,601
Is that your new uniform?

308
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,761
Yeah.

309
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,041
Time really flies, doesn't it?

310
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,481
You're already in high school, huh.

311
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:44,481
Yup.

312
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,641
You don't come running
at me anymore these days.

313
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,881
I learned my lesson
after all those beatings.

314
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:09,921
I'm looking forward to it.

315
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:15,641
In three years, when I graduate,
I plan on looking for a job here.

316
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,761
Then I can be with you more.

317
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,081
In autumn,

318
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,001
winter,

319
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,081
spring...

320
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,161
Always.

321
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,681
Right?

322
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,481
Hotaru.

323
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,921
Let me tell you about myself.

324
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,441
I'm not a spirit.

325
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:46,281
But,

326
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,001
I'm no longer human.

327
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:52,201
It seems like I was once a human,

328
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,801
but when I was a baby,

329
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,721
I was abandoned in this forest.

330
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:01,841
I'd only just been abandoned,
so I cried helplessly

331
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:06,441
as if to call back the parents
who left me.

332
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,721
They say I didn't stop crying
for a long time.

333
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:22,001
I should've died then,

334
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:26,761
but the mountain god appeared and cast a
spell that allowed me to continue living.

335
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:32,321
So that I never move on.

336
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,761
I'm like a ghost.

337
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:41,321
Hotaru.

338
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,161
It's okay if you forget about me.

339
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,121
A body that's maintained
by magic is very weak.

340
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:54,401
If it touches a real human body,

341
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,761
the spell will break and
the body will disappear.

342
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,721
It's such a fragile thing.

343
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,721
How long can you-

344
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:01,721
Something that disappears
when touched...

345
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,001
It's just like snow, isn't it?

346
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,761
Gin,

347
00:30:07,881 --> 00:30:11,241
I thought of you during winter.

348
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,121
Even during autumn

349
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:15,201
and spring.

350
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:17,361
Gin,

351
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,521
don't forget about me.

352
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,201
Don't forget.

353
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,081
Time might separate us some day.

354
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:31,521
But,

355
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,561
even still,

356
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:35,561
until then,

357
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,841
let's stay together.

358
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,561
Spirit festival?

359
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:47,881
No, a summer festival
held by the spirits.

360
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,561
There's not much
of a difference.

361
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:51,801
The nuance is completely different!

362
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,241
Nuance?

363
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,761
When you were little,

364
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:58,081
I thought you might get scared,
so I didn't invite you.

365
00:30:58,801 --> 00:30:59,521
But tonight,

366
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,081
can you sneak out
of your house?

367
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,881
I've wanted to go with you
for a long time.

368
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:08,961
I-I want to go!

369
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,761
Meet me at eight at
our usual place.

370
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:16,881
But a festival filled with spirits sounds
a little unnerving...

371
00:31:17,281 --> 00:31:18,921
On top of that, it's at night.

372
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:20,761
Don't worry.

373
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,361
On the outside, it's not very different
from a human festival.

374
00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:26,441
It's supposed to mimic human festivals,
after all.

375
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,481
And I'll protect you, Hotaru.

376
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:35,081
When you say things that,
it makes me want to glomp you.

377
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,001
Do it.

378
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,321
Seriously.

379
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:56,161
Wait!

380
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,361
Wait!

381
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,041
It's true.

382
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,401
It's just like a human festival.

383
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:23,761
Are they all disguised as humans?

384
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:24,761
That's right.

385
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,921
Impressive, isn't it?

386
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:29,521
I've heard that sometimes
even humans unknowingly mix in.

387
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,921
Like Iwa and her friends, huh?

388
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:33,721
Who?

389
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:38,721
Hotaru.

390
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,921
Tie this around your wrist.

391
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,521
You'll get lost.

392
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,441
It's just like going on a date!

393
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:53,041
This is a date.

394
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:56,601
Shall we go?

395
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:57,881
Yeah.

396
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,241
Here you go.

397
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:47,441
Weird.

398
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,841
Ew, a couple!

399
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,241
Hey!

400
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:15,641
Look!

401
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,241
That kid has a tail!

402
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,441
I-I'm sorry!

403
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:56,881
Wow, that was so weird!

404
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:59,201
Everyone went all out with
their disguises, didn't they?

405
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:00,801
It was like a mimicking competition!

406
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,481
Is it like this every year?

407
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:07,361
Yeah, every time summer
comes around...

408
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:10,441
Hotaru,

409
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:14,601
I can no longer wait for
summer to come around.

410
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:21,881
When I'm away from you, even though I can't
be around crowds, I want to go see you.

411
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:47,721
That mask...

412
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:49,441
Have it.

413
00:35:56,121 --> 00:36:02,681
<i>He probably won't come to
that place next summer.</i>

414
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:08,401
<i>This is definitely our last...</i>

415
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,081
Wait!

416
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:11,921
Watch out!

417
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,681
Are you okay?

418
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:16,601
Yeah.

419
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,641
Thank you!

420
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,761
Be careful, okay?

421
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,321
Gin?

422
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,481
Was that boy a human?

423
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:42,241
Gin!

424
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,681
Come here, Hotaru!

425
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:47,121
I can finally touch you.

426
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,041
I love you.

427
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:30,481
Yeah.

428
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:32,961
I love you, too.

429
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,641
<i>Deep green.</i>

430
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,681
<i>This is the mountain god's forest.</i>

431
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:05,201
Hotaru.

432
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,881
Thank you.

433
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:11,081
We wanted to be with
Gin forever, but...

434
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:16,321
Gin wanted to touch a human.

435
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,761
He finally got to be hugged
by a human.

436
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,921
<i>I probably won't be able to</i>

437
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,841
<i>look forward to summer
for a long time.</i>

438
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,001
<i>My chest will hurt.</i>

439
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:33,281
<i>My tears will be overflowing.</i>

440
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,161
<i>But this warmth in
my hands and</i>

441
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:42,841
<i>these summer memories
will live on in my heart.</i>

442
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,441
<i>So, let's go.</i>

443
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:58,521
