<i>[Episode 33]</i>

3
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:13,318
The one before him yelled out, "Oh no!"

4
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,079
If you'd like to know what happens next,
come listen again next time.

5
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,519
Good story...

6
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,199
- Farewell.
- Wonderful!

7
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,558
Farewell, everyone.

8
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,558
Where's A-Li?

9
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,799
Where's A-Li?

10
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,278
Why would he suddenly be in a brothel?

11
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,799
Mister, do you know where
the brothel is in this town?

12
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:04,318
It is in that building.

13
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,718
Thank you.

14
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:14,359
Such a proper-looking gentleman turns out
to actually be a lecherous devil.

15
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:19,038
How desperate and bitter this world is!

16
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:39,199
The tale told by the storyteller
was quite good.

17
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,799
You seemed quite interested
in the beginning.

18
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,558
So how come you ended up
following them into that building?

19
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:53,598
There was a fat man who tried to kiss
a young lady in public on the street.

20
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,519
The lady wouldn't let
the fat man kiss her.

21
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,919
The fat man was angry
that he couldn't kiss her

22
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,639
and called a few of his men
to surround the lady.

23
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,338
I rushed downstairs to save her
but they were already gone.

24
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,878
An older man told me

25
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,799
she went into a "flower building."
(A brothel.)

26
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,559
I searched all over the building
but didn't see any flowers.

27
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,391
It's just a name used in
the Mortal Realm.

28
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,199
No need to be so particular.

29
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,199
I couldn't find the fat man.

30
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,918
I couldn't find him anywhere,
so I went inside a room.

31
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,798
Before I could get a good look,
you showed up.

32
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,278
This is a secret between you and me.

33
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,319
Don't tell your father, all right?

34
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,119
I understand.

35
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:58,738
By the time you finish your cup of tea

36
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,798
I'll be back to discuss this
with you in detail.

37
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,278
Farewell, Your Highness.

38
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:26,947
Your Highness.

39
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:33,266
I heard His Highness has returned?

40
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,786
Yes, His Highness did, but he left again.

41
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,507
Left again?

42
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:41,146
The Aunt of Qing Qiu is
sightseeing in the Mortal Realm

43
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:43,307
so His Highness has been
keeping her company.

44
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:46,507
Sightseeing in the Mortal Realm realm?

45
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:51,387
Then won't His Highness miss
the Heavenly Lord's birthday banquet?

46
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:55,346
Do not worry, Your Highness. My Lord
said he will be attending the feast.

47
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,627
That's good.

48
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,706
I was afraid His Highness would
miss the Heavenly Lord's birthday feast

49
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:05,867
by staying too long in Qing Qiu.

50
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:10,987
Since His Highness will be returning,
then I will not worry.

51
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:14,706
Rest assured, Your Highness. My Lord will
be at the Grand Hall in a short while.

52
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,427
Very well. I understand.

53
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:49,387
Mister, you are truly a fine-looking man.
I very much admire you.

54
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,346
You are too kind.

55
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:54,346
Your hand is fair and delicate as well!

56
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,987
I have fallen in love
with you at first sight.

57
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,466
Would you--

58
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,906
That hurts!

59
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,666
You seem be having a merry time
taking liberties with my wife.

60
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,086
You're back.

61
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:12,307
You are a man of talent to have
managed to annoy my father.

62
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,346
Goodbye now. Take care!

63
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,026
How dare you? Do you know who I am?

64
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:26,026
- Where did you send him off to?
- I don't know.

65
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:32,026
Even if you hadn't shown up,
I was already thinking of doing that.

66
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,906
Why didn't you try to avoid him
when he was taking advantage of you?

67
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:37,466
He merely touched me once or twice.

68
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:25,627
You were merely kissed once or twice.

69
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,787
Why not buy a lantern, Misters?

70
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,267
Buy a lantern.

71
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:50,866
Misters, take a look.

72
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:53,626
Mortals buy lanterns
to pray to deities for blessings.

73
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,386
To whom are we going to pray?

74
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,947
It's just about making a memory.

75
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:01,067
Do you really believe releasing a lantern
can make everything in life go well?

76
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,172
Come.

77
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:10,706
Since you are men, it should be no issue
for the two of you to share a room.

78
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,865
There are only three inns
in our small town.

79
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,986
The other two
have been full since yesterday.

80
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:19,907
A guest just left and that's how
this single vacancy came to be.

81
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,907
So... why don't you share
the room for the night?

82
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,547
Please bring up some hot water.

83
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:24,866
All right.

84
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:34,187
- And cook a few dishes as well.
- All right.

85
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,866
If you don't want to eat,
why don't you wash up and go to bed?

86
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:51,386
<i>I've always known about your temper</i>

87
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:55,067
<i>yet I failed to anticipate that you would
be so determined to sever all ties.</i>

88
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,187
<i>You have forgotten all about the past.</i>

89
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,706
<i>I hope that you will remember</i>

90
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:08,027
<i>and at the same time,
I hope that you will never remember.</i>

91
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:30,986
My Lord.

92
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:35,826
No need to give chase.

93
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,427
I have failed in my duty.
Please forgive me, My Lord.

94
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,106
It doesn't matter.

95
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,147
These people dared to ambush Celestials.

96
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:48,106
Does Your Highness
not intend to pursue this?

97
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,706
They are not real people.

98
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,547
They are puppets
created by demonic magic.

99
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:53,787
They were specially made
for assassination.

100
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:56,386
Even if we caught up to them,
they would merely turn to ash.

101
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,027
We would gain no answers.

102
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:01,027
Demonic magic? Who wants to
stand against the Celestial Tribe?

103
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,346
High Immortal Die Feng mentioned it.

104
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:09,386
Deities departing the Eastern Sea
were all attacked, one after another.

105
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,586
I am about to investigate this matter.

106
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,626
Your Highness, the Heavenly Lord's
birthday feast is about to start.

107
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:18,267
I know. You can go back now.

108
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,706
Yes.

109
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,787
Mother, this porridge is very thick.

110
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:45,106
Be good.

111
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,386
The food here is hard to stomach.

112
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:53,106
I borrowed their kitchen
to make this half pot of porridge.

113
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:59,427
No wonder it tastes the same as
the porridge you make.

114
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,027
When we were at Mount Junji

115
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:07,307
I was also unaccustomed to the cooking
of that princess of the Eastern Sea.

116
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:11,706
However, Father didn't cook
any food just for me.

117
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,746
I have business to attend to later
back at the Celestial Palace.

118
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,907
Father, you're leaving?

119
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,746
Cheng Yu said absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

120
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:26,427
You and Mother were already
separated for 300 years.

121
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,466
How can you bear to part now?

122
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,267
Have you forgotten what day it is?

123
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,787
What day is it?

124
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:37,667
Let me think about
what day it is in Heaven.

125
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,506
- Oh! It's the Heavenly Lord's birthday!
- That's correct.

126
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:45,267
Are you taking me and Mother to celebrate
the Heavenly Lord's birthday?

127
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,586
Celebrate?

128
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:51,466
Your mother doesn't like to go
to these sorts of banquet.

129
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,506
I will just go by myself.

130
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,466
All right.

131
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:59,626
Don't worry. I will bring Riceball back.

132
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,907
Aunt, you're back!

133
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,667
Where is the Crown Prince?

134
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,942
He returned to the Celestial Palace.

135
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,162
He said he'll be gone for
a few days on business.

136
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,466
Doesn't that mean there won't be
anyone to cook for you?

137
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:25,746
Go to the market in the afternoon
to buy some loquats.

138
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,547
Your Highness is indeed punctual.

139
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,307
I had exactly enough time to finish
my cup of tea. Just as you said.

140
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:50,667
I just encountered that group
of people in the Mortal Realm.

141
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,427
Your Highness has
encountered them as well?

142
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,386
How could they dare attack Your Highness?

143
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,106
They were not after me.

144
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,866
They were after the life
of a high immortal

145
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,267
but my subject, Tian Shu,
happened to come across them.

146
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,067
Did Your Highness capture anyone alive?

147
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:09,506
It would have been of no use.
They were created by demonic magic.

148
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:14,547
Yes, it is demonic magic.
They come from the Ghost Realm.

149
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,147
But the Ghost Realm pledged
allegiance to the Celestial Tribe.

150
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,907
Why would they do this now?

151
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,346
Keep this matter quiet for now.

152
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:27,787
First determine the identities of
the immortals who were attacked.

153
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:31,067
Yes.

154
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,147
Your Highness.

155
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:09,187
- Has His Highness returned?
- Yes, the Crown Prince is back.

156
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,667
Is Bai Qian of Qing Qiu with him?

157
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:17,547
I saw the Crown Prince return alone.

158
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,547
He headed straight for Zichen Hall

159
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,427
to speak with
the West Sea's Second Prince

160
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,147
He has yet to go to the banquet.

161
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:28,547
Good. It is best that she is not here.

162
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:34,746
Now I have absolute confidence
in keeping Ye Hua here.

163
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:37,427
Your Highness, I'm afraid...

164
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:38,826
No need to be afraid.

165
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:44,986
The Heavenly Lord has always
despised the snake.

166
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:48,027
By association, he also dislikes
the snake's son, Yuan Zhen.

167
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,706
The tension has eased
only in recent years.

168
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,907
If...

169
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,506
If Yuan Zhen were to molest me

170
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,746
the Heavenly Lord would certainly
not forgive him.

171
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:05,547
Therefore, there is no need to worry.

172
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:08,426
In the Heavenly Lord's eyes,
I am very important.

173
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:13,906
He has looked after me since I was young.
Even if he disregards these affections

174
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:19,227
he will still uphold justice for me out
of respect for the other clan leaders.

175
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,586
I am Ye Hua's side consort.

176
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,146
If I am molested by his cousin

177
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:28,186
no matter which way it's put,
it is a serious matter.

178
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:34,146
Ye Hua will have to stay in
the Celestial Palace for a few days.

179
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:39,307
The main priority now is to
keep him here in the Celestial Palace

180
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:43,307
so he can't go to Qing Qiu
and be enticed by that nine-tailed fox.

181
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:51,386
Make preparations here.

182
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:56,586
I will go find Yuan Zhen
and try to lead him here.

183
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,787
Yes, Your Highness.

184
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,487
That's the eldest son of
the Water King of the North Sea?

185
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,707
Yes. Look at how pitiful he is.

186
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:18,106
He is the Heavenly Lord's grandson,
but he has to wait here

187
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:19,987
and can't go in directly
to make his greetings.

188
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:22,467
Who told the Water King
to marry that snake?

189
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,666
Exactly.

190
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:37,866
Who are you? Is there something
you need my help with?

191
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,426
You should call me Consort Su Jin.

192
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,426
You are Consort Su Jin?

193
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,586
Greetings, Consort Su Jin.

194
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,707
According to seniority,
I am your cousin's wife.

195
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:52,186
There is no need for such formalities
like we're strangers.

196
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:57,467
Don't take what
those servants said to heart.

197
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,626
What is the point of living a long life?

198
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:03,787
What is most important is
being with the ones you love.

199
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:07,027
I am very envious of the love
your parents have for each other.

200
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,186
You are right, Your Highness.

201
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:14,987
By the way, why are you here alone?

202
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,307
Father left to give his greetings
to the Heavenly Lord.

203
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,987
He had me wait here to be summoned.

204
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,747
Is that so?

205
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:25,307
How about this? I'll take you inside.

206
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:29,467
That won't do! How can I enter
without being summoned?

207
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:33,507
It's all right. He is your grandfather.

208
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36,346
Besides, the Heavenly Lord has been
praising you the past few days

209
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,586
saying your congratulatory words
were well written.

210
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,027
Really?

211
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:43,146
Come, follow me.

212
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:46,426
The Heavenly Lord is currently at
Xiwu Palace. I'll take you there.

213
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,747
Your Highness, this place is...

214
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,866
Quick, move him up there.

215
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,146
Yes.

216
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,467
Go.

217
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,666
Hang a length of white silk
from a roof beam.

218
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,866
Yes.

219
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:32,307
Quick, run out of here crying and yelling

220
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,386
that I've been molested
by the drunk, young prince

221
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:36,906
and that I want to hang myself
because I cannot live with it.

222
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:38,146
Yes.

223
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,227
Someone come quickly!

224
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,866
My lady was molested
by the drunk, young prince

225
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,707
and is hanging herself out of distress!

226
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,426
Someone come! Anyone!

227
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:55,626
My lady is hanging herself!

228
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,355
Someone come!

229
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:03,507
- Crown Prince.
- Second Uncle.

230
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:09,386
I heard you have been
staying in Qing Qiu lately.

231
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,346
It seems a wedding date
will be fast approaching.

232
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,000
I also heard from Shao Xing
that she saw

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,626
that the woman at your side at the
Eastern Sea was High Goddess Bai Qian.

234
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:20,106
At first, I thought
she was just joking

235
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,866
but it turned out to be true.

236
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,067
I heard from Third Uncle that

237
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:27,826
you brought your eldest son, Yuan Zhen,
to the Heavenly Lord's birthday banquet.

238
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,227
Yes.

239
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:32,547
Father just praised
Yuan Zhen's intelligence.

240
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:37,666
It's just unfortunate that
no matter how intelligent he is

241
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,154
he is merely the son of
the Water King of the North Sea.

242
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:46,707
I'm afraid he was not meant to be
in the Nine Heavens.

243
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:47,906
Ye Hua!

244
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:51,946
Second Brother, hurry to Xiwu Palace.
Yuan Zhen is in great trouble!

245
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:38,426
- Father.
- Heavenly Lord.

246
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,987
Rise.

247
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,106
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

248
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:55,307
Your good son is just like you,
mindless over lust!

249
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,547
Yuan Zhen, what have you done?

250
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:05,586
Father, I did not do anything!
I did not do anything!

251
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:13,227
He barged into my chambers
and I nearly...

252
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,467
I nearly lost my innocence to him.

253
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:29,787
I am unworthy of Your Highness's
generosity to me in the past.

254
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:35,787
Please grant me a piece of white silk
so that I may die with my innocence!

255
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:53,626
I beg Your Majesty and Your Highness
to grant me death!

256
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,346
You're a disgrace!

257
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,707
You animal!

258
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:14,586
Yuan Zhen was imprudent

259
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,906
to have dared to commit
such a shameful act!

260
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:21,707
However, Father, I implore you
to consider Yuan Zhen's young age

261
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:23,507
and spare his life!

262
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:30,547
Father, please spare Yuan Zhen's life
and be lenient with punishment!

263
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:43,826
Consort Su Jin did
all she could to resist...

264
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,866
and was not defiled by him.

265
00:25:47,707 --> 00:25:52,707
I could have issued a lighter punishment
if it were someone else's son.

266
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:54,826
However, he just has to be your son!

267
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:00,146
Of my three sons...

268
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,227
you were the one I favored the most.

269
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:09,866
You were also the one
to cause me the most pain.

270
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:15,346
I cannot believe that on this day,
it is now your son who breaks my heart.

271
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:19,866
I never imagined that
after all these millennia

272
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,787
the first time I allow you to bring
your son to the Celestial Palace

273
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:29,866
I would in exchange be
disgraced by my own grandson

274
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:34,227
in front of all my subjects
at my own birthday banquet!

275
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:38,826
I know I have done wrong.
Please don't be angry, Father.

276
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,386
Yuan Zhen.

277
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:49,346
You are young, yet you are
actually capable of doing such a thing!

278
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:53,426
I have no choice but to reconsider
my evaluation of you.

279
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:59,067
To think I believed you had
a benevolent disposition!

280
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:02,626
Heavenly Lord, please investigate this!
I truly did not do anything!

281
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:06,906
It was Consort Su Jin who led me there!
I really did not do anything!

282
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,826
- Please investigate, Your Majesty!
- You're a disgrace!

283
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:14,866
Is there any woman who would destroy
her own innocence just to frame another?

284
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,946
You are making excuses even now?

285
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:26,307
Guards!

286
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,547
- Heavenly Lord.
- Heavenly Lord.

287
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:33,946
Bind Yuan Zhen with an Immortal Seal.

288
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:36,906
Send him off to the Mortal Realm
to suffer trials for 60 years.

289
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,906
After 60 years, he may return to
the ranks of the immortals.

290
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:41,507
- Yes.
- Yes.

291
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:44,401
No...

292
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:52,946
No, no! Father! Father, help me!
Father! Father!

293
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:55,666
- Please withdraw your command, Father!
- I really didn't do it!

294
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:58,747
- Yuan Zhen has a gentle nature.
- I didn't do it!

295
00:27:58,747 --> 00:28:00,386
He does not indulge in lust!

296
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:05,186
A father knows his son best.
He would never do such a thing!

297
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:07,346
Please investigate, Father.

298
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:10,946
- Please investigate, Father!
- Save me, Father!

299
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:13,707
Back in the day

300
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:17,050
I also thought you had a gentle nature
and didn't indulge in lust.

301
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:21,826
Did you not do such
a disgraceful thing as well?

302
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,507
Take him away!

303
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,027
- No, no! Father, save me!
- Yuan Zhen!

304
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:35,186
Father! Father, save me! Father!

305
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:36,906
Father!

306
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,787
<i>I did not do anything!</i>

307
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:51,826
This child falls asleep so easily.

308
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:56,946
Ye Hua is so lucky
to have a son like you.

309
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:09,747
Your Highness, please grant me death
so I may prove my innocence.

310
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:14,027
Your Highness!

311
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,067
What act are you playing out today?

312
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,586
What does Your Highness mean?

313
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:36,106
Could it be... Your Highness suspects
I would sully my own innocence?

314
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:39,146
Is there any woman in the world
who would do such a thing?

315
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:42,426
Moreover, I have always
loved only Your Highness.

316
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:45,227
Does Your Highness not know?

317
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:49,067
Once, you framed Su Su just like this.

318
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,987
Did you really think I could not
see through your lies?

319
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:58,946
Your Highness wrongly accuses me!

320
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,467
Do you know why I have let you live?

321
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,987
First, it is because of
the Soul-gathering Lamp.

322
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:17,146
I only spared you from death
for that lamp.

323
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:19,547
Second...

324
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:24,666
It is because you are taking care of
Su Su's eyes in your eye sockets.

325
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:32,186
If you die, Su Su's eyes
would die as well.

326
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,626
However...

327
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:42,586
Should you continue
digging your own grave

328
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:45,106
then do not blame me
for showing you no mercy.

329
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,787
Su Jin, even if you were to die

330
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:53,787
I would still be able to find
a new owner for those eyes.

331
00:30:56,507 --> 00:31:00,186
My Lord.
My Lord!

332
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:07,186
I stayed by Your Highness's side
for so many years.

333
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:08,626
Could it be that...

334
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,586
it truly meant nothing to you?

335
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:15,307
That's right.

336
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,747
Nothing at all.

337
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:48,027
- In my opinion--
- It was a scheme devised by Su Jin.

338
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:50,787
The Heavenly Lord used the chance
to further suppress Second Uncle.

339
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,186
You are seeing things
even more clearly now.

340
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,747
It is just unfortunate that
Yuan Zhen has fallen on bad luck.

341
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,146
Second Brother was careless as well.

342
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:04,186
It was because of that snake that
Father demoted him to the North Sea.

343
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:07,267
Second Brother and his wife have even
deeper affections for each other now.

344
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,946
They're about to have their fourth child.

345
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:12,626
Isn't that an affront to Father
in front of the whole world?

346
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:15,547
Yuan Zhen has been made
a scapegoat for his parents.

347
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:20,267
That may not be a bad thing.

348
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:25,346
I'll advise Second Brother
to exercise restraint.

349
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:28,666
His love and affections
must be kept hidden.

350
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,906
If Father feels disrespected

351
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,891
Second Brother won't have
an easy life either.

352
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:45,227
Is there something that
you can't tell me, Third Uncle?

353
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:47,507
I just find it strange.

354
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,227
Since you already know Su Su is Bai Qian

355
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:53,386
why aren't you bringing her back to
the Celestial Palace as soon as you can?

356
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:55,386
She has a marriage arrangement with you.

357
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:02,307
Haven't I said that she has
completely forgotten about me?

358
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:04,787
She's really forgotten?

359
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,826
It must be Zhe Yan's amnesia potion.

360
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:13,787
She must have remembered
you took out her eyes

361
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,209
so that's why she chose
to remove you from her memory.

362
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:26,346
Now that you are staying in Qing Qiu,
what are your plans?

363
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:42,787
I want to... start all over again.

364
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,106
Start all over again?

365
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,787
When she was Su Su...

366
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:54,227
she did not have any good memories
of the Celestial Palace.

367
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,027
Since that is the case...

368
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,267
then let the memories be forgotten.

369
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:11,266
I just have to take things slowly
and find my way into her heart.

370
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:20,626
This time, there will be no obstacles.

371
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,507
I will be able to rightfully
take her as my wife.

372
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:28,347
Good. This may be a good idea.

373
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:03,467
Your Ladyship, the wind is picking up.
Hurry back inside.

374
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:09,427
It's been two years.
His Majesty still has not come to see me.

375
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:11,387
Your Ladyship was framed by villains.

376
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,067
Word has spread throughout the palace

377
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:16,586
that the plumed cockscomb
on your forehead is a demonic flower.

378
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,786
His Majesty would naturally not come
to see you after he heard that.

379
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,947
So it is because of this birthmark.

380
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:33,827
This birthmark was Aunt's favorite.

381
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:41,867
Do not be sad, Your Ladyship.
The rumors will be forgotten one day.

382
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:43,427
Your Ladyship is still young.

383
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,226
Do not fear that you will not
receive favor.

384
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:49,987
<i>But if I am unable to see him</i>

385
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:55,427
<i>how can I offer him a sincere heart
and fulfill his wish?</i>

386
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:12,427
Your Majesty.

387
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:26,266
Sit.

388
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:30,027
I do not dare.

389
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:31,507
I allow you to sit.

390
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,226
Yes.

391
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:44,907
Noble Consort still refuses
to return to the palace.

392
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,987
Noble Consort?

393
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:51,467
Noble Consort entered the palace
when she was 15 years old.

394
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:54,347
I always favored her.

395
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:57,347
I never expected that after giving birth
to the crown prince, Yuan Zhen

396
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,547
she would keep saying
she wanted to become a nun.

397
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,746
I could not do anything about her.

398
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,947
I could only build
a Taoist temple for her

399
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,186
in the remote mountains
by the imperial city

400
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,427
so she could devote herself
to religious practice.

401
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:15,266
Noble Consort has wholeheartedly
devoted herself to Taoism.

402
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:19,706
She and Yuan Zhen lived in
the Taoist temple...

403
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:23,146
until Yuan Zhen turned 16.

404
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:31,427
Then she sent a Taoist nun
to escort Yuan Zhen back to the palace.

405
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:34,786
She only returns on the first
and fifteenth of every month

406
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,427
to visit her son.

407
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:40,027
She never comes to see me.

408
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:48,666
She never visits me.
It is as if I do not even exist.

409
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,907
<i>Si Ming said Dijun came
to the Mortal Realm</i>

410
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,706
<i>to experience the bitterness of life.</i>

411
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,706
<i>From the looks of it</i>

412
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,947
<i>Si Ming put in his best effort
to write this story.</i>

413
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,266
<i>Is he not afraid that
after Dijun returns to Heaven</i>

414
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:06,067
<i>and recounts the bitterness
experienced in the Mortal Realm</i>

415
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,666
<i>Dijun will make him have
a taste for himself as well?</i>

416
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,666
Why are you silent?

417
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,827
I...

418
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:21,067
I am feeling sad for Your Majesty.

419
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,226
Noble Consort is so favored
by Your Majesty

420
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:24,706
yet she does treasure it.

421
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:27,347
She has not only trampled on
Your Majesty's sincere heart

422
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,467
but also done an injustice to the women
in the palace who adore Your Majesty.

423
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,306
Do you adore me as well?

424
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:38,547
I am Your Majesty's concubine.
Of course I adore you.

425
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:41,447
I wish I could scoop out my heart

426
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:44,347
and show Your Majesty
so you could see who fills it.

427
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,827
You are quite good at amusing others.

428
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:51,706
Your Majesty is smiling.

429
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:54,827
That is wonderful.

430
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:57,146
Anything can be quickly forgotten.

431
00:38:57,146 --> 00:39:01,586
My aunt said the world
is always changing.

432
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:05,547
No matter who you are,
you will eventually turn to dust.

433
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:08,885
So why should you worry so much
and make your life difficult?

434
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:13,226
That is quite reasonable.

435
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:23,347
This flower... is very beautiful.

436
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:26,987
For some reason, every time
I see this flower on your forehead...

437
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:31,027
I feel as if it is familiar.

438
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:34,827
Your Majesty remembers this birthmark?

439
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,226
I am uncertain.

440
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:41,987
I just want to keep gazing at it
and look at nothing else.

441
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,347
I also find it mysterious.

442
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:51,306
I thought I had fallen under your spell

443
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,027
so I have been avoiding you
for the past two years.

444
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:58,547
I was afraid I would keep looking

445
00:39:58,547 --> 00:40:01,226
and never be able to let go again.

446
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:11,626
Your Majesty! Your tea is finished.
I'll pour another cup for you.

447
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:34,706
How come I can't even manage
to say a few words of affection?

448
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:39,347
I can't be like this.

449
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,666
I know!

450
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,226
<i>Two Lives Curse!</i>

451
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:54,226
Mother, when is Father coming back?

452
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:58,547
I want to eat steamed mushrooms,
and cabbage and radish soup.

453
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,146
Soon, probably.

454
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:04,987
- Father is back!
- You're back.

455
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:14,106
Didn't I tell you
A-Li is growing right now?

456
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,947
He can't just eat these the entire day.

457
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:17,086
I know.

458
00:41:17,086 --> 00:41:19,507
That's why I've been hoping
day and night for you to return

459
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:21,275
to make better meals for him.

460
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:27,507
You've really been hoping for my return?

461
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:33,907
Father, Mother is blushing.

462
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:38,347
I was... hoping for you
to return to cook.

463
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:50,126
