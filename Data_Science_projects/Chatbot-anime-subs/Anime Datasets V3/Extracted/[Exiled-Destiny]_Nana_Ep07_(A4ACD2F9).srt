1
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,791
I realize I'm a dreamer by nature,

2
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:11,931
but never in my wildest dreams did I ever
imagine meeting the girl again.

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,601
I only knew her name.

4
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,861
When I was darkness at that time

5
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,701
With trembling lips

6
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,791
In a corner of a room I cry

7
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,881
The more I struggle

8
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,711
The more this wound deepens

9
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:57,871
The broken promise hurt me

10
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,611
Nobody can save me

11
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,791
God, I have only one request

12
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,421
Stop tearing apart my love

13
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,761
I need your love

14
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,991
I'm a broken rose

15
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:18,941
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

16
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,101
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

17
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:23,871
I need your love

18
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:27,181
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,111
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

20
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:34,071
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

21
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,051
I wanna need your love

22
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,281
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:42,621
I wanna need your love

24
00:01:59,211 --> 00:01:59,871
Huh?

25
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,781
Too bad! Someone beat us to it.

26
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,611
Would it be all right if I show
this person the place too?

27
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:11,291
Huh? Sorry but that
would be a problem.

28
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,851
This customer has pretty well
decided on this place.

29
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,091
Nana!

30
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,161
That's you, right, Nana?! No way!
What a coincidence!

31
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,231
Who are you?

32
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,001
Am I such a forgettable person?

33
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,101
Sorry, sorry.

34
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,901
Are you all right, Nana?

35
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,231
So you do remember.

36
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,041
I didn't recognize you at first.

37
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,681
You look different with
these clothes and hairdo.

38
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:37,071
You don't have a fixed style, do you?

39
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,241
So, are you two friends?

40
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,651
- I wouldn't really say we're friends...
- Yes, we are!

41
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,061
Anyway, you. Miss Osaki?
What's your decision?

42
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:48,251
Are you renting the place?

43
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,851
I'm still thinking.

44
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,401
If you haven't made a decision yet,

45
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,731
can you please allow this young lady
to see the place?

46
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,621
The kitchen's so cute!

47
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,471
The rooms are so big!

48
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,571
You're kidding!
An old-fashioned bathtub with legs!

49
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,841
- I'll take it!
- Is that so?

50
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,001
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!

51
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,581
I found this place first!
You can't just decide like that!

52
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,011
I see. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:16,651
That's right. What are you thinking?

54
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,481
But you seemed to be having
a problem making up your mind.

55
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,781
No, I've decided.
I'll take it. Yokoi.

56
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,821
- Wait a minute!
- I'm not waiting.

57
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,001
I'm tired of staying
at crappy capsule hotels.

58
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,701
I just wanna hurry up and live
any place that's available.

59
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,701
If any place will do,
look elsewhere.

60
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,501
For me, it has to be this place!

61
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,041
What's wrong with you staying
at your boyfriend's place?!

62
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:40,711
Did he dump you?

63
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,551
No!

64
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,911
But as things are now,
it's only a matter of time!

65
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,081
Why? You were all lovey-dovey
about him.

66
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:48,521
That's true, but let me tell you!

67
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:50,691
Now, come on.
Rather than discussing nonsense,

68
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,311
what are you gonna do
about renting this...

69
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,581
- Nonsense?
- Nonsense?

70
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,561
How cruel!
Here I am seriously suffering!

71
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,751
- Yokoi!
- Yes!

72
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:59,661
For someone in the business
of serving customers,

73
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,561
you've got no delicacy!

74
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,831
I-I'm sorry.

75
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,601
There's more to doing your job
than just go through the motions!

76
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:06,701
Try to pursue the romance!

77
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,431
Now, now. Calm down, ladies.

78
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,231
Romance?

79
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:13,601
I have a suggestion.

80
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:16,281
Who is this carefree old man?

81
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,941
This is Mr. Ando from
the real estate agency at the train station.

82
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,381
He's a 52-year veteran in this business.

83
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,191
You two seem to be
special acquaintances.

84
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,321
Why don't the two of you
share this place?

85
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:33,901
This place is designed with
the dining room in the middle,

86
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,461
so with a room on opposite sides,
you can maintain your privacy.

87
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,961
Yet you'll be there for
each other when needed.

88
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:43,241
Flat-sharing can be very nice.

89
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:47,501
Plus, you'll only be paying half the rent
and living expenses.

90
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,171
- Half the rent?!
- Half the rent?!

91
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,481
- Half of 70,000 yen is...
...35,000 yen?

92
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,111
- That's cheap!
- That's cheap!

93
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,391
Let's go for it, Nana!

94
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,591
- It's like a dream to be able to stay...
- Then we'll have to split our fees, too.

95
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,051
at such a wonderful place
for so cheap!

96
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:00,291
Sounds good,

97
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,261
but are you the kind of person who
properly respects the privacy of others?

98
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:05,321
I will! For sure!

99
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:11,131
If privacy is an issue,
you can put locks on your room doors.

100
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,661
I'll arrange for that right away.

101
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,971
Thank you, Mr. Ando!

102
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,471
You are such a nice person.
Isn't he, Nana?

103
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:21,341
Miss Osaki, sure it'll be cheaper,
but you really should think this through.

104
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:25,271
Sharing a flat with a stranger
is nothing but annoying.

105
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,211
I don't agree.

106
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,411
You are a lonely man,
aren't you, Yokoi?

107
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:37,621
Say, Mr. Ando,
how soon can the locks be arranged?

108
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,901
If I made arrangements right away,

109
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,921
then it'll be done
sometime tomorrow morning.

110
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:46,531
Then please.
I'll be moving in tomorrow afternoon.

111
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:49,401
What about you?

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,641
Th-Then me too.

113
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,591
Then starting tomorrow,
we're roommates, Nana-chan.

114
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:21,901
What in the world were you thinking?!

115
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:25,211
Why not? Sharing is cool!

116
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,571
Like the foreigners do!

117
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:29,301
You're so easily fooled by others!

118
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,081
I don't think it's a good idea

119
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,381
for you to move in with
a complete stranger.

120
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,011
She's not a complete stranger.

121
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:36,551
I told you.
We sat next to each other on the train.

122
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,721
Coincidences like this have got to be...

123
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:42,821
...the work of the Demon Lord,
don't you think?

124
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,491
Stop talking about the Demon Lord!

125
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,701
What are you upset about, Jun-chan?

126
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,771
Does it make you sad

127
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,321
that I'm going to be living
with another woman?

128
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:54,201
Well yeah, sure I'd love
to live with you if I could,

129
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,831
but you've got Kyosuke.

130
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,411
I betcha she thinks
she can do you in.

131
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,541
Do me in?

132
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:06,641
It's 'cause you talk like that,
that you attract that type of woman.

133
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,311
What are you saying, Jun-chan?

134
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,981
In addition, she might just as well be
some serial murderer on the run.

135
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,151
That's impossible!

136
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,691
How can you be sure?!

137
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:18,131
Now if you're going to start living
with this stranger,

138
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:20,561
you are aware that you might
get yourself buried in cement

139
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,001
and sunk to the bottom
of Tokyo Bay.

140
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,031
You're over-reacting!

141
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,141
Okay, I give up.
I don't care what happens to you,

142
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,731
and if something does happen,
don't come crying to me.

143
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,111
But I don't think
Shoji's going to approve.

144
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,081
Have you told him yet?

145
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:40,771
No. Shoji's working today too,
so I'll tell him when he gets home.

146
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:44,051
He surely wouldn't appreciate me
showing up at work to tell him.

147
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:46,621
Hello? I'm in the middle
of work, too.

148
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,451
Hey Jun-chan! This dress is really cute!
Maybe I'll buy it.

149
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,191
I don't have any clothes
to sell to loafers.

150
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:57,001
Jun-chan's so lucky she gets to work
at such a classy boutique.

151
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:01,031
She's got a nice figure, kinda,
and she's got it made with Kyosuke.

152
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,371
I better hurry up and find a job.

153
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,741
I guess Shoji's not home yet.

154
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,751
But he got off work hours ago.

155
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:30,421
Hello...

156
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,241
Your call is being forwarded to
a voice messaging service.

157
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:35,071
Please leave a message
after the beep.

158
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,301
Why isn't he picking up?

159
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:41,171
If he's going to be late,
he could at least call.

160
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,481
Is he with another girl?!

161
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,641
No. Not Shoji. He could never!

162
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:50,651
But come to think of it,
we lived apart for a whole year.

163
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:51,521
It might not be so unusual if
another woman did show up in his life.

164
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,861
Tokyo Wife
(Sexy Type)
It might not be so unusual if
another woman did show up in his life.

165
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,521
Tokyo Wife
(Sexy Type)

166
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:55,061
Tokyo Wife
(Sexy Type)
While we were apart,

167
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:55,591
While we were apart,

168
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,891
he emailed me every day
and he was busy studying,

169
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,501
so I didn't even consider
the thought of him fooling around...

170
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,891
But, he is a member of
the male population...

171
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:10,501
A guy can do it with a girl even
if he has no feelings of love for her.

172
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,011
He did say something crude like that,
before we started dating.

173
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:20,421
If that's how he really feels,

174
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,051
he might just think nothing
of cheating on me.

175
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,451
Shoji...

176
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:34,391
Who do you like better,
me or that country girl?

177
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:37,491
You, of course, Sachiko.

178
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,341
This is ridiculous!
My imagination is running away on me.

179
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,861
Who the heck is Sachiko?!

180
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,341
I'm going to bed!!

181
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:56,481
Sachiko... Sachiko... Sachiko...

182
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,421
The name Sachiko means happy child.

183
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,391
This isn't good. I can't sleep.

184
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:10,131
So this is how hard it it to wait for
a husband who doesn't come home.

185
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,931
Even though he's not my husband.

186
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:19,281
I wonder if this is how
I was making Mr. Asano's wife feel.

187
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,141
Well, if that's the case,
this is heaven's punishment!

188
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,011
The Demon Lord's curse!

189
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,011
Nana!

190
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,551
What are you doing there?

191
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,141
You're going to catch cold!

192
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:31,951
Shoji...

193
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:35,761
Welcome home!

194
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,121
Look out!

195
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:43,261
What? But I sent you an email
telling you I'd be late.

196
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,231
You liar!
I didn't get any email!

197
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,661
How can you tell such an obvious lie?

198
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,301
- So you were with Sachiko...
- That's funny...

199
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,501
See, look! It's in my outbox...

200
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,941
I sent it to Junko by mistake...

201
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,351
I'll be home late today.
A friend at work has a fever, so I have
to work the evening shift to cover for him!
This sucks.

202
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,511
But I'll still have enough energy left
to have sex with you when I get home.
Ha ha ha Shoji

203
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,551
That idiot!

204
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:12,091
But I wonder why he doesn't
just ask Nana to live with him?

205
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,151
It's nothing to wonder about.

206
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,201
He probably just wants her
to become a bit more independent.

207
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:23,201
I couldn't agree more,
but that's a pretty wild expectation.

208
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:24,911
I hear ya.

209
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,881
Well, Shoji's spending
this year studying,

210
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,851
so he worries that much more
about this relationship.

211
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:33,611
Worried? He isn't thinking
about breaking up with her, is he?

212
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:37,791
No, the opposite.
He wants to marry Nana.

213
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,581
Marry?! Is he outta his mind?!
They're only twenty!

214
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,451
I don't think he wants
to do it just yet.

215
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,901
If he's going to university
for four years,

216
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:50,871
he won't be able to support Nana
until after that.

217
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:52,871
So he was wondering
whether or not

218
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,901
he should just quit studying
for the entrance exam

219
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,601
and find a full time job.

220
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,911
Just make her wait.

221
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:02,571
It's silly to throw your life plans
out the door for a woman.

222
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,841
Actually, I think so too.

223
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,241
But you know Nana.

224
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,461
Do you think she can wait
for all those years

225
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,251
until Shoji's ready to support her?

226
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:20,131
Maybe not. Say a mature,
liberal-minded rich guy shows up.

227
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,261
She'll be off with him
in no time.

228
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,301
You think so too?

229
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,401
Of course.

230
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:25,761
If a guy like that shows up,
I'd go with him too!

231
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:27,771
Yeah, I guess.

232
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,701
What makes you so carefree?!

233
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:33,671
Hey, why are we talking
about me now?

234
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,141
What were you thinking?

235
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:42,111
You're so easily fooled by others!

236
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,021
I don't think it's a good idea

237
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,391
for you to move in with
a complete stranger!

238
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:46,051
Shoji!

239
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:49,361
Jun-chan already said that.
So say something else.

240
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,451
Is that so... Then, let's see...

241
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:52,621
Sorry.

242
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,261
Okay, I got it.

243
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,891
Let's live together, Nana.

244
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:04,041
If living alone makes you too nervous,
you can stay here.

245
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,471
But...

246
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:09,071
N-Not enough space
in this one little room?

247
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,141
Wanna go find another place?

248
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,011
No, not that. But you!

249
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:16,881
You wouldn't wanna live with me.
You'll hate it.

250
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:20,151
I'm always wanting my own way,
and I whine.

251
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,891
You think I don't know that?

252
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:24,951
I'm used to it, or rather,
I've given up about that.

253
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:25,721
How dare you!

254
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:29,591
Just kidding.
Let's do it, okay?

255
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:31,191
Shoji...

256
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:34,031
Thank you.

257
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:35,631
That makes me happy.

258
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:37,661
But I can't!

259
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,771
Those words were all
I needed to hear.

260
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,341
You've chosen me over Sachiko.

261
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,581
Who the heck is Sachiko?

262
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:47,911
You're just too kind.

263
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,451
If we live together,

264
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,351
I'm going to rely on you
too much all the time.

265
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,581
I don't want to be a burden anymore
than I already am.

266
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,021
No, Nana.

267
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,761
Before you go and become
a burden on a complete stranger,

268
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:02,891
let it be me!

269
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:07,661
But like, I'm twenty already!
I wanna be a mature woman!

270
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,901
A classy woman
the television viewers can idolize!

271
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:12,901
Please understand!

272
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:16,811
If at all possible,
that's how I want you to be, too.

273
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:22,881
Anyway, if you're able to go
and live on your own,

274
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:25,041
go for it.

275
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:29,081
Just don't go moving in
with a total stranger.

276
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:34,091
Why not?
Why doesn't anyone trust Nana?

277
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,701
It's not her that we don't trust.

278
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,531
It's your ability to judge people.

279
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,411
You know Nana, she's beautiful,
has a small face,

280
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,101
she's thin, has a husky voice,
she is sooo cool!

281
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,611
She could be a top star
in a musical.

282
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,181
What's that supposed to mean?

283
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,351
You feel attracted to a person
just by their looks?

284
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,591
You'd like her too, Shoji.

285
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,921
But what if you decide that
you like her better than me?!

286
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,251
I couldn't go on living!

287
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,121
All right. Introduce her to me.

288
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,401
I'll go to the apartment
with you tomorrow.

289
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,731
You promise
you won't fall in love with her?

290
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:17,301
I promise. I've got my hands full
with you and Sachiko.

291
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:22,301
Oh yeah, that's right.
Sachiko is quite a wild woman.

292
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:24,041
You'll never make it.

293
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,341
So who the heck is Sachiko!

294
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,461
I was wondering what kind of an old
rundown shack you were gonna show me,

295
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,051
but this is pretty nice.

296
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:42,121
Seventy thousand yen for
this place is a good deal.

297
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,731
Maybe it's haunted.

298
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,531
What do you mean by that?!

299
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,131
Never mind that.

300
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,061
Why did you guys come here
with us?

301
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,831
Why not?

302
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:53,511
Besides, I wanna get
a look at that girl

303
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,501
who has the guts to live with Nana.

304
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,941
Courtesy call.
We're representing the benefactors.

305
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:01,181
So, where's your room?

306
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,481
Room 707.

307
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,121
707?!

308
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:05,321
That's bad luck!

309
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:05,991
Demon Lord
That's bad luck!

310
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,891
Since when have you guys
become believers of the Demon Lord?

311
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:15,891
There's no answer.
Maybe Nana's not here yet.

312
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,331
Do you have a key?

313
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,061
I haven't been given one yet.

314
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,601
Why not?
You have a contract, right?

315
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,581
Yeah, but I needed a guarantor
to sign and seal it,

316
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,041
so I asked my Dad.

317
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,771
I should get it tomorrow.

318
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:32,281
So you're not an official resident yet?

319
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,421
But I already paid
the commission and stuff.

320
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,451
What the?!

321
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:37,221
Someone's pulling one over on you!

322
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,261
And who might you be?

323
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,561
W-Wrong door! I'm very sorry!

324
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:57,501
I don't believe it!

325
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:00,041
Cripes! How can you
make such a mistake?

326
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,301
It's cold!
Yasu, what is this place!

327
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,671
There's no hot water!

328
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,711
Maybe this is the right place!

329
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:07,811
What the hell?

330
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,921
Did you get the gas man to come
and open the valve?

331
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,521
Open what?

332
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:13,651
Nana!

333
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,421
Nana! I've been waiting for you.

334
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,261
What took you so long?

335
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,021
Nana, get dressed.

336
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,491
Oh, is your boyfriend with you?

337
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:24,271
- Mhm, my friends are here too.
- Hey, she might just be my type.

338
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:25,961
- Come on in.
- That's nice.

339
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,901
Man, it's cold!

340
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,401
I'm going to catch cold!

341
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,961
What are you gonna do for me
if I lose my beautiful voice?!

342
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,171
Please. So you are
the other occupant.

343
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,971
Yes! Th-Th-Thank you
for welcoming us in!

344
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:41,641
What's the hesitation?
This is your place, too.

345
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:45,221
How do you do?
My name is Junko Saotome.

346
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,811
I'm a friend of Nana Komatsu.

347
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:48,451
Who are you?

348
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,151
She's got guts.

349
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,491
Oh, pardon me for
not introducing myself earlier.

350
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:58,501
I'm a friend of Nana Osaki,
Yasushi Takagi by name.

351
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,001
I am also her acting benefactor.

352
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:01,931
Nice to meet you.

353
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,471
Yasushi Takagi
Ishizuka Law Office

354
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,871
Law Firm?!

355
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,201
- A lawyer?
- Really?

356
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,041
I'm still learning,

357
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,911
but if you're ever in trouble,
feel free to give me a call.

358
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,151
Then why don't you
do something about this, Yasu?

359
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:16,121
I'm in trouble
because I have no hot water.

360
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,661
So you gotta call the gas company
to get a guy over here to open up...

361
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:20,681
You call.

362
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,021
Yes ma'am.
Let's see. The number...

363
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,221
Well then.
Perhaps I'll make some tea.

364
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,121
Let me help.

365
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,401
Hey, do you have a kettle
and cups and stuff?

366
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,661
- Nope.
- You good for nothing!

367
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:32,791
I'm sorry!

368
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,771
You gotta wait for
the gas guy to come

369
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,101
before you can use
the burner anyway!

370
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,671
Oh, that's right.

371
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,211
You've gotta do that?

372
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,711
So did you call them?

373
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,201
The line was busy.

374
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:45,511
Also, fill this in and send it
to the power company.

375
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,921
Your water bill will be debited from
your bank account along with your rent,

376
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,411
so you don't have to worry about those.

377
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:53,381
Oh, and don't forget to register
your new address with the City Hall.

378
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,221
Well Nana,
I guess we'll be leaving, then.

379
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,351
Looks like we can trust this guy
to look after things for you.

380
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:00,781
We can?

381
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,331
Well, hang in there, man.

382
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,391
Oh, are you leaving so soon?

383
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,371
The child doesn't know left
from right,

384
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,241
but I hope you do befriend her.

385
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,701
The pleasure is ours.

386
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:16,811
Shoji, are you coming?
You're working tonight, right?

387
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,241
Right. What should I do?

388
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:22,151
Don't worry about me, Shoji.

389
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,421
Nana is here too, so I'll be okay.

390
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:25,421
That's right.

391
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,351
Shoji, you...
be a man and go earn some money.

392
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,821
Well, it may be all right.

393
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:37,491
That lawyer, Takagi, is taking care
of the other Nana and our Nana too.

394
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,871
The two of them seem to be
getting along just fine.

395
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,401
Like, both placing herself above all?

396
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:47,771
The other Nana seems
even weirder than our Nana.

397
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,741
Stop repeating Nana
and Nana so much.

398
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,481
I feel my troubles doubling.

399
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:56,041
Two times seven is fourteen.
Seven squared is forty-nine.

400
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:58,421
- My troubles are gonna multiply.
- As such...

401
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:02,551
Nana and I started living together
on a positive note.

402
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:05,491
At least for me, that is.

403
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:09,901
Nana, the soonest the gas company people
can make it here is tomorrow.

404
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:13,521
No way! Then we can't even heat
this place until then?

405
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,801
You don't even have
an air conditioner here.

406
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:16,731
No way!

407
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,631
If you're cold,
put on something warm.

408
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,441
But I only brought my leather jacket.

409
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:22,981
I can't get comfortable in that.

410
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,381
Oh, do you want me
to lend you something?

411
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,311
Really? Thanks. Thanks a lot.

412
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,191
When I first arrived in Tokyo,

413
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,311
I didn't know whether
I'd be able to make it or not.

414
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:38,351
Could I get a job,
would I be Shoji's girl forever?

415
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,801
I had a mountain of anxieties.

416
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,131
Your bag's all clothes.
Are you a peddler?

417
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:50,171
What's your choice, ma'am?

418
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:54,341
But as strange as it seems,

419
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:56,541
I had absolutely no qualms about
moving in with you, Nana.

420
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,141
It's hard to explain why.
That's just how it was.

421
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:12,181
I reached into the sky

422
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:18,701
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

423
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:24,071
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

424
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:30,071
Like colorful balloons

425
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,181
I'm alone

426
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:35,911
My hand had no place to go

427
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:42,551
And gently you took it

428
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:43,731
Starless night

429
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:47,921
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

430
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:53,731
I want to feel your warmth

431
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:55,601
Tears are falling down

432
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:59,701
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

433
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:06,201
Of your hand holding mine
