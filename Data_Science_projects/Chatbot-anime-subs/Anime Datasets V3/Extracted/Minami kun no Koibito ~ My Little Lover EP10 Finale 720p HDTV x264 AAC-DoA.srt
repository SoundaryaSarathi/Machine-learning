<i>- I'll leave Horikiri-shi in your care.</i>

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,670
<i>Okay.</i>

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,280
<i>By the way, </i>

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,310
<i>When I looked into "The Legend of One-Inch Princess",</i>

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,460
<i>I found out that using the lucky mallet is not enough.</i>

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,520
<i>What?</i>

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>In the original story, after the One-inch Princess used the mallet,</i>

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,340
<i>she prayed, facing the morning sun, at Akebono Cape and she became big.</i>

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,290
<i>Akebono Cape?</i>

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Why don't you go?</i>

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,470
<i>Please, make me big, and return me to my original self.</i>

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,740
<i>Please return Chiyomi to her original self.</i>

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,870
<i>The day has finally come when I can return to my original self.</i>

14
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,620
<i>Where are you, Chiyomi?</i>

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,390
<i>Right here! I am here, Minami-kun!</i>

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,190
<i>Ever since Minami-kun, who I've liked since when I was little, has rescued me,</i>

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,880
<i>I've felt happiness being close to the person I like, and sadness...</i>

18
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,590
<i>The Minami-kun that I like is not a coward like that.</i>

19
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,070
<i>You can't do anything without me.</i>

20
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,020
<i>Your fever is going up.</i>

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,930
<i>Being impatient with myself for not being able to do a thing.</i>

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,280
<i>Being disappointed at myself...</i>

23
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>A lot happened.</i>

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,070
<i>- That you really like Chobiko... <br> - I like Chiyomi.</i>

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,250
<i>It's not one sided-love.</i>

26
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,560
<i>You are...</i>

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,030
<i>already a part of me.</i>

28
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,210
<i>Minami-kun...</i>

29
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,600
<i>I finally found out that Minami-kun was feeling the same way.</i>

30
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,150
<i>Now, our feelings became one. </i>

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,120
<i>I want to get back to how I was... for Minami-kun.</i>

32
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>~Last Episode~<br><br>Good bye Chiyomi, Good bye Minami-kun</i>

33
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,860
Why?

34
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,750
Am I going to stay like this forever?

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,190
Don't worry.

36
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,650
I'm sure there is another way.

37
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,560
But... what else can we do?

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,110
Don't worry.

39
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,290
I'm here with you.

40
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,690
Minami-kun...

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,410
But, that Takagi...

42
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,680
he was so confident, but what is this?

43
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,290
Thank you very much.

44
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,700
Thank you for taking care of me during my stay.

45
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,640
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,810
Well... Since we came all the way out here,

47
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,820
shall we skip school for a day and stay one more night somewhere?

48
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,780
He's not heading back now, is he?

49
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,100
<i>I'll Leave Horikiri-shi in your care.</i>

50
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,440
<i>Okay.</i>

51
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>In the original story, after the One-inch Princess used the mallet,</i>

52
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,330

53
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,200

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,960
<i>Why don't you go?</i>

55
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,780
Those two are definitely seeing each other.

56
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,960
Somewhere, they will meet up.

57
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,650
Chiyomi, is there any place you want to go?

58
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,980
Yeah.

59
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,220
Where? Where do you want to go?

60
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,030
Please take me home.

61
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,540
Home?

62
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,990
Not Minami-kun's house,

63
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,330
but my house.

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,680
Chiyomi?

65
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm going to tell my parents about what's been going on.

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,350
Wait a minute. It's not like you can't get back to normal forever.

67
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,150
I can't continue to be your burden like this forever.

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,440
It's okay with me. I don't think of it as a burden.

69
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Minami-kun...

70
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,690
Minami-kun is talking to himself all this time. Is he okay?

71
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,590
Let's forget about each other when we get home.

72
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,300
Everything up until now...

73
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,850
let's forget about them.

74
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,560
What are you saying?

75
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,940
I can't possibly do that.

76
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,240
You can't become happy being with me like this.

77
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,540
There's nothing I can do for you.

78
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,150
Don't worry about that. I'm saying it's okay.

79
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,070
I don't like it.

80
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,230
I don't want to live being a burden to you.

81
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,360
Minami-kun, you will someday regret it.

82
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,030
I'll regret more if I'm not with you.

83
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,920
I...

84
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,490
no matter how you are, I will protect you.

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,040
And I won't leave your side.

86
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,310
Minami-kun...

87
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,760
I love you.

88
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,120
Let's stay together forever.

89
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,650
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,550
Let's end this.

- Chiyomi, calm down.<br><i>- What should we do?</i>

118

There's nothing you can do right now. Let's calm down first...

119
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,250

122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,700
Doctor, how is Shunichi?

123
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,290
How is he doing?

124
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,240
The surgery was a success.

125
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,100
We removed the bleeding in the brain.

126
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,940
There were no other damages, so all we have to do is wait for him to regain his consciousness.

127
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,140
I'm sure there will be no aftereffect either.

128
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,940
Dr. Kawamura, thank you so much.

129
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,530
Thank you.

130
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,700
So he was Minami-san's child.

131
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,620
Since he is young, I'm sure he'll recover quickly.

132
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,410
Thank you very much.

133
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,280
Excuse me.

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,890
Asuka, why didn't you tell us if you knew?

149
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,230
I did tell you. I said she might have become a tiny person.

150
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,620
That sounded like a joke.

151
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,770
You wouldn't have believed me if I told you anyway.

152
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,070
- But, even so...<br>- It's alright now.

153
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,630

160
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,480
He's been asleep this whole time.

161
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,230
He just had the surgery yesterday...

162
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,840
This is to be expected?

163
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,990
It's strange.

164
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,760
The anesthesia has worn off a long time ago. He should be awake by now.

165
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,270
Eh?

166
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,500

169
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,480
Minami-kun hasn't regained consciousness yet.

170
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,550

He should be awake by now.

177
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,180
I was told that it is clearly not normal for him

178
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,490
to be in a coma for a long time like this.

179
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,780
But, wasn't he recovering nicely?

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,610
There is a chance that he wouldn't regain consciousness.

181
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,760
No way...!

182
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,150
Dad!

183
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,610
Minami-san, the doctor wants to talk to you about our plans going forward.

184
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,160
Okay.

185
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,610
Ricchan, may I ask you to (stay here) for a while?

186
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,180
- I am going, too.<br>- Me, too.

187
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,250
Minami-kun...

188
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,220
Mom.

189
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,750
Hmm?

190
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,330
Would you leave us alone for a little bit?

191
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,570
Okay.

192
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
Minami-kun.

193
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,440
Wake up.

194
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,170
Wake up... please.

195
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,740
I'm sorry, Minami-kun...

196
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,060
I was only thinking about myself.

197
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,420
Even if I couldn't get back to how I used to be,

198
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,710
I would have been happy just to be beside you.

199
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,310
I will never leave you.

200
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,030
Even if you didn't wake up.

201
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,760
I love you, Minami-kun.

202
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,570
Let's stay together forever.

203
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,290
Minami-kun...

204
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,330
Minami-kun!

205
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,770
Chiyomi...

206
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,390
Yeah, I'm Chiyomi. Do you recognize me?

207
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,030
You were safe...

208
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,210
Minami-kun.

209
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm so relieved.

210
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,940
I'm so happy.

211
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,590
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by <br>The Little Lover Team @Viki</i>

212
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,910
Chiyomi.

213
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,510
Minami-kun.

214
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,600
Minami-kun, I...

215
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,650
Chiyomi?

216
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes, Minami-kun.

217
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,340
- Chiyomi.<br>-Yes.

218
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,190
- Chiyomi.<br>- Yes.

219
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,140
Can you wear something?

220
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,270
<i>Don't look!</i>

221
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,040
<i>- Not yet!</i><br>- I won't look.

222
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,490
It's okay now.

223
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,500
I can't believe...

224
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,180
a kiss really worked...

225
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,060
<i>I wonder if a prince's kiss</i>

226
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,700

227
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,960
<i>There is no way that would work.</i>

228
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,830
My goodness.

229
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,820
Holding back (a kiss) backfired.

230
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,210
What?

231
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,780

256
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,160
Hey, Minami. Are you okay?

257
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,180
Yeah, I am okay.

258
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,540
Hey, don't go ahead of me. I'm still weak.

259
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,510
Sorry. Forgive me.

260
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,110
Goodness.

261
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,850
What is this unusual atmosphere?

262
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,600
What's up with Horikiri and Minami?

263
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,750
Didn't they used to fight like cats and dogs?

264
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,460
By any chance... while Horikiri was missing...?

265
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,750
Could it be you and Minami-kun are...?

266
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,340
Yeah. We are dating.

267
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,730
Hey, Minami-kun!

268
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,730
It's okay. It's better to make these kinds of things clear.

269
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,180
- Ami...<br>- Amippe!

270
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,280

336
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,100
I just get overwhelmed with emotion.

337
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,690

Okay, okay.

342
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,200
I always thought they would end up getting together.

343
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
Me, too.

344
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,090
So cute.

<i>Isn't onee-chan pretty?</i><br><i>(onee-chan: it is used to call older women)</i>

348
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,770
Are you next, Dad and Dr. Reiko?

349
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,180
- What?<br>- Sayori...

350
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,110
You are a good match unexpectedly.

351
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,490
Sayori-chan...

352
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,120
What? Unexpectedly? What do you mean?

353
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,230
Okay, here we go. Cheese fondue.

354
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,190
Thank you. Let's see.

355
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh, you look cute in it.

356
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,250
- I'm so happy.<br>- Because I'm good.

357
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,850
Me too. Me too. Me too.

358
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,300
- I want to take a picture with you too, Takagi-san.<br>- Okay.

359
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,920
May I call you Onii-chan (big brother) from now on?

360
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,200
- What?<br>- Onii-chan!

361
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,110
Asuka-chan...

362
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,770
Well, your Onii-chan is over there, right?

363
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,850
- Riku, let's take another picture.<br>- Onii-chan.

364
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,300
- Onii-chan.<br>- <i>Me, too. Me, too.</i>

365
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:55,210
I should have taken a picture of Chiyomi when she was a tiny person.

366
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,730
I'm regretting it now.

367
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,470
We have one.

368
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,240
See?

369
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,010
There's Chiyomi!

370
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,410
- What?<br>- Look.

371
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,420
Chiyomi!

372
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,830
Yeah, I am in it.

373
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,470
You're here.

<i>My Little Lover<br>Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

375
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,610
<i>Since the day I became small, </i>

376
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,950
<i>it's been exactly a year today.</i>

377
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,650
- Well then, I'm going.<br>- Um.

378
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,970
Are you okay? Are you done packing?

379
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,330
Ah!

380
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,140
I forgot to pack sweatpants and shoes.

381
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,090
What do you think you are going there for?

382
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,220
<i>Minami-kun successfully entered a medical university<br> where he could commute from home.</i>

383
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,970
<i>He became a medical student in April this year.</i>

384
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,790
<i>I moved to Minami-kun's house.</i>

385
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,350
<i>Well, I just moved to our neighbor's house though. </i>

386
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>We've been having a sweet married-life.</i>

387
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,000
It will be so hard for me to be away from you for two weeks.

388
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,480
<i>Well, I sure will feel that way. But, today, I am going to Tokyo</i>

389
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,230
<i>to participate in the dance workshop <br>I was supposed to go to last year.</i>

390
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,210
This time, you will work hard to become a dancing writer, right?

391
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,580
After I finish writing this, I'll be going.

392
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,650
Are you about to finish it?

393
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,680
It is getting to the best part of the story now.

394
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,280
The best part?

395
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,830
<i>The big guy took Chobiko to a place.</i>

396
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,130
<i>The place was...</i>

397
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,460
<i>Be careful.</i>

398
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,740
<i>Wow, this place brings back memories.</i>

399
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,700
<i>It seems as if it happened a long time ago.</i>

400
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,390
<i>Yeah.</i>

401
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,030
<i>It makes me remember the time when I became small.</i>

402
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,900
<i>Is that all you remember?</i>

403
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,980
<i>What?</i>

404
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,820
<i>It is not a well-made crown, but...</i>

405
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,140
<i>Chiyomi... I love you.</i>

406
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>I want you to stay with me forever.</i>

407
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,560
<i>Let's get married.</i>

408
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,450
<i>When she put her face on the big guy's chest,</i>

409
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,500
<i>She heard his heartbeat she used to listen to.</i>

410
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,500
<i>Chiyomi, look.</i>

411
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,980
<i>The two kept looking at the rainbow for a long time.</i>

412
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,100
<i>That was the same kind of rainbow<br> that they saw when they were kids.</i>

413
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:11,040
<i>That rainbow might have been our future.</i>

414
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:33,530
<i>Chobiko is not in a pocket anymore.</i>
