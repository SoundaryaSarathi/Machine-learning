1
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,621
Mizuki-sensei…

2
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,463
There’s another person…

3
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,139
Who…?

4
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,072
The Clow Cards…

5
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,160
Who are you?

6
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:15,907
[Sakura, Kero,
and the Mysterious Teacher]

7
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,066
The alarm’s over here.

8
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,671
Didn’t you put it
over on the desk yourself

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,979
so that you don’t fall back asleep?

10
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,778
Oh, that’s right!

11
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,255
Geez.

12
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,652
You’ve had this doll

13
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,959
since before you woke me,
haven’t you?

14
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,195
Yeah, about a week
before I first met you.

15
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,565
Tomoyo made it for me for my birthday

16
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,995
and having become a 4th-grader.

17
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,168
It’s me.

18
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,799
I see. It does look like you.

19
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,503
Tomoyo’s real good at sewing.

20
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,681
Why is the doll wearing clothes like that
even before I was awoken?

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,587
Even before I become
the Card Captor,

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,614
Tomoyo said

23
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,649
someday she’d

24
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,917
make costumes for me

25
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,490
to wear for sure.

26
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,288
And so, she first
started with a doll…

27
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,201
It looks like it…
It’s like what’s in the dream.

28
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,811
There was a huge moon…

29
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,474
A full moon.

30
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,414
The Clow Cards…

31
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,454
…and Mizuki-sensei were there…

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,631
And now, there was also
a person with wings.

33
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,233
Has pretty purple clothes

34
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,198
and silver hair…

35
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,642
The clothes I was wearing

36
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,106
look very much like this.

37
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,450
I gotta go.
I woke up early too!

38
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,107
Yue…

39
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,308
Good morning!
Good morning!

40
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,244
You woke up early as planned.

41
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,822
The rice is almost ready.
Thank you!

42
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,429
Good. They look very nice.
Really?

43
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,970
Tsukishiro-kun is competing in
Japanese archery today, right?

44
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,735
Yeah. He’s representing
his school, he said.

45
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,548
There’re even adults in the competition.
It’s a really big one, I heard.

46
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,582
He must be good.

47
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,783
He seems to help out with the basketball
team and the soccer team as well.

48
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,352
I promised Yukito-san

49
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,721
that I’m gonna make lunch for him.

50
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,229
Oh, by the way,
is Onii-chan still asleep?

51
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,796
He said he has part-time today as well.

52
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,300
He got up early and left already.

53
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,510
Oh well.

54
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,006
And I was going to make him lunch
for a surprise too.

55
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,850
Okay, now that the side dishes are done,
let’s add those in.

56
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:21,985
Okay!

57
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,797
It’s done!
Good job.

58
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,726
Tomoyo-chan… Li-kun… Yukito-san…

59
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,030
Yukito-san… Me…

60
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,144
Oh no, I made too much.

61
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,903
Even it is one more prepared,

62
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,407
I’m sure Tsukishiro-kun will eat them all.

63
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,850
But for you to carry all of them
by yourself…

64
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,682
Don’t worry.

65
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,622
They’re coming to help
carry the food together.

66
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,055
Coming!

67
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,665
– Good morning, Tomoyo-chan!
– Good morning!

68
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,364
I am glad the weather is so nice!

69
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,941
Li-kun too!

70
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,004
Thanks for coming by.

71
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,339
When it comes

72
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,942
to capturing Clow Cards,

73
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,182
it’s easier if you’re around.

74
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,315
You’re right.

75
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,720
The lunch was just done. Shall we go?

76
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,746
I’ll go to get them.

77
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,235
You made lunch for me too, right?

78
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,038
– I must come along.
– Ke… Kero-chan!

79
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,270
What’s wrong?

80
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,013
It’s nothing.

81
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,112
It’s not nothing…

82
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,026
Sorry about that, Li-kun.

83
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,592
I’ll carry it
after we get off the train.

84
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,264
– I’m okay.
– But…

85
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,127
Still not there yet?

86
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,029
No, Kero-chan,
you can’t stick your head out.

87
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,068
We are getting there soon…

88
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,607
Told you it’s better to just stay home,
right?

89
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,199
I can always make you lunch

90
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,704
If you want.

91
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,443
I’m coming with you not
just because there’s lunch.

92
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,784
I just want to stay near you if possible.

93
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,512
It’s all about to end…

94
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,124
End? Are you talking
about the Clow Cards?

95
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,797
So, I’m almost done

96
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,132
with gathering all the cards?

97
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,361
It is almost over, Sakura-chan!

98
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,685
What is wrong?

99
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,524
No… it’s nothing. Sorry.

100
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,238
Yue, it seems that
it’s almost time for us to meet.

101
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,674
Li-kun, really,
let me carry it!

102
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,417
I… I’m okay.

103
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,612
Oh, there we are!

104
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,672
There’s a archery field in such a place.

105
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,579
There are rituals that
involve drawing bows as well.

106
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,507
Yukito-san!

107
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,681
– Good morning!
– Good morning!

108
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,088
You guys came to cheer for me.

109
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,755
Yes! Umm… We brought lunch too!

110
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,126
He… Here it is!

111
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,889
You guys got up early for all this.

112
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,825
It must be tough.

113
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,166
No, not at all!

114
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:30,965
Thank you.

115
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,570
Oh, I gotta go. I’ll do my best.

116
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,107
We’ll cheer for you with all we have!

117
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,920
He looks wonderful dressed in that.

118
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,947
Yukito always looks so nice,
whatever he wears.

119
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,320
Don’t you think so, Li-kun?

120
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,367
I can sense the aura of the moon…

121
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,241
Tsukishiro-san won!

122
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,678
Yukito-san is wonderful!

123
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,855
What is the matter?

124
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,397
That is…

125
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,869
Mizuki-sensei…

126
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,146
Why is Sensei here?

127
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,976
But she is very skilled too!

128
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,201
Yeah…
Just as I thought, the aura of the moon…

129
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,750
Tsukishiro-san
has advanced to the final!

130
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,327
Yeah, but his opponent is…

131
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,773
Tsukishiro-kun…

132
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,274
My best regards.

133
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,202
Same here.

134
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,872
I don’t know who to cheer for.

135
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,077
Yukito-san, or Mizuki-sensei…

136
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,921
Neither of them
is giving away anything.

137
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,593
Whoever loses concentration
is going to lose.

138
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,560
Tsukishiro-san won!

139
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,102
She seemed to be
distracted by something,

140
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,765
and lost.

141
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,305
Congratulations.

142
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,439
Thank you very much.

143
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,878
– Congratulations!
– Co… Congratulations!

144
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,582
Thanks. But that was…

145
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,825
Oh well. I’m hungry!

146
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,965
– Do you mind if I start eating?
– Y… Yes!

147
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,903
– Let’s eat!
– Let’s eat!

148
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,931
This is good! Did you make all of this?

149
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,141
Father helped me.

150
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,771
This is really good!

151
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,389
Oh, where are the cups?

152
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,853
In my back pack.

153
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,359
Kero-chan’s gone!

154
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,765
– What’s wrong?
– It… It’s nothing…

155
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,871
Where did you go… Kero-chan…

156
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,087
Hello.

157
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,751
You did notice me after all.

158
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,063
This is the first time
I saw you in this shape.

159
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,964
Yeah, I guess last time was
when that brat and I exchanged bodies.

160
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,300
I couldn’t use any magic at all,

161
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,336
I couldn’t tell.

162
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,584
I sense a great power in you.

163
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,683
On top of that,
it’s the power of the moon.

164
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,185
You work with the power of the moon,
don’t you?

165
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,495
Created alongside
by Clow Reed as a pair,

166
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,733
The other guardian of the Clow Cards…

167
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:19,794
Yue,

168
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,001
Which means Moon in Chinese…

169
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,343
Kero-chan! Kero-chan, where are you?

170
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,313
– Did you say anything to Sakura?
– No.

171
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,584
About the Last Judgment…?

172
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,111
I know about it.
But I didn’t mention that to her either.

173
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,791
My task here is something else.

174
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,391
What’s your task?

175
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,990
You’ll find out, very soon.

176
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,663
Geez, where did Kero-chan go?

177
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,930
I believe
Sakura can accomplish anything.

178
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:56,840
Same here.

179
00:17:58,645 --> 00:17:59,907
Kero-chan!

180
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:03,871
Mizuki-sensei!

181
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,385
– What’s the matter with you?
– I thought

182
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,447
it’s better to talk in a quiet place.

183
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,055
Talk?

184
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,633
Kero-chan?!

185
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,443
That was such a surprise!

186
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,911
You were with Miss Mizuki.

187
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,144
That’s because you got out of the bag.

188
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,786
She noticed me earlier.

189
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,985
She is someone
with a great power after all.

190
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,783
And yet you feel schweeet or whatever

191
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,852
when you see her.

192
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,393
That’s because!

193
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,799
But… Not again.

194
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,722
So… Sorry!

195
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,331
Bear…

196
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,733
For me? Thanks!

197
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,510
Sakura-chan!

198
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:42,880
What are you doing?!

199
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,308
O… Onii-chan!!

200
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,656
You really do work part-time everywhere.

201
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,691
What a coincidence.

202
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,758
– For us to bump into each other.
– It really is!

203
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,760
Onii-chan?

204
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,302
There is no coincidence in this world.

205
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,037
There is only the inevitable.

206
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:19,952
See ya, Touya.

207
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,553
Work hard!

208
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,489
Let’s go before it gets too dark.

209
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:32,292
Oh wait, Sakura,
do you not have the lunch boxes?

210
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,063
Oh, now that you mention it…

211
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,130
You must have left
them somewhere back there.

212
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,004
I took them out when
we were eating lunch…

213
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,135
They must be around there somewhere.
Let’s go look for them.

214
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,406
Okay.

215
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,785
What Onii-chan said just now…
What did he mean by that…

216
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,081
And then what Miss Mizuki said…

217
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,853
Today’s last round,

218
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,653
did something distract you?

219
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,635
I just felt
like somebody was staring at me.

220
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,062
Staring at you?

221
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,801
– Tsukishiro-kun…
– Yes.

222
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,106
You…

223
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,342
Kero-chan, this aura…!

224
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,405
Yeah. A Clow Card.

225
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,778
On top of that,
it’s one that has very strong power.

226
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:35,490
Tomoyo-chan!

227
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,228
Are you okay?

228
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,497
It’s coming!

229
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,171
This is…!
