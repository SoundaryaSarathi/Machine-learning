<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>

Tear open the door to your heart...

But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,700
Lucky!

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm so lucky that I can go
shopping with you today, Kaji!

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,970
What the?! Isn't this the swimsuit section?
<i> </i>

25
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,340
What the?! Isn't this the swimsuit section?
<i>Please allow us to announce a call for a customer.</i>

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Hey! Hey! How do you like this?
<i>Please allow us to announce a call for a customer.</i>

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,640
Hey! Hey! How do you like this?
<i>Mr. Yamazaki, your friend is waiting for you.</i>

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,710
Easy, school girl. You're a little young for that.
<i>Mr. Yamazaki, your friend is waiting for you.</i>

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,180
You're just being an old fuddy-duddy, Kaji.
<i>Please come to Customer Service on the first floor.</i>

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,650
This is what's in fashion these days.
<i>Please come to Customer Service on the first floor.</i>

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,690
Oh, really?

33
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,060
I'm anxious about this school trip.
I just know we'll have a great time.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,360
And where are you going
for the trip?

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,630
Okinawa!

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,620
We're even scheduled to
go scuba diving!

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,790
Scuba diving...

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,530
It's been three years since
I've gone diving.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,470
Say, where did you go
for your school trip?

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,770
Well, we didn't have one.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
Why not?

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Because of the Second Impact.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Episode 10:
Magma Diver

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,850
I can't go on the trip?!

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,390
Right.

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,090
Why not?!
Right.

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,490
Why not?!
<i> </i>

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,830
Because you're on stand-by
for combat duty.

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,530
You never told me anything
about that!

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,600
I just told you.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,130
Who in the hell decided that?!

52
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,620
Me, the Operations Planning
Manager.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,540
Hey, why don't you stop slurping
that tea, and say something!

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,910
Be a man!

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,750
Actually, I kind of anticipated
it would be like this.

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,840
And you've already given up?

57
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,290
How pathetic. Nothing's more
useless than a housebroken male.

58
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,260
Please don't talk about
me like that.

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,090
I know how you must feel,

60
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,100
but there's no other way.

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,660
There's always the possibility of
an Angel attack while you're gone.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,070
It's always stand-by!
Stand-by, stand-by, stand-by!

63
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,610
We've always got to be ready to defend
against an enemy who may not even come!

64
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,870
Why don't you try to find out
where they are, and attack first?!

65
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,150
If we could do that, we'd
have already done it.

66
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,680
Look, think of this as an
opportunity to catch up.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,390
While the rest of your
class is on the trip,

68
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,660
the two of you can study.

69
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,020
Or do you think I don't
know about these?

70
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,330
If you thought you had to tell me
what your test scores were,

71
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,400
you made a big mistake. Finding
out what your grades are

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,770
is quite simple for me.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,040
It's ridiculous. This school's
grades are meaningless!

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,610
The old fashioned grading system
used here means nothing to me.

75
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,080
When in Rome, do as
the Romans do.

76
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,450
You could at least try to adjust
to Japanese school life.

77
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,880
No way!

78
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,250
Asuka, I'll bring you
some souvenirs!

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,930
Well, it's just too bad for you guys!

80
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,390
Don't feel bad, I'll have enough
fun for both of you!

81
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,100
<i>Post the survey data on Mt. Asama</i>

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,940
<i>from Balthasar to Melchior</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

83
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,280
A school trip?

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,680
That's pretty casual behavior
for times like these.

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,350
Well, it's because the times
are so hard

86
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,290
that they want to have a little
fun while they can.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
What are you up to?

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,370
Studying physics.

89
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,140
You're such an obedient
student, Mr. Big Shot.

90
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,730
Well, I'd have to anyway.

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,210
Ta da!

92
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,580
Since I can't go scuba diving in
Okinawa, I'm going to do it here!

93
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,210
Really?

94
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,450
What're you working on?

95
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,470
Let me see.

96
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,220
You can't solve an easy
problem like this?

97
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,960
There! Here you go!

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,860
It's so easy.

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,990
How can you solve a difficult
problem like this,

100
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,760
and not make good grades
on your tests?

101
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,970
Because I couldn't figure out
what the questions said.

102
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,240
You mean you couldn't read the
questions in Japanese?

103
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,210
Right, I haven't learned
all of the Kanji yet.

104
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,640
I didn't have to study it in college.

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,410
College?

106
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,500
Yeah, I graduated last year.

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,980
What does this one say?

108
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,480
It's about thermal expansion.

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,820
Thermal expansion?
That's kid stuff!

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,460
To put it simply,

111
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,830
things expand when they get hot,
and shrink when they get cold.

112
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,360
Well, it sounds easy
enough in theory.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,840
If I were to warm up my breasts,
do you think they'd grow bigger?

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,770
How would I know such things?!

115
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,530
You're such a boring little boy.

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,030
Watch this, Shinji!

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,800
Back roll entry!

118
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,350
This just isn't clear enough.

119
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,290
But the report from Mt. Asama
Earthquake Research indicates

120
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,950
that we should take a closer
look at this shadow.

121
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,020
Of course, we can't ignore this.

122
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,390
What's Magi's judgment?

123
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,560
Fifty-fifty.

124
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,730
Is someone there yet?

125
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,320
Captain Katsuragi's
already on site.

126
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,000
You've gone too deep.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,270
Not yet. Descend another
500, please.

128
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,340
<i>Depth 1200. The pressure</i>
<i>resistant partition is cracking.</i>

129
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,320
Ms. Katsuragi!

130
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,110
If it breaks, we'll pay for the
damage. 200 more, please.

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,060
We're monitoring a reaction!

132
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,430
Begin analysis!

133
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,890
Right!
Begin analysis!

134
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,920
Right!
<i> </i>

135
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,500
<i>The probe has imploded due</i>
<i>to the extreme pressure.</i>

136
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,140
Did you get a result?

137
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,540
Just barely. The pattern is blue.

138
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,780
Then there's no doubt.
It's an Angel.

139
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,380
From now on, this laboratory will
be completely sealed off.

140
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,520
It's under NERV's jurisdiction now!

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
Any and all access to the outside
world is prohibited.

142
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,120
All records of the events of the
past six hours are classified.

143
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,760
I need an A-17 from Commander
Ikari, top priority!

144
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,600
Watch what you're saying.
This is an open line.

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,670
I know. Switch to the
scrambled line.

146
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,440
A-17?!

147
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,040
An offensive attack?

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
Correct.

149
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,440
Unacceptable, it's too dangerous.

150
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,050
Have you forgotten what happened
fifteen years ago?

151
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,080
This is our chance

152
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,590
to move from a defensive posture
to an offensive one.

153
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,820
The risk is enormous.

154
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,560
However, I'm sure you're aware
how important it is

155
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,730
to obtain a living Angel as
a sample, aren't you?

156
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,820
We will not tolerate failure.

157
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,400
Failure?

158
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,300
If we fail, it will result in the
extinction of the human race.

159
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,470
Are you really going to do it?

160
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
This is an Angel?

161
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,880
Yes, it's something like a chrysalis
priorto reaching the adult stage.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,480
This operation's prime objective
is to capture this Angel.

163
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,020
We must capture it alive, as close
to its original state as possible.

164
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,260
And if we fail?

165
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,490
Then you must destroy it
immediately. Do you understand?

166
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,190
Roger!

167
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,990
Roger!
The designated pilot for the actual operation is...

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,030
Hey, let me! I dive!

170
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,930
<i>I know it's going to be me.</i>

171
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,830
Asuka!

172
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,470
You will carry out the mission
using Unit 02.

173
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,400
Sure! It'll be easy.

174
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,940
And me?

175
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,140
Unit 00 does not conform to the
special equipment we'll be using.

176
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,180
Rei and Unit 00 will remain at
headquarters on stand-by.

177
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,150
Yes.

178
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,680
Oh, too bad.
Yes.

179
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh, too bad.
<i> </i>

180
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
You don't get to go to
the hot springs.

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,190
Now an A-17 has been ordered,
we must scramble immediately.

182
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,120
Get ready.

183
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,690
Roger!
Get ready.

184
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,620
Roger!
<i> </i>

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,220
This heat resistant plug suit
doesn't seem any different.

186
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,630
Press the switch on
your right wrist.

187
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,570
Oh, no!

188
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,070
What is this?

189
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,570
Unit 02 is also ready.

190
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,180
No! What is this?

191
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,950
The suit is designed to protect you
from heat, pressure and radiation.

192
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,110
This is Type-D equipment, for combat
under extreme environmental duress.

193
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,280
Is that my Unit 02?

194
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,960
No way! I quit!

195
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,560
I don't want to appear in public
in this dorky outfit!

196
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,130
This is the sort of
thing Shinji's for!

197
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm so disappointed.

198
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,940
I was anticipating seeing
Asuka's gallant figure!

199
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,430
No!

200
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,180
Really, I can't let Kaji see me
in this awful looking thing.

201
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,410
We're having problems?

202
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,680
Well, yes.
We're having problems?

203
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,910
Well, yes.
<i> </i>

204
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,420
Excuse me, but I can...

205
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,110
I'll go in Unit 02.

206
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,150
No, I don't want you
touching my Unit 02!

207
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,260
I'd rather do it than let
her take my place.

208
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm sorry about the look.
Please, forgive me.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,300
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

210
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,510
Eva Units 01 and 02 have arrived.

211
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,320
Have both units stand-by
in position.

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Move in the laser bore,
and ready the crane.

213
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,610
Roger.

214
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,890
Hey, isn't Kaji here yet?

215
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,690
That male buffoon won't be here.
It's not any of his business.

216
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,790
Damn! I wanted him to
see how great I am.

217
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,400
An A-17 has been ordered.

218
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,310
That includes the freeze
of all current assets.

219
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,480
I assume that means some people
will be getting into a bit of trouble.

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,240
Why didn't you stop them?

221
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,180
I had no excuse for stopping it.
This order is an official one.

222
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,020
Surely you must know that if NERV
fails, the whole world will perish.

223
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,540
They're not that arrogant.

224
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,460
What are those?

225
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,160
The U.N. and the Air Force
will be on stand-by alert...

226
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
...until this mission has
been completed.

227
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,770
Will they help us?

228
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,830
No, they're here to clean up...

229
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,560
...in case we fail.

230
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,770
What do you mean?

231
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,570
They will use N2 depth charges to
destroy the Angel, and us with it.

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,340
That's dreadful!

233
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,880
Who would order
something like that?

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,370
Commander Ikari.

235
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,520
<i>Laser operation, complete.</i>

236
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
<i>The bore path has been secured.</i>

237
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,710
<i>The Type D equipment is</i>
<i>functioning normally.</i>

238
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,220
<i>Unit 02 is in position to dispatch.</i>

239
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,000
Roger.

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,830
Asuka, are you ready?

241
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,400
Anytime you are.

242
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,890
Launch!

243
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,700
It looks hot!

244
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,180
Unit 02 is entering the lava.

245
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,280
Watch this, Shinji!

246
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,590
Giant Stroke Entry!

247
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,030
<i>Current depth: 170.</i>
<i>Speed of descent: 20.</i>

248
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,500
<i>No problems detected.</i>

249
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
Visibility is zero. I can't
see a thing.

250
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,740
Switching to CT monitor.

251
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,840
Even with this, the range of
clarity is no more than 120.

252
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,080
Depth is 400...

253
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,150
450...

254
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,520
500...

255
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,250
550...

256
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,460
600...

257
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,620
650...

258
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,060
<i>900...</i>

259
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,900
<i>950...</i>

260
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,070
<i>1000...</i>

261
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,370
<i>1020...</i>

262
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,170
<i>We're over the maximum</i>
<i>safety depth.</i>

263
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,610
Depth is 1300. Unit 02 has reached
estimated target level.

264
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,440
Asuka? Can you see anything?

265
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,350
<i>No reactions detected.</i>
<i>It's not here.</i>

266
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,850
The lava circulation is faster
than we thought.

267
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,720
The target's velocity doesn't
match our predictions.

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
Hurry up and re-calculate.

269
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
Continue the operation.
Maintain descent.

270
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,860
<i>Depth is 1350.</i>

271
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,350
<i>1400...</i>

272
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,640
<i>A crack has occurred in the</i>
<i>second coolant pipe.</i>

273
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,970
<i>Depth is 1480.</i>

274
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,110
We're over the maximum
allowed depth.

275
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,840
It hasn't contacted the target yet?

276
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
Go on.

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,110
<i>How's it going, Asuka?</i>

278
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm okay. I just want to finish this
and take a shower, ASAP.

279
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,650
<i>There's a nice hot springs near</i>
<i>here. We'll hit it once we're done.</i>

280
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,080
<i>Just hang in there just</i>
<i>a little longer.</i>

281
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,680
<i>Maximum allowed depth plus 120.</i>

282
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,560
<i>Eva Unit 02 has lost its</i>
<i>progressive knife.</i>

283
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,730
<i>Maximum allowed depth plus 200.</i>

284
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,070
Captain Katsuragi,
we've got to stop!

285
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,570
Have you forgotten that there's a
human being in there?

286
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,240
I am in charge of this operation.

287
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,730
Proceed, please.

288
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,970
Misato's right. I'm okay.
I can go on.

289
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,750
Depth 1780.

290
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,720
Unit 02 has reached the
corrected target depth.

291
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,950
There it is!

292
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,970
Target in sight.

293
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,460
Prepare to capture.

294
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,870
Due to the motion of the currents
moving you and the target,

295
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,610
you'll have just one chance
to make contact.

296
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,740
I know. Just leave it to me.

297
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,010
<i>30 to contact.</i>

298
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,950
<i>Relative velocity 2.2 on the axis.</i>

299
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>Electromagnetic cage spread.</i>
<i>No problems detected.</i>

300
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,150
<i>The target has been captured.</i>

301
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,420
Nice, Asuka.

302
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,570
Operation completed.

303
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,030
I'm coming up now.

304
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,970
<i>Are you all right, Asuka?</i>

305
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,640
Who do you think you're asking?
Fear is worse than danger itself.

306
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,170
<i>It was an easy assignment.</i>

307
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,680
But this isn't a plug suit.
It's a sauna suit!

308
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,180
I want to take a bath.

309
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,660
The tension let loose all at once.

310
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,530
Yeah?
<i> </i>

311
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,160
Yeah?
You were scared about this operation, weren't you?

312
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,830
You were scared about this operation, weren't you?

313
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,770
Yes, if it'd gone wrong, there
might have been another disaster.

314
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,130
Right, Second Impact.

315
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,070
Nobody would want to
repeat that again.

316
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
What's going on?!

317
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,650
Oh no! It's started to hatch!

318
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,140
It's much earlier than
we predicted!

319
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,380
Status of the cage?!

320
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,710
There's no way it can
withstand this!

321
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,590
Abort the capture!
Jettison the cage!

322
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,090
We're changing the operation!

323
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,260
Destroying the Angel
is now top priority!

324
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,370
Unit 02, withdraw, and
prepare for combat!

325
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,860
This is what I've waited for!

326
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,770
Damn, I forgot I dropped the knife!

327
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,230
It's right in front of me!

328
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,400
Releasing ballast!

329
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,210
It's fast!

330
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,990
This is no good. I've lost it.

331
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,930
In addition to that, I've got lousy
visibility, I'm too hot,

332
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,230
and this disgusting suit's stuck
to my body with sweat.

333
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,830
This really sucks.

334
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,430
<i>Asuka!</i>

335
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,040
We'll drop you Unit 01's knife.
Catch it!

336
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,530
Roger!

337
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,470
Oh, no! Have you
dropped it, Shinji?

338
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,150
<i>Contact with knife, 40 seconds.</i>

339
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,880
<i>The Angel is approaching rapidly!</i>

340
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,580
No! Go away!

341
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,150
Hurry up with it!

342
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,090
Come on!

343
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,020
What the hell?!

344
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,710
Unbelievable! How could it open
its mouth in such an environment?

345
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,370
Its construction must
be incredible!

346
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,850
The left leg is damaged!

347
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,340
The heat shields!

348
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,750
Damn you!

349
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,090
If it can withstand such a high
heat, high pressure environment,

350
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,530
then the progressive knife will
be useless against it!

351
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,960
Then what's the solution?

352
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,190
I know! Like the one earlier!

353
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,860
Eat this!

354
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,910
I understand! Thermal expansion!

355
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,430
Transfer all coolant pressure
to cable three! Hurry!

356
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,100
I've done it, but...

357
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,900
Is this the end? Looks
like that's that.

358
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,910
Shinji?

359
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,890
Idiot! What a show off!

360
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,840
Hello?

361
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,570
Are the NERV personnel here?

362
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,060
Yes!

363
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,870
I need your signature here.

364
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,450
Thanks so much.

365
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,850
From Kaji?

366
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,840
What is this?

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,750
The bath is over there, to the left.

368
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,200
<i>Bath - Men</i>

369
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,760
This feels like heaven.

370
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,270
<i>I never thought a bath</i>
<i>could feel this good.</i>

371
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,480
Shinji, can you hear me?

372
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,050
Yes, Ma'am!

373
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,150
Would you throw me the
body shampoo?

374
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,410
We ran out of ours.

375
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,890
Here it comes.

376
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,550
Roger.
Here it comes.

377
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,380
Roger.
<i> </i>

378
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,790
Ouch!

379
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,430
You idiot! You dork, watch
where you're throwing!

380
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,030
Sorry.

381
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,600
He hit me in my most
essential part!

382
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,090
Let me take a look.

383
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,030
Wow, your skin is so soft
and smooth, Asuka!

384
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,140
Don't! You're tickling me!

385
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,630
How about right here?

386
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,240
Don't touch that!

387
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,270
Come on, what gives?

388
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,390
It expanded.

389
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,790
How embarrassing!

390
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,920
Oh, this? I got this in
the Second Impact.

391
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,070
You know all about my
past, don't you?

392
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,770
Well, yeah. It's a part of my job.

393
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,610
It's all ancient history now.

394
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,170
We should just forget.

395
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>To be continued...</i>

396
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Preview

397
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
When Tokyo-3's power
supply is cut off,

398
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,800
an Angel arrives at NERV HQ to
find it completely locked up.

399
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,300
Can the kids make it to headquarters
in time to intercept the Angel?

400
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,600
Next episode:
"In the Still Darkness"

401
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
You can expect more fanservice!
