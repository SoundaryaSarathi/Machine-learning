1
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:21,413
Both of you, fasten your seat belts.
There'll be quite a jolt when we touch down.

2
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:22,573
Oh, right.

3
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:26,578
Commence landing in a suitable location.

4
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,370
We did it! We've landed on Planet Namek!

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,371
Amazing!

6
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:51,042
What kind of place is it?
We can't see much through this mist.

7
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,377
Are you sure this is it?

8
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:53,712
No mistake about it.

9
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:54,713
But...

10
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:58,383
I rebuilt this spaceship!
Are you trying to put it down!?

11
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,051
No, it's not that...

12
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,553
Then what <i>is</i> it?

13
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:04,389
We should be able to tell right away
by looking at the Dragon Radar.

14
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,390
Y- yeah, yeah, right!

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,382
Good grief, you're so skeptical...

16
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,694
K- Kami-?

17
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:44,529
You're finally awake, are you?

18
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,197
--Who are you?
--Lychee.

19
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:49,367
The biggest quack doctor on the planet.

20
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:55,040
And this loudmouth is Zarkuro. He's been
bad company for me for 300 years now.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,042
T- three hundred years!?

22
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,873
Nice to meet you.

23
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,714
That's how we say
hello on this world.

24
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:06,051
Nice to meet you. I'm Bulma.

25
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:10,555
You know, you're lucky that I
was the one who discovered you.

26
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,891
If it weren't for me
taking the proper measures,

27
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,894
all three of you would have croaked.

28
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,729
Thank you.

29
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,223
Come on, now, how long are you going
to sleep? Both of you, hurry and wake up.

30
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,559
Come on.

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,742
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:32,403
Nice to meet you.

33
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:37,015
Um, this is Planet Namek, right?

34
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,017
Yes, it is.

35
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:43,021
We can tell just by looking at your faces.
You look just like Kami-<i>sama</i>.

36
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,691
That's right. You look
just like Piccolo-<i>san</i>, too.

37
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,354
I sure hope you find them
okay- the Dragon Balls.

38
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,187
H- how did you-?

39
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:22,557
We know everything
there is to know about you.

40
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,564
Well, you are Kami-<i>sama</i>'s
relatives, after all.

41
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:29,067
I guess there's no reason
why you wouldn't.

42
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:33,731
You needn't worry.
We won't stand in your way.

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,009
Oh, right, where's our spaceship?

44
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,412
Oh, we put it in the storeroom in back.

45
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,354
Here it is.

46
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,037
It's pretty damaged,
but still okay, right?

47
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
Probably.

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,042
Thank you for everything.

49
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,710
Don't mention it.

50
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:18,046
You really are kind-hearted people
for doing all this, aren't you?

51
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,394
--Look! They're here!
--All right!

52
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:35,667
There, look, look!

53
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,337
See? There are three of them
grouped together near here!

54
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:41,673
How lucky for us!

55
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,074
Let's hurry and go look for them.

56
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,677
With any luck, we can get
three of them today.

57
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,167
All right, let's go!

58
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,358
Okay, let's go!

59
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:01,693
Right.

60
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:04,028
That thing won't do you any good.

61
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:07,699
This area is a dangerous one,
and teeming with monsters.

62
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,864
If you go out in that toy-like thing,
you'll get yourself stomped on easily.

63
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,369
Monsters?

64
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,711
Bulma-<i>san</i>...

65
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:28,887
All right, what choice do I have
but to let you use my goku?

66
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,377
Goku?

67
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:54,839
What do you think? My dear
little goku is pretty fast, huh?

68
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,174
Yeah...

69
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,357
There it is! It's around here!
Could you land around here?

70
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:10,521
A- all right.
Goku, here! Land!

71
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,521
Oh, no!

72
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:32,376
With a spaceship like this one...

73
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,661
Was it down there?

74
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,330
No, it wasn't.

75
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,891
Search carefully.
It has to be around here.

76
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,677
Sorry to have to make you
do this, as well.

77
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:03,348
That's okay, this is
staving off boredom.

78
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:04,248
It's a big help.

79
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:08,920
After all, right now, Earth could be facing
a great crisis at any moment, and...

80
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,089
Oh, you know all about it, huh?

81
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,420
Yes.

82
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:19,758
It's definitely down there
somewhere, no doubt about it.

83
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,391
Did you find it?

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,336
We couldn't hold our breaths any longer.

85
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,339
This is going to be really hard.

86
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,343
Still, there's no mistake
that it's around here someplace.

87
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,743
Huh? Where's Lychee-<i>san</i>?

88
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,436
Here it is!

89
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,940
Here it is!

90
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:41,011
Lucky!

91
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,408
R- really?

92
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,764
He's completely
regained consciousness.

93
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,712
<i>K</i>- <i>Kakarrot...</i>

94
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,058
<i>Why? Why, when my battle power</i>
<i>is far and away higher than his,</i>

95
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:05,051
<i>did I take that attack dead-on?</i>

96
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,063
What!?

97
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,747
What did you do that for
out of nowhere!?

98
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,081
Ee-yow!

99
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,753
Patients should act like patients,
and lie there quietly, you know!

100
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,424
I'm just so bored, so bored!
I can't wait to go cut loose!

101
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,027
Patients shouldn't
be talkin' nonsense.

102
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:41,032
Goku-<i>sa</i>, until your body is doin'
better, you're to behave yourself.

103
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:42,366
Is that for me?

104
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:45,703
This? If you can put it on,
you can wear it.

105
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:47,864
I guess not, then.

106
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,717
These ancient ruins are from
four or five-thousand years ago.

107
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:02,386
Wow, 5,000 years?

108
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:07,380
Look here, the Dragon Ball
is within a 5-meter radius of us.

109
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,728
Bulma-<i>san</i>, over there.

110
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,059
Find it?

111
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:15,892
There are stairs over here.

112
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:20,404
The Radar's readings are getting stronger.

113
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,736
It must be in here.

114
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,744
All right, let's go.

115
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:28,234
Bulma-<i>san</i>, wait!

116
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,750
Wow, these are ancient Namekians.

117
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:46,364
Their faces are completely different
from the way they look now, aren't they?

118
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:49,356
Yeah, it would seem so...

119
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,711
W- what are these?

120
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,544
I wonder if there's treasure in them.

121
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,377
It's right close by.

122
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,389
In here.

123
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:12,378
T- that's-!

124
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,731
Ulp... Is that-?

125
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,573
Okay, let's find one more
before the day is over!

126
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,350
You're sure a chipper old man, huh?

127
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,021
He's a nice fellow, isn't he?
Doing this for complete strangers like us.

128
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,358
That's what's so fishy about it.
We should be careful.

129
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:49,694
It's possible that once
we get all seven together,

130
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:51,362
he might be planning
to swipe them from us.

131
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,023
He couldn't be.

132
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,046
It's in this area.
Could you set us down soon?

133
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,037
Yes, yes!

134
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:41,345
Huh?

135
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,014
What's the matter?

136
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,676
The Dragon Ball is moving.

137
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,369
A- are you all right?

138
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:07,701
I'm fine, but the Radar-

139
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,544
C- could you hand that over?

140
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:27,058
Hey! Hold it!

141
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,218
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

142
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,668
Hey! Hold it!

143
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,398
Telling him that isn't going
to get through to him!

144
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,343
Wait!

145
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,678
What are you doing!?

146
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,515
Y- you can't go any farther!

147
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,685
We have to hurry, or he'll
get away, you know!

148
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,688
Why are you stopping me!? Let me go!

149
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,680
If you go any farther,
your life will be in danger.

150
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
He's gone.

151
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:13,704
Listen, you're not planning to swipe
the Dragon Balls from us, are you!?

152
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,041
I- I wouldn't do that.

153
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:22,536
You're acting funny. You're being far
too nice to perfect strangers like us.

154
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,992
That's his voice.
Something has happened to him.

155
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,222
Let's go have a look.

156
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:02,349
I'm sure it was around here...

157
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,692
Whoa! That's that thing from earlier!

158
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:13,697
The water in these swamps is dreadful
stuff that will dissolve any living thing,

159
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:18,369
and the gasses that rise from it will take
out any ordinary person who breathes them.

160
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:21,372
Is that so? So that's why
you stopped us, huh?

161
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,374
I'm sorry for saying
something so terrible.

162
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:26,043
Just so long as you know, it's all right.

163
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,045
Thank goodness.

164
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,880
Still, we're in a jam.

165
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,653
If he's ended up like that, that means
the Dragon Ball is in the swamp, right?

166
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:39,323
How are we going to
get it out of there?

167
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:40,991
Oh, that would be impossible.

168
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:41,992
Under any circumstances?

169
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:45,563
Well, I do have a bodysuit for that
sort of thing, but even if you

170
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:48,666
were to wear it to dive down there,
it would only be good for ten seconds.

171
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:52,227
Any longer than that,
and the suit will dissolve.

172
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,674
I'll do it.

173
00:16:56,674 --> 00:17:00,344
After all, we can't do anything
unless we have that Dragon Ball, right?

174
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,346
That may be so, but...

175
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,248
I just need to come back up
within ten seconds, right?

176
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:07,918
I'll give it a try.
Please let me do it.

177
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:11,088
I know. What if we tied
a special rope around his body,

178
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,358
to pull him up before
ten seconds is up?

179
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,360
Mm-hmm, that sounds good.

180
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,760
All right, let's give it a try.

181
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,979
Judging from the readings on the Radar,
it's right underneath us. Good luck.

182
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,648
We'll pull you up with the rope
after seven seconds, okay?

183
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:38,615
Okay.

184
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:50,719
2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

185
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:53,894
Now!

186
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:02,735
Oh, no! The swamp water
is stronger than I figured...

187
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,741
--Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
--Gohan!

188
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:13,017
<i>All right, great.</i>
<i>Now to hurry up on the rope.</i>

189
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,252
<i>The rope!</i>

190
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:17,243
<i>l have to act fast,</i>
<i>or I won't make it!</i>

191
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,093
<i>lt's no good! I won't last until</i>
<i>l make it to the top like this!</i>

192
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,766
<i>lt's no good!</i>

193
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,273
<i>Masenko!!</i>

194
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,610
Gohan-<i>chan</i>...

195
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:51,877
Gohan!

196
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,062
I'm back.

197
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,396
He made it!

198
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,065
He made it!

199
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,400
He made it, all right...

200
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,739
<i>Bulma and the others were ecstatic</i>
<i>over already obtaining three of the Balls.</i>

201
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:15,076
<i>Now then, will they be able to get</i>
<i>all of the Dragon Balls without any trouble?</i>
