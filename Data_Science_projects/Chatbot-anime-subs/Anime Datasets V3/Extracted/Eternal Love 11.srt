<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,278
Your Highness.

4
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:29,032
- Is Fifth Sister here?
- Aunt?

5
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,239
Didn't she say she was going to
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods?

6
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,438
You didn't see her?

7
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,998
She was there last night

8
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:38,526
but I haven't seen her
since I woke at daybreak.

9
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,998
Has she returned?

10
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,278
She has not.

11
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:43,639
However, Zhe Yan is here.

12
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,479
- Zhe Yan?
- Yes.

13
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,838
He is back from the Celestial Palace?

14
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,118
Yes, I am back.

15
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,199
What brings you by Bai Qian's Fox Den?

16
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,865
Why are you here?

17
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:00,612
I just returned from
the Celestial Palace.

18
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,598
That's right.

19
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,639
I've been focused on where
Fifth Sister might be

20
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,079
and I've forgotten you went to
Celestial Palace to cancel the marriage.

21
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,718
Come.

22
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,038
Let me tell you about
her marriage arrangement.

23
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,653
Has it been canceled?

24
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,332
The marriage to
second prince Sang Ji is canceled

25
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:18,280
but the marriage arrangement with
the Celestial Tribe is still in place.

26
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,318
What do you mean?

27
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,679
Let me tell you all about it.

28
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:56,278
Dijun?

29
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,199
Did it ring?

30
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,799
Why are you here?

31
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,438
I followed my aunt here.

32
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:05,639
Aunt?

33
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,718
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu,
who never appears in public?

34
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,639
Yes, my aunt is Bai Qian.

35
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,639
I remember last night...

36
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,055
I'm not sure if
it was last night anymore.

37
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:23,918
Before I fell asleep, I saw my aunt
leaving Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods

38
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,238
so I followed her all the way here.

39
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,678
Could it be... your aunt is
somehow tied to Kunlun Mountain?

40
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,999
No, I've never heard her mention it.

41
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,678
Did your aunt leave you this?

42
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,759
Yes, my aunt left it.

43
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,199
Do you know what is written in this?

44
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,468
My aunt said a magic technique
is recorded there.

45
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,079
That's correct.

46
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,999
The technique to seal a spirit within the
Bell of the East Emperor is written here.

47
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,894
The Bell of the East Emperor?

48
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,478
Isn't that the magical weapon
that can destroy heaven and earth?

49
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,119
That is correct.

50
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,083
Isn't that the artifact that

51
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:20,158
caused Mo Yuan's soul to be scattered
70,000 years ago at Ruoshui Riverbank?

52
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,678
That is correct.

53
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,199
Mo Yuan used this very technique
to seal away Qing Cang.

54
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,639
It seems your aunt does indeed
have many ties to Kunlun Mountain.

55
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,238
How is that possible? My aunt has never
left Qing Qiu since she was born.

56
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,639
Is that true?

57
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,278
It is true.

58
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,519
You are my savior.
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

59
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,439
Where are you going?

60
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:31,238
The color of your outfit is strange,
but it looks quite nice.

61
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,639
Where did you buy it?

62
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,519
Qing... Qing Qiu.

63
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,245
<i>A-Yin.</i>

64
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,598
<i>I like you.</i>

65
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,959
Since you've tacitly consented,
why must you act so shy?

66
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,918
When did I tacitly consent?

67
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,918
<i>Li Jing.</i>

68
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,319
If you wake up,
I'll give you my promise.

69
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,759
Once you promise me,
you can't go back on your word.

70
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,238
<i>In this lifetime, I, Li Jing</i>

71
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,079
will only be with A-Yin.

72
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,519
If I break this oath

73
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,999
I shall have no posterity
and live a life of loneliness.

74
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,918
<i>Back then, you said</i>

75
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,119
<i>you would be with me
regardless of what happens.</i>

76
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,678
<i>Now you say you were foolish.</i>

77
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:34,079
Very well.

78
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,918
I'll let you two be.

79
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,238
How long are you going to
keep following me?

80
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,798
I... I said I was going to
repay your kindness.

81
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,798
Did I want you to?

82
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:34,927
Zhe Yan says a debt must be repaid.

83
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,879
If I don't repay it here

84
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,278
then I'll have to repay it elsewhere.

85
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,158
So, I've thought about it carefully

86
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,678
and I think I should be proactive
about repaying this debt.

87
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:47,038
This way, I'd able to
choose how I repay you.

88
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,399
Then...

89
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
how do you plan on repaying me?

90
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,278
I... I haven't decided yet.

91
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,798
Ever since Mo Yuan left,
Kunlun Mountain hasn't been this lively.

92
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,043
Dong Hua Dijun.

93
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:15,239
What are you doing at Kunlun Mountain?

94
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,599
I was just passing by
and came in to take a look.

95
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:25,158
The place is now deserted and no longer
as magnificent as it was back then.

96
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,318
Apologies for intruding.

97
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,119
<i>A-Yin.</i>

98
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,999
<i>It has been 70,000 years.
Where have you gone?</i>

99
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,759
Dijun.

100
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,759
I came upon this just now
and finally understand.

101
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,359
The Bell of the East Emperor's seal
is not permanent.

102
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,438
This must be reported immediately
to Heavenly Lord to make a plan.

103
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:31,759
When will the seal be lifted?

104
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,558
It happens today.

105
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:36,078
Today?

106
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,399
The sealing spell lifts
after 70,000 years.

107
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,078
70,000 years? Then...

108
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,678
A lady appeared at
Ruoshui Riverbank today.

109
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,212
She must have known the sealing spell
was about to be lifted

110
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,038
and was there to seal Qing Cang.

111
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,958
70,000 years.

112
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,918
Not even you knew
the sealing spell would be lifted.

113
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:58,438
Who else in this world
could predict this?

114
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:03,399
It was not a prediction. Instead...

115
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,918
This lady already knew of this fact,
but did not tell anybody.

116
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:13,239
I'm afraid she had already planned
to fight Qing Cang alone

117
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,239
and not involve anybody else.

118
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,359
The more I hear from you

119
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,599
the more I admire this lady.

120
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,719
Dijun, who might this lady be?

121
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,418
It is most likely...

122
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,479
This young princess's aunt.

123
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,038
My aunt?

124
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,879
I have yet to ask. This is...

125
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:51,678
I am Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.

126
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,158
Granddaughter of the Fox King.

127
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,678
- Princess Feng Jiu.
- That is me.

128
00:11:56,678 --> 00:12:00,759
Then your aunt is Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

129
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,158
That's right, my aunt is Bai Qian.

130
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:06,999
Then isn't she the Crown Prince's
Crown Princess Consort?

131
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,438
What Crown Princess Consort?

132
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,678
Isn't my aunt marrying the second prince?

133
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,438
Why has it turned into
the crown prince?

134
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,599
It is a long story.

135
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,999
- Then make it a long story short.
- All right.

136
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,719
Then we'll have to start from
that little snake from your aunt's den.

137
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,918
Little snake? Do you mean Shao Xing?

138
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,678
Yes, Shao Xing.

139
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:32,519
Shao Xing--

140
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:40,239
Why do you guess that
it is Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

141
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,558
The scroll you're holding

142
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,399
is what Bai Qian left for
the princess last night.

143
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,078
The Bell of the East Emperor's
sealing method is written in detail.

144
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,759
Don't you find it
too much of a coincidence?

145
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,198
It is too much of a coincidence.

146
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,999
However, I have one question.

147
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:06,879
It's said Bai Qian has never stepped foot
outside of Qing Qiu after she was born.

148
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,999
How did she come to know about
Mo Yuan's special sealing technique?

149
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,119
That is also what puzzles me.

150
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:17,678
Moreover, this kind of special technique
is passed down from master to disciple.

151
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:21,558
Mo Yuan never accepted
a female disciple.

152
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,519
Your Highness.

153
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
Do you know something we don't?

154
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,879
My aunt has no relation
to Kunlun Mountain.

155
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,399
Then that's strange.

156
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:38,719
I'm afraid this question
will only be answered

157
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,743
when Mo Yuan comes back from the dead.

158
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:43,558
Or...

159
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:50,399
When Ye Hua marries Bai Qian,
you can ask her yourself.

160
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,759
You must be joking, Dijun.

161
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,958
Miss Bai Qian of Qing Qiu
has such a high rank.

162
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,278
I do not dare speak carelessly.

163
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,759
Star Lord, you've piqued my interest
in hearing a story.

164
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,798
You'll have to explain everything.

165
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:13,918
After that, you have to help me
repay Dijun's kindness.

166
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,158
Repay his kindness?

167
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:17,719
That's correct.

168
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,678
Quick, tell me.

169
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,599
Why is my aunt marrying the crown prince?

170
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:25,318
And you were talking about my aunt
sealing the Bell of the East Emperor.

171
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,038
Everything is so confusing.

172
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,519
Can you explain everything to me?

173
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,798
Let's go.

174
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,918
Let's talk while we go.

175
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:37,999
Where do you want to start?

176
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,438
Start from the snake then.

177
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,438
All right.

178
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:44,558
I was only gone for a few days.

179
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:48,302
That snake made my aunt into
the world's laughingstock?

180
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,438
No, even if Zhe Yan
and Grandfather can tolerate it

181
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,879
I cannot!

182
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,158
So what if you cannot?
Your aunt doesn't even care.

183
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,438
She can tolerate it
because she is magnanimous.

184
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,918
I cannot tolerate it.

185
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,558
Why don't you take me to
the Celestial Palace?

186
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,479
What? I have to teach
that snake a lesson.

187
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:12,078
Then wouldn't I be committing
the crime of aiding and abetting?

188
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:32,318
You ruined your life's prospects
for this woman.

189
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,038
Do you harbor any resentment?

190
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,678
I dare not.

191
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,158
You can take this snake with you,
but you are not to give her any title.

192
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,198
That is the most I can tolerate.

193
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,438
I accept your command.

194
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,359
Shao Xing, stop right there.

195
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,719
My aunt has treated you well.

196
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:15,078
Yet you dare steal her future husband,
causing her to be ridiculed by the world?

197
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,318
Princess.

198
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,438
Do you still acknowledge me
as the princess?

199
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,719
It is all my fault.

200
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,318
Please do not be angry, Your Highness.

201
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:31,318
Be mindful of your health.

202
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,669
You were always good at
pretending to be delicate.

203
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,198
Impudence! Where did
this feral girl come from?

204
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,278
You dare behave atrociously
in the Celestial Palace?

205
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,198
You dare stand in my way? You--

206
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,078
You are that heartless man.

207
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,239
The Celestial Palace's
second prince, Sang Ji.

208
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,958
No, you've been demoted.
You are no longer the second prince.

209
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,970
You are Water King of the North Sea.

210
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,359
Your rank is lower than mine. What right
do you have to stand in my way?

211
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,719
Shut up!

212
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,318
Water King of the North Sea.

213
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,558
Please calm down,
Water King of the North Sea.

214
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,598
Princess, please calm down as well.

215
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,759
Since the Heavenly Lord
has made his ruling

216
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,078
then you two should try to
maintain some harmony.

217
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,838
Out of respect for Star Lord Si Ming,
I'll let you off this time.

218
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,038
I am a princess of Qing Qiu.
I don't need your pardon.

219
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,759
You were unfaithful to Qing Qiu first.

220
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,154
- You can't even take a lecture from me?
- You--

221
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,439
Feng Jiu.

222
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,878
Dijun.

223
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,038
How... How come you're here?

224
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,398
If I didn't come

225
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,623
was I to let you have a confrontation
with Water King of the North Sea?

226
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,598
I am just standing up for my aunt.

227
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:02,358
This is the young princess of Qing Qiu.
She has been spoiled by the Fox King.

228
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,519
Please do not take it
to heart, Water King.

229
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,959
I don't dare.

230
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:11,558
This lady...

231
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,919
Have you always been serving
by the side of Bai Qian of Qing Qiu?

232
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,999
Yes.

233
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,439
Then...

234
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,038
Have you ever heard of Si Yin?

235
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,038
<i>Oh no, is Dijun investigating
Mo Yuan's whereabouts?</i>

236
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,638
<i>Then will Shao Xing...</i>

237
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:32,358
I do not know.

238
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,999
<i>At least she has some conscience left.</i>

239
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,199
Do you know who I am?

240
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,959
I do not.

241
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,519
I am Dong Hua Dijun.

242
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,919
If you lie to me,
nobody would be able to save you.

243
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,558
<i>Dijun, you're a bully!</i>

244
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,598
I...

245
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,519
truly have never heard of Si Yin.

246
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:13,598
<i>Hold it together.</i>

247
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,318
Dijun, do not pressure her.

248
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:20,118
She stays in Qing Qiu all year round.

249
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,759
How could she possibly know Si Yin of
Kunlun Mountain from 70,000 years ago?

250
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,679
That is true.

251
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,439
- Dijun.
- Dijun.

252
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,519
Taichen Palace?

253
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,038
Outrageous! You dare
trespass into Taichen Palace?

254
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,959
<i>So there is still a place in this world
that I, Bai Feng Jiu, cannot enter.</i>

255
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,838
<i>How unexpected that
there would still be a human</i>

256
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,222
<i>who would dare come to
Mount Junji of the Far East.</i>

257
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:09,558
<i>The Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?</i>

258
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,838
70,000 years ago... 70,000 years ago...

259
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,598
I will bury you all with the dead!

260
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,598
Impossible.

261
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:40,919
That was clearly a mortal in that hut.

262
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,598
And it was a woman.

263
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:46,439
But why would she have
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

264
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:50,919
Scarlet Flame Golden Lion.

265
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,159
Who are you?

266
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,959
Crown Prince of
the Celestial Tribe, Ye Hua.

267
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,759
Why is there red lightning
on this mountain?

268
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:24,999
Run!

269
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,598
Quick, run!

270
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,798
Run!

271
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,558
There's a monster!

272
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,919
Run!

273
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,439
I have been hiding from
the Celestial Tribe for 70,000 years.

274
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,598
Why must you be so ruthless?

275
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:15,078
As a man sows,
so shall he reap.

276
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,199
Mother!

277
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,358
Mother, where are you?

278
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,398
My child!

279
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,038
It is a dragon!

280
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,278
- It's a dragon god!
- A dragon god!

281
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,959
A dragon god!

282
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,479
Dragon god!

283
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,439
Dragon god!

284
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,878
Thank you!

285
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,878
<i>The Golden Lion's crimson hellfire
sure is powerful.</i>

286
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,878
<i>I actually cannot even return
to my human form.</i>

287
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,199
<i>I'll have to rest here for a few days.</i>

288
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,999
You're awake.

289
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:23,479
Here.

290
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:28,919
There's a cat at my house.
I hope you two can get along.

291
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,078
Does it taste good?

292
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:43,919
How come you're here?

293
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,759
Little black snake, come with me.

294
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,679
<i>What is this place?</i>

295
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:13,598
<i>That person?</i>

296
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,798
<i>In my dream,
that person was a man.</i>

297
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,959
<i>How come it is a woman now?</i>

298
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:31,239
You're awake.

299
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,398
Do you know?

300
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,959
You're the most attractive snake
of the ones I've met.

301
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:39,038
Look, there are even horns on your head.

302
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,919
They feel so smooth. How nice.

303
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
<i>Do I look like a snake?</i>

304
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,239
When I saw you in the cave

305
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,278
I thought you were
hibernating for the winter.

306
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,078
Then I remembered it's only
the ninth month of the year.

307
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,439
It's not time for snakes to
go into hibernation yet.

308
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,519
So I figured you might have been injured

309
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,679
and brought you back
to nurse you.

310
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,878
<i>The Golden Lion might be powerful,
but he can't hurt me.</i>

311
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:08,759
Do you know what this place is?

312
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,999
Other than birds and beasts,
why aren't there any other humans?

313
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,199
<i>This is Mount Junji of the Far East.</i>

314
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,999
<i>The Golden Lion has forcibly occupied
the mountain for over 10 years</i>

315
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,679
<i>so naturally, nobody would
dare hunt here.</i>

316
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,479
Let me tell you. I only have this hut.

317
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,719
You look like you don't have
a home to return to either.

318
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,887
Why don't you stay
and I'll take care of you?

319
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:32,328
<i>I only need three days to be able
to resume my human form</i>

320
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,742
<i>and return to the Celestial Palace.</i>

321
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:35,657
<i>Why would I need you to take care of me?</i>

322
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,598
No, I shouldn't discuss this with you.

323
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:43,919
Since I brought you back,
you should stay to accompany me.

324
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,999
But if you want to leave,
I won't stop you.

325
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,479
However, you must not have
any other owner, all right?

326
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,838
<i>Owner?</i>

327
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,838
All right.

328
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,239
I couldn't catch any animals.
I only have some fruit.

329
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,959
Have these to eat.

330
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,598
<i>This fan...</i>

331
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,038
<i>Could it be
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?</i>

332
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,719
<i>How would a mortal have
Kunlun Mountain's artifact?</i>

333
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:22,558
Your Highness.

334
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,479
Why is His Highness
resting so early today?

335
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,838
Is he feeling unwell?

336
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,878
Princess, His Highness
received Heavenly Lord's orders

337
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:38,278
and has gone to the mortal realm
to subdue the Golden Lion.

338
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,558
Golden Lion?

339
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:43,558
Isn't that Qing Cang's mount?

340
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,919
Yes, it is that Golden Lion.

341
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,959
It fled to the mortal realm due to
unforeseen events in the Ghost Realm.

342
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,878
Then when will His Highness be back?

343
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:59,798
I've made soup for him.
I'm afraid it will cool.

344
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,878
A day in heaven is a year on earth.

345
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:04,638
His trip there and back

346
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,798
will at most be the time it takes
for an incense stick to burn.

347
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:10,598
Then please bring this soup inside for me

348
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,519
so His Highness can drink it
when he returns.

349
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,798
Yes.

350
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,078
They don't attend court

351
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:42,398
and yet the separate clans
expect me to commend their loyalty?

352
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,111
Please calm down, Father.

353
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,679
Kunlun Mountain has already disbanded.

354
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,798
I believe peaceful relations
are most necessary.

355
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:54,278
We can only try to
placate the clan leaders.

356
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,789
Eldest Brother is correct.

357
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,598
The Mermaid Clan is in the south.
The north is not at peace either.

358
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:06,278
We must not raise
internal strife at this time.

359
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:11,278
I understand. You two
need not be so worried.

360
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:14,078
Where is Ye Hua?

361
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,479
Your Majesty.

362
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:18,782
Crown Prince has gone to the mortal realm
to subdue the Golden Lion.

363
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,318
Since Ye Hua is not here,
why don't you two speak first

364
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,439
about what plans you have

365
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:29,118
to make the clan leaders believe
my sincere intentions for harmony?

366
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,558
Su Jin, you may leave.

367
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,239
Your Majesty.

368
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,759
Do you believe that
I am siding with outsiders?

369
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,959
Your Majesty brought me into the
Celestial Palace when I was a child. I...

370
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,159
You are a woman.
There is no use for you to stay here.

371
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,519
You may go.

372
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:56,959
Yes.

373
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:23,038
I have a way to pacify
the separate clans.

374
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,598
You have a way? What is it?

375
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,398
Grant me the title of side consort.

376
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,318
Confer the title of side consort to you?

377
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:44,038
If you confer
the title of side consort to me

378
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,358
you would not be strengthening
the power of any one clan

379
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:49,959
and it would also show
the whole world

380
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,798
that Your Majesty values
each and every clan.

381
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,239
I am already old.

382
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,759
I have long since
lost interest in the harem.

383
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,078
I will be holding you back.

384
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,278
I only wish to do something
for Your Majesty.

385
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,038
I wish to do something useful for
the world, just as my father did.

386
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,038
It is precisely because your father
made sacrifices for the Celestial Tribe

387
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:16,269
that I have even more reason
to not allow you to do so.

388
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,998
The south poses trouble
from the Mermaid Clan

389
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:20,679
while the north is in such unrest.

390
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:23,278
The Celestial Tribe is
in need of manpower.

391
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,479
Do not hesitate
any longer, Your Majesty.

392
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:29,798
I am willing to do this.
I have absolutely no complaints.

393
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,959
You do not understand, child.

394
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,959
This is an important life decision.

395
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,558
You must not act rashly.

396
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:00,759
If...

397
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,519
If Your Majesty feels you owe me a debt

398
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,519
could you allow me this?

399
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,919
In the future, no matter
what wish I may have

400
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,038
Your Majesty will grant it to me.

401
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:36,078
Why didn't I notice
you were injured when I took you in?

402
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:44,439
When I took in those birds,
I also used this herbal medicine on them

403
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,638
and they were healed within 10 days.

404
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,358
Bear with it for a while.
I'll be done soon.

405
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,598
<i>This is the yellowseed herb
found only in the far east.</i>

406
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,924
<i>It can remove rotting flesh.</i>

407
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:58,238
<i>It must be used with the juice of berries
with a regenerative effect to be useful.</i>

408
00:33:58,238 --> 00:34:02,318
<i>By using this by itself,
aside from making my injuries worse</i>

409
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:03,719
<i>there is no other benefit.</i>

410
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:06,358
All done. Aren't I good to you?

411
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,838
Snakes like to eat raw meat, right?

412
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,199
<i>Snakes do like to eat raw meat.</i>

413
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,998
<i>But I do not.</i>

414
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,759
Eat it. You'll get hungry.

415
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,759
<i>Meat must be cooked before it's eaten.</i>

416
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,039
If you starve, I'll be sad.

417
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,278
<i>Presumptuous!</i>

418
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,759
You still won't eat?

419
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,639
Are you not eating because
you want me to give you another kiss?

420
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,958
<i>No... No need. I'll eat.</i>

421
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,559
The snakes here are so smart.

422
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,318
They even know to pick out
the food they like to eat.

423
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:08,559
It's a good thing that
I brought you back that day.

424
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,610
You're much smarter than
those birds and cats.

425
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,639
Why don't you come with me
to the market for some things?

426
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,438
<i>I've already been here for three days.</i>

427
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,175
<i>I should be leaving now.</i>

428
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,759
<i>Although you've made
my injuries a bit worse</i>

429
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:26,079
<i>it was out of good intentions.</i>

430
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,998
<i>Thank you for your
three days of hospitality.</i>

431
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,998
<i>Farewell then.</i>

432
00:35:29,998 --> 00:35:31,878
Let's go then.

433
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:40,119
<i>Can't you see it'll rain soon?</i>

434
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,119
<i>It's about to rain!
I have to find a place to hide.</i>

435
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,599
I heard Crown Prince is in this area
to subdue the Golden Lion.

436
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,599
It would have been great
to have heard the news earlier.

437
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,958
I've been at the Celestial Palace
for dozens of millennia

438
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:21,838
but I never had the chance
to speak to him.

439
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:28,159
Are you about to cast rain?

440
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:33,599
Crown... Crown Prince.

441
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,159
No need to cast rain today.

442
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,039
Yes.

443
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,358
The dark clouds are clearing already?

444
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,278
You're sleeping again?

445
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,798
If you're not eating, you're sleeping.
You truly are a snake.

446
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,438
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

447
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,438
Su Jin.

448
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,798
Heavenly Lord.

449
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,998
I have already killed the Golden Lion.

450
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,239
I have come to report back.

451
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:34,878
Good. You subdued him so easily.

452
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,239
You have indeed
lived up to my expectations.

453
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,958
However, I was careless and was injured.

454
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,798
I am not worthy of your confidence in me.

455
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,478
- Is it serious?
- No, it is just a light injury.

456
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:56,039
The wound has just not been handled well
and will need a new dressing.

457
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,518
Crimson hellfire is
no ordinary monster power.

458
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:00,278
Do not treat this lightly.

459
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,318
Yes.

460
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,358
- Come, put some effort into it.
- Slowly, slowly. Be careful.

461
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,119
- Clear this up. Let me help you.
- Put it here. Here, give me that.

462
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,398
Here, hold this.

463
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,518
Watch out for your foot.

464
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:22,918
- Put this over there.
- All right.

465
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,958
There's still some more wood over there.

466
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,239
Pick it all up.

467
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,838
Sir, what happened here?

468
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:32,438
Yesterday, there was a monster
that looked much like a lion.

469
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:35,518
Its whole body was red.
It spewed flames everywhere.

470
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:37,639
Look, it burned everything here.

471
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,798
The heavens must have been
looking after us.

472
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:48,119
A black dragon suddenly appeared
and cast rain, putting out all the fires.

473
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,278
It even killed the monster
with a single thunderbolt.

474
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:54,478
Did the monster look like a lion?

475
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:56,278
That is what is being said.

476
00:38:57,478 --> 00:38:58,998
The Golden Lion?

477
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:02,318
Sir, do you know where
the monster's corpse is?

478
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:05,918
You are such a strange lady.
You want to see the monster's corpse?

479
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:08,559
I don't know, I don't know.

480
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,599
<i>Back then, Li Yuan disappeared with
Father's mount, the Golden Lion.</i>

481
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,119
<i>If it really is the Golden Lion</i>

482
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,342
<i>I'll be able to find a clue
to Li Yuan's whereabouts.</i>

483
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:31,239
I sold some fruit and got some money.

484
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,719
Let's go to the teahouse
for tea and opera later.

485
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,239
Let's go.

486
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,679
Come, take a look at this talisman.

487
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,318
If yesterday's events happen again

488
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:42,278
this will give you
the black dragon's protection

489
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:43,278
and leave you unharmed.

490
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,759
- I'll have one!
- Come, come.

491
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,798
- I want one!
- Plenty for all.

492
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,438
Can this talisman really ward off evil?

493
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,599
Of course. Do you want a talisman, Miss?

494
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,239
I'm not afraid of monsters.

495
00:39:55,958 --> 00:40:01,079
For a lady, you have such courage.
You're not afraid of monsters?

496
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,599
- It was beaten to the ground.
- Good, good!

497
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,199
Before you knew it, the hero had
turned around and rode astride the tiger

498
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,798
and delivered a few cuffs and kicks.

499
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:26,039
- Good, good!
- Miss.

500
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,679
Why did you follow me?
I'm not buying a talisman.

501
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,369
I only want to ask you about
the origins of this fan.

502
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,798
I picked it up.

503
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,719
How about selling it to me?

504
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:39,759
It's not for sale.
This fan is the first item I found.

505
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:41,478
I'm keeping it as a memento.

506
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:44,559
It is of no use to you.
Why must you insist on keeping it?

507
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,278
I said I'm not selling it.

508
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:50,318
- Miss, look.
- You!

509
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,759
Miss, why did you steal my fan
while I was making talismans?

510
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:57,398
Who stole your fan? Give it back--

511
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:59,039
You!

512
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,639
I was selling talismans outside just now.

513
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,119
You came to join the crowd
and stole my fan while I was unawares.

514
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,199
I found this fan.

515
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,639
- You--
- Everybody, look!

516
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,918
Come, come.

517
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,318
Miss, since you are so stubborn

518
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,878
why don't we have
someone else bear witness

519
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:19,278
and see who this fan really belongs to?

520
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,199
The fan originally belongs to me.

521
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,371
Why should I need someone else
to make the judgment?

522
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,798
If this fan really does belong to you

523
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:28,278
then do you know
what is drawn on this fan

524
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,998
and who had inscribed the words on it?

525
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:31,438
Yes, that is reasonable.

526
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,679
I did not take a close look at it before.

527
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,918
Of course you don't know.

528
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:38,199
Even if you did know, you wouldn't know
the history of this fan.

529
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,438
This was passed down from my ancestors.

530
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:43,099
It has been passed down
for several generations to me.

531
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:47,838
The painting on here depicts
the immortals' Kunlun Mountain.

532
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,438
This fan is an immortal's artifact,
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

533
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,318
Is it that impressive?

534
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:57,639
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun?

535
