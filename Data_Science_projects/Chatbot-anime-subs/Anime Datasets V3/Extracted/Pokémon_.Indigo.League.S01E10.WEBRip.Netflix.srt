I mean, you'd have to be pretty stupid

168
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,927
-to fall into one of those holes.
-Hey!

169
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,096
[Team Rocket yelling]

170
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,683
This is the third hole we've fallen into.

171
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,395
How come nobody ever falls into our traps
but we always fall into theirs?

172
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,565
Well, this one was very cleverly hidden,
well made, and--

173
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,859
-I'm glad you're enjoying it so much!
-Meowth!

174
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,447
[all yell]

175
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,118
[all yell and mutter]

176
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,330
-[Meowth] Help me out! Help me out!
-[James] Get us out of here!

177
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,876
Ouch, my tail! Let go!
Stop pulling my tail!

178
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,175
[grunts]

179
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,803
Do you feel any better yet, Staryu?

180
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,264
Sorry about what happened in the forest.

181
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,640
Oddish.

182
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:45,103
I shouldn't have surprised you like that,
heh. You must've been scared.

183
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,563
Oddish.

184
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,399
Melanie told me
your old trainer got rid of you.

185
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,693
Was it really
because he thought you were too weak?

186
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,902
Oddish.

187
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,363
You know, some trainers
can be insensitive.

188
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,116
But not all of us are mean like that.
[giggles]

189
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,911
You just need to find a trainer
who understands you.

190
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,999
Anyway, I'm sorry for what I did
and I hope we can become friends.

191
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,458
Oddish.

192
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,960
[sobs]

193
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,255
-Huh?
-Oddish. Oddish.

194
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,758
You're sweet, Oddish. I am sorry.

195
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:20,555
All I think about lately is winning.
I hope I'm not becoming heartless.

196
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,892
-You were always heartless.
-Mind your own business!

197
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,810
Bulbasaur!

198
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,520
[all grunt]

199
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,315
-Hey, it's rude to tackle people!
-She's right.

200
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,816
[growls]

201
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,612
I know. You're just mad
because I was going to beat you.

202
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,032
-But you chickened out and ran off.
-That must be it.

203
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,368
Then let's see how tough you really are.

204
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,995
-[Melanie] Please wait. Please.
-Huh?

205
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,624
Bulbasaur is only trying
to protect Oddish.

206
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,378
Bulbasaur volunteered to guard
our whole village.

207
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,590
-[both] Huh?
-It protects all the injured Pokémon

208
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,759
whenever enemies try
to attack them.

209
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,218
[both] Oh.

210
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,181
Bulbasaur is the bravest
and most loyal Pokémon I know.

211
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,600
So that's why Bulbasaur attacked me.

212
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,603
It must've thought
I was taking Oddish from the village.

213
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,648
[Bulbasaur gibbering]

214
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
[Ash] Now what?

215
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:18,112
Bulbasaur doesn't like Pokémon trainers.
It wants you to leave the village now.

216
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,532
[Misty] But we're not here to capture
Pokémon. We want to help you.

217
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,452
It's true, Bulbasaur.
These are our friends.

218
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,412
[grunting]

219
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,998
Bulbasaur was worried
about the other Pokémon,

220
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,002
so it decided to be the village bodyguard.
Now, that's what I call bravery.

221
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,380
It would be great to have a Pokémon
like that.

222
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,385
To protect the world from devastation.

223
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,553
To unite all peoples within our nation.

224
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,515
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

225
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,226
To extend our reach to the stars above.

226
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,521
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

227
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,692
-Surrender now or prepare to fight.
-That's right.

228
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,403
We've said our lines.
Time to attack the village.

229
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,239
Those village idiots thought
their measly traps would stop us.

230
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,700
They thought
they had the home team advantage.

231
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,161
No such luck.
We're the home team now.

232
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,123
I congratulate myself
for this brilliant scheme.

233
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,584
Don't forget, I suggested tying balloons
on the stadium roof.

234
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,754
[warbling]

235
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,303
[both exclaim]

236
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,146
-Here we go again.
-Today only at Jessie stadium.

237
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,108
-It's the Team Rocket Pokémon challenge.
-The flying stadium was my idea.

238
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,402
Oh, heh.

239
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,825
All Pokémon are invited
to enter the stadium.

240
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,285
Step right up.

241
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,580
Yeah, we're not hosing you.
Well, maybe we are.

242
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,582
[all grunting]

243
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
They never run out of ideas, do they?

244
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,254
Hurry! Everybody get in the cabin!

245
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,924
Wait. No! Oddish!

246
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,057
[grunting]

247
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,850
Bulbasaur.

248
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,187
-Bulbasaur!
-Take Staryu.

249
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,650
Keep going, Bulbasaur! Ugh.

250
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,455
That rotten little pest.
He's always ruining our flawless plans.

251
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,958
Not this time. He's gathered them all
in one place for us.

252
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,503
Our super-vacuum will suck up them up.

253
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,093
[all] Let's go, team!
To steal them is our dream!

254
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,512
Let's go, Rocket!
Put Pokémon in our pocket!

255
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,183
[grunting]

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,022
Pidgeotto, I choose you!

257
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,485
Pidgeotto, Gust attack!

258
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,779
[squawking]

259
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,997
-And the tornado's winding up.
-But will it strike us out?

260
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,333
There goes the whole ballgame.

261
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,963
[all yelling]

262
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,676
[James] The home team
really got blown away.

263
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,221
[Meowth] So what are we going to do now,
challenge them to wind surfing?

264
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,225
[all yelling and screaming]

265
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,273
[Meowth] Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again.

266
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,363
Is everyone feeling okay?

267
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,866
I just had the wind knocked out of me.

268
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,160
Bulbasaur.

269
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,997
This village is well-protected
with Bulbasaur here.

270
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,709
Ash, don't you agree that Bulbasaur would
be an excellent addition to your team?

271
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,211
Oh, yeah, would he ever!

272
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,173
-I think Bulbasaur should go with you.
-Huh?

273
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,843
Bulbasaur stayed here
to protect the weaker Pokémon.

274
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,388
But this village is too small.
The bulb on its back can't grow.

275
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,642
It needs to go out into the world now
and I know you'll take good care of it.

276
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,272
Please do me this favor. Take
Bulbasaur with you on your journey.

277
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,317
He'll be a good companion.

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,445
But what will happen to the village
without Bulbasaur?

279
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,530
Yeah, who's going to protect you?

280
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,659
It's true that Bulbasaur has done
a great job, maybe too great a job.

281
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,623
You see, these Pokémon shouldn't
remain in this village forever and ever.

282
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,626
After they recover,
the Pokémon are supposed to leave.

283
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,921
But it's too safe here,
so none of them wants to go away.

284
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,507
They don't want to return
to the outside world.

285
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,591
Oddish.

286
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,969
But I think it's important
that all of them return to the wild.

287
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,721
That's where Pokémon belong.

288
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,558
And hopefully, someday,
they'll find good trainers like you.

289
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,521
Of course, taking care of sick Pokémon
will always be my mission

290
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,316
but I know my job isn't finished
until they return where they came from,

291
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,945
so it's the day a Pokémon leaves
that is most rewarding to me.

292
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,030
Melanie, I--

293
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,950
So you see,
it's time for Bulbasaur to leave here.

294
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,995
Please take it with you.
It won't be a burden, I promise.

295
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,207
Bulbasaur still has a lot of growing
to do.

296
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,961
I want it to be in a place where I'm sure
it can grow strong and happy.

297
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,463
I'm sure that place is with you, Ash.

298
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,674
Well, if you really want me to.

299
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,759
Bulbasaur.

300
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,261
[giggles]

301
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,179
What did it say?

302
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,934
Bulbasaur will join you on one condition.
It wants to battle you in a Pokémon match.

303
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,020
-Right, Bulbasaur?
-Bulbasaur.

304
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,982
Ha! If you want a match, you'll get it.

305
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,818
Oh, please let me battle with Bulbasaur.

306
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,444
-Please? Pretty please?
-No way.

307
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,366
-Pika.
-Bulbasaur.

308
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,912
Pikachu, go!

309
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,081
[both grunting]

310
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,839
Pikachu! Look out, Pikachu!

311
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,176
[grunting continues]

312
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,854
Ah! The Vine Whip is Bulbasaur's
special move.

313
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,442
Ah, Pikachu, Thunderbolt!

314
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,245
All right. Poké Ball, go!

315
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,217
We did it! We got Bulbasaur.

316
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,178
Pikachu.

317
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,139
Bulbasaur, I'll miss you.

318
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,436
[Melanie] Have a safe trip.

319
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,105
I promise to take good care
of Bulbasaur.

320
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,276
Bulbasaur, thank you for watching over us.

321
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,153
[gibbers]

322
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,323
-Uh, Melanie, I've been thinking.
-Yes?

323
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,033
Well, since Bulbasaur is leaving,

324
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,160
I wouldn't mind staying
and helping you out.

325
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,621
It's very kind of you but we'll be okay.

326
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,624
I wouldn't want to keep you
from all of your wonderful adventures.

327
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,085
Oh. Yeah, I guess you're right.

328
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,298
-Goodbye, Melanie.
-Goodbye. Good luck.

329
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,759
Bulbasaur.

330
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,845
Don't worry, Bulbasaur.
You'll see your friends again.

331
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,723
As soon as the Pokémon feel better,
they'll leave this village too.

332
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,684
Bulba.

333
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,646
Take good care of each other.
Bye-bye.

334
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,023

336
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,487
-Did you kiss her goodbye?
-That's enough stupid questions.

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,949
Would you please stop embarrassing me
already? You know, okay, so she's cute.

-I understand that!
