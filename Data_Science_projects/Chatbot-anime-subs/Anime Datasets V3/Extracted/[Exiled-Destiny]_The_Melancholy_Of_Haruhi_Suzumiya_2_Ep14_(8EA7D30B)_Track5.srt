1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,720
I do.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,620
Nagato led us to the back
of her apartment building.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,600
Oh, they all seem
used to people.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,700
Black cat, black cat...

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,440
Oh well.
Let's use this one.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,450
And she's changed
the set up again.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,480
It's not black, but I guess
we don't have a choice.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,920
Okay, Yuki!
This is your partner!

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,990
Be good friends!

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,370
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya V

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,270
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya V
And so we started
filming again.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,300
The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya V
It looks like it doesn't matter
where we shoot.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,290
It looks like it doesn't matter
where we shoot.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,030
Yuki! Attack Mikuru!

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,740
Take this...

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,780
Okay, cut!
Nice!

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,350
We'll make
that cat talk!

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,480
He's a witch's cat,
after all.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,990
So he should at least make one
or two snide remarks, right?

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,210
How absurd.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,090
Your name is Shamisen! Come on,
Shamisen, say something!

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,200
There's no way he'd talk.
Actually, please don't talk.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,300
Wait, "Shamisen"!?

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,570
Hmm, pretty good.

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,970
Kyon, I'm going to leave
that cat's care to you.

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,540
Take him home
with you.

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,380
You have until tomorrow to
teach him a trick or two.

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,580
Like jumping through
a ring of fire!

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,470
Okay, we're done
for today!

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,220
Tomorrow we'll be shooting
the climax!

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,990
The filming's going smoothly!
Everyone's healthy!

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,960
Rest well, everyone!
And prepare yourselves for tomorrow!

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,730
Good work. I'll buy you
a can of cat food in a bit.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,740
Or would you prefer
dried sardines?

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,610
I'm okay with either.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,450
Hey now, was that you, Nagato?
I was asking the cat.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,150
That was my intention.
That's why I answered.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,700
Did I say
something wrong?

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,160
What a surprise. He's a calico
and he's male.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,060
No, that's not why you
should be surprised.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,710
What a surprise.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
For a cat to speak...

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,410
I don't understand why
you're all surprised.

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,070
He's a bakeneko, or some kind
of nekomata.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,750
It's true that the sounds
that are coming from me

46
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,480
might sound like
human words to you.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,920
If that's the case, then why
are you trying to confirm

48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,390
that I said what
it sounds like I said?

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,700
Well, you know. It's because you're
actually answering my questions.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,640
But it might just be that
the sounds that I'm making

51
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,610
just happen to mesh with what
you're saying, right?

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,940
If that's the case, then that wouldn't
make it a conversation,

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,450
even if it were between
two humans.

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,210
Exactly.

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,750
Even if two people are acting like
they're talking to one another,

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,950
no one can be sure if they're properly
expressing how they feel.

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,890
Many people do say one thing even if
they feel another way, after all.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,260
Shut up, you.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,770
Now that you mention it,
that's true...

60
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,540
I'm sorry, but could you
please be quiet, too?

61
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,810
The situation
is pretty bad.

62
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,280
We've underestimated
Miss Suzumiya yet again.

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,610
Umm... what do
you mean?

64
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,020
There's a chance that the setting
of Miss Suzumiya's movie

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,250
will become the everyday reality
of the world.

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,720
If she thinks to herself, "I'd like to shoot
a scene of a giant meteor impact,"

67
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,290
then it might
become reality.

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,300
Then what can
we do?

69
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,070
We have to prevent the erosion
of our reality by her imagination.

70
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,800
Right now, she's unconsciously
mixing up reality and fiction.

71
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,410
She is getting pretty
carried away.

72
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,240
Miss Suzumiya's unusual
abilities are coming out

73
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,250
through the filter
of her movie making.

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,980
To prevent this, we need to make
Miss Suzumiya understand

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,460
that this is simply fiction, and logically
guide this film into something more stable.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,930
And how are we supposed
to rationalize a talking cat?

77
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,370
I'm not talking about
rationalizing things.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,270
If we did, we'd end up with a
world setting where cats talk.

79
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,640
But that's not possible
in our world.

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,040
Well, what about
you guys?

81
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,550
Well, it's true that we exist
thanks to Miss Suzumiya.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
The same as that
talking cat.

83
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,450
Can't we do something
about this?

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,920
If this were a fantasy world, then
we wouldn't need any explanations.

85
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,490
But the moment we show proof of
a talking cat or a Mikuru Beam,

86
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,690
then our world
will change.

87
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,260
The world will have to change from one
where there are no supernatural phenomena

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,810
to one that is
aware of them.

89
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,570
Okay, then what
do we do?

90
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,240
We just have to put an ending on the
movie that Miss Suzumiya will accept.

91
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,870
Does that even exist?

92
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,520
It does.

93
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,020
It's an incredibly simple ending that
can take any events that make no sense

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
and make them all reasonable
in a second.

95
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,920
Spit it out.

96
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,960
"It was all a dream."

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,490
I wasn't joking.

98
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,530
Do you think you'll be able to
convince Haruhi to do that?

99
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,740
It might be difficult.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,710
But in this case, mentioning that
everything in the movie is a dream,

101
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,310
a lie, or a misunderstanding
is the best way to resolve it all.

102
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,820
That's probably true
for you...

103
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,790
I might think that's the best way, too.
But what about Haruhi?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,770
Okay, don't say a single word
in the house.

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
Act like a cat,
got it?

106
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,540
I don't know what "like a cat" means,
but I'll do as you ask.

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,270
Don't talk. Make all
of your answers "meow".

108
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,370
Meow.

109
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,120
Cat cat cat!

110
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,310
Meow.

111
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,230
There we go.

112
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,490
All right,
see you later.

113
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,320
As you wish.

114
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,270
Only a few days remained
until the school festival.

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,330
It felt as if a chaotic atmosphere
was steadily spreading

116
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,240
throughout the school, connecting
everyone to Haruhi's excitement.

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,310
We have to find the legendary
Crystal Crescent Orb, and quickly!

118
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

119
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,440
It's like it wouldn't
be strange at all

120
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,680
if a couple people from another world
got mixed up in all of this.

121
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,050
Kyon!

122
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,920
Mikuru says she has something
she wants to talk to you about!

123
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,830
Go on, Mikuru,
give that to him!

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,370
Oh, this... umm...
it's a c-c-coupon!

125
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,100
Yakisoba Cafe Acorn
Discount coupon
Oh, this... umm...
it's a c-c-coupon!

126
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,170
It's for the yakisoba cafe
our class is doing!

127
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,270
Thank you very much.

128
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,880
Please bring some friends
with you.

129
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,240
That's all!
See ya!

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,290
- Kyon...
- What's up?

131
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,300
Well, if I say this, it will look like
Koizumi is one of those...

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,370
And... I don't like it, but...

133
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,670
Uh-huh.

134
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,680
I, you see... I have a different
way of thinking...

135
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,110
In other words... it's a different
interpretation from Koizumi's.

136
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,310
Are you talking about the whole
"Haruhi is God" thing?

137
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,290
There's no mistaking that Miss Suzumiya
has the power to change the present.

138
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,160
But I don't think it's the power
to change how the world works.

139
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,740
The world has always
been like this.

140
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,640
I see... this is completely opposite
of what Koizumi says.

141
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,630
I think that Miss Nagato
probably thinks differently, too.

142
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,780
Umm... this might give you a
bad impression of him, but...

143
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:58,630
If I said... you shouldn't trust Koizumi...
it might be misleading, but...

144
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,390
Umm, I'm sorry... I'm no good
at explaining things,

145
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,490
and I'm under certain restrictions,
so I... But l...!

146
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,000
I understand. There's no way
Haruhi could be God.

147
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,870
Your explanation is easier to understand
than Koizumi's, Miss Asahina.

148
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,150
Thank you...

149
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,230
But please understand. I don't have
anything against Koizumi himself.

150
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,000
Sure.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,050
Literature Club

152
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,690
This is what is believed to be
Mikuru Asahina's assertions.

153
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,430
Haruhi Suzumiya is not the
one who created the world,

154
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,990
but that this world has
always been this way.

155
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,230
Psychic powers
and time travel,

156
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,840
extraterrestrial life forms and other
supernatural beings have always existed.

157
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,410
Haruhi Suzumiya's role is to
unconsciously discover them,

158
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,280
and that this ability manifested
three years ago.

159
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,980
However, while she can find the unusual,
she can never realize it.

160
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,260
Because there exists something to interfere
with her making those realizations.

161
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,860
And that is us.

162
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,590
So Miss Asahina has a different
reason from Koizumi

163
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,910
for not wanting Haruhi to discover
anything mysterious?

164
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,810
Yes. She came to this era to protect
the future that she is from.

165
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,680
It almost feels like she's revealing
vital information like it's no big deal.

166
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,920
Itsuki Koizumi and Mikuru Asahina will never
agree with each other's interpretations.

167
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,420
To them, the other's theory can only serve
to disrupt the basis of their own existence.

168
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,860
Hold on. Koizumi said that he didn't have
his esper powers until three years ago.

169
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,230
There is no proof anywhere that
what Itsuki Koizumi says is true.

170
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,870
It's true.
There's no proof...

171
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,780
Koizumi's theory just attaches
an acceptable explanation

172
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,250
to some events that
have involved me.

173
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,650
Who knows
if that's correct?

174
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,480
And Miss Asahina's theory
is the same.

175
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,390
Who can guarantee that the
Asahina version is correct?

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,060
What do you think?
Which one is right?

177
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,230
What about the possibility of autonomous
self-determination you mentioned?

178
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,800
No matter which truth
I present,

179
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,270
there is no way for you
to obtain any proof.

180
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,840
Why not!?

181
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,940
Because there is no proof anywhere
that I'm speaking the truth.

182
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,780
Not to you...

183
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,390
I don't know.
Who would, normally?

184
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,100
Koizumi, Nagato, please give me an
easier to understand explanation.

185
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,190
- I won't give you the orb!
- Come back here!
Koizumi, Nagato, please give me an
easier to understand explanation.

186
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,580
The only one who thought the filming
was going well was Haruhi.

187
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Because of this, the grim looks
on the faces of Koizumi,

188
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,510
Miss Asahina and myself had
awfully dark shadows.

189
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,650
At some point, the model guns
started firing

190
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,980
water-hammer rounds
instead of BBs.

191
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,850
Haruhi brought Miss Asahina contacts
of other different colors,

192
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,930
and she started firing off
other dangerous things.

193
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,590
And every time, she was
bitten by Nagato.

194
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,700
Just as the cherry trees
were starting to blossom,

195
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,770
a few days later
they had all fallen off.

196
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,390
The white pigeons
at the shrine

197
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,370
had turned into passenger pigeons,
which have long since been extinct.

198
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,470
And it looks like the progression
of the seasons is a little bit off.

199
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,150
The current highs for Nikkei futures
have risen to 9360 yen,

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,750
with a low of around 9250...
Kyon, your friend's here!

201
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,750
Yo.

202
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,630
The details and foreshadowing
don't matter to Miss Suzumiya.

203
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,900
She probably hasn't thought
of an ending, either.

204
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,830
It might end incomplete.

205
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,140
That would be
a problem, right?

206
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,510
Our theory is that it would be problematic
if the world became more like fiction.

207
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,040
To tell the truth, my agency
and Miss Asahina's group

208
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,130
aren't the only ones whose theories
center around Miss Suzumiya.

209
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,820
There are a lot
of them.

210
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,330
There have been enough conflicts
and bloody exterminations

211
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,100
for me to want to explain
it all in digest format.

212
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,470
Alliances and betrayals,
interference and sneak attacks,

213
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,730
destruction and
mass murder.

214
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,580
Each group has brought forth all of their
strength in an attempt to survive.

215
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,720
Well, this has nothing to do with you.
Or Miss Suzumiya.

216
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,480
And I would prefer that Miss Suzumiya
never found out about any of this.

217
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,460
I don't want to do anything
that will cloud her mind.

218
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,030
My criterion is that Miss Suzumiya has
a character that should be loved.

219
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,270
Oh, you do too,
of course.

220
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,380
Why are you
telling me this?

221
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,550
I just blurted it out.
There's no reason.

222
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,880
After all,
it's just nonsense.

223
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,050
That's true.
It's not amusing at all.

224
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,520
There's one more bit
of nonsense.

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,630
Have you ever wondered why
Miss Asahina has joined us?

226
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,200
Her job is to get you
on her side.

227
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,970
The only one that can get Miss Suzumiya
to listen to them at all is you, after all.

228
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,870
Being able to get a grip
on you would be perfect.

229
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,210
Her young appearance,

230
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,380
her submissively obeying Miss Suzumiya's
unreasonable demands,

231
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,680
and her pitiful demeanor.

232
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,460
It's all to get you
to focus on her.

233
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,730
I'm tired of you
and your jokes.

234
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

235
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,130
It looks like I lack the ability
to keep a joke going.

236
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,270
I'm lying. Did you
take that seriously?

237
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,710
Between Miss Suzumiya's movie
and my class's play,

238
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm under a lot
of pressure.

239
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,680
If a closed space opened up
in addition to all that,

240
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm pretty sure that
I would collapse.

241
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,230
Which is why I came to
make a request of you.

242
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,790
Please, can you do something
to stop Miss Suzumiya's movie

243
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,870
from being the source of all
of the strange phenomena?

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,530
Make Haruhi realize that her movie
is nothing but nonsense?

245
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,830
Was that it?

246
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,310
As long as she clearly
understands that.

247
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,100
And if possible,
before we finish filming.

248
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm counting on you.

249
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,260
What the heck
is up with him?

250
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,460
Did he come just to push the
responsibility onto me?

251
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,730
But still...

252
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,170
I guess I can't just
let it be.

253
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,240
God, this is annoying.

254
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,210
A movie is a movie,
and reality is reality.

255
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,250
They're two different things.

256
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,320
That's so obvious, so why in the world
do I have to convince her of that?

257
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,920
Koizumi said to make it "all just
a dream," but what else is there...

258
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,040
The next day, I went to Haruhi
with a single suggestion,

259
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,940
and after a lot of discussion,
I got her to understand.

260
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,100
Okay, then!

261
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,410
Good work, everyone!
With this, we're finished filming!

262
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,450
You all did your best!

263
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,080
Let's meet up in the clubroom
first thing tomorrow morning

264
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,520
and preview the movie!

265
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,020
Mikuru, it's too soon
to cry!

266
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,390
Save those tears for when you
get a Palme d'Or or an Oscar!

267
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,330
Let's all be happy together!

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,270
Mikuru and Yuki's last battle suddenly
awakens Itsuki Koizumi's powers

269
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,840
and this hard to understand,
deus ex machina power

270
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,280
knocks Yuki to the far reaches
of the universe.

271
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,070
With this, the curtain closes on our story.
Wait, it's closing!?

272
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,410
So it's finally over.

273
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,090
Okay, Mikuru, come here!
You know, it feels like it all
ended in an instant.

274
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,320
Miss Suzumiya, aren't we done?
You know, it feels like it all
ended in an instant.

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,760
Miss Suzumiya, aren't we done?
They say time flies
when you're having fun...

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,230
They say time flies
when you're having fun...

277
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,290
Though I wonder who was
the one having fun here.

278
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,390
Who knows?

279
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,570
Can I leave the rest
to you?

280
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,730
My head is packed with the things
I need for my class's play.

281
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,980
Unlike a movie, I don't get a retake
if I mess up a line.

282
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,040
Oh, one more thing.

283
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,420
We're grateful to you. Both the
agency, and me personally.

284
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,050
Okay, shout it loud!

285
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,560
We're aiming for a
Hollywood blockbuster!

286
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,090
We'll get the golden bear
and the golden lion awards!

287
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,640
That's it! Now, Mikuru,
point at the future!

288
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,860
Oh brother.

289
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,770
To be honest, up until the end I didn't
have a pixel's worth of understanding

290
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,850
of what Haruhi
was trying to film.

291
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,980
It's probably obvious, but no
matter where we searched,

292
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,180
we didn't have the time to put in the visual
effects, or the technology for that matter.

293
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,720
And so Haruhi complained.

294
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,620
We can't show off
an unfinished film like this!

295
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,020
Do something about it!

296
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,220
The school festival is tomorrow.
I'm at my limit.

297
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,860
If you stay up all night,
you'll make it, right?

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,940
You can just stay
here overnight.

299
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,400
And I'll help, too.

300
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,710
They'll know that those are BBs!
In the end, Haruhi was
of no help whatsoever.

301
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,680
In the end, Haruhi was
of no help whatsoever.

302
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,450
To be fair,
I fell asleep, too.

303
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,360
Kyon! Hey, wake up!

304
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,300
So, how did it
turn out?

305
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,210
There was no point to staying overnight.
The movie is still unfinished.

306
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,180
...from the future!

307
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,790
It's not bad. It's not quite all there,
but for you, it's pretty good.

308
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,320
It wasn't me.
Someone else did it.

309
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,270
Best odds, Nagato. Next best, Koizumi.
Miss Asahina, unlikely.

310
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,870
And the long shot would be someone
who has yet to appear.

311
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,700
Mikuru, you have to fight back!
And the long shot would be someone
who has yet to appear.

312
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,600
Good morning.
How did it turn out?

313
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,940
Good morning...

314
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,950
Good morning!
It's done, of course!

315
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,310
Our feature-length spectacle built on
our blood, sweat, and tears!

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,720
Oh, is that so?

317
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,690
That's wonderful.

318
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,360
Let's all watch it together!

319
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,160
Audio/Visual Room

320
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,890
Audio/Visual Room
Mikuru, you were great!

321
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,730
You'll completely capture the hearts
of the whole audience with this!

322
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,730
It's perfect, Mikuru!

323
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,040
The school festival started, and there
was nothing more for me to do.

324
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,540
The changes to reality that we feared
seemed to come to a stop.

325
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,420
I knew this when Shamisen
stopped talking.

326
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,910
Speaking of stopping, I stopped seeing
those strangely dressed guys

327
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,050
that I had seen a lot in the days
before the school festival.

328
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,660
There weren't any plays in the festival
that they might have been in,

329
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,660
so I wonder who
they were.

330
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,530
North High Fest

331
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:17,970
Screening in progress

332
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,030
Screening in progress
The movie ended with Haruhi
doing some narration.

333
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,430
The movie ended with Haruhi
doing some narration.

334
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,770
I convinced her to close the movie
with a director's speech

335
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,410
This story is fictional.
I convinced her to close the movie
with a director's speech

336
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,080
This story is fictional.
By telling her it was important to
mention that it was all in fun.

337
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,480
Characters, organizations,
incidents...
by telling her it was important to

338
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,510
Characters, organizations,
incidents...
Those were the magic words that
canceled out everything.

339
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,880
...other proper names,
and events are not real.
Those were the magic words that
canceled out everything.

340
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,940
As well as all other proper names,
and events are not real.

341
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,610
It's all a lie.

342
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,050
Even if there's a resemblance,
it's coincidence.

343
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,920
Oh, not the ads.

344
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,250
Support Ohmori Electronics and
Yamatsuchi Model Shop. Buy lots.

345
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,930
Say it again?

346
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,860
This story is fictional.

347
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,630
Characters, organizations,
incidents...

348
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,470
Hey, Kyon, why do I
have to say that?

349
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,110
Kitaguchi Station-front Park

350
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,480
If there's one thing that bothers Haruhi
in spite of her devil-may-care attitude,

351
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,140
it's that "the world is the
world is too normal".

352
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,650
As for what she considers to be "not
normal", it would be the supernatural.

353
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,320
She expresses this
by saying things like,

354
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,360
"Why haven't I seen even a single ghost?
What's up with that?"

355
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,500
I've got something important to
tell you, so listen closely.

356
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,040
What is it?

357
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,760
You want there to be aliens,
future people,

358
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,310
and people with
esper powers, right?

359
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,000
Well, yeah.
What about it?

360
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,240
There actually are aliens,
future people, and espers,

361
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,970
closer than you could
ever imagine.

362
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,520
Really, and who
would they be?

363
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,490
Don't tell me that you mean
Yuki or Mikuru or Koizumi.

364
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,560
They wouldn't count as
"closer than I could imagine."

365
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,530
Umm, actually... That was
what I was going to say.

366
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,370
Are you stupid? There's no way
it would be that easy.

367
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,140
Well, if you think about it,
that's true.

368
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay, so who's what?

369
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,120
Listen and rejoice.
Yuki Nagato is an alien.

370
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,590
The Information
something-or-other Entity?

371
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,920
She's an agent for
something like that.

372
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,590
Oh yeah! Humanoid interface!
That's what it was!

373
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,850
What about Mikuru?

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,330
Miss Asahina is pretty simple to explain.
She's a future person.

375
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,170
She came from the future,
so she's a future person.

376
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,200
How far in the future
did she come from?

377
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,840
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.

378
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,620
Aha, I get it.

379
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,010
So you understand now?

380
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,350
Which means that Koizumi is an esper?
That's what you're going to say, right?

381
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,620
Yes! That's exactly what
I was going to say!

382
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,330
Don't screw around
with me!

383
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,710
Why is this crazy woman so realistic
about the weirdest things?

384
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,740
If she would just believe me,
everything would be so much easier.

385
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,020
T-Thank you very much!

386
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,020
Then again, if Haruhi just knew about
all of the phenomena around her,

387
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,800
I don't know what would
happen to the world.

388
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,030
Oh brother.
