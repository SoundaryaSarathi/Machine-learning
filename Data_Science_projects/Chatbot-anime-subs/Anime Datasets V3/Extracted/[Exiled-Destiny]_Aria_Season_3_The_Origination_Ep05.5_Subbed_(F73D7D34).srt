1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,370
First, I'd like to say, thank you!

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,530
Well that was sudden.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,470
Me too! Thank you!

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,300
To everyone who's watching this...

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,740
It's all thanks to the warm breeze
of love that you've sent us!

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,980
Thank you!
Thank you!

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,210
We're really grateful.

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,810
It's a wonderful miracle, isn't it?

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,010
No kinda-sappy lines allowed!

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,650
Huh?
No kinda-sappy lines allowed!

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,550
Huh?

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,020
"Dear Ai, yesterday's rain has finally let up,
and the weather is very pleasant today."

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,890
"But Alicia will be out all day,
so the shop is closed."

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,070
"Not only that, but Aika has work
and Alice is at school."

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,930
"So, President Aria and I are going out, too!"

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:00,620
Do you remember that day
Oboeteimasuka ano hi o

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,760
When your heart suddenly began to race
Futo kanjita tokimeki o

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,040
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you...
Aoi hizashi abite

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
...as you cut through the wind
Kaze o kiru kimi ni

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,390
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met
Mitoreru to me ga atte

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,620
I couldn't help but smile
Egao koboreta

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,160
It's just like a spiral
Marude supiraare

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,630
I want to spend my days waving to you
Itsumademo te o furitai hibi

24
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:00,440
This is my proof that I was here with you
Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,690
An eternal spiral
Zutto supiraare

26
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:14,500
There's a path which stretches on ahead
Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,640
When you climb the next hill,
Tsugi no saka o nobottara

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,170
Let's meet again
Mata aimashou

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,520
That Little Secret Place...

30
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,820
This is a completely residential area, so there's
usually no reason to come here when giving tours.

31
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,930
But it's definitely another face of Neo-Venezia.

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,900
The scenery here never seems to change.

33
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,410
The rain finally let up yesterday,
so I think we have a good chance.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Ready, President Aria?

35
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,720
Ready, set!

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,820
Ta-daa!

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,400
It's full of laundry, just like we thought!

38
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,700
There's even more over here!

39
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,110
The laundry is blissfully swimming in the sky.

40
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,460
Hey!

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,730
You dirtied your clothes already?

42
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,460
But... there was a puddle!

43
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,260
And I just finished doing the laundry, too.

44
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,270
Honestly...

45
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,010
But that Sylph guy said it's good
for me to have so much energy!
Honestly...

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,940
But that Sylph guy said it's good
for me to have so much energy!

47
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,610
But that Sylph guy said it's good
for me to have so much energy!
You have too much energy! For goodness' sake...

48
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,770
You have too much energy! For goodness' sake...

49
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,140
Huh?

50
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,660
We can see the Campanile from here too,
can't we, President Aria?

51
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,670
President Aria?

52
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,420
President Aria...

53
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,730
Here you go.

54
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:58,310
This scenery hasn't changed either,
from the time I first came to this city.

55
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,130
We're getting a little hungry, aren't we?

56
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,240
Well then, shall we go have lunch?

57
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,610
Ah, I know!

58
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,940
Why don't we go eat that?

59
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,950
You know, that exciting, heart-pounding dish
we had the other day at a restaurant near here.

60
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,160
Let's go, shall we?

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
Well then, off we go!

62
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,270
So, two orders then?

63
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,530
Yes.

64
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,500
Certainly. Please wait just a moment.

65
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,740
Exciting, exciting.

66
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,940
Thank you for waiting.

67
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,830
Well? Isn't it neat?

68
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,260
I've always loved getting this restaurant's polenta
served up like a volcano, ever since I was a kid.

69
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,830
I can really sense the history behind it.

70
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,880
Time to eat.

71
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,940
Let's order that the next time we come here.

72
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,880
Thank you for waiting.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,310
It's here!

74
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,010
Here's your chitarra.

75
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,150
Exciting, exciting.

76
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,960
Exciting, exciting.

77
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,160
Exciting, exciting.

78
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,670
All right, go ahead.

79
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,940
Okay!

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,910
It's so much fun!

81
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,120
Yes, yes.

82
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,250
Go ahead.

83
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,540
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

84
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,630
That was delicious, wasn't it?

85
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,150
President Aria...

86
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,230
President Aria!

87
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,660
We're so stuffed, aren't we, President Aria?

88
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,450
Ah, I'm starving. Maybe I'll get some pizza...

89
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,640
Huh?

90
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,110
Isn't that Sideburns?

91
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,490
Just as I was hoping I'd run into
Alicia on my day off, too.

92
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,960
Geez, she just doesn't get it, does she?

93
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,430
Oh well, maybe I'll go yank on her
sideburns as a greeting anyway.

94
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,430
Why don't we try going this way?

95
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,570
Huh? She's gone.

96
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,100
Which way did she go?

97
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,610
Where is she?

98
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,120
Where is she, where is she?

99
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,020
Where is she, where is she, where is she?

100
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,730
Where is she, where is she, where is she,
where is she, where is she, where is she?!

101
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,030
I guess I lost her.

102
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,070
Ma'am, give me a slice of tomato pizza.

103
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,440
Sure.

104
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,940
Thank you for your business.

105
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,920
There she is!

106
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,710
They have some new outfits, President Aria!

107
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,510
What is she doing?

108
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,290
Akatsukin!

109
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,770
Huh?

110
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,530
Are you off today?

111
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,710
Yeah.

112
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,780
Are you going to our
middle school reunion, Akatsukin?

113
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,580
Yeah.

114
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,080
Then I'll send the RSVPs for both of us.

115
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,050
Yeah.

116
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,150
That pizza sure looks good.

117
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,390
Are you sure?

118
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,120
Yeah.

119
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,250
Thanks!

120
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,390
She went inside.

121
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,500
See ya.

122
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,730
Yeah.
See ya.

123
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,700
Yeah.

124
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,940
Huh? My pizza...

125
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,410
Where'd it go?

126
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,880
It looks great on you.

127
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,350
I'm happy for you, President Aria.

128
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,910
Caffè Florian's restoration
has begun, President Aria.

129
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,630
I'm sure it'll be more radiant
than ever when it's reborn.

130
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,540
I lost her again.

131
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,940
Stupid fast girl!

132
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,880
She's elusive, that's for sure.

133
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,850
Huh? It won't open.

134
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,260
This entrance is off limits to the public.
Please use the elevator like everyone else.

135
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,320
What? But I-

136
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,030
It can't be helped!

137
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,440
Thank you so much.

138
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,380
Not at all. Come again anytime.
Ah, and please send Alicia my regards.

139
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,540
I will!

140
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,050
This is taking forever!

141
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,890
What?!

142
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,630
How in the world did she...

143
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,840
You're not getting away this time!
Prepare yourself to be caught!

144
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,180
Huh? Pony-boy?

145
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,970
I wonder what he's doing.

146
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,510
He's really acting sneaky, isn't he?

147
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,350
Junior.

148
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,250
I wonder where he's headed?

149
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,720
Who knows.

150
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
Want to go see?

151
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,180
Yes!

152
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,130
We haven't been here for a while, have we?

153
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a tourist attraction,
so there are lots of people nearby.

154
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,330
But strangely, no one ever notices this spot.

155
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,310
Not Aika, not Alice...
I bet not even Alicia knows about it.

156
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,970
It's my very own place.

157
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,080
If I stay here like this, no one can find me.

158
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,930
President Aria, the city of Neo-Venezia
is changing little by little, isn't it?

159
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
It's not here!

160
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,600
I can't find the stairway anywhere!

161
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,060
Where is it?!

162
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,680
Just how did she get up there?

163
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,280
Could that be it?

164
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,690
Is it all right to enter without permission?

165
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,390
Eh, whatever.

166
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,680
Oh, wow!

167
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,670
You can see the entire inside stretch
of the basilica from here.

168
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,990
Horse butts...

169
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,200
She's sleeping...

170
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,400
BIG-DOUBLE-SIDEBURN-YANK!!

171
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,200
That'll teach you, Sideburns!

172
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,070
Akatsuki, an ambush isn't fair.

173
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,100
I've finally caught you.

174
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,760
Caught me?

175
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,900
Come to think of it, why did I have to
follow Sideburns in the first place?

176
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,280
No, I absolutely was not following you!

177
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,020
At any rate, I'm amazed you
managed to find your way up here.

178
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,830
The stairs leading up here are inconspicuous,
so most people don't even notice them.

179
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,060
Hah, it was a piece a cake.

180
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,970
So, what brings you to this place?

181
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,960
The truth is, there's someone here
that I'm interested in.

182
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,030
So every once in a while,
I secretly come here to see him.

183
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,150
You see this person in secret?

184
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,580
Yes.
You see this person in secret?

185
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,310
Yes.

186
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,350
Just the two of you?

187
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes.
Just the two of you?

188
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,590
Yes.

189
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,920
Ah, but President Aria is with us, too.

190
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,490
He always gazes out to sea from here, all alone.

191
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,230
Sideburns, just who is this guy?

192
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,630
Huh?

193
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,370
I'm asking you who he is!

194
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,140
It's this person right here.

195
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,220
But anyway, come here Akatsuki, come here.

196
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,720
Huh? What is it?
But anyway, come here Akatsuki, come here.

197
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,950
Huh? What is it?

198
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,620
If you crouch here, you can see
the world from his point of view.

199
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,100
See?

200
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:52,620
A white seabird with a tilted neck...
Kubi o kashigeta shiroi umidori

201
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:59,080
...flew away into the endless sky
Tondetta no anna ni takai sora

202
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,860
Soon, a ship sailing beyond the sky...
Sora no mukou no fune ga mousugu

203
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:10,600
Soon, a ship sailing beyond the sky...
Sora no mukou no fune ga mousugu
Surrounded by this scenery that never changes,
happy things, new things, even sad things...

204
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,310
...will arrive in the afternoon harbor
Tadoritsuku gogo no minato
Surrounded by this scenery that never changes,
happy things, new things, even sad things...

205
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,080
...will arrive in the afternoon harbor
Tadoritsuku gogo no minato
...all pile up every day, and slowly
they bring about change, don't they?

206
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,310
...all pile up every day, and slowly
they bring about change, don't they?

207
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,380
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

208
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,650
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku
It's just like how the shapes of the clouds and
the color of the sea are always quietly changing.

209
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,060
Lively people gathered among colorful glass
Nigiwau hito iro toridori no garasuzaiku

210
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,290
The person I long to see has gone to a far-off land...
Aitai hito tooi kuni e itta

211
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,860
The person I long to see has gone to a far-off land...
Aitai hito tooi kuni e itta
For hundreds of years,
a time so unfathomably long,

212
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,500
The person I long to see has gone to a far-off land...
Aitai hito tooi kuni e itta
he has been watching over this piazza,
unbeknownst to everyone.

213
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,400
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no
he has been watching over this piazza,
unbeknownst to everyone.

214
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,070
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no

215
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,340
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no
It's ever so wonderful...

216
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,970
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no
...but it's also a little sad, isn't it?

217
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:50,600
...to a town I have yet to discover
Ima wa shiranai machi ni iru no

218
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,580
That's why...

219
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,040
...I made this my very own secret place.

220
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:08,930
Until the bells ring, I shall wait here
Kane ga naru made koko de machimashou

221
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:15,430
Aprecious treasure that was left behind
Oiteitta no daiji na takaramono

222
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:26,850
I dream of a birdcage that lost its key
Kagi o nakushita torikago no yume

223
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,580
Surely, you'll come searching for it
Kitto sagashi ni kitekureru yo

224
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,460
Voices fly about as a shower of flower petals dance
Tobikau koe afuredasu hanabira ga mau yo

225
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,560
Voices fly about as a shower of flower petals dance
Tobikau koe afuredasu hanabira ga mau yo
I won't tell anyone.

226
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,960
Voices fly about as a shower of flower petals dance
Tobikau koe afuredasu hanabira ga mau yo

227
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,330
Voices fly about as a shower of flower petals dance
Tobikau koe afuredasu hanabira ga mau yo
Let's make this our secret base.

228
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,230
I long to hear your voice, since the window I painted...
Kikitai koe enogu de kaita mado
Let's make this our secret base.

229
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,400
I long to hear your voice, since the window I painted...

Yours and mine.

230
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,770
I long to hear your voice, since the window I painted...
Kikitai koe enogu de kaita mado

231
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,480
...was washed away by the passing rain
Toori ame ni nagasareta

232
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,580
...was washed away by the passing rain
Toori ame ni nagasareta
And President Aria's, and that guy's, too!

233
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,510
...was washed away by the passing rain
Toori ame ni nagasareta

234
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,510
Okay!

235
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,150
Now now, don't mind us. Go on, go on.

236
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,900
Uh...

237
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,520
Sorry to interrupt.

238
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,790
We were really just passing by.

239
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,970
Hold it right there!

240
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,140

Stop getting the wrong idea, Gachapen!

243
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,840
You better not tell Alicia anything! Understand?!

244
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,540
This was supposed to be my secret place...
You better not tell Alicia anything! Understand?!

245
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,570
I see...

246
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,190
It just became everyone's
special place, starting today.
