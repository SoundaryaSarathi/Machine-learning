[Ash] Wow, look at that.

It's a wild Hitmonchan.

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,300
So that's one of those fighting Pokémon
I've heard about.

15
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,176
That one's a real fighter.

[Pokédex]
<i>Hitmonchan, a skilled fighting Pokémon</i>

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,641

18
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,727
All right, let's capture it.

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,229
-Ready, Pikachu?
-Pikachu.

20
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:48,066
If you defeat Hitmonchan,
you'll become the world champion Pokémon.

Pikachu.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,999
You got to learn the basics first.

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,085
Keep your left up and jab with your right.

Make Pikachu stop, Ash.
This isn't even a fight.

-[both] Huh?
-Pika.

58
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,082
We did it.

How many times do I have to tell you,
don't drop your guard.

-Keep your gloves up, Hitmonchan,

66
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,643
because fighting smart
hurts less than fighting stupid.

I won't come home until I become
champion in the P1 Grand Prix.

Daddy.

85
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,698
I'll be in the Gym taking on challengers.

Can I ask a favor of you,

a really, really big favor?

94
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,184
Please feel free to ask.
We'll be glad to help in any way possible.

95
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,769
Thank you.

96
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,647
Please, I want you to defeat
my father's Hitmonchan.

[Ash] This sure doesn't look like
an ordinary Pokémon Gym.

What's the P1 Grand Prix?

103
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,959
P1 is short
for the Pokémon number one Grand Prix.

104
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,420
<i>It's a tournament for fighting Pokémon.</i>

105
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,884
Because my father wants to win the P1,

106
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,887
he's training all the time
and ignoring his family.

107
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,014
So if we defeat that Hitmonchan,

108
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,226
your dad will come to his senses
and go back home.

109
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,435
Right.

110
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,355
Ha, don't worry. Just leave it to us.

111
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,606
-Huh?
-Leave it...

112
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,316
-To us?
-Pika.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,442
We'll take care of it.

114
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,362
Ash, don't you have a fighting Pokémon
we can use?

115
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,822
What are you talking about?

116
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,824
[chuckles]
You don't mean Primeape, do you?

117
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,034
Primeape!

118
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,204
[growls and mutters]

119
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,082
Ape-prime!

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,877
Yeah, Primeape should be able
to do the job.

121
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,088
And I've got Geodude.

122
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,592
We'll both enter the tournament
and defeat that Hitmonchan.

123
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,470
[James] A big Pokémon match.

124
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,056
[Meowth]
And feast your eyes on that prize.

125
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,310
[Jessie] I'd love to get my hands
on that championship belt.

126
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,603
And if we sold the belt,

127
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,147
we could go and stuff ourselves
at the all-you-can-eat buffet.

128
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,608
Unlimited food.

129
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,320
Honey-glazed ham, roast leg of lamb,
strawberry jam.

130
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,197
Sirloin steaks, chocolate cakes.

131
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,450
Can't you numbskulls think of anything
but food?

132
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,576
[both yell]

133
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,037
What would you do with the money, Jessie?

134
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,955
-Who me?
-Yes, Jessie.

135
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,166
What would you do
if you had some extra cash?

136
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,294
First, I'd go to the salon
and get a complete facial.

137
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,879
Then I'd get my hair and makeup done.

138
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,174
Then I'd go on a major shopping spree.
Dresses, then handbags, then shoes.

139
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,467
Then I'd do a bit of jewelry shopping.

140
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,011
And after all that,
I'd invite some close friends over

141
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,472
for a nice quiet dinner at home.

142
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,934
[laughs]

143
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,770
I hate to interrupt
your internal dream sequence,

144
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,481
but shouldn't we figure out
how to get into this competition?

145
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,399
Only fighting Pokémon are allowed.

146
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,360
Of which we currently have none.

147
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,654
Well, then, we'll just have to borrow one,
won't we?

148
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,574
All we have to do is find one. Hmm.

149
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,077
-Like that one there.
-[Meowth] What is it?

[announcer] And now the challenger,
the kicking fiend,

164
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,096
Hitmonlee, along with its trainer Giant.

165
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,560
[groans] Stand up straight.
You're making me dizzy.

166
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,979
I'm tired. Let's trade places.

00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,398
-Ah!
-Quit complaining.

168
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,400
[announcer]
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:50,572
two new Pokémon trainers
competing here in their P1 debut.

170
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,825
Please welcome Ash and Brock.

-Oh, no, not you again.
-Huh?

00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,705
Hmm...

173
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,209
-Hey, Ash, what's the matter?
-Uh, nothing, I guess.

174
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:09,299
[announcer] And now for our first match,
Machop is ready to battle.

175
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,135
What Pokémon will Ash use to challenge it?

176
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,600
I choose you, Primeape.

177
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,272
Primeape.

178
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,817
[growls] Primeape.

179
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,986
-Machop.
-Primeape.

180
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,449
[both growling]

181
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,868
[bell dings]

182
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,119
[yelling]

183
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,038
[grunting]

184
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,416
Primeape!

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
-Get up, Primeape.
-It looks beat.

186
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,129
[announcer]
And it looks like Machop has the advantage

187
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,631
in the battle with Primeape.

188
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,385
Machop may be small,
but it sure packs plenty of power.

189
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,971
[growling]

190
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,016
-[both gasp]
-This looks bad.

191
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,603
[announcer] Machop's mega-muscle power
stops Primeape's kick cold.

192
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,397
It looks like Machop's getting ready
for its special attack.

193
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,900
Special attack?

194
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,194
[Pokédex]
<i>Machop. Its body is pure muscle.</i>

195
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,822
<i>Its special attack is the seismic toss.</i>

196
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,407
Oh, no. It's going to toss Primeape.

197
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,578
-Machop.
-Primeape.

198
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,413
Ah!

199
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,916
Primeape. [grunts]

200
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,252
[groans]

201
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
[both gasp]

202
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,463
[Ash groans]

203
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,006
[Primape grunts]

204
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,676
Primeape, are you okay?

205
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,387
[groans]

206
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,013
-Primeape.
-All right, good.

207
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,349
-Now, we're not going to quit.
-Primeape!

208
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,019
Watch out for that seismic toss
and give it everything you've got.

209
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:45,979
Primeape.

210
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,648
-That's amazing.
-What's amazing?

211
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,985
Primeape used to do just what it wanted
and never listened to anybody.

212
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,529
-But now it's taking orders from Ash.
-Pika.

213
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,656
Primeape, scratch attack.

214
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,034
Primeape. Primeape.

215
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,035
Jump, Primeape!

216
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,038
[growls] Prime... Attack.

217
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,583
Mega kick right now.

218
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,878
-Machop.
-Primeape. Primeape.

219
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,008
-We did it.
-[announcer] And this match is over.

220
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:20,096
Machop is down and out.
Ash's Primeape wins the battle.

221
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,642
-That Primeape, it's really tough.
-Monchan.

222
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,105
It seems like everything changed
when Ash dove to save Primeape.

223
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,982
That's when Primeape started
to trust Ash.

224
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,066
Pika, pika.

225
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,529
Primeape. Primeape. Primeape. [growls]

226
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,701
[announcer] Our next match
is between Hitmonlee and Geodude.

227
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,203
Fans, Geodude is hard as a rock.

228
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,497
Will Hitmonlee be able to crack Geodude?

229
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,999
[bell dings]

230
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,921
Rebecca, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

231
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,006
-Brock, watch out behind you.
-Huh?

232
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,507
[Brock groans]

233
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,260
[groaning]

234
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,596
Monlee.

235
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,931
This won't take very long.

236
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,769
Ah! Geodude, this time, hit Hitmonlee.

237
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,354
Dude.

238
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,230
Don't show any mercy.

239
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,024
Kick, kick, kick.

240
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,194
Hitmonlee. Lee, lee, lee...

241
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,785
Geodude's going to get turned
into gravel. [groans]

242
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,244
-Brock.
-[groans]

243
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,873
-Brock.
-[groans]

244
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,166
Huh?

245
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,670
If you're a real man,
you know when you have to admit defeat.

246
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,171
Time to face facts.

247
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,757
You can lose today and win tomorrow.

248
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,884
Right.

249
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,220
[announcer]
Fans, Brock has thrown in the towel.

250
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,472
[bell dings]

251
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,641
[Brock] Geodude.

252
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,687
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Geo.

253
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,815
You don't have to apologize.
You gave it your best shot.

254
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,358
Dude.

255
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,861
Don't worry,
you'll be as solid as a rock again soon.

256
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,614
Primeape and I
will take care of things now, Brock.

257
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,325
-I'm counting on you, Ash.
-Right.

258
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,245
[announcer] Machop wins.

259
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,832
-Monchan.
-Hitmonlee.

260
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
Primeape.

261
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,586
Yay!

262
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,965
[announcer] Now Ash's Primeape
will advance to the final match,

263
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,301
while the Fighting Spirit Gym's
very own Hitmonchan,

264
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,345
the number one contender
at this tournament,

265
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,765
takes on the legendary kicking fiend
Hitmonlee

266
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,184
for a chance at the championship.

267
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,273
This is a tough opponent.
If we play fair, we may lose.

268
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,734
Not with the plan I cooked up with Meowth.

269
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
And speaking of cooking,
I'm broiling in here.

270
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,446
-Get back in.
-Hmm.

271
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,489
Keep on moving. Keep on fighting.

272
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,034
-Remember, you're a champion.
-Monchan.

273
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,535
[bell dings]

274
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,913
Hitmonchan. Hit. Hitmon. Hit.

275
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,878
-Monlee.
-Chan.

276
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,381
Got to be smart. Got to be strong.
Got to keep moving.

277
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,133
Lee, lee, lee...

278
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,761
Hitmonchan. Hitmonchan.

279
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,804
Hitmonlee is not landing any kicks.

280
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,807
We've got to slow Hitmonchan down.

281
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,227
And a little gloppy glue should do it.
[chuckles]

282
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,983
Hitmonchan. Chan.

283
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,068
Hitmonlee.

284
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,320
[announcer]
Hitmonchan's in trouble.

285
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,989
Hitmonlee's mega kick
is getting the best of Hitmonchan.

286
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,991
Hitmonchan.

287
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,411
This is dangerous.
You should forfeit the match right now.

288
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,330
Lee, lee, lee...

289
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,624
Finish it, Hitmonlee.

290
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,750
Hitmonlee.

291
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,502
Stop it!

292
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,504
Don't hurt my father's Pokémon.

293
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,173
-Rebecca.
-[all gasp]

294
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,427
[both gasp]

295
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,637
[groans]

296
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,516
-Aw. Are you all right?
-I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

297
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,852
Oh, Daddy.

298
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,814
[grunts] Are you hurt, Rebecca?

299
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,149
-No, I'm fine.
-I'm glad.

300
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,026
[Rebecca chuckles]

301
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,277
I give up.

302
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,948
[bell dings]

303
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,950
[announcer]
Anthony throws in the towel.

304
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,869
Hitmonlee is the winner.

305
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,039
Eh, good work, Hitmonchan.
Are you okay?

306
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,290
Monchan.

307
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,585
I'm sorry I worried you
and your mother so much.

308
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,296
-Oh, Daddy.
-That's my girl.

309
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,633
-Isn't that great?
-The family's back together.

310
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,761
-That means we're up against Hitmonlee.
-That's right.

311
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,805
Your battling brought them back together.

312
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,642
And now all Ash needs to do
is win one more time to be champion.

313
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,601
-Pikachu.

314
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,062
-[Jessie] Don't bet on it.
-[all gasp]

315
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,230
Huh?

316
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,733
I can't wait for the chance
to show you three little goody-goodies

317
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,068
what losers you are.

318
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,281
You don't stand a chance against us.
We're going to win that championship belt.

319
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,951
And after we do, you can find us
at the all-you-can-eat buffet table.

320
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,161
-Oh!
-Will you be quiet?

321
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,663
-It's them again.
-Team Rocket.

322
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,416
How did you ever guess?

323
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,625
[both] Ha!

324
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,794
To protect the world from devastation.

325
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
To unite all peoples within our nation.

326
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,258
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

327
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,179
To extend our reach to the st...
Oh, I can't take it.

328
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,640
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light.

329
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,684
-Surrender now.
-Ah!

330
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:22,773
[James] Surrender now or prepare to...
Prepare to... [sobs]

331
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,110
-Uh, we're not finished.
-Hmm.

332
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,489
As I was saying, we are going to be
the winners around here.

333
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,949
-And you can bet your buffet on that.
-[bell dings]

334
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,285
[announcer]
And now for the final confrontation.

335
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,955
Primeape, a newcomer
who's battled to this last round

336
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,749
with tremendous attacks,

337
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,003
faces the ferocious footwork of Hitmonlee,
the kicking fiend.

338
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,632
Get ready, fans,
for a match you'll never forget.

339
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,635
You can't just defend yourself, Primeape.
Attack.

340
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,055
If you can't get inside Hitmonlee's kicks,
you'll never win the battle, Primeape.

341
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,058
Primeape, get in there
and show Hitmonlee that you're not afraid.

342
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,643
Primeape.

343
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,312
[growling]

344
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,813
-You did it.
-All right.

345
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,066
[growling]

346
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,069
-What are you doing?
-Kick it. Kick it.

347
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,821
[chuckling]

348
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,742
Pikachu.

349
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,411
-The secret weapon is ready.
-Aha.

350
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,331
All you got to do now
is use this remote control.

351
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,626
Have Hitmonlee jump up,
and then flip the switch.

352
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,545
A hundred thousand volts
will run through the ring

353
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,338
followed by an explosion.

354
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,341
Primeape will get a charge out of that.
[cackles]

355
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,470
Pika. Pika, pi.

356
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,723
-What is it, Pikachu?
-Pikachu. Pikachu. Pikachu.

357
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,101
Look, I don't have time for this now,
okay?

358
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,521
-Hang in there, Primeape.
-Pika.

359
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,524
Pika.

360
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,693
[whimpers]

361
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,195
Monlee.

362
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,863
-Hit it.
-You got it.

363
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,288
-Nothing's happening.
-Something's wrong?

364
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,874
-Hitmonlee.
-Primeape.

365
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,462
Primeape. [growling]

366
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,632
All right.
Use the seismic toss now, Primeape.

367
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,884
-[both] Oh, no.
-This is bad.

368
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,888
Primeape.

369
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,477
We did it.

370
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,774
Hitmonlee.

371
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,693
[announcer]
And it's all over.

372
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,904
Primeape defeats Hitmonlee
with a seismic toss.

373
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,616
Ash's Primeape wins by a knockout.

374
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,495
Primeape is the new
P1 Pokémon Grand Prix champion.

375
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,915
-We did it!
-All right!

376
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,918
-It's prime time for Primeape.
-Primeape. Primeape.

377
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,921
I'm proud of you, Primeape.
Congratulations.

378
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,465
Primeape.

379
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,218
Ash, this Primeape has got a lot
of natural fighting talent.

380
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,887
-You think so?
-Mm-hm.

381
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,514
Why don't you let me train it for a while?

382
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,601
I promise to turn it
into a real P1 champion.

383
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,021
A true P1 champion.

384
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,233
-What went wrong, Meowth?
-What happened to our secret weapon?

385
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,610
Pika.

386
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,029
Pikachu.

387
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,615
Here it is. It looks like it works.

388
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,116
Pika.

389
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,285
Really appreciate it.

390
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,037
[beeping]

391
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,706
[all] Ah!

392
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,792
[all] Oh!

393
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,505
Team Rocket's blasting off again.

394
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,759
Prime. Prime.

395
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,553
Please take care of Primeape.
I'm counting on you.

396
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,973
[chuckles] There's no need to worry.
You can depend on me.

397
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,892
And I'll make sure my father spends

398
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,977
-lots of time with our family.
-Mm-hm.

399
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,522
You keep on training and winning,
Primeape,

400
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,818
and I'll always be grateful and proud
that I knew a real P1 champion.

401
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,239
-Prime. Primeape.
-Mm.

402
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,411
-Bye.
-Goodbye and thank you.

403
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,162
