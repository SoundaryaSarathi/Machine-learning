1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
<i>Dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou</i>
But someday you'll become aware of...

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,800
<i>Kono sora wo daite kagayaku.</i>
So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,560
We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,470
What?!
We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

24
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,070
What?!
It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,870
It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

26
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,360
Is it possible?

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,930
No, dodge it!

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,980
Retrieve him, hurry!

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,290
The target has gone silent!

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,400
How's Shinji?

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,760
He's alive!

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>Unit 01 has been recovered.</i>
<i>Send it to the 7th cage.</i>

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm going to the cage.
Take over for me, please!

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>Unit 01 secured!</i>

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,240
The pilot's brain waves are
extremely erratic!

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,650
His cardiac readings
are very weak.

37
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,050
Increase power to life support.
Give him a heart massage.

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,980
Roger!

39
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,290
Pulse confirmed!

40
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,410
Force eject the entry plug! Hurry!

41
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,830
Emergency LCL discharge!

42
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,630
Roger!

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,600
Come on, open the hatch! Hurry!

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,660
Shinji!

45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
Episode 6:
Decisive Battle in Tokyo-3

46
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>Scale: 1/1 Balloon Dummy</i>

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,720
<i>The enemy's accelerated particle</i>
<i>beam cannon has hit the balloon!</i>

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,320
<i>The decoy has been vaporized!</i>

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,810
Next.

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>Type-12 Automatic Cannon</i>

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>The Type 12 Mortar has</i>
<i>been vaporized!</i>

52
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,430
I see.

53
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,650
From the data we've collected,
we're assuming that the Angel

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,750
automatically attacks any
opponent within a certain range.

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,490
Anything entering that range
will be targeted.

56
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,090
It's too risky for close range
combat in an Eva, isn't it?

57
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,760
What's the status of its AT field?

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,790
It's still active.

59
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,020
It's strong enough that the spatial
changes in phase are visible.

60
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,100
Using conventional attacks,
guided missiles, artillery, bombs,

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,400
will inflict more damage on
us than on the Angel!

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,210
Offensively and defensively it's
almost perfect. A flying fortress.

63
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,410
What's the status on its drill?

64
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,650
At this moment the target
is directly above us,

65
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,580
penetrating the Tokyo 3 Null Zone.

66
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,520
A giant shielded drill with a
diameter of 17.5 meters

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
is boring towards NERV HQ.

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,030
The enemy is going to attack
NERV Headquarters directly.

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,930
Sassy bastard!

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,300
What's its ETA?

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,240
06:54 AM, just after midnight.

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,940
By that time, it will breach all
twenty-two levels of armor,

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,270
and compromise NERV
Headquarters itself.

74
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,740
Less than ten hours...

75
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,090
The drill has contacted the
first armor plate.

76
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,720
What's the condition of Unit 01?

77
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,530
The defensive armor was melted
down to the third layer.

78
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,660
The good news is that the central
control unit sustained no damage.

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,070
Three more seconds, and it would
have burned right through the Eva.

80
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,740
It will take three hours to install
replacement parts.

81
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,110
Roger.

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,370
What's the status of Unit 00?

83
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,840
Re-activation itself should
prove no problem,

84
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,480
but there's still a feedback error.

85
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,550
So it wouldn't...

86
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,720
...survive combat.

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,390
What's the condition of
Unit 01's pilot?

88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,150
No physical damage.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,290
However, his nerve
pulses are up by 0.8.

90
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,630
Still within acceptable limits.

91
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,760
<i>Enemy arrival:</i>
<i>9 hours, 55 minutes.</i>

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,030
Talk about you high
pressure situations!

93
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,200
Why don't we just raise
a white flag?

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Before we resort to that,

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,870
there's one little thing
I'd like to try.

96
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,480
You want a sniper to shoot the
target from outside its firing zone?

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,410
Yes, Sir.

98
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,810
Instead of trying to neutralize
the target's AT field,

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,550
I believe a pinpoint shot with a
high-energy beam is the only way.

100
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,090
What do the Magi say?

101
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,520
The responses from the
Magi Super Computers

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,990
were two affirmative and one
conditional affirmative.

103
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,060
Our probability of success
is 8.7 percent.

104
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,430
It's the highest value we could get.

105
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,170
I see no reason to reject the plan.
You may proceed, Captain.

106
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,900
Yes, Sir.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,070
You know how crazy this whole
operation is, don't you,

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,870
Operations Director Katsuragi?

109
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't be rude. It's not crazy!

110
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,610
It can be executed within the
nine hours we have left,

111
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,950
and has the highest
chance of success.

112
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,380
It does? Really?

113
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,460
But our positron rifle can't
handle such high output.

114
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,520
What are you going to
do about that?

115
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,290
We'll borrow one of course.

116
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,160
Borrow one? You don't mean...

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,420
Yeah! The Strategic Self Defense
Force Lab's new prototype!

118
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,140
NERV is hereby requisitioning this
Self Propelled Positron Cannon

119
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,870
as of 15:00 today.

120
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,110
But this is ridiculous!

121
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,220
We'll try to return this in as close
to its original condition as we can.

122
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,690
Thank you for your cooperation!

123
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,180
Okay, Rei! Take it away!

124
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,120
Be careful. That's a piece
of precision machinery!

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Ma'am? Our calculations
show that it will take

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,000
at least 180 million kilowatts
to penetrate that AT field.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,130
Where in Japan are you going to
to get that much electricity?

128
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,080
From all of Japan. We'll take it all!

129
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,250
<i>We apologize for interrupting</i>

130
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,290
<i>our regular programming for
<i>this Emergency Bulletin.

132
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,920

<i>Repeat, from 11:30 PM tonight</i>
<i>until tomorrow morning</i>

<i>We appreciate your cooperation.</i>

138

<i>The drill has just broken through</i>
<i>the seventh defensive layer.</i>

139
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,820
What's the status on our
energy supply?

140
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,560
3.2% behind schedule, but we
should be finished by 23:10.

141
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,290
And the positron rifle?

142
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,930
For the honor of Technology
Development Department 3,

143
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,930
we're betting that we'll have
it built in three hours.

144
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,300
And how's our defense coming?

145
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,600
Well, using a shield is
about all we can do.

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,640
So, this is the shield?

147
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,010
Yes. It was part of a single
stage trans-orbital rocket.

148
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,410
It may look ugly, but it's got an
electromagnetic base coating that

149
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,450
Section 2 guarantees will stand
up to the enemy's particle beam

150
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,920
for at least seventeen seconds.

151
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Good. Have you determined
the sniper position?

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,860
Given the location of the target,
taking geographical features and

153
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,560
power access into consideration,
this would be our best choice.

154
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,700
Right. Looking good.

155
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,200
Our sniper will attack from
the top of Mount Futago!

156
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,330
The Operation will commence,
at 00:00 tomorrow morning!

157
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,440
From this point on, this operation
will be called "Operation Yashima".

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,870
Roger.

159
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,900
Now, the only remaining
problem is the pilot.

160
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,620
Unit 01's designated pilot
is conscious now.

161
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,660
His examination results
look normal.

162
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,700
Good. Then, the operation
will proceed as planned.

163
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,860
Roger.

164
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,030
But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,660
Let's get to Mt. Futago now!

166
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,180
<i>Central Hospital,</i>
<i>Intensive Care Unit</i>

167
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,590
Ayanami...

168
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,090
I'm here to brief you on the
Operation Yashima timetable.

169
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,690
The operation will begin at
midnight, 00:00 hours.

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,300
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami will arrive
at the cage by 17:30.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,570
At 18:00, Units 01 and 00
will activate.

172
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,910
At 18:05, both units
must be deployed.

173
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,180
They will arrive at the temporary
base on Mount Futago at 18:30.

174
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,880
There, they will await
further orders.

175
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,540
The Operation will begin
promptly at midnight.

176
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,810
This is the new one.

177
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,830
Don't show up looking like that.

178
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,960
Sorry.

179
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,840
I've been apologizing
since yesterday.

180
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,100
Your meal.

181
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,490
I don't want to eat anything.

182
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,120
We'll be departing in
sixty minutes.

183
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,690
Do I really have to pilot
the Eva again?

184
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,090
Yes, you do.

185
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,700
I don't want to.

186
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,230
Maybe you can be so
cool about it,

187
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,030
because you haven't had the kind
of experiences I've had yet.

188
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,010
I don't want to go through it again.

189
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,100
Then, you can stay here in bed.

190
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,640
What do you mean by that?

191
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,750
I'll pilot Unit 01.

192
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,250
Dr. Akagi is already prepared to
rewrite the personal data files.

193
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,160
Ritsuko is...

194
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm leaving. Captain Katsuragi and
Dr. Akagi are waiting for me.

195
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,260
Goodbye.

196
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
NEON GENESIS
EVANGELION

197
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,150
They're really late. We ought
to evacuate to the shelter.

198
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,790
I hacked into my dad's data files.

199
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,930
I'm sure this is the time.

200
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,050
Why aren't they here then?

201
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,540
The mountain is moving.

202
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,030
The Evangelions!

203
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,580
Cool!

204
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:08,150
Go for it, Evangelions! We believe
in you! Beat the Angel!

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,600
<i>The drill has penetrated through</i>
<i>the 17th layer of armor.</i>

206
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,770
<i>It will reach headquarters</i>
<i>in 3 hours 55 minutes.</i>

207
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,710
<i>Power supply transfer from</i>
<i>Shikoku and Kyushu is completed.</i>

208
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,570
<i>Beginning tests of each</i>
<i>cooling system.</i>

209
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,100
This is a very delicate piece of
machinery! Handle it carefully.

210
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,250
This thing wasn't built for field
operations. Will it really work?

211
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,460
There's no choice. This is the most
expedient way of attaining our goal.

212
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,960
Are you sure it's safe to use?

213
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,490
Theoretically, yes.

214
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,030
However, we're not sure if the
cannon barrel and accelerator

215
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,300
will be able to handle
the stress or not.

216
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,360
This is the first time it's been fired
with such a high power output.

217
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,970
Here are the battle plans
for the operation.

218
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,610
Shinji...

219
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:57,870
Yes.
Shinji...

220
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,170
Yes.
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

221
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,340
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

222
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,410
Right.

223
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,950
Rei, you will cover him
with Unit 00.

224
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
Right.

225
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,220
This is because Shinji has a higher
sync ratio with Unit 01,

226
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,890
and this operation will require
exceptional precision.

227
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,720
Since the positron beam will be
influenced by the Earth's gravity,

228
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,430
magnetic fields and rotation, it
will not fire in a straight line.

229
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,660
You must remember to make
adjustments for these deviations.

230
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,730
You must penetrate the
core precisely.

231
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,740
But I've never practiced this!

232
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,140
Don't worry.

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,170
Just do what the manual says.

234
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,210
When the indicators converge in
the center, pull the trigger.

235
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,710
The computers will
handle the rest.

236
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,080
Also, be aware that before you can
fire the rifle a second time,

237
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,920
you'll have to wait for the unit to
cool, replace the fuses and reload.

238
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,090
And if I miss? Or if the
enemy shoots back?

239
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,330
Don't think like that.

240
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,950
You must destroy it with
your first shot.

241
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,670
<i>So I have no choice.</i>

242
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,900
I...

243
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,270
I'm just to defend Unit 01, correct?

244
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes.

245
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,610
Understood.

246
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,710
It's time. Get geared up.

247
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,200
Right!

248
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,790
Maybe...

249
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,280
...this is our last day alive.

250
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,380
Why do you say that?

251
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,230
You won't die.

252
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,630
I'll protect you.

253
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,980
Why do you pilot this?

254
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,450
Because I'm bonded to it.

255
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,280
Bonded?

256
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,780
Yes, it's a bond.

257
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,360
You mean to my father?

258
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,520
To all people.

259
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,370
You're very strong, Ayanami.

260
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,340
I have nothing else.

261
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,200
What do you mean, "you
have nothing else"?

262
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,570
It's time. Let's go.

263
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,980
Goodbye.

264
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,990
<i>The time is now 00:00.</i>

265
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,410
Commencing operation.

266
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,640
Shinji, we're entrusting you with
all the energy of Japan.

267
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,580
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

268
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,140
Understood.

Don't say... Don't say that
you have nothing else.

319
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,330
Don't say goodbye when you leave
on a mission. It's too sad.

320
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,920
Why are you crying?

321
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm sorry. I don't know what to do
or feel at a time like this.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,860
Why don't you try smiling?
