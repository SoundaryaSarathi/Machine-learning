Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.08,0:05:25.92,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Is it the burning fire of passion?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.34,0:05:29.07,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Or a relaxed, cool-guy water type?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.07,0:05:31.18,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Or maybe a gentle wind, \Nblowing across the plain?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.50,0:05:34.58,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Or is it solid, reliable earth?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.43,0:05:40.73,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,What is shadow, anyway?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.00,0:05:42.43,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Weren't there only four attributes?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.43,0:05:44.06,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This is a category error!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.06,0:05:46.11,Default,Puck,0000,0000,0000,,In addition to the four basic attributes,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.11,0:05:47.95,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,there's also shadow and light.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.24,0:05:50.64,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Is it actually some amazing ability?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.64,0:05:52.70,Default,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,Like a talent only seen once \Nin five thousand years?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.08,0:05:55.58,Default,Emilia,0000,0000,0000,,With shadow magic,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.72,0:06:02.13,Default - italics,Subaru,0000,0000,0000,,It's just debuffs?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.32,0:06:04.89,Default,Puck,0000,0000,0000,,An easy one would be something like Shamac.
