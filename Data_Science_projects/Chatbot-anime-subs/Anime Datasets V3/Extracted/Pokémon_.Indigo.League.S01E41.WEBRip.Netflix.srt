You're superheroes?

not to frighten the customers.

I didn't mean to scare anyone.

I know, but we're here to help trainers

-not scare them away.
-[both] Huh?

of this Pokémon pharmacy?

Yes, with my grandma.

00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,474
I'm interested in Pokémon potions.
If you're not doing anything tonight,

88
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,976
maybe we could have dinner together
and talk about them.

Hm. Are all three of you Pokémon trainers?

how about a Pokémon battle?

-Huh?
-Okay, you can battle with me.

93
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,654
That's great. We can battle out back.

94
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,742
-To protect the world from devastation.
-To unite all peoples within our nation.

95
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,119
Yeah, well, unite all people
after that girl comes out.

-[James] Who do you mean?

Now, wait, Meowth.

99
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,419
Don't forget our mission
is to capture Pikachu.

100
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,464
-Huh?
-She's captured my heart.

-Paras? Paras.

108
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,484
Paras, you can't give up already.

109
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,779
Seems like your Pokémon
doesn't want to battle us.

110
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,282
You're right.
I'd love for Paras to evolve

111
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,242
into a Parasect very soon.

112
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,702
But it's too cowardly to battle.

113
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,330
The best way for Pokémon to evolve
is by winning battles.

114
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,916
The more battles they win,
the quicker they evolve.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,168
But what do you want to make Paras evolve
so fast for?

116
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,005
Because I have to have
Parasect's mushroom.

117
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,007
Why do you need Parasect's mushroom?

118
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,135
You see, after Paras evolves,

119
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,680
I'll use its mushroom to make a new potion
especially for Pokémon,

120
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,474
and I'll use the new potion
to help Pokémon all over the world.

121
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,977
She's too terrific to be human.

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,981
That's it, I'd give up all nine lives
to make Cassandra's dream come true.

-He's going to make a fool of himself.
-Oh, I understand.

this Cassandra is the cat's Meowth?

That ain't funny!

126
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,951
Don't be shy.
I know exactly how you feel about her.

127
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,494
You don't think I'm an idiot?

128
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,790
You might say that Cassandra's one female
who really knows how to treat a feline.

129
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,876
I was so unprepared for love.

130
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,379
Well, cupid's arrow strikes
when you least expect it.

131
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,301
Help me catch, Pikachu,
you two lovebird brains.

132
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,720
Just this once,
since it's for a good cause,

133
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,639
we're going to let Paras win, okay?

134
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,932

What's the matter, Ash?

139
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,744
-Electric shock might be overdoing it.
-Yeah, you might be right.

-Look, Paras is making the first move.
-Paras.

Pikachu, thunder shock.

142

Or, uh, maybe just a teeny static bolt.

But it was humiliating.

00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,476
What a pathetic Paras.

149
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,437
How will Paras ever get any experience?

-Pika.
-Oh, this is a tough one.

151
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,316
What am I supposed to do now?

152
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,987
Look up, Paras' type,
and we'll just choose a weaker opponent.

153
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,363
Good idea.

154
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,866
[Pokédex] <i>Paras has qualities</i>

155

I choose you, Charmeleon!

170
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,122
-Char.
-Your turn, Charmeleon. Go easy on it.

171
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,707
Char.

172
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,333
-Pika.
-Charmeleon?

173
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,502
Charmeleon doesn't look like a loser.

174
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,797
-Char.
-Paras.

175
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,008
It's okay, hang in there.

176
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,303
-Char.
-No, stop, Charmeleon.

177
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,766
-Char.
-Paras.

178
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,351
-Char.
-Paras.

179
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,436
[all] Oh.

180
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,774
-Paras, Paras.
-Paras, wait.

181
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,526
-Char. Char.
-What are you doing, Charmeleon?

182
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,278
-Char.
-Ah!

183
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,530
Oh, that wasn't nice.

184
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,533
-Char.
-Charmeleon.

185
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,910
It's way out of control.

186
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,496
Pikachu!

187
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,915
[moans]

188
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,376
-Pika.
-Oh. Thanks, Pikachu.

189
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,298
-Ash.
-Are you okay, Ash?

190
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,424
Uh...

191
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,301
Oh, dear, Paras has run away.

192
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,179
I didn't want to beat it.

193
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,974
Mm-hm, it's my fault for challenging you
to a Pokémon battle.

194
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,646
I was so happy when Charmander evolved,
but now I'm not sure I was ready for it.

195
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,024
Oh, Ash,
worry about your stupid Charmeleon later.

196
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,859
We've got to look for Cassandra's Paras.

197
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,820
You're right, let's get going.

198
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:17,200
Paras, Paras, Paras.
Paras, Paras, Paras, Par... Paras?

199
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,413
Paras.

200
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,623
Huh.

201
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,084
[Cassandra] Did you find Paras?

202
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,460
[Misty] No, we didn't.

203
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,255
There's no sign of it anywhere.

204
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,299
I'm really sorry.
This was all my fault.

205
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,884
-[Cassandra] No, Ash.
-Pika?

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,010
It's not you.

207
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,222
Poor Paras doesn't have any confidence
in its own abilities.

208
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,181
Oh.

209
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,726
Uh, so, what about this potion?
Uh, what's it supposed to do?

210
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,064
Um, I'm trying to come up
with a miracle potion.

211
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,065
[Pikachu squeals]

212
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,110
One that'll not only restore
a Pokémon's defensive powers,

213
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,530
but its attack power, concentration,
and its determination as well

214
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,157
and make it smarter, too.

215
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,660
-You're trying to make a smart potion?
-Pika.

216
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,829
When it's done,
you should give Ash a taste.

217
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,289
[chuckles]

218
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,625
I want all Pokémon to grow
and stay healthy.

219
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,587
That's why I need Paras to realize
how important it is

220
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,838
and to believe in itself.

221
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,341
-[both] And?
-And... and what?

222
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:20,305
And if James and I help this worthless
little Paras, what's in it for us?

223
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,264
What do we get?

224
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,308
I'll tell you what you get.

225
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,768
If you two make this Paras evolve,

226
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,271
then you could become rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

227
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,355
[both] Hmm?

228
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,776
Cassandra's miracle Pokémon potion
could make millions, maybe even zillions.

229
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,904
[both] Mm-hm, mm-hm.

230
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,531
And how do we get rich from her potion?

231
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:43,202
Once me and her are a cozy twosome,
she'll make me her company mascot.

232
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,497
-We're thrilled for you.
-But we won't get rich.

233
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,918
I was planning on making you two
my business managers.

234
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,128
I'll have a lot of money to manage.

235
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,131
But if you'd rather not, I'll understand.

236
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,216
[both] Hmm.

237
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,020
[James] Just imagine,
we'll have more money than we can count.

238
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,773
[Jessie] We can count on that.

239
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,067
[laughter]

240
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,194
Who cares about cash?

241
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,196
I just want to spend
the rest of my nine lives

242
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,490
with that trainer of yours, Cassandra.

243
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,494
I can picture it now, her and me
sitting on a porch on summer nights.

244
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,998
Who would have thought living with a human
could be so purr-fect.

245
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,045
[laughs] Ah. Ah!

246
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,421
What's the idea?

247
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,131
Stop daydreaming.

248
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,592
Hurry up, we want to get rich quick.

249
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,553
I can't do that
unless you lend me Arbok and Weezing.

250
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,180
What do you need those two for?

251
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,599
Hmm, 'cause losing battles
is their specialty.

252
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,351
He's got a point.

253
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,312
They're bigger losers
than the guy who invented homework.

254
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,690
How did we get stuck with such rejects?

255
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,191
Arbok.

256
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,943
-Paras?
-[meows]

257
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,361
Arbok.

258
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,156
Paras? Paras, Paras.

259
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,077
Congratulations to our champion.
That was stupendous, Paras.

260
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,621
-You're a heavyweight.
-Paras.

261
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,707
Now let's bring on our next challenger.

262
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,958
[wheezing]

263
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,127
-Paras?
-Meowth.

264
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,294
[groans]

265
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,338
Paras?

266
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,048
-Paras, Paras.
-[groans]

267
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,175
It looks like another knockout.

268
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,970
Slow down, tiger.
Don't get too much experience.

269
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,555
Paras.

270
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,474
-Hey, I think it's going to evolve.
-Paras. Paras. Paras.

271
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,143
-Oh.
-Needs more victories.

272
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,978
Let's see if it's tough enough
to defeat me.

273
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,147
-Put them up, champ.
-Paras.

274
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,399
Ouch. Oh, Meowth.

275
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,317
I'm a goner. You're too strong.

276
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,278
Paras, Paras, Paras.

277
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,779
Paras, Paras, Paras.

278
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,990
Paras, Paras. Paras.

279
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,617
A few lousy wins
and it thinks it's Tarzan.

280
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,952
It's got confidence.

281
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,705
-Hey, Paras.
-It's the brats.

282
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,750
Maybe they can help us
get Paras to evolve.

283
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,252
-[Brock] Come on out. Hey, Paras.
-[Cassandra] Hey, Paras.

284
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,171
-Paras.
-Paras.

285
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,173
It's Paras.

286
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,758
There you are.

287
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,092
How'd it get up in that tree?

288
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,677
Paras, Paras.

289
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,181
It's acting strange.
I've never seen it act like this before.

290
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,724
I wonder what happened.

291
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,601
Maybe it's Paras' sparring partner.

292
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,478
-Paras.
-Pikachu.

293
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,481
-Paras, Paras.
-I think it wants to battle.

294
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,233
Oh, Paras,
you finally understand my dream.

295
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,193
That's excellent.

296
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,613
Pikachu, it's time to help Paras
evolve into Parasect.

297
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,448
Pikachu.

298
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,617
My plan is going to work.

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,452
-If it wins...
-We'll be rich.

300
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,372
-Get it, Paras.
-Paras.

301
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,999
Remember, Pikachu, go easy on it.

302
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,710
-Pikachu. Pika-pi.
-Paras. Paras.

303
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,171
Pika!

304
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,839
Pika. Pika...

305
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,051
Pikachu, mm-mm-mm.

306
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,136
Pika, pika.

307
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,596
Par?

308
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,557
-Paras, Paras, Paras.
-That's great, Paras wins.

309
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,851
-Paras.
-Paras sure looks proud of itself.

310
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,478
If you keep battling it like this,

311
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,440
then Paras is almost sure to gain
enough experience to evolve into Parasect.

312
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,566
Yes.

313
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,279
Charmeleon, one more time!

314
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,156
Char.

315
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,951
Charmeleon, I'm counting on you this time.

316
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,244
Char.

317
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,248
Hey, what's the matter?
Charmander was always totally obedient.

318
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,501
[laughs] Its trainer needs experience.

319
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:23,172
If the trainer is poor, the Pokémon
won't respect him and won't obey orders.

320
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,590
Oh.

321
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,844
Call it back. We quit.
Charmeleon's too strong.

322
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,222
-Charmeleon, return.
-Char.

323
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,223
See.

324
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,850
Charmeleon won't obey Ash.

325
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,854
-Char. Char.
-Paras, Paras.

326
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,188
Knock it off, Charmeleon.

327
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,691
Please, stop.

328
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,527
I got to do something to help Paras win.

329
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,363
-Meowth is right.
-Our zillions depend on it.

330
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,699
-Char.
-Paras.

331
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,035
-Paras, you can beat it.
-Paras?

332
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,037
What are you all doing here?

333
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,289
It's Team Rocket.

334
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,793
We're the official Pokémon pep squad,
here to cheer on our hero.

335
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,378
[Jessie and James] Go, Paras.

336
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,256
Paras, don't forget all the training
we gave you.

337
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,924
You're pumped for victory.

338
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,302
-There's no way you can lose.
-You're a winner.

339
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,305
They really helped train Paras?

340
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,725
Let's hear it. Give a cheer for our ace,
the great Paras!

341
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,895
[all] Paras. Paras. Stomp and stamp.

342
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,356
-You bet.
-[all] Paras. Paras. That's our champ.

343
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,941
Oh.

344
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,110
Char.

345
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,321
[all groaning]

346
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,241
Paras. Par? Paras!

347
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,953
Char, char, char,
char, char, char.

348
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,413
[all groan]

349
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,333
Paras. Paras. Paras. Par...

350
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,669
-Oh!
-Don't do it, Charmeleon.

351
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,339
-Char.
-Par.

352
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,304
[all] Huh?

353
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,932
Paras?

354
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,101
Oh.

355
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,354
[all] Wow.

356
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,859
[all] Oh!

357
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,027
Pika.

358
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,616
-Parasect.
-Oh.

359
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,035
-Wow.
-It really evolved.

360
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,248
[Pokédex] <i>Parasect, the mushroom Pokémon,</i>
<i>it battles using poison spheres</i>

361
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,042
<i>that spread from the mushroom canopy</i>
<i>on its back.</i>

362
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,961
We're all proud of you, Parasect.

363
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,214
I never doubted you.
Great job, Parasect.

364
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,632
Yahoo.

365
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,425
All aboard the gravy train.

-[laughs]
-Char.

368
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,391
Team Rocket's blasting off again!

369

Char.

370
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,979
-Parasect, stay back.
-Parasect.

371
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,605
Char.

372
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,567
What's that?

373
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,486
It's Parasect's special attack.
It's using spore attack.

374
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,905
[groans]

375
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,032
That's amazing. One spray.

376
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,410
If Parasect's spore attack
is that effective,

377
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,453
it'll definitely make a powerful potion.

378
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,913
Charmeleon, return now.

379
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,960
Looks like you have to evolve
into a better trainer, Ash.

380
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,670
Next time I'll be fine.

381
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,422
Pika, pika.

382
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,092
Thanks for helping me, Parasect.
I knew I'd be able to count on you.

383
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,051
Parasect.

384
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,597
Now it's my turn to help.
I'm going to make my miracle potion

385
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,308
and help improve
all the Pokémon in the world.

386
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,684
Parasect.

387
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,772
I'm sorry we caused
so much trouble for you all.

388
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,359
Well, losing on purpose
is the toughest thing we've ever done.

389
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,445
-Isn't it, Pikachu?
-Pikachu.

390
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,656
You'll keep on losing
if you don't bring up your skill level.

391
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,408
You promised to be nice, Grandma.

392
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,826
[Grandma laughs]

393
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,829
Let us know when you finish
your new potion, Cassandra.

394
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,914
I'll be your first customer.

395
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,333
See you later.

396
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,294
Thanks again.
Good luck on your journey, everyone.

397
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,590
Goodbye. Good luck.

398
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,384
[narrator]<i> And just as Ash and friends</i>
<i>are saying goodbye,</i>

399
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,802

400

[all groan]

401
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,640
Huh?

402
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,185
I'm so happy. I got to be the luckiest cat
in the entire universe.

403
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,437
A little tighter, please. [chuckles]

404
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,857
-Parasect.
-And here's my star pupil

405
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,777
who went from chump to champ
in record-breaking time.

406
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,445
How can we ever repay you?

407
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,864
Thanks to you,
we'll make the greatest potion ever known.

408
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,409
It was nothing after you cooled me off,
it was the least I could do.

409
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,162
-She's falling for it.
-We'll be rich.

410
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,374
Now that fate's thrown us together
to help the Pokémon of the world,

411
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,126
I guess it's only natural
to make me your company mascot--

412
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,836
-Never!
-Huh?

413
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,840
I'd never tear you away from Team Rocket.
You're a superhero team, aren't you?

414
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,593
-Well, we are super.
-And a team.

415
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,638
It was super heroic
to help out with Paras like that.

416
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,431
-Then why--
-[Grandma] We've already got

417
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,850
-a company mascot anyway.
-Huh?

418
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,061
Persian.

419
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,689
I found this Persian
snoozing in the backyard.

420
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,232
It's adorable.

421
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, Meowth, I promise to pamper
this Persian just like it was you.

422
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,613
Now you can go on being a superhero.

423
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,783
-There go our billions.
-And zillions.

424
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,204
I'm a hero, but I got zero.
