1
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,273
Here, say aah.

2
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,482
How is it?

3
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:15,884
Yeah, this is tasty!

4
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:19,088
Really? These fruits are
a Germanian specialty.

5
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:22,524
Hey! Don't feed
someone else's familiar!

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,994
Oh, it's all right.

7
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,796
We all get bored when it's
study hall all the time.

8
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:31,527
Well, the whole thief hubbub means
no time to hold classes, I'm sure.

9
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,136
But it sure is a big deal.

10
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:38,539
I hear rumors that Princess Henrietta
may have to take responsibility.

11
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,377
The reason why Fouquet
could sneak in was

12
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:45,814
because they pulled the few guards
they had to guard the Princess, right?

13
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:50,052
In the first place, I hear that she
had decided to visit the Institute,

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,646
pushing aside all objections
from her advisors...

15
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,381
Princess...

16
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,027
Miss Vallière!

17
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,495
Miss Tabitha!

18
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,464
Come to the Principal's
office immediately!

19
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:11,473
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

20
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:19,812
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

21
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:30,352
The sky where two moons
never fade away

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,422
That's an impossibility, right?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,172
This is the first time I've
felt anything like this

24
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:48,977
I'm feeling more and more
at ease with this place

25
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:55,439
Even if you trip and
become depressed

26
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,887
I will always hold you
tight with a squeeze

27
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:09,765
The story where we met that day
stays hot with a sweet kiss

28
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:16,105
See, you can cast magic, and
the wishes will surely come true

29
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:22,044
A history of the couple's romance
that starts from the first kiss

30
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:30,543
You, the one who cast magic on
this destiny, suddenly appeared

31
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:38,893
A Thief's Identity

32
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,537
Why are you here?

33
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,839
It's all right. It sounds fun,
don't you think?

34
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,609
Upon questioning various
folk around town,

35
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,578
we have gathered information about
sightings of a suspicious shadow

36
00:02:56,578 --> 00:03:00,215
entering and leaving a deserted
shack deep in the woods.

37
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,810
You sure are quick with
your job, Miss Longueville.

38
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:08,812
From those testimonies,
I attempted to sketch it out.

39
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,163
How is it?

40
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:23,471
This is Fouquet!
There's no doubt about it!

41
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,012
Let's report this to the
Palace immediately.

42
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:34,283
We can ask the Royal Guards
to send men there.

43
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:37,586
If we drag our heels that much,
Fouquet will catch on to us.

44
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:40,889
We must get the Staff of Destruction
back with our own hands,

45
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,127
to regain the Institute's honor
that was tarnished by that thief!

46
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:48,153
Raise your staff, if you are
up for the challenge!

47
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,670
What's wrong?

48
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,663
Are there no nobles that want to raise
their fame by capturing Fouquet?

49
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:06,104
I'll go!

50
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,617
Miss Vallière!

51
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,517
I will go as well.

52
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:13,816
Zerbst!

53
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,859
I can't afford to lose
against a Vallière.

54
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,060
You know...

55
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,288
Tabitha?

56
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:24,589
You don't have to. This is a problem
between the two of us.

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,758
I'm worried about you two.

58
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,165
Tabitha!

59
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,540
Thank you.

60
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:39,272
Then I will leave it to the three of you.

61
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,651
These two have witnessed Fouquet.

62
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:48,757
On top of that, Miss Tabitha is a
Chevalier Knight, at so young an age.

63
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:49,758
A knight?!

64
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,623
Is that true, Tabitha?

65
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,632
Furthermore, Miss Zerbst is from

66
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:59,401
an established military
family in Germania.

67
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:03,963
I also hear that her flame magic
is very strong as well.

68
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,637
And...

69
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:12,848
Miss Vallière over here is
a daughter of the Vallière family,

70
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:17,615
which has had several
excellent mages, and... well...

71
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:21,381
She has a very bright future...

72
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:23,692
Oh, that's right!

73
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:26,828
I hear that her familiar is
an excellent swordsman who

74
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:31,265
overwhelmed Guiche de Grammont,
the son of General Grammont!

75
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,268
That's right! He has
the legendary Gund...

76
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:40,742
The Institute of Magic will be
looking forward to your hard work

77
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,835
as well as your duties as nobles!

78
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,055
Old Osman, I will serve as their guide.

79
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,891
Will you do so, Miss Longueville?

80
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,950
I had intended to from the start.

81
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,111
What?

82
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,781
She can use magic,
so Fouquet is a noble, right?

83
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,272
Why is a noble stealing
things as a thief?

84
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,788
It's not the case that
all mages are nobles.

85
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:31,760
For various reasons, many have been
demoted from nobility to peasants.

86
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,397
Among them, many disguise
themselves as guards,

87
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,093
or turn into criminals.

88
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:42,760
Even I am one of those that
has been demoted from nobility.

89
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:48,276
But, Miss Longueville, you're
Old Osman's secretary, right?

90
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:53,949
Mr. Osman isn't too picky
about noble or peasant.

91
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,884
Then what was the reason
you lost your nobility?

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,856
Isn't it all right?
I would like to hear it.

93
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,188
You're being rude, Zerbst!

94
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:07,863
I'm just having idle chitchat
because I'm bored.

95
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,133
Geez... For what sad reasons
do I have to come catch a thief...

96
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,761
Then you didn't need
to come out here.

97
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,109
It's because I'm worried
about my darling.

98
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,811
Right, Darling?

99
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,112
Yeah...

100
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:24,980
What about you?

101
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,516
What are you going to do if
a golem shows up again?

102
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:30,385
That should be obvious!
I'll get that thing with my magic.

103
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,521
Magic? Whose?

104
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,046
Don't make me laugh,
Louise the Zero!

105
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:40,295
Come on, don't come all the way
out here to have a fight.

106
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,092
Oh, Darling...

107
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,765
You forgot this.

108
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,905
Oh, but I have him with me.

109
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:53,909
Such a cheap thing won't
do you any good in a crisis.

110
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,774
Don't you think so?

111
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,437
Well, I don't exactly disagree...

112
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,847
But...

113
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,788
Do whatever you want.

114
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:09,291
See, you got permission
from your master.

115
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,781
Then, without hesitation...

116
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,533
According to the information,
it has to be that shack.

117
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,810
It's just an old
charcoal-burning shack.

118
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,074
It could be camouflage.

119
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:36,017
It seems like an empty house.

120
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,281
There doesn't seem to be
any place to hide.

121
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,782
There's nobody in there.

122
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,021
There seem to be no traps.

123
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,899
Tabitha!

124
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,895
I'll stand guard outside.

125
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,076
Yeah, please do.

126
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:04,204
Then I will scout the surroundings.

127
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:09,184
Let's do a once-over to see
if there are any clues.

128
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:11,243
Well, even if it's useless...

129
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,037
Oh, at this rate I'll be covered in dust.

130
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,835
Tabitha, Saito, let's go outside now.

131
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,905
Staff of Destruction.

132
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,188
What's the matter?

133
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,863
It's certainly the same box, but...

134
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,395
Louise?

135
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,364
A golem?!

136
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,276
Nied Iss Har...

137
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,246
Inn Ex Pet Flame...

138
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,049
Fire!

139
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,458
We're no match for it after all!

140
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,134
Where's Louise?

141
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,278
What are you doing?!

142
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,594
Run, Louise!

143
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,193
I will not!

144
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,036
Stop it! You're no match for it!

145
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,027
In the first place, you
can't cast spells...

146
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:13,331
I'm a noble!

147
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,279
You don't call someone a noble
because they use magic!

148
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,649
You call someone a noble who never
shows their back to the enemy!

149
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,174
I won't be called
Louise the Zero forever!

150
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,947
Tiel Nidul Thunder!

151
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,201
Don't get in my way!

152
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:48,109
Who cares if you're a noble?!

153
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,100
It's all over if you die, idiot!

154
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,408
I mean...

155
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:59,180
People always, always make
fun of me, and it's frustrating.

156
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,990
They'll make fun of me again
if I run away!

157
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,293
Hey, come on, don't cry.

158
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:08,421
And I won't be able to keep the
promise I made to the Princess...

159
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,768
Get on.

160
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,258
Kirche, please!

161
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:18,640
Get a grip!

162
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,572
You too.

163
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,112
It's all right! Go!

164
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,374
Saito?!

165
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,479
It sure makes me want to
do something about it.

166
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,123
Damn piece of dirt!

167
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,057
Don't underestimate me!

168
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,827
I'm the familiar of Louise the Zero!

169
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,604
You're kidding me!

170
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,646
Wasn't it a fine piece from Germania?!

171
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,215
Draw me, partner!

172
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:02,117
You'll break too!

173
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:05,086
If you don't want to die,
draw me! Don't you get it?!

174
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,621
All right! Shut up!

175
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:14,162
My body is so light.

176
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:17,393
It feels just like when
I was fighting Guiche!

177
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,701
What are you saying,
this late in the game?

178
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,067
Don't space out on me! It's coming!

179
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:32,308
What? It looks like he's
gotten agile all of a sudden.

180
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:41,156
Damn... I won't lose like this,
but I can't win either.

181
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,088
What should I do?

182
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:45,260
I have to do something!
Let me borrow that!

183
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,294
What the heck?!

184
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,784
Let me down!

185
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:50,461
Louise!

186
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,732
Get away from Saito!

187
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,243
The Staff of Destruction?!

188
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,301
It can't be!

189
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,408
Why?

190
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,743
Louise!

191
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,193
This isn't a magic staff!

192
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:19,626
You use it like this!

193
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:30,134
Take cover!

194
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:44,216
Amazing...

195
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,243
Why is something like that...

196
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,598
He's a peasant, but he
can use a magic staff?!

197
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:57,966
You really are my darling after all!

198
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,867
Oh, no, it's not that... My body
was moving on its own again.

199
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,503
Where is Fouquet?

200
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,975
If the golem was here,

201
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,840
that means she's somewhere close by.

202
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,481
Good job.

203
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:16,651
Miss Longueville,
where have you been?

204
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:19,420
"Staff of Destruction"
describes it well enough.

205
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,753
It blew my golem into dust.

206
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,593
My golem?

207
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,753
No way.

208
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:30,224
You're Fouquet?

209
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:32,331
Don't move!

210
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:34,736
Stealing it is well and good,

211
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,438
but I was in a bind because I
couldn't figure out how to use it.

212
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,941
I thought that if I brought
someone from the Institute,

213
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:43,044
I was sure to get good results.

214
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,979
That's why...

215
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:49,517
My guess was slightly off when
students came instead of instructors,

216
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:52,687
but I thought that the familiar
standing there could pull it off.

217
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,722
Nothing less from Gundolf.

218
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,257
Gundolf?

219
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:57,659
I give you my thanks.

220
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,785
Farewell.

221
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,492
Why?

222
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,365
Unfortunately, this is
a single-use weapon.

223
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,604
It's called a rocket launcher,

224
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,038
a weapon that came from my world.

225
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,308
So this ends our job... Right?

226
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,894
We have handed Fouquet
over to the Palace Guards,

227
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:36,431
and the Staff of Destruction is
once again secure in the vault.

228
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,066
That puts an end to the matter.

229
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,035
You all are the guests of honor
for tonight's banquet.

230
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,304
That is to be expected.

231
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,874
The Palace thinks very highly
of this incident.

232
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:51,012
I am sure that they will
reward the three of you.

233
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,015
A reward from the Palace?! Amazing!

234
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,280
Three? That means that Saito...

235
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,853
Unfortunately, since he
is not a nobleman...

236
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,092
I see.

237
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,660
I don't care about that.

238
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,061
Instead, I would like
to ask something.

239
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,329
I have to dress up really nicely today!

240
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:19,099
Saito...

241
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:23,044
I am not someone from this world.

242
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:26,411
I was unintentionally
summoned here by Louise.

243
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:30,685
The Staff of Destruction is
a weapon that exists in my world.

244
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:32,353
Where did you find it?

245
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,811
I see. That's how it is.

246
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:41,560
The Staff of Destruction is
a memento from a certain man.

247
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:47,360
I believe it's already been thirty years.

248
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,381
He had saved my life,

249
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:03,748
and was dressed in a peculiar
outfit that I'd never seen before.

250
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:07,455
That man had suffered
terrible wounds.

251
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,625
I brought him back to the Institute,

252
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,423
and gave him our best care, but...

253
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,727
He passed away?

254
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:24,405
In the end, I never figured out who
he was, or where he came from.

255
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:28,176
The man had two Staves
of Destruction on him.

256
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:32,780
I buried the staff that had
saved me with him in his grave,

257
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,418
and I offered the second
to the Palace.

258
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:40,788
To think that such a story was
behind the Staff of Destruction...

259
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:44,554
Dammit! I thought I finally found
a lead to finding my way back!

260
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,107
What's wrong, partner?

261
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:02,643
There's a party going on.
What's with the glum face?

262
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,112
Leave me alone.

263
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:06,647
I thought I would be able to go home,

264
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,581
but I didn't learn anything after all.

265
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,853
The daughter of Duke Vallière,

266
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:17,655
Miss Louise Françoise Le Blanc
de La Vallière, has arrived!

267
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:29,702
That's Louise, right?

268
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,572
Miss Louise!

269
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,199
May I have the...

270
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,914
Hey! Fine feathers
make fine birds, eh?

271
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,711
Quiet.

272
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,845
Why are you standing there,
looking dazed?

273
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,724
It's fine for me to do anything, right?

274
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:52,852
I haven't been given any orders
from my master today.

275
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,565
Something's starting.

276
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,260
Come on, you should go.

277
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,598
I wouldn't mind dancing with you.

278
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,639
Don't you mean, "May I please
have this dance?"

279
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,507
It's just for today.

280
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:25,287
Will you honor me with one song's
worth of a dance, gentleman?

281
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,253
Sure...

282
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,668
I'll pass after all. I've never
danced before anyway.

283
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:35,903
Just follow me.

284
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,138
Like this?

285
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,006
I'll believe you.

286
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,274
What's that?

287
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:44,078
That you came from another world.

288
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,740
What, you didn't believe me?

289
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,684
I had my doubts until now,

290
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:54,712
but that Staff of Destruction was
a weapon from your world, right?

291
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,284
Seeing something like that,
I have to believe you.

292
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:05,299
Hey, do you want to go back?

293
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,766
Well, yeah.

294
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,863
That makes sense.

295
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,574
Um, thank you.

296
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,579
What's up with this, so suddenly?

297
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,274
You're acting kinda strange today.

298
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,318
You saved me when I was
almost crushed by that golem.

299
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm just saying thanks for that.

300
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,211
What are you talking about?
Of course I did.

301
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,322
Why?

302
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,885
Because I'm your familiar.

303
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,202
This is a surprise.

304
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:43,971
A familiar that serves as his
master's dance partner...

305
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,168
I've never seen anything like it!
A real surprise!

306
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:11,662
As if I were under a real magic spell

307
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:22,733
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart

308
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:34,255
But each time I see you, I give you
a pointy, cold shoulder

309
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:45,359
Why do I act mean towards the one
that I think about the most?

310
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:57,302
My true feelings,
the shards of loneliness

311
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:08,211
In the deepest part of my heart,
I'm calling for you

312
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:14,451
For the day to start from zero

313
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,074
At the request of the Princess,

314
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:30,177
we hid our social status to find out
what's going on in the city.

315
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,178
Just you watch.

316
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,772
I'll uncover the injustices of
the city one after another!

317
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,183
What? Trés bien?
