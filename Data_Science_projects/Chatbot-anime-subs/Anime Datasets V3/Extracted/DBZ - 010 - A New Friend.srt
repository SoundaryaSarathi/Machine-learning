1
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:18,996
Oh, no! It's night already!

2
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,687
All right, now...

3
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,999
Mother!

4
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,002
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt!

5
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,004
This is what works best.

6
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:31,203
No, Father! Let's go home
and take some medicine!

7
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:34,346
It'll be fine. Here.

8
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:38,612
It hurts! It hurts!

9
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,253
All right, one more to go!

10
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,997
<i>Looks like it's all over.</i>

11
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>l would've liked to have gone up</i>
<i>against that guy one more time.</i>

12
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,806
<i>Oh, well...</i>

13
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,683
You're not very cheerful, huh?

14
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,018
You, huh?

15
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,546
Hitting three consecutive
home runs is incredible, isn't it?

16
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,305
Is there something
you're not satisfied with?

17
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:10,308
I'm not a baseball player.
I'm a martial artist.

18
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:15,507
I know that, but unless you have a job,
you can't make a living, right?

19
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,280
All right! Lucky, lucky!
Yamucha-<i>san</i>?

20
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:33,598
After the next guy, you'll be up!
I'll be counting on you to smash it!

21
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:36,294
There's a bonus in it for you!

22
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:41,339
Sure. Just leave it to me, coach.

23
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,009
I'll be sure to hit a home run,
just you watch.

24
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:51,015
<i>T</i>- <i>two million zeni!?</i>
<i>Damn, that's a lot...</i>

25
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,350
I'm counting on you!

26
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,113
Sure, sure.

27
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,319
That's pretty demanding...

28
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:06,058
Play ball!

29
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:15,640
I don't care... if it...
hurts you... let him hit you!

30
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,474
Get hit by the pitch...
and load the bases!

31
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:28,350
Strike!

32
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,326
So that's it, huh?

33
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,521
If you want to get hit so badly!

34
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,805
D- dead ball!

35
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,686
W- why, you! You hit me
on purpose, didn't you!?

36
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:05,290
Don't give me that!
You were trying to get hit!

37
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,624
Why you bastard!

38
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,091
You want to go at it!?

39
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:40,658
You mustn't, Yamucha-<i>sama</i>! If you go
in there, people are going to get hurt!

40
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:45,330
It'll be okay! I'll go
easy on them, okay? Ha-ha!

41
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,061
Ha-ha... But still...

42
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,193
Here, here! Here! Here!

43
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,642
You bastard!

44
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,614
Here, here!

45
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:03,948
<i>This one can handle himself!</i>

46
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:05,617
Kuririn!

47
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:06,951
Nice to see you after so long.

48
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,952
But why?

49
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:11,888
I'll explain it all later.
In any case, please come with me.

50
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,630
What!? You say Goku has died!?

51
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,258
Him and this Saiyan
both lost to each other.

52
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,493
But still, that's just like Goku.

53
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,972
Goku...

54
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,908
Oh, but please don't be
all that worried about him.

55
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,211
We can bring him back to life
with the Dragon Balls, after all.

56
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,371
Come on, hurry!

57
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:43,321
This isn't good, Yamucha-<i>sama</i>.

58
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:47,558
She's still mad about you
standing her up on your last date

59
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,327
because you didn't have any money.

60
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,997
T- this doesn't necessarily mean that
things are all patched up between us, okay?

61
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:57,335
This is a state of emergency, so I'm just
working together with you temporarily.

62
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:59,633
Yeah, I know that much.

63
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,276
If you were to apologize, though,
that would be another story.

64
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:11,282
Who, me? It doesn't bother me that
I'm not together with everyone else!

65
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,619
I don't care who comes attacking,
I can take them on myself well enough.

66
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,289
T- that might be so,
but it would be a shame!

67
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,293
Kami-<i>sama</i> said he was going to specially
train us up in the Heavenly Realm!

68
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,295
What!? Really!?

69
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,633
<i>T</i>- <i>training with K</i>- <i>Kami-sama!?</i>

70
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,535
That's okay. You don't have
to come if you don't want to.

71
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:38,635
W- what are you doing? Let's go, Pu-Erh!
Don't dawdle around! Come on, come on!

72
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,769
Ooh, that hurts!

73
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,016
I wonder how many days it has been.

74
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:24,921
If I don't step on it, a year will
have gone by just like that. All right...

75
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:32,754
Help!

76
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,461
But then, no one's going to help me.

77
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:42,222
I can't run away here.

78
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,513
That looks painful!

79
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,219
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

80
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,824
All right, now...

81
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:52,098
Ready, set... come on, you!

82
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:14,318
Ooh, yow... yow...

83
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:19,960
You mean it was stuck in this deeply?

84
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,704
I've got it!

85
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,377
Just hold on. It's almost done.

86
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,645
See?

87
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:52,591
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.
This is what works best!

88
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,778
Here. This ought to be enough-

89
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:30,101
Sure enough, it's just
like I read in books.

90
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,333
There are dinosaurs that
don't eat meat. All right, then...

91
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:54,692
It's been a long time
since I've been this fired up!

92
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:58,362
The fighting is going
to start up again, huh?

93
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,762
And there's only a
slim hope of us winning.

94
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,370
No, that's not necessarily so!
This time, we'll have Piccolo,

95
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,134
and Goku should be coming back
to life even stronger, after all.

96
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:16,313
On top of all that, we're going to be able
to undergo Kami-<i>sama</i>'s training!

97
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,482
T- that's right, huh?

98
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,987
Depending on how our training goes,
even we can still become stronger!

99
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,825
All right, let's do it!
I don't care who these Saiyan guys are,

100
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,995
I'm going to make sure that
<i>they're</i> the ones who are beaten!

101
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,054
That's the spirit, Yamucha!

102
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,004
What's this? They're getting
along fine after all.

103
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,801
Don't be jealous, don't be jealous!

104
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,007
Must be nice...

105
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,625
I know! Once he's feeling better...

106
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,906
Great! That'll be great!

107
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:25,346
I've gotten quite a
bit stronger too, huh?

108
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:41,157
All right, then!

109
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,313
All right!

110
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,094
It's no use.

111
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:26,644
I'm back!

112
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:32,549
Here, I've got lunch! But this time,
leave some for me, okay? Don't eat it all-

113
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,676
You, huh!?

114
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:09,279
Let go of him! He's hurt!

115
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,689
Let him go!

116
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,193
Shoot!

117
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:24,355
<i>Gohan learns for the first time</i>
<i>how harsh the laws of nature are.</i>

118
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:30,988
<i>However, he cannot shrink back now.</i>
<i>The Saiyans will not wait for him!</i>
