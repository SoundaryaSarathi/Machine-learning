<i>[Episode 48]</i>

3
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,139
If I remember correctly

4
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,695
70,000 years ago by Ruoshui Riverbank

5
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,840
there was one female general among
those who fought against Kunlun Mountain.

6
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,650
That was you?

7
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:44,231
Exactly. I'm from the Ghost Tribe.

8
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,578
Kunlun Mountain has no
dealings with the Ghost Tribe.

9
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,117
Please leave.

10
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:50,709
Please let me see Taoist Master Zi Lan.

11
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,992
Zi Lan?

12
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:57,198
Why would Zi Lan see
a demonic woman like you?

13
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,372
Please leave now.

14
00:02:58,372 --> 00:02:59,897
Please show me some mercy.

15
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,224
I'm not here to stir up any trouble.

16
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,394
I just wish to see Zi Lan.

17
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,539
I just wish to see him.

18
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,786
Young lady, although the Celestial Tribe
and the Ghost Tribe have reconciled

19
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:14,479
the disciples of Kunlun Mountain won't
forget the pain of losing our mentor.

20
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,288
I won't let you up the mountain.

21
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,900
If you take one more step forward

22
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,468
you'll be trespassing in the sacred area
of the Celestial Tribe.

23
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,468
I beg you to...

24
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,270
High Immortal,
please show her some mercy.

25
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,814
My sister has no intention
of trespassing.

26
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:29,508
She's here on my behalf to seek
an audience with High Immortal Zi Lan.

27
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:33,978
The Ghost Lord would so craftily sneak
into the Celestial Tribe's sacred area?

28
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:40,349
My sister and I came today to
borrow Kunlun Mountain's elixir cauldron.

29
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,021
Why would you turn us away?

30
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,187
The Celestial Tribe and Kunlun Mountain
are not the same.

31
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,831
We honor High God Mo Yuan.

32
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,322
We won't reconcile
with your tribe.

33
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,289
Never.

34
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,962
Li Jing!

35
00:03:57,962 --> 00:03:59,050
You mustn't!

36
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,701
Don't you see that
he's going to kill us?

37
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,858
No, don't!

38
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,308
This is our only chance.

39
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:06,064
We mustn't offend them.

40
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,477
I have to see Zi Lan!

41
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,550
That's enough.

42
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:14,866
You mean so much more to me
than this child.

43
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,016
Yan Zhi, what's wrong?

44
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,461
Why would you suddenly
barge into Kunlun Mountain?

45
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,771
Are you in some sort of trouble?

46
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,682
Constable...

47
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,939
Can I borrow
Kunlun Mountain's elixir cauldron?

48
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,504
The elixir cauldron?

49
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,677
I'm sorry, Yan Zhi.

50
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:00,012
I'm no longer the constable
in the Mortal Realm.

51
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:03,091
Now, I'm a disciple of Kunlun Mountain.

52
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,447
Before my senior and his disciples

53
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:10,211
please tell me why you need
to borrow our elixir cauldron.

54
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,286
To save this child.

55
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:19,305
I have to save him.

56
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,557
Master, forgive me for my insolence.

57
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:38,411
I have to use this elixir cauldron
once for the Ghost Tribe.

58
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,927
I'm ashamed to face you
and my fellow disciples.

59
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,853
Your disciple, Zi Lan, hereby swears...

60
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,997
that when Master returns

61
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:15,315
I'll spend my life guarding
the Sea of Innocence.

62
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,702
I'll never enter the Ghost Realm again

63
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:25,153
nor get in touch with
the demonic woman...

64
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,997
as a way to make up for my sins.

65
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,079
Ye Hua, I can't understand
your tactical formation strategy at all.

66
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:42,334
When I was studying under my mentor
at Kunlun Mountain

67
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:46,317
tactical formation strategy was
my least favorite subject.

68
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,480
My head now hurts just at the sight
of the tactical formation strategy.

69
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,038
My body hurts all over.

70
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:55,225
Then why are you still
sitting there so seriously?

71
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:01,713
I was worried that you might not
be able to hold the brush well

72
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:05,728
but now that I see you holding it so well

73
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,841
I can't help but want to take
a longer look at you.

74
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,254
Mother!

75
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,240
My Riceball is home!

76
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,446
He's holding so many things on his own.

77
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:19,880
Let him do it.

78
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:30,151
Mother!

79
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,218
Riceball, you're home.

80
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,823
Cheng Yu! This is my mother!

81
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:36,359
Isn't my mother very pretty?

82
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:41,884
So this is the Lady Cheng Yu
who dares to challenge her superior?

83
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:52,203
Your Highness,
can I touch Lady Qian Qian?

84
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,283
My mother belongs to my father.

85
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,273
Only my father can touch her.

86
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,813
Who are you to touch her?

87
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:04,205
All these years, this is the first time
I've ever met a female high god.

88
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,779
Why can't I touch her?

89
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,541
You're now teasing my wife
right in front of me.

90
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,264
Cheng Yu, you're getting even bolder.

91
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,230
Your Highness is so petty.

92
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,673
A-Li, what is it in your hands?

93
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:24,054
These are the sugar canes
I brought you from Sacred Mountain.

94
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,803
A-Li is the best. Come here.

95
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:34,668
When Jia Yun came to fetch me,
he kept reminding me

96
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,246
that Father's right arm is badly hurt

97
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,888
so I mustn't act willfully
and ask Father for a hug.

98
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,576
Father, does your arm still hurt?

99
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:44,600
It doesn't.

100
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:48,607
I can still hold you
with one arm!

101
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:50,009
Are you all right?

102
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,244
Be careful.

103
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,873
Don't worry.

104
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,701
Sometime soon I will be able to feel
my right arm again.

105
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,552
I know that your arm will recover soon.

106
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:02,981
It's just that you paint so well.

107
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,192
It would be such a pity if
you couldn't paint anymore.

108
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:08,253
Then Riceball and I would have
to get someone else to paint for us.

109
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,715
It would be so troublesome.

110
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,524
Should I paint you something now?

111
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,798
- Now?
- Yes.

112
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:17,650
Lady Qian Qian is so gorgeous.

113
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,625
Any ordinary artist
wouldn't dare paint her.

114
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:23,288
I'm afraid only Your Highness will
be able to capture her beauty.

115
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,057
You have the gift of gab.

116
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:27,331
Let's go, Riceball!

117
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:40,544
Cheng Yu.

118
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:42,111
Come and have a seat.

119
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,418
Yes.

120
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:10,744
I heard that High God is
Little Princess Feng Jiu's real aunt?

121
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:12,847
That's correct.

122
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:19,125
May I be so bold as to ask High God
to pass a message on to Little Princess?

123
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,995
Please tell her that I've gotten into
some trouble in the Nine Heavens.

124
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,145
I'd like Little Princess
to visit me here.

125
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:29,201
I'll send someone to pass on
the message immediately.

126
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:31,495
But she hasn't been
in the best mood lately.

127
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,663
I don't know if she will come.

128
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,889
High God won't have to worry about it.

129
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,667
Little Princess and I are very close!

130
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:43,830
You're that close?

131
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,283
No... It's just... Fate!

132
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:51,890
Fate brought us closer.

133
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,245
All right.

134
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,317
You can get some rest now.

135
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,066
Your Highness, I sat there
for such a long time

136
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,563
that my neck is almost twisted.

137
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:21,342
Why isn't even a corner
of my outfit in the painting?

138
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:25,283
Cheng Yu, why aren't you in it?

139
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,144
Ye Hua doesn't have enough
stamina these days.

140
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,957
It's very tiring to paint with
only one arm.

141
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:34,269
Please understand.

142
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:38,886
He doesn't have enough stamina?

143
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,636
What does that mean?

144
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,285
Does it mean that although
Father can hold A-Li

145
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:48,216
he can't hold Mother?

146
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,346
Ye Hua!

147
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:06,070
Cheng Yu, take A-Li back
to his hall to get some rest.

148
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:08,592
Ye Hua...

149
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:10,341
Yes...

150
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,261
Ye Hua...

151
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,471
Put me down quickly.

152
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,113
Ye Hua, I hope you don't mind

153
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,511
that I didn't want to go to
the Hall of Beautiful Youth.

154
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,134
What is it?

155
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,458
She is, after all, Riceball's mother.

156
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:50,183
Although I don't know why she left you
and jumped off Zhuxian Terrace

157
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:53,167
the dead should still be respected.

158
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:58,261
It wouldn't be appropriate
for us to... do it there.

159
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:59,804
I understand.

160
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,768
I... There's still one more matter.

161
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:07,129
Speak your mind.

162
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,508
I've already told Nai Nai
to lock away her things.

163
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:18,705
I also told myself not to
look at them in case I get upset.

164
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,812
I've already burned all her things.

165
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,717
There's one more matter.

166
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,986
Qian Qian, why do you have
so many matters to discuss today?

167
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:38,958
What I just mentioned are
all matters of the past

168
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,793
but this one matter that I am about
to say is very important.

169
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,028
Do you still remember
that when we were in the West Sea

170
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:00,985
I said I wanted to cancel our engagement?

171
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,206
I do.

172
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:18,245
Back then, I didn't really
look into my heart.

173
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:22,706
Don't take those words to heart.

174
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:27,522
Now that we share a mutual affection,
the engagement can't be canceled.

175
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,717
While I was bored in the West Sea

176
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,913
I looked into the auspicious dates.

177
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:37,976
The second of September is great
for weddings and constructions.

178
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:42,115
It's a good day for everything.

179
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,969
Why don't you tell Grandfather
that we'll get married on that day?

180
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,032
What did you just say?

181
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:02,399
I know that I might not
seem proper by saying that.

182
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,672
It's not ideal for you to bring it up.

183
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:09,726
Why don't my parents suggest the date?

184
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,625
After all, marriage is
an important matter.

185
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,669
It's best for the elderly to discuss it.

186
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:21,297
Qian Qian...

187
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:24,965
Say it again.

188
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,556
What is it you would do with me?

189
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,272
Ye Hua...

190
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:48,855
I love you.

191
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,527
I really do love you.

192
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,163
I want to be with you forever.

193
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,549
<i>Women of Qing Qiu are always very blunt.</i>

194
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,028
<i>We just say whatever we think.</i>

195
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:17,545
<i>He was raised in the very rigid
Celestial Palace.</i>

196
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:21,222
<i>Will he think of me as
too easy now that I said that?</i>

197
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,578
Qian Qian...

198
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,527
Give me another child.

199
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:59,163
70,000 years ago, I sat here
staring out at Kunlun Mountain

200
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,778
thinking of someone in there.

201
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,116
I often think to myself

202
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:09,031
that if I hadn't been born into
the Ghost Tribe as the second prince

203
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,497
everything would be great.

204
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,721
Are you referring to
High Immortal Si Yin?

205
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,228
Back then, I thought that
she was of the Celestial Tribe.

206
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,913
I thought that
it wasn't just the conflict

207
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:25,599
of both tribes that stood between us

208
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:32,311
but also the regulation that our tribes
are not to be joined in marriage.

209
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,563
You thought that she was
from the Celestial Tribe?

210
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,240
What do you mean by that?

211
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,700
Si Yin is a man of the Celestial Tribe!

212
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,885
Do you still not know?

213
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,791
Si Yin is Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.

214
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,740
High God Bai Qian.

215
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,425
High God Bai Qian?

216
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,894
So you weren't wrong to
fall in love with her then.

217
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:05,098
I was the one who got it wrong
about Si Yin?

218
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:09,905
I was too young then.

219
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:12,459
I admired him for his status
as a high immortal.

220
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:16,659
I thought that all men in
the Celestial Tribe

221
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,499
should be as cheerful and
candid as he was.

222
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,451
Be it love or hate

223
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:26,007
we should all break it off nice and
clean without any hesitation or tricks!

224
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,395
But now...

225
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:31,651
All right!

226
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:33,971
Now that I know she's a woman

227
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,926
she's still a high god who isn't
afraid to love or hate someone.

228
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,130
Exactly.

229
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,852
That's how A-Yin is.

230
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:47,084
If she wishes to break it off with you

231
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,843
she will do so nice and clean.

232
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,762
Without any hesitation.

233
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,233
Why aren't you asleep yet?

234
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,991
You already made me sore all over...

235
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,045
Qian Qian...

236
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,320
Yes?

237
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,943
<i>If it is as Li Jing said</i>

238
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:42,281
<i>the seal on the Bell of the East Emperor
will weaken once Mo Yuan returns</i>

239
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,950
<i>and Qing Cang will be able
to break free...</i>

240
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,295
<i>What will you do then?</i>

241
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,092
What is the matter?

242
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:01,565
70,000 years ago, if you had had
the chance to seal up the bell

243
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:05,997
would you really
have done it for Mo Yuan?

244
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,076
I'm deeply grateful to my mentor.

245
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:18,720
If I had had the chance to do that,
I'd definitely have done it.

246
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,351
None of the disciples of Kunlun Mountain
would hesitate to do that...

247
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:36,648
What is it?

248
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,753
Let's sleep.

249
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,443
Li Jing.

250
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,205
Why have you never taken
a good look at your child?

251
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:05,576
He should have died 300 years ago.

252
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,839
No! What wrong has he done?

253
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,743
He shouldn't be punished
in his mother's stead.

254
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:12,962
I believe that he'll wake up soon.

255
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:19,346
Be good, Uncle Zi Lan will
be here soon.

256
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:31,884
Zi Lan asked me to
bring you this elixir.

257
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,721
Zi Lan...

258
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:49,564
Zi Lan is...

259
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:56,096
This is the prescription
that Zi Lan wrote for you.

260
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,861
He said that you've lost
all your cultivation

261
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:07,116
so if you don't
nurse yourself back to health

262
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:10,604
on the 1st and 15th of each month
you'll ache so badly all over

263
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:12,250
that you won't be able to get out of bed.

264
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,905
We have helped you
with whatever we could.

265
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:21,148
Please don't come
to Kunlun Mountain again.

266
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,256
I'll take my leave now.

267
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:48,915
Feed it to my child.

268
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,859
Yes.

269
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:00,699
Ying'er. Be good.

270
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:01,903
Cry!

271
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:04,335
Cry! Come on. Be good.

272
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,255
He's awake.

273
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,769
Zi Lan, I really don't understand
how you could bear to use up

274
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:56,102
half of all your lifetime's cultivation.

275
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,655
That child has a strong,
evil aura around him.

276
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:02,192
Yan Zhi's cultivation isn't enough
to save his life.

277
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,557
I definitely had to use mine.

278
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,488
Women are indeed the source of trouble.

279
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,949
Second Disciple, why do you sound
more emotional than I am?

280
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:14,993
I don't think that it's so serious.

281
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:19,569
Now that the world is at peace,
too much cultivation is of no use.

282
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:23,835
I just need enough to safeguard
the Sea of Innocence.

283
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:38,781
Ye Hua!

284
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:50,314
What are you smiling at?

285
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,155
What are you smiling at?

286
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:12,384
Many others would mistake you
for my mentor but I never did.

287
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:18,905
Except for the first time I met you
in the Eastern Sea

288
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,279
when you gave me a bit of a shock...

289
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:25,895
you're actually very different
from my mentor.

290
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:27,233
Is that so?

291
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:32,903
My mentor's eyes aren't as dark as yours.

292
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,534
They aren't as calm as yours.

293
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,380
Tell me.

294
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,246
You're considered
quite young among the gods.

295
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,233
Why would you behave so much
like an elderly god?

296
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,365
Even more so than Lord Dong Hua?

297
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,976
You can keep looking for a while longer.

298
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,855
If you're tired, you can nap in my arms.

299
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,837
The sun has already risen.

300
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:08,371
Are you going to get up
or sleep for a while longer?

301
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:11,387
I'm a bit thirsty.

302
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:13,205
Get someone to make tea.

303
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,159
Sure.

304
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:06,623
Starting today

305
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,722
station someone to keep an eye on the
Bell of the East Emperor at all times.

306
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,722
Should there be any abnormal movement,
report back immediately.

307
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:15,650
Does Your Highness think
Qing Cang will break out soon?

308
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,407
You don't have to know about that.

309
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:19,614
Just heed my words.

310
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,663
Should there be any abnormal movement
in the bell, alarm no one else.

311
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:24,996
Come to me immediately.

312
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,202
Yes!

313
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:36,496
You said that you saw High God Bai Qian
drugging His Highness's tea?

314
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:40,036
Did you really see
High God Bai Qian do that?

315
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:43,089
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

316
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,953
How is that possible?

317
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:49,164
She's engaged to Ye Hua.

318
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:51,294
She wouldn't do that.

319
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:57,834
I've always had my doubts about
this high god and the Crown Prince.

320
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,990
Doesn't Your Highness feel the same way?

321
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,027
About what?

322
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,218
You may be dismissed.

323
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:08,218
Yes.

324
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,563
I still remember very clearly
what happened 300 years ago.

325
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,858
Doesn't Your Highness find it weird?

326
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:24,413
Back then, His Highness loved
that mortal so deeply.

327
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:27,481
For 300 years, he guarded
that Soul-gathering Lamp.

328
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,172
He was so keen on forging
a replica of her.

329
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:34,520
Why did that suddenly changed after
he took a trip to the Eastern Sea?

330
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,528
Even if he were to change his mind
that was simply too abrupt.

331
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:43,509
Now that you've said it,
it does coincide with what I think.

332
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,227
I've also been very worried.

333
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:48,917
Has Ye Hua been bewitched?

334
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:52,212
Why would he fall for another so quickly?

335
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,538
The Nine-tailed Fox Clan of Qing Qiu
is skilled at casting seduction charms.

336
00:29:56,538 --> 00:30:01,711
Perhaps, it was some seduction drug that
the maid saw her adding into the tea.

337
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:08,969
These are but speculations.

338
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:11,612
After all, she is a high god.

339
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:14,457
She's also engaged to Ye Hua.

340
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:16,587
She wouldn't stoop to that.

341
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:20,423
Even if Ye Hua feels nothing for her,
he still has to marry her.

342
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:25,676
I'm afraid that Your Highness isn't
aware of a something.

343
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,872
What else is there that is strange?

344
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,476
Before the Crown Prince went to
the Eastern Sea

345
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:35,512
Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu once
took on my form

346
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:38,554
and stole the Soul-gathering Lamp
from Zichen Hall.

347
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:40,167
What?

348
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,528
She stole the Soul-gathering Lamp?

349
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,069
That Bai Feng Jiu...

350
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:50,059
As a princess,
how could she do such a thing?

351
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:56,328
Why are you only telling me
about this now?

352
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:59,983
Third Prince and the Star Lord
came to apologize on her behalf.

353
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,691
They said that she was too playful and
stole the lamp for fun.

354
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:06,943
They asked me not to blame her anymore.

355
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:11,076
It was also for the sake of
Lord Dong Hua and the Star Lord

356
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,416
that this matter was resolved quietly.

357
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:17,368
I've heard that Bai Feng Jiu has
been fooling around in Taichen Palace

358
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:20,067
in the name of repaying kindness.

359
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,763
She wreaked such havoc in Taichen Palace.

360
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:26,701
I thought that Lord Dong Hua would
have disliked that little princess.

361
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:30,402
Who knew that he would be
so protective of her?

362
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,548
Lord Dong Hua's mind is unfathomable.
Who could have known?

363
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:39,239
But when I think of this matter,
I do find it fishy.

364
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,609
Your Highness, think about it.

365
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,468
Bai Feng Jiu first took away
the Soul-gathering Lamp

366
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:46,773
that had Su Su's blood and bones
growing in it.

367
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:49,839
Then Bai Qian met His Highness
in the Eastern Sea.

368
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,297
After His Highness met her
he immediately fell for her instead.

369
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:56,615
His Highness hasn't mentioned
making a replica of Su Su since then.

370
00:31:56,615 --> 00:32:01,250
Isn't this all too much of a coincidence?

371
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:05,359
It is indeed.

372
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,069
Therefore, whether or not

373
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:13,662
there is an engagement between
Bai Qian and His Highness

374
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,916
we must get to the bottom of this matter.

375
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:19,391
If Bai Qian is so manipulative

376
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:21,242
Your Highness should report this matter

377
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,094
to the Heavenly Lord
and the Crown Prince.

378
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:30,186
It's too dangerous to make this woman
the future Consort or Heavenly Empress.

379
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,115
Exactly!

380
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:37,517
However, these are still
just our speculations.

381
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:41,403
She is after all High God Bai Qian
and the Queen of Qing Qiu.

382
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,733
She is not one we can offend.

383
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:51,136
She has been to the Celestial Palace
twice without greeting me.

384
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,486
Today, I will go and visit her instead.

385
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:06,797
Mother, you're reading too quickly.

386
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:09,970
Why would a child read so carefully?

387
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,493
I'll tell you the story
when I'm done reading it.

388
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,749
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

389
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:33,060
You may all get up.

390
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:39,247
Greetings, Grandmother.

391
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,276
Get up quickly.

392
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:43,517
Yes.

393
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:50,915
Greetings, Crown Prince and High God.

394
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,000
High God Bai Qian.

395
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,093
Consort Le Xu.

396
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:58,656
According to the rites,
I should bow to greet a high god.

397
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:02,423
However, as you're marrying my son

398
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:06,385
the greeting formalities
between us can be overlooked.

399
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,414
I'll go with Ye Hua's order of
seniority in the family.

400
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,344
Bai Qian greets Consort Le Xu.

401
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:16,784
I'll accept the greeting from
my future daughter-in-law then.

402
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:23,550
Your Highness!

403
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:29,782
Ye Hua, you're always so busy with work.
Your tea has gone cold

404
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:31,869
before you had the time to drink it.

405
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,400
Why don't I get you a new cup of tea?

406
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,253
There's no need to go to such trouble.

407
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:39,594
This tea is at my preferred temperature.

408
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,577
You can't drink that tea!

409
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,188
What is wrong with this cup of tea?

410
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,512
I'm just worried that you'll feel unwell
from drinking cold tea.

411
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:56,728
You've only recently recovered
from a severe illness.

412
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:01,666
What if you get sick again
after having cold tea?

413
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:04,166
Mother, fret not.

414
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:07,362
Qian Qian made me this tea.

415
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:14,121
She added in the nourishing elixir
from High God Zhe Yan.

416
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:16,338
It's used for improving one's health.

417
00:35:16,338 --> 00:35:19,782
<i>How did he know that I added
in the nourishing elixir?</i>

418
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,034
I see.

419
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:28,476
High God is very thoughtful.

420
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,842
Your Highness need not be so polite.

421
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:36,447
After all, Ye Hua is my future husband.

422
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:39,726
I also hope that
he can fully recover soon.

423
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:45,715
Speaking of which, that reminds me
of your wedding.

424
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:49,637
High God has been to the
Nine Heavens twice already.

425
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:53,362
Now that you don't seem to
be leaving anytime soon

426
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:59,637
why don't we move the wedding date
forward and have it done soon?

427
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,844
First of all, that would comply
with the Celestial Tribe's tradition.

428
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:07,195
Secondly, this will fulfill the wish of
the Heavenly Lord and Ye Hua's father.

429
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,443
What do you think about that, High God?

430
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:16,192
Although I'm Qing Qiu's Queen,
my parents are still alive.

431
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:19,230
I have to ask them about my marriage.

432
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:21,507
Good!

433
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:25,065
I'll speak to the Heavenly Lord

434
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,849
to prepare for the wedding in advance.

435
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:29,920
After all, the marriage between the
Celestial Tribe and Qing Qiu's Fox Tribe

436
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,900
is one important occasion that
is not to be taken lightly.

437
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,768
Grandmother, A-Li likes you!

438
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:42,340
You mean that you don't usually like me?

439
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,532
I do but I like you the most today.

440
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:48,782
I've been looking forward to
their wedding.

441
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:52,916
Then A-Li can have a reason
to visit Mother.

442
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,445
If they don't get married
you can't visit your mother?

443
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,862
If they don't get married

444
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:00,996
Mother will have to worry about
the Celestial Tribe's regulations.

445
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,947
She has to sneak in here to visit Father.

446
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:07,362
Last time, she snuck into Father's
room late at night.

447
00:37:07,362 --> 00:37:11,610
If she has to do that every time, it
will be really hard for me to find her.

448
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,927
Ye Hua, why are you always so quiet?

449
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,487
As Mother said, this is indeed
an important occasion

450
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,297
for both the Celestial Tribe
and Qing Qiu.

451
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,891
The Heavenly Lord will have to discuss it
with the Fox King.

452
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:29,378
It can't be rushed.

453
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,250
It's good that you're aware of that.

454
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,398
I won't keep the Crown Prince from
handling official affairs now.

455
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:42,628
I'll take my leave.

456
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:47,197
Take care, Grandmother.

457
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,952
Go and read.

458
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:05,050
How did you know that I added
a nourishing elixir to your tea?

459
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:08,746
Even my mother knew that
there was something fishy with the tea.

460
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:12,824
If I didn't, wouldn't that make me
seem incompetent?

461
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:17,248
Consort Le Xu came here for that?

462
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:20,635
I was wondering why she rushed here
in such a panic.

463
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,775
There are so many regulations in
the Celestial Tribe.

464
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,327
They think too much.

465
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,784
Why are you looking at me like that?

466
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,681
It's nothing.

467
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:38,313
I just think that my trip to Yingzhou
of the Eastern Sea was worthwhile.

468
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:41,887
You now speak to me
so much more cheerfully.

469
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:45,903
I was like this when I was younger.

470
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:48,605
It's just that after 140,000 years

471
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:51,231
with everyone in the realms
addressing me as Auntie

472
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:53,599
I wouldn't dare speak too casually.

473
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:59,208
What are you going to
prepare for our wedding?

474
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,679
This is an important occasion.

475
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,394
We must discuss it carefully.

476
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:08,032
Lord Dong Hua just returned recently.

477
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,041
He has much to discuss
with the Heavenly Lord.

478
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:13,233
Once the Heavenly Lord has
some time to himself in a few days

479
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,735
I'll report to him about
holding the wedding.

480
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:20,012
<i>Who knows how long I will have to wait
for Mister Bottled Up to make a move.</i>

481
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:21,927
<i>I'd better bring this up to my brothers</i>

482
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,266
<i>so they can talk to Mother
and Father about it.</i>

483
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,835
<i>That should save him some
trouble when he approaches them.</i>

484
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,327
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

485
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:55,050
What are you doing?

486
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,387
Are you preparing for
Little Prince's birthday?

487
00:39:57,387 --> 00:40:00,346
The Crown Prince doesn't like
bright red colors.

488
00:40:00,346 --> 00:40:01,534
Change them.

489
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:04,139
The Crown Prince gave the orders himself.

490
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:06,715
The high god of Qing Qiu
is soon to be married into the palace

491
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:08,141
and we are to prepare for it.

492
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,483
That is true.

493
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:14,690
After all, she is the high god of
Qing Qiu and the legal consort.

494
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,438
Everything must be well prepared.

495
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:19,099
I'll have to discuss
the rites of marrying the legal consort

496
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:24,655
with Consort Le Xu and the Crown Prince
when I return to the palace.

497
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:26,894
Get going.

498
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:28,351
Yes!

499
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:43,155
Your Highness, when you married
into Xiwu Palace

500
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:45,478
there wasn't any wedding ritual at all.

501
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:50,047
It was even... even worse than when
you were the Heavenly Lord's concubine.

502
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,690
Everyone knows I have loved Ye Hua
since I was young.

503
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:02,215
There is no telling who will be
the future mistress of Xiwu Palace.

504
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,447
Yes, Your Highness!

505
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:09,746
Ye Hua.

506
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:11,793
You've decided to hold the wedding?

507
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:16,590
Let's discuss the betrothal gifts
and welcoming ceremony rituals.

508
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,248
- This is an important occasion.
- Yes.

509
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:22,224
Father, don't rejoice too soon.

510
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:25,918
Ye Hua still needs to withstand
a heavenly trial in the Mortal Realm.

511
00:41:28,538 --> 00:41:30,269
Why?

512
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,469
Yingzhou of the Eastern Sea's
four mythical beasts

513
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:37,780
inherited half of
the Heavenly Father's powers.

514
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,822
However, Ye Hua had them slayed.

515
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:41,902
That's great disrespect
to the Heavenly Father.

516
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,454
I've looked into the regulations.

517
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:48,331
Ye Hua should go to the Mortal Realm
for a heavenly trial.

518
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,460
No one else took that to heart.

519
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,561
Stop bringing up that minor mistake
our son made.

520
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,371
The Celestial Tribe
has our law to abide by.

521
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,322
He should be punished for his mistake.

522
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,360
You're such a grinch for
bringing this matter up

523
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,572
when we're discussing
such a joyous event.

524
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:05,405
Ye Hua, your father is right.

525
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:07,659
You destroyed what once belonged
to the Heavenly Father

526
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,505
so you need to withstand
a heavenly trial.

527
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,119
I understand.

528
00:42:13,474 --> 00:42:16,902
But you destroyed the divine fungal grass
and that makes up for your mistake.

529
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,766
I'll send you to the Mortal Realm
but not for a heavenly trial.

530
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:23,510
I'll have the Star Lord leave
a blank space in your Book of Destiny.

531
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,788
Whatever happens, happens.

532
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,012
We'll leave it to chance.

533
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,621
How about that?

534
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:30,592
I accept the decree.

535
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,438
It's just a heavenly trial.

536
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:34,347
He will be back
in no more than two months.

537
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:36,693
Based on their statuses

538
00:42:36,693 --> 00:42:41,581
the betrothal gifts will probably not
be fully prepared when Ye Hua returns.

539
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,306
Father is right.

540
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:46,166
I'll start preparing them now.

541
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:56,168
