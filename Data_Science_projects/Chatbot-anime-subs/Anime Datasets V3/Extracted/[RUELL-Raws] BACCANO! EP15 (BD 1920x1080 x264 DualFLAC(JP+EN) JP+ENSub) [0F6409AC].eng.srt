1
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,572
Those guys are freaks.

2
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:17,137
You really are a good little girl, Chane.

3
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:20,068
Here he is! This is the guy, isn't it?

4
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:22,041
Bingo!

5
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,163
Hey!

6
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,172
Hey there!

7
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:24,132
W-What's the matter, Nice?

8
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:27,815
Nothing. Just smiling about the past.

9
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,317
Oh.

10
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,598
Jacuzzi! We got an old miner friend I know

11
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:38,812
and a Hollywood movie engineer
to buy that explosive under the table!

12
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,665
It came to $100,000.

13
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,482
$100,000! Isn't that incredible?

14
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,948
And those ceramic grenades
with the insides removed

15
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,408
went for $200 each!

16
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,587
They did? That's great.

17
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,722
Be that as it may, Jacuzzi,

18
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:56,828
we've picked up on something
that could mean trouble.

19
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,122
Eh? What?

20
00:02:58,122 --> 00:03:01,628
Someone was holding onto a box
that was floating in the river.

21
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,060
A passenger, you might say.

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,638
Boss, it was that one in the black dress.

23
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,012
That woman?

24
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,098
--Yes.
--Huh? An acquaintance?

25
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,848
I wouldn't say acquaintance...

26
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:19,450
Well, we do know her, you might say.

27
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,858
Anyhow, we couldn't turn her over to the police,

28
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,039
so we brought her here.

29
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,668
You have? Well then,
hurry and introduce her to me.

30
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,044
Yeah.

31
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,630
Come on in!

32
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,928
Hey there. I'm Jacuzzi Splot.

33
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,556
Glad to have you here. What's your name?

34
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,947
They still won't let me out of here.

35
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,148
Sorry. It seems like
you're having to hang around here

36
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,745
like a duty nurse because of me.

37
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:08,862
D-Don't pay any mind to me.
You can read if you want to.

38
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:11,908
I'm not all that interested
in stuff like the papers.

39
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:16,492
A-And by "stuff like the papers,"
I wasn't in any way trying to make fun of you.

40
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:17,737
Don't misunderstand, okay?

41
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:22,638
I just meant I didn't want you to pay
too much mind to me, that's all.

42
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:32,857
Listen, Chane,

43
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:37,853
your last name is Laforet, right?

44
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:42,116
By any chance, are you a relative
of that Huey fellow, or anything?

45
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,982
Sorry! If it's a complicated matter,

46
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,068
then you don't have to
force yourself to talk about it,

47
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,238
and if you're not related,
and it's just a coincidence,

48
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:52,627
I hope you'll forgive me.
In any case, I'm sorry!

49
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:02,595
"He is my father." I-Is that right?

50
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,228
"I was with the terrorists
that attacked the train."

51
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,524
I sort of knew that,
from the way that Nice and Nick were acting.

52
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,228
"Why don't you report me?"

53
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:22,990
Why?

54
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,620
Well, while I may not be able to excuse
what those black suits did on the train,

55
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,568
we stole some freight from the train ourselves,

56
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:35,112
so we can't complain too loudly.

57
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:39,202
Besides, you more or less
seem like a good person. I mean...

58
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:42,912
I don't know for sure
whether or not you're a good person.

59
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,513
But it doesn't matter, does it?
We're friends, after all.

60
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:04,866
"I don't understand you people."

61
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:10,037
"You people"? Does she mean Nice and Donny?

62
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,542
And that's about the size of it.

63
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,421
You don't believe me?

64
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,885
I suppose you wouldn't. Not that easily.

65
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:30,266
I don't show this to people very often,
but you're special, miss.

66
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,382
Do you believe me now?

67
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,315
Yes.

68
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:41,472
I may be older than you, but it gets awkward,

69
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:43,738
so you can talk to me
like you were talking to a child.

70
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:49,577
Thank you very much. I mean, thanks, Czes-<i>kun.</i>

71
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,628
Oh, hey, this is
a hell of a coincidence, huh?

72
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,742
I came by to see Firo,
a childhood buddy of mine.

73
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:08,277
It turns out he went out with
a couple of acquaintances, or something.

74
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,292
I figured it would be wrong
to intrude when he has company,

75
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,851
so I decided to call it a day and head back.

76
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,771
What are you guys up to?

77
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,565
Have you gone and become chummy, now?

78
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,533
I'm telling you,
that Chane woman is a problem.

79
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,448
If we let her become one of us,

80
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,128
there's definitely gonna be trouble ahead.

81
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,298
She's gonna draw
the attention of the police our way.

82
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,718
After all, she <i>was</i> in with those terrorists.

83
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,872
Doesn't matter to me,

84
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:53,502
but I'm a little wary about
making trouble for Genoard-<i>san.</i>

85
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:55,878
Still, Jacuzzi has already made up his mind.

86
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:57,019
Boss...

87
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,481
Sure, she's a girl we don't know anything about,

88
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,512
but the fact is, just like us,

89
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:05,736
she's down and out,
and has no one she can depend on.

90
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,029
Chane-<i>san</i>!

91
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:13,119
A-A package just arrived,
addressed to you, Chane-<i>san.</i>

92
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,503
Wow.

93
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,172
It's pretty, isn't it?

94
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,551
Why don't you try it on, Chane-<i>san</i>?

95
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,686
Please, excuse us...

96
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,195
Hya-ha...

97
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,074
It's pretty. It looks good on you.

98
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,703
Who sent it to you?

99
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:00,750
<i>It's from him. What could he be thinking?</i>

100
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,381
<i>Clothes...</i>

101
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,372
<i>This is the first time anyone besides Dad</i>

102
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:13,637
<i>has given me something like this.</i>

103
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:19,852
<i>Dad would often provide me</i>
<i>with clothes when I was little.</i>

104
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,480
<i>It made me very happy.</i>

105
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:30,696
<i>But I don't know how I should feel,</i>
<i>receiving clothes from him.</i>

106
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:39,205
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>
<i>I understand less and less about him.</i>

107
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,283
<i>He said he would protect Dad.</i>

108
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,252
<i>He said he would marry me to do so, too.</i>

109
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:50,633
<i>I don't know what he was</i>
<i>thinking to make him say that.</i>

110
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:58,878
<i>But at least I didn't sense</i>
<i>any falsehood in his words.</i>

111
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:02,019
<i>That's why I'm so confused.</i>

112
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:08,192
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>should I accept his proposal?</i>

113
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:14,031
<i>But I'm scared. What am I afraid of?</i>

114
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:20,530
<i>What was he thinking</i>
<i>to make him propose marriage to me?</i>

115
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,137
<i>Why would he give me this?</i>

116
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:26,252
Chane-<i>san</i>, is something the matter?

117
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,380
No, huh?

118
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,968
Chane-<i>san</i>, why don't you
step out, for a change of air?

119
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,468
Oh, Graham-<i>san</i>, someone's coming out.

120
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:53,654
Is that right? Let's pray that
this doesn't turn into a tedious story.

121
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,907
Ah, tedium is a crime.

122
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,478
It takes the limited amount of time
that is given to man,

123
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:04,456
and rather than spending it
in indolence or drowning it in pleasure,

124
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,572
it just stays there, eating it up.

125
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:14,884
I can't put up with that!
Tedium is a crime! Die, tedium, die!

126
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,596
Die! Die now! Die, you! Die, me!

127
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,891
Woah, she's really a cute girl!

128
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,712
Time spent in tedium is like a coffee break,

129
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:29,607
to allow the climaxes of life
to reach their perfect state.

130
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,052
I'm going to choose to think so.

131
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,432
She's so cute, it makes you
remember sayings like that, doesn't it?

132
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:37,740
That would have to be Eve Genoard, right?

133
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,438
If we're wrong, we're wrong.

134
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:45,164
I'd like to assert that
it's all part of the spice of life.

135
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:50,544
After all, there isn't a single thing
in the whole world that is tedious.

136
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,658
That's the complete opposite of
what you just said.

137
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,452
Are you okay, Boss?

138
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:59,708
Ever since you fainted,
you've become quite fearless, huh?

139
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,472
They're going into Central Park.

140
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,560
Are they? Then why don't
I start spinning a sad tale?

141
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,771
For them, that is.

142
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,144
Hya-ha?

143
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:10,901
Hya-ha.

144
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:11,565
Hya-ha!

145
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,828
Huh? What's this?

146
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,798
A sad story... why don't we
start ourselves a sad story?

147
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,872
A story that is heartrending in its sadness.

148
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:43,597
But, rest assured, it will be happy for me.

149
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,172
Jacuzzi!

150
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:51,468
W-What's the matter,
Nick and Nice? Why so rushed?

151
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:54,258
Chane-<i>san</i>... Chane-<i>san</i> has been taken!

152
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:58,480
W-What are you saying?
You don't mean, by the police...

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,217
No, not them.

154
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:04,034
This guy carrying a monkey-wrench
<i>this</i> big came up out of nowhere.

155
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:19,591
"Dear Jacuzzi Splot and associates,

156
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,872
We have apprehended Eve Genoard.

157
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:26,042
If you wish to save her,
gather all the money you can

158
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:30,978
and come to the abandoned factory
at pier 13. Come alone."

159
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,592
This is a ransom note!
W-What's more, it says "Eve"!

160
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:38,598
They've got the basic facts all wrong!

161
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,142
Something awful is going to happen
to Chane unless we do something!

162
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:42,531
Jacuzzi!

163
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,245
Jacuzzi, are you going there?

164
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,832
You're going to a lot of trouble for a girl
we don't know anything about.

165
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,362
You bet I am. Chane is one of us.

166
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:58,213
Jacuzzi, you may consider her one of us, but...

167
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,828
It's true, I don't know where Chane was born,

168
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:03,010
or how she might have been brought up,

169
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,277
but even so, she washed up out of the river,
just like you did, Nick.

170
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:11,673
Even at just that,
I sense some sort of destiny about her.

171
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:15,207
She doesn't have
anywhere else to go, same as us.

172
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:20,611
Besides... besides, I just don't
see Chane as being a bad person.

173
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,738
That's all there is to it.

174
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,098
Jacuzzi...

175
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,978
Nick, relax. I'm going alone.

176
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:29,272
Jacuzzi, you can't!

177
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:32,625
Jacuzzi, that wrench-wielding bastard
is no ordinary punk.

178
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,293
I'm still going. I <i>have</i> to go, you know?

179
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,032
He told me to come alone, after all.

180
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:42,383
If I didn't, it would be impolite, wouldn't it?

181
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,473
I-I'm so scared, I can't help myself, though...

182
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,428
Poor girl. She seems to be so scared,
she can't say anything.

183
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,428
Sorry about this, young lady.

184
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:03,404
But not being able to speak
may be lucky for you, in a sense.

185
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,768
People expend exceedingly powerful energy,

186
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:11,022
whenever putting sadness into
words, or putting joy into words,

187
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,414
or putting anger into words.

188
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,417
Even more when it turns to fear, or pain.

189
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,921
In that sense, being so afraid
that you can't find any words...

190
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,828
in extreme circumstances,
where human instinct controls

191
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:28,748
energy consumption,
could, in a sense, be called

192
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:32,433
a self-defense mechanism, couldn't it?

193
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:37,928
Whoops. I went and said
something somewhat intelligent there.

194
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,274
All right, give it up for me, guys.

195
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:45,112
Hmm? Hey, why are you
getting up without asking--

196
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,062
Ho... here I thought
you were an ordinary young lady,

197
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,996
but this is interesting.

198
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,792
That's a bit on the large side for
something used for self-defense, isn't it?

199
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,448
But that's okay.

200
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:03,908
You surprised me a bit,
but being surprised is a good thing.

201
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,508
Being surprised reminds people

202
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,722
that what lies ahead of us
in life is unpredictable darkness.

203
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,700
This is a second surprise.

204
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,689
I get the feeling
you <i>aren't</i> Eve Genoard, are you?

205
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:25,678
You'll excuse me. Your move just now
was not that of an amateur.

206
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:29,268
To be honest, I am surprised.
Also, I would appreciate it

207
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,742
if you would listen until I'm finished speaking.

208
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,402
You are fascinating. An "okay"
that goes even beyond "okay."

209
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,743
Uh-oh, I'm starting to get excited.

210
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,282
All right, that settles it.

211
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:46,256
It wouldn't surprise me
if you told me you were a Martian now.

212
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,288
Well, hurry up and grow
eight arms, why don't you?

213
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:51,817
If it turns out you're not human,

214
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,514
that just means that you're worth breaking.

215
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,527
This is getting to be enjoyable,
for some reason.

216
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,682
It's becoming truly, truly enjoyable.

217
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:14,858
Why don't we join forces,
to spin ourselves an enjoyable tale?

218
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:18,247
Or to put it more specifically, let me beat you.

219
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,249
Please stop!

220
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:25,532
Um, I brought the money, s-so,

221
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:28,632
let the girl... let the girl go at once, please.

222
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,136
Maybe it's not such a great deal of money,

223
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,418
but I do think it's a considerable
amount in its own right,

224
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:40,143
so take the money, and
please return the girl to me!

225
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,896
Oho... that was fast.

226
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,638
All right, let's switch our tale
away from the surprising story

227
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,722
to the story that is gratifying to me.

228
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:50,779
No, that's okay.

229
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,598
Never mind the money.

230
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,326
I don't know why, but
everyone says it's a good thing.

231
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,488
And seeing those who are taken in
by money and then ruined by it

232
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,333
is best of all!

233
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,295
Catch! Hold on...

234
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,328
You said you brought money,

235
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:12,202
but looking you over,
you're empty-handed, aren't you?

236
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:15,168
I'm empty-handed, but I brought money--

237
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,628
or rather, something in its place, instead.

238
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,809
I-I don't know if you'll believe me or not,

239
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,519
but I have...

240
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,480
I have... I have...

241
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:30,348
...a bounty on me, from somemafiosos--
the Russo Family of Chicago.

242
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,932
By turning me over to them,

243
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,781
you should be able to
get a good deal of money.

244
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,417
Nice!

245
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,231
Jacuzzi...

246
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,568
Nice, open up! Nice!

247
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,638
Nice!

248
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,739
Open up, Nice!

249
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,089
Jacuzzi!

250
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,846
What's with the tattoo?

251
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,338
You see? Now everyone will recognize my face.

252
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:48,342
So things will be fine,
as long as I'm together with you.

253
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:49,523
Jacuzzi...

254
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,433
Nice, what's wrong?

255
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you so much.

256
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,453
Nice, when you cry, I feel like crying, too.

257
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:09,501
I just wanted to be
of help to you... that's all...

258
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,886
That's the sort of person Jacuzzi is.

259
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:24,850
He thinks more about others
than himself, and then takes action.

260
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,020
So he's always on the losing end.

261
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,428
But he always has lots of friends around him.

262
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:34,693
You're amazing, huh?

263
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,348
Damn it, you've impressed me!

264
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:43,478
Fascinating! You are happy!
And also sad, Jacuzzi Splot!

265
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,245
But I am impressed.

266
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,568
They say that there's always a fine line
between happiness and sadness,

267
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,250
but you, at this very moment,

268
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,118
have locked up my heart inside that line.

269
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,797
However!

270
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:01,918
At the same time,
I am enjoying my fight with this woman.

271
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:03,680
Ah, what shall I do?!

272
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:09,603
Shall I release this woman,
out of regard for you trapping my heart?

273
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:14,024
Or shall I ignore that, and
continue to fight this woman?

274
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,222
My feelings are torn right now.

275
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:21,990
Ah, what should I do?! What would you do?!

276
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,494
Is that your answer?

277
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,398
Then let's get it on.

278
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:31,500
Stop! I beg you, stop fighting to the death!

279
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,998
Chane-<i>san</i>, are you all right?

280
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:44,248
Nice, the place is wide open.
Why did you blow it up?

281
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:46,657
You don't need to ask, you already know why.

282
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:49,726
The boss just wanted to blow something up.

283
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,228
Guys!

284
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,638
Huh? Didn't I write in the note
for you to come alone?

285
00:21:55,638 --> 00:22:00,182
Yes, and just like it said in the
note, Jacuzzi came here alone,

286
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,728
so I came here alone, too.

287
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:06,188
Yeah, I came alone to America, from Mexico.

288
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:07,915
I also walked here, alone.

289
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:10,818
--Me too!
--Me too!

290
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:12,666
Indeed, you did not contradict me.

291
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,698
Now, I see that you are all intelligent.

292
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:18,004
W-What are you going to do with them?

293
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,368
Guys, thanks for coming. But for some reason,

294
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:25,895
I thought I heard an unfamiliar voice
mixed in with you.

295
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:27,208
Am I imagining things?

296
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,378
Come to think of it...

297
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:31,157
Now that you mention it,
I can't say I didn't hear it, either.

298
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:34,338
I'm impressed that
you'd be able to pick out my voice,

299
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,718
as not being one of your friends.

300
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:36,968
N-Not at all...

301
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,733
But then, who are you?

302
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,348
Me? I'm the former Claire Stanfield,

303
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:47,285
former transcontinental railroad conductor,
and current Rail Tracer.

304
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:50,161
R-R-Rail Tracer?!

305
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:50,871
Jacuzzi!

306
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,005
I'm terribly sorry for being so abrupt,

307
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:58,044
but I have business with that woman.
I need to interrupt for a moment.

308
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:04,634
It's been a while, huh?
Are you still planning to kill me?

309
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,628
Well, it's not as though
I'd particularly mind if you were.

310
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:11,418
But I thought that it would be proper for me

311
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,462
to declare my love for you, first.

312
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:19,008
I get the feeling that I didn't communicate
my feelings for you, on top of that train.

313
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,468
I'll tell it to you straight.

314
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:25,432
As perplexing as it is,
it appears I'm in love with you, Chane.

315
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:29,518
Sorry, that's not true.
Actually, it's not perplexing.

316
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:31,760
But it is true that I love you.

317
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,108
Ah, sure enough,
it's not like me to use fancy words.

318
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,250
Let me tell it to you straight.

319
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,420
I love you. Let's get married.

320
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,048
Are you unsure?

321
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,967
It's all right. I promise you,

322
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,878
I won't destroy the world
you've come to believe in.

323
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,447
The world is not that fragile.

324
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:55,758
No world can be destroyed
just by having someone else enter into it.

325
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,146
It just gets bigger, that's all.

326
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,108
If it ever seems like your world
is falling apart, I will protect it.

327
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:06,848
You ordinarily wouldn't believe
anyone who uses words like these.

328
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:10,659
But, as you know, I'm not ordinary.

329
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,833
<i>Why? Why would these people do this for me?</i>

330
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,879
<i>For me, after we've just barely met?</i>

331
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,799
<i>For me, someone who isn't even family?</i>

332
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,468
<i>Why would they do so much?</i>

333
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,351
<i>Why would this man say he loves me?</i>

334
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:40,178
<i>I've never met a person that said they loved me.</i>

335
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,440
<i>Even my friends avoided me.</i>

336
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,320
<i>Not even my father has ever told me he loved me.</i>

337
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:54,202
<i>No, not even my father...</i>

338
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:01,459
<i>...ever told me... he loved me...</i>

339
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,843
Let me tell you an incomprehensible story.

340
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:15,418
What is it to be incomprehensible,
as to the doings of men?

341
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:17,225
It's incomprehensible, isn't it?

342
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,563
No matter. It's useless to
even think about such a thing.

343
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,552
With that being said,
I'm not sure what's going on,

344
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,317
but may we resume our situation?

345
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,710
Very well, I give you my permission.

346
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,491
But then, I haven't heard
what your answer is, Chane.

347
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,272
If you are going to oppose
Chane and her friends,

348
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:38,872
then I will take you on.

349
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,528
All right, if you're going
to run away, now's the time.

350
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,948
How arrogant of you!

351
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:46,782
There's only been one other person to rival

352
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:48,618
the arrogance I have within me!

353
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:49,924
Boss Ladd!

354
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,958
The arrogance of Boss Ladd was unwavering.

355
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,878
For you to jeopardize
that is far beyond the pale!

356
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:02,882
Unless I knock your arrogance below
at least that of Boss Ladd's,

357
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,342
my dawn will never break,

358
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:08,178
and I will not see the sun!
It will remain night forever!

359
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:11,279
Is this "Ladd" person
Ladd Russo, of the Russo Family?

360
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,323
You know the boss?

361
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,575
He's the guy who fell from
the train the other day, right?

362
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,398
How do you know that?

363
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:23,108
That's not even a rumor that has gotten around
outside of his close companions.

364
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:25,418
Well, that's because
I'm the one who dropped him.

365
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:53,102
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

366
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:07,366
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

367
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:18,958
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

368
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:25,922
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

369
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:33,012
<i>I believe so</i>

370
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:40,108
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

371
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:47,652
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

372
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:54,288
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

373
00:27:54,288 --> 00:28:04,339
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

374
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,103
<i>They say that people's lives are limited.</i>

375
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,638
<i>However, there are those</i>
<i>that sing that when grasping</i>

376
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,892
<i>for unlimited possibilities,</i>
<i>people can magnify their lives</i>

377
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:21,062
<i>1 0, 1 00, even 1 000 times over</i>!
<i>And well you might say</i>!

378
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:22,773
<i>And I should be there at the center.</i>

379
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:25,580
<i>That's one of the rules</i>
<i>that God laid down, right?</i>
