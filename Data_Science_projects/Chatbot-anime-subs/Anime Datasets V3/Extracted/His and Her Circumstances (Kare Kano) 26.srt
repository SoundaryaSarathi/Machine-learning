1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,720
At the end of the 1990's.

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,040
Japan has reached the most dangerous depths of economic crisis and depression since World War II.

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,050
There is a series of personal and company bankruptcies...

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,870
...increasing rate of unemployment, shocking rise in felonies by delinquent minors.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,960
Indeed, though it is the end of the century, it is most appropriate to call it a time of chaos.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,780
This is the same.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,820
First year room A as the top student of Hokuei Public High School...

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,320
...of the Kanagawa prefecture, Yukino Miyazawa, was the ultimate Queen of glory.

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,860
Arima, who has changed her, was carrying...

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,960
...the burden of his unhappiness by himself, and he was also an honors student.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,800
These secretive two have become intimate with each other, even insofar as they are top students.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,850
They eventually cross the stages of being classroom buddies, friends, more than friends to lovers.

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,810
And thus they arrive at a relationship in which we speak...

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,950
...of them in terms of His and Her's, they are now boyfriend and girlfriend.

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,420
And then, feeling pressure in their relationship...

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,390
...they decided together that they would live toward their happiness.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,020
Toward these two who have made these decisions...

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,590
...the world has thrown trials, which could even be called cruel, one after the other.

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,900
But sweeping away destructive demonic influences, and enduring...

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,030
...compounding excruciating situations, now has put the summer vacations behind her...

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,970
...and has now taken up the challenge of the Autumn Cultural Festival.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,090
However!

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,240
However!
Stage 1

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Stage 1

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,820
Broadcast Information Meetings

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,290
Broadcast Information Meetings
Ah

27
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,390
Ah

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,680
Oh It's Asapin

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,160
Oh It's Asapin
He presented himself, and flowed in.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,260
He presented himself, and flowed in.

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,330
He presented himself, and flowed in.
Oh, Miyazawa, you're also doing broadcast and information

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,810
He presented himself, and flowed in.
Oh, Miyazawa, you're also doing broadcast and information
Oh! Asabakun

33
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,460
Oh, Miyazawa, you're also doing broadcast and information
Oh! Asabakun

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh! Asabakun
And conversation.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,810
And conversation.
Oh yeah, let's do it.

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh yeah, let's do it.

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,280
Well, those two are here too.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,170
Well, those two are here too.
And then he appeared, and flowed in again.

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,370
And then he appeared, and flowed in again.
Tonamikun

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,370
Tonamikun

41
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,740
I'm so glad. I just came into this school. I've got no one I know and I don't know this school.

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,270
Then stay with me, I'll teach you lots of stuff.

43
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,620
Then stay with me, I'll teach you lots of stuff.
And conversation.

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,370
Then stay with me, I'll teach you lots of stuff.

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:49,790
Kinda feels like I'll get used.

46
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,540
Kinda feels like I'll get used.
Continuing conversation.

47
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,810
Continuing conversation.

48
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:50,870
Continuing conversation.
Of course

49
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,050
Of course

50
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,080
Of course
Continuing conversation.

51
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,250
Continuing conversation.

52
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,530
He is silent.

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,460
And scornful

54
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,820
Stage 2

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,360
This is the tallest tree in this school...

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,230
Ouch

57
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,530
Hey, didn't mean to do that.

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,760
Hey, didn't mean to do that.
Opps, sorry.

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:14,830
Opps, sorry.

60
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:14,980
Opps, sorry.
Dropped it.

61
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,280
Dropped it.

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Dropped it.
Thus she apologizes.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,650
Thus she apologizes.

64
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,520
And then smiles.

65
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,310
Unexpected encounter.

66
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,410
Small irritation.

67
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,980
What are you doing up here?

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,080
What are you doing up here?
He approaches.

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,310
What are you doing up here?

70
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,460
It's the best eating lunch at places like this.

71
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,260
It's the best eating lunch at places like this.
Conversation.

72
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,240
It's the best eating lunch at places like this.

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,740
Gorilla! Ha ha ha you're a gorillia!

74
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,640
Gorilla! Ha ha ha you're a gorillia!
Guffawing.

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,710
Gorilla! Ha ha ha you're a gorillia!

76
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,810
You say so, but you look like a gorilla yourself.

77
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,470
You say so, but you look like a gorilla yourself.
Girl looks on with morbid fascination.

78
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,680
You say so, but you look like a gorilla yourself.

79
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,650
Here, some feed.

80
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,090
Irritated again.

81
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,940
Dullness...

82
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,050
And then restfulness.

83
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,220
Hey

84
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,720
Hey
Destruction of her pleasure.

85
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:40,820
Destruction of her pleasure.

86
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,560
Destruction of her pleasure.
N...wha?

87
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:41,660
Destruction of her pleasure.

88
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:41,750
Destruction of her pleasure.
You haven't forgotten what I told you the other day, right?

89
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,850
You haven't forgotten what I told you the other day, right?

90
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,160
You haven't forgotten what I told you the other day, right?
Bringing an end to his endurance.

91
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,190
Bringing an end to his endurance.

92
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,090
And thus interjecting.

93
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,490
And thus interjecting.
What are you all confident about?

94
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,920
And thus interjecting.

95
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,500
But she is utterly unmoved.

96
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,060
But she is utterly unmoved.
Yeah.

97
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,160
But she is utterly unmoved.

98
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,760
But she is utterly unmoved.
If you don't like me, I can't help it. Go ahead and not like me.

99
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,930
If you don't like me, I can't help it. Go ahead and not like me.

100
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,130
Grr! What does that mean?
She does not move.

101
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,200
She does not move.

102
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,030
She does not move.
Besides, I like you quite a bit.

103
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,000
Besides, I like you quite a bit.

104
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,970
Silence.

105
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,300
Eh?!
Shut up

106
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,200
Eh?!
Shut up
Shaken.

107
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,270
Shaken.

108
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:55,470
I SAID I DON'T LIKE YOU!

109
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,970
I SAID I DON'T LIKE YOU!
Reasserting.

110
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,000
Reasserting.

111
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,610
If I'm not liked, do I have to not like you back?

112
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,840
When I think about it, being with you is kind of fun.

113
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,120
Isn't that enough?

114
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,380
Cannot reach her.

115
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,950
Free flowing...

116
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,990
this gal's heart is always somewhere far away

117
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,520
Any words of mine...

118
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,450
and feelings...

119
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,560
cannot reach her.

120
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,620
It never will reach Sakura

121
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,590
Why?

122
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,140
I don't know

123
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,760
I don't know
He replies.

124
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,080
He replies.

125
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,110
That is the first time I ever kissed.

126
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,780
Come to think of it, me too.

127
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,850
Come to think of it, me too.
He says the same.

128
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,170
Come to think of it, me too.

129
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,700
And then, questioning...

130
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:02,920
And then, questioning...
Why did I do such a thing?

131
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,040
Why did I do such a thing?
Questioning...

132
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,100
Questioning...

133
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,350
Questioning...
Meeting Room

134
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,640
Meeting Room

135
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,290
Next we need to discuss with regard to the topic of...

136
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,750
Stage 3

137
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,390
Prep Room

138
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,790
Ahh, thank you.

139
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,990
Ahh, thank you.
She expresses gratitude.

140
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,020
She expresses gratitude.
Today I have to arrange and do a check of the proposals of all the participating circles for the events.

141
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,250
Today I have to arrange and do a check of the proposals of all the participating circles for the events.

142
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,340
Today I have to arrange and do a check of the proposals of all the participating circles for the events.
And then works on.

143
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,260
Today I have to arrange and do a check of the proposals of all the participating circles for the events.

144
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:27,860
I begin writing out notes... until evening into the night.

145
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,190
I begin writing out notes... until evening into the night.
And then her suffering.

146
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,360
I begin writing out notes... until evening into the night.

147
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,830
You... you seem to be bogged down, you need any help?

148
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,830
You... you seem to be bogged down, you need any help?
And then empathy.

149
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,050
And then empathy.
You're top of the class anyway, so...

150
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,900
You're top of the class anyway, so...

151
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,350
No, just your bringing it here for me was enough, thank you.

152
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,670
No, just your bringing it here for me was enough, thank you.
And then her reply.

153
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,000
No, just your bringing it here for me was enough, thank you.

154
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,370
What, I'm offering you sincere help.

155
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,300
What, I'm offering you sincere help.
And then, conversation.

156
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,770
And then, conversation.

157
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,130
Because if I'm too friendly with other boys, Arima will get lonesome.

158
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,450
Because if I'm too friendly with other boys, Arima will get lonesome.
And then talking about her love affair.

159
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,940
Because if I'm too friendly with other boys, Arima will get lonesome.

160
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:41,970
Arima fan

161
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,380
Arima fan
What are you saying, don't flatter yourself!!

162
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
Cause it's true.

163
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,980
Heh, I cannot understand it at all, why is Arima-kun with a girl like this... I'm sure there are plenty other girls he could date who are a lot more suited to him, who is more upstanding, more graceful, more lovely.

164
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
Heh, I cannot understand it at all, why is Arima-kun with a girl like this... I'm sure there are plenty other girls he could date who are a lot more suited to him, who is more upstanding, more graceful, more lovely.
He cannot understand.

165
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,210
Heh, I cannot understand it at all, why is Arima-kun with a girl like this... I'm sure there are plenty other girls he could date who are a lot more suited to him, who is more upstanding, more graceful, more lovely.

166
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,570
Heh, I cannot understand it at all, why is Arima-kun with a girl like this... I'm sure there are plenty other girls he could date who are a lot more suited to him, who is more upstanding, more graceful, more lovely.
He cannot understand.

167
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,830
Heh, I cannot understand it at all, why is Arima-kun with a girl like this... I'm sure there are plenty other girls he could date who are a lot more suited to him, who is more upstanding, more graceful, more lovely.
He cannot understand.

168
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,830
He cannot understand.

169
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,950
He cannot understand.

170
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,250
He cannot understand.
Cannot understand!!

171
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,320
Cannot understand!!

172
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,650
You probably tricked innocent and unsuspecting Arima-kun into your sneaky trap and now you're using him. That must be it!!

173
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,880
You probably tricked innocent and unsuspecting Arima-kun into your sneaky trap and now you're using him. That must be it!!
And then, judgement.

174
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,380
You probably tricked innocent and unsuspecting Arima-kun into your sneaky trap and now you're using him. That must be it!!

175
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,020
You probably tricked innocent and unsuspecting Arima-kun into your sneaky trap and now you're using him. That must be it!!
And then, utterance.

176
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,660
You probably tricked innocent and unsuspecting Arima-kun into your sneaky trap and now you're using him. That must be it!!

177
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:56,990
Boo

178
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,590
Boo
Boo, wrong!

179
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,090
Boo, wrong!
Wrong

180
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,090
Wrong

181
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,330
Arima was the one who attacked first.

182
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,620
I can't hear you... it's a lie!!!

183
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,530
I can't hear you... it's a lie!!!
Not listening, and then denial

184
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:02,660
Not listening, and then denial

185
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:02,790
Not listening, and then denial
Anyway, whatever became of your revenge scheme?

186
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,990
Anyway, whatever became of your revenge scheme?

187
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,730
Anyway, whatever became of your revenge scheme?
And then she asked.

188
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,060
And then she asked.
Well...

189
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,500
Well...

190
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,100
I'm still working on it. I haven't given up.

191
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,170
But you know, to hold a grudge of vengeance for two whole years and be that involved with your feelings against that person.

192
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,910
What?

193
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,880
Oh, nothing.

194
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,880
And then he appears again.

195
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,080
And then he appears again.
Asapin

196
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,480
Asapin

197
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,010
Oh this. 
I was asked asked to do this by Sawada-san.

198
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,050
Oh this. 
I was asked asked to do this by Sawada-san.
And then, conversation again.

199
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,250
Oh this. 
I was asked asked to do this by Sawada-san.

200
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,610
Thank you.

201
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,690
Thank you.
And then, conversation again.

202
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,250
And then, conversation again.
Oh well, I better go help out in class.

203
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,250
Oh well, I better go help out in class.

204
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,580
Do well with your revenge.

205
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,680
Do well with your revenge.
And then, parting.

206
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:29,750
Do well with your revenge.

207
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,760
Shut up.

208
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,350
And then, askance.

209
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,020
Long silence.

210
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,530
Long silence.

211
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,140
Long quiet.

212
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,630
Long quiet.

213
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,060
What is at the end of it.

214
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,030
What awaits at the end of it.

215
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,700
Hey, you...

216
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,470
Hey, you...
Breaking of silence.

217
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:43,760
Breaking of silence.

218
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,730
You're getting too close to Miyazawa.

219
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,870
You're getting too close to Miyazawa.
Breaking of complacency.

220
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,170
You're getting too close to Miyazawa.

221
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,500
Chasing after Arima.

222
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,600
Chasing after Arima.
Breaking all blocks.

223
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:47,610
Chasing after Arima.

224
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:47,940
You shouldn't casually do things that's not called for.

225
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,270
You shouldn't casually do things that's not called for.
Breaking up pressure.

226
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,710
You shouldn't casually do things that's not called for.

227
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,680
Arima really doesn't like it when someone gets too close to Miyazawa, regardless of boy or girl.

228
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,950
What...Arima-kun?

229
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,610
The Arima-kun that you know is just a fabrication.

230
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,610
The Arima-kun that you know is just a fabrication.
The breaking of truth.

231
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,520
The Arima-kun that you know is just a fabrication.

232
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,550
The real Arima is very temperamental.
He is very possessive.

233
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,120
The real Arima is very temperamental.
He is very possessive.
The breaking of the ghost image.

234
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,220
The real Arima is very temperamental.
He is very possessive.

235
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:03,880
But I know that Miyazawa will never betray Arima.
But I'm not Just saying this

236
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,620
But I know that Miyazawa will never betray Arima.
But I'm not Just saying this
And the breaking of fictitiousness.

237
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,190
But I know that Miyazawa will never betray Arima.
But I'm not Just saying this

238
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:08,820
Arima is only truly kind to...
Miyazawa only

239
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,390
Arima is only truly kind to...
Miyazawa only
And then, fantasy.

240
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,230
Arima is only truly kind to...
Miyazawa only

241
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,030
The reason why Arima overlooks my being with Miyazawa

242
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,260
The reason why Arima overlooks my being with Miyazawa
And then, deception

243
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,060
The reason why Arima overlooks my being with Miyazawa

244
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,330
Is because he knows that I would never touch Miyazawa.

245
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,600
Is because he knows that I would never touch Miyazawa.
And then, putting himself in his situation.

246
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,760
And then, putting himself in his situation.

247
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,470
Huh?

248
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,270
Aren't you over thinking this? What's so great about her anyway?
Not that I don't like her.

249
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,630
Aren't you over thinking this? What's so great about her anyway?
Not that I don't like her.
But it is the truth.

250
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,340
Aren't you over thinking this? What's so great about her anyway?
Not that I don't like her.

251
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,670
She's a little smart and cute; that's about it.

252
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,370
She's a little smart and cute; that's about it.
It is also real.

253
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:25,940
She's a little smart and cute; that's about it.

254
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,340
She's a regular girl 
She's not even my type.

255
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,640
She's a regular girl 
She's not even my type.
Glad to have met her.

256
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,970
Glad to have met her.

257
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,510
Don't you get it?
You're just a brat

258
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,180
Don't you get it?
You're just a brat
And then, the setup

259
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,610
And then, the setup

260
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,820
Stage 4

261
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,790
Me and you

262
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,790
The reason why it must be you for me and me for you.

263
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,430
You're scared, right?

264
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,280
Thought I know in my mind, I do not know with my feelings.

265
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,640
Thought I know in my mind, I do not know with my feelings.
Want me to tell you why?

266
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,940
Want me to tell you why?

267
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,850
You have realized.

268
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:03,910
You have realized.
Though I made love to Miyazawa.

269
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,250
Though I made love to Miyazawa.

270
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
That cannot be happy.

271
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,920
It is because you came in contact, that your distance has grown apart.

272
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,390
Now it's as if you're two separate people.

273
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,750
Now it's as if you're two separate people.
The joy of touching each other is momentary.
That cannot be the goal.

274
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,960
The joy of touching each other is momentary.
That cannot be the goal.

275
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,960
I had never thought this way before.

276
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
But now, painfully.

277
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,580
But that Miyazawa can go on without you.

278
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,950
Poor guy.

279
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,720
You thought you could be happy.

280
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,800
Stage 5

281
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,800
Prep Room.

282
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,270
Oh

283
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,200
Oh

285
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,500
Meeting again.
You done with the work?

286
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,830
You done with the work?

287
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,870
You done with the work?
Conversation again.

288
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:03,970
Conversation again.
Yeah, released at last.

289
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah, released at last.

290
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,270
Yeah, released at last.
Conversation again.

291
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,710
Yeah, released at last.

292
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,070
Hey, did you see Arima?

293
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,800
Hey, did you see Arima?
Conversation.

294
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,580
Hey, did you see Arima?

295
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,910
No, I haven't seen him.

296
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,640
No, I haven't seen him.
Conversation.

297
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,340
No, I haven't seen him.

298
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,740
I see. I can hardly see him because of the play and everything So I at least wanted to go with him.

299
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,340
I see. I can hardly see him because of the play and everything So I at least wanted to go with him.
Conversation.

300
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,380
I see. I can hardly see him because of the play and everything So I at least wanted to go with him.

301
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:13,800
And the play? Is it fun?

302
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,900
And the play? Is it fun?
Conversation.

303
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,220
And the play? Is it fun?

304
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah! it's fun to do this with everyone.

305
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,350
Yeah! it's fun to do this with everyone.
Conversation.

306
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,990
Yeah! it's fun to do this with everyone.

307
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,890
Don't get close to Miyazawa.

308
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,180
Don't get close to Miyazawa.
What are you saying?!!
She's not the kind of girl I'd be that interested in!

309
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,860
What are you saying?!!
She's not the kind of girl I'd be that interested in!

310
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,360
So long

311
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,190
So long
And then, parting.

312
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,400
And then, parting.
Later

313
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Later

314
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,290
Maybe...

315
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,970
What I have believed to be myself is nothing but a fraud that was created out of my own efforts.

316
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,810
Maybe there is another real me, inside of me.

317
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,070
Maybe there is another real me, inside of me.
His and Her Circumstances

318
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,010
His and Her Circumstances

319
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,180
Existence and Nothingness, Born Mutually.

320
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,210
Stage 6

321
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,350

Arima-kun

325
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,120
Um...

326
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,660
Um...
And then, the panic that envelops him, and the hesitations.

327
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,120
And then, the panic that envelops him, and the hesitations.

328
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,420
And then, the panic that envelops him, and the hesitations.
Um...

329
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,590
Um...

330
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,020
He completely hates me...

331
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,590
He completely hates me...
Insecurity and hopelessness.

332
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,900
He completely hates me...

333
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,430
Good morning

334
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,530
Good morning
Good morning.

335
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,200
Good morning.

336
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,360
Good morning.
Hey, have you seen Arima?

337
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, have you seen Arima?

338
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,200
Waaah! ...Don't come near me!!

339
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,370
Arima-kun is my best friend, who was kind to me.

340
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:18,870
I understand now, but at the time, I was a spoiled and truly obnoxious brat, and I can't help it if others didn't like me.

341
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,840
I understand now, but at the time, I was a spoiled and truly obnoxious brat, and I can't help it if others didn't like me.
But Arima-kun was not that way.

342
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:23,880
But Arima-kun was not that way.

343
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,210
Everyone would come around Arima-kun, and I would never be teased in that classroom.

344
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,880
Everyone would come around Arima-kun, and I would never be teased in that classroom.
Whenever I was alone, he would be next to me, unpretentiously.

345
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,510
And he was frighteningly intelligent.

346
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,250
And he was frighteningly intelligent.
He was fair
He was kind

347
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,790
I'm sorry.

348
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,720
I didn't know that Miyazawa was that precious to you.

349
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,590
But to be honest, I'm surprised.

350
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,830
That Arima-kun would actually look at me in such a way, with such feelings.

351
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,330
Maybe being in love is something like this.

352
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,860
Such out word feelings?

353
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,070
Hmm?

354
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,870
In that case,
does that mean that
Arima-kun had that
element in him to
begin with?
In that case,
who was the
Arima-kun in Junior High?
Was he just a facade?

355
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,640
Ridiculous!

356
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,140
Arima-kun is not that kind of person

357
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,140
No, wait...

358
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,040
If asked which...

359
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,140
I used to naively believe back then, but...

360
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,810
To coexist fairly with everyone is to...

361
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,080
View everyone as if they were the same.

362
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,050
Huh?

363
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,550
I have opened a hitherto unopened box...
It seems as if...

364
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,560
The Arima that you know is just a fabrication.

365
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
The Arima that you know is just a fabrication.
That's right...
But that's the real Arima-kun.

366
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,960
That's right...
But that's the real Arima-kun.

367
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,650
Arima

368
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,470
You're strong.

369
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,570
Want me to hold it?

370
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,470
All of his caring feelings are given to Miyazawa

371
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,610
His reactionary feelings and hostility are turned toward all who would get between him and Miyazawa.

372
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,980
Whenever it pertains to Miyazawa, Arima-kun cannot hold back his feelings.

373
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
For the first time...

374
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,990
I wanted to know the Arima-kun who was not about my dreams or ideals.

375
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,050
This time for real.

376
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,520
I wanted to be friends with you.

377
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,730
Arima-kun... Your heart... Where is it?

378
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,100
Stage 7

379
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,130
Social Studies Resource Room

380
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,420
What a help, thank you.

381
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
No problem, do I put this away?

382
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,210
Miyazawa!

383
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,470
Miyazawa!
Well, it's just that somewhat, lately I feel that our kinship is lacking.

384
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,910
Well, it's just that somewhat, lately I feel that our kinship is lacking.

385
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,180
Princess, does that mean that my efforts are insufficient?

386
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,680
No. We were together all the time during summer vacation...

387
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,690
...and now we're hardly together because we're so busy with all the school activities.

388
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,120
It's so fun being with Arima, that duties I have to do become lonesome.

389
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,230
After this stint is over, let's be glued together to our heart's content.

390
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,490
Glued together.

391
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,200
But maybe at times we might have inappropriate feelings.

392
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,800
But maybe at times we might have inappropriate feelings.
Oh, um, yes.

393
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,070
Oh, um, yes.

394
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,270
We have crossed the major threshold, and yet, what's with his purity?

395
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,250
Do you want to be with me?

396
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,250
Yes.

397
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,820
I don't know why, but Arima, sometimes you look like you're someone else.

398
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,090
You think so?

399
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,460
Is it a little strange? Am I scary?

400
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,600
No.

401
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,000
Please don't let me go.

402
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,630
Day by day, I am falling apart.

403
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,500
Falling into the dark side

404
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,200
How can you say such a thing?

405
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,940
To want to have you all to myself.

406
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,480
I'd truly love to free you.

407
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,580
On the other hand, I want to take you away from everything.

408
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,050
I don't want anyone to know that I have such feelings.

409
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,150
Stage 8

410
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,350
Student Guidance Room

411
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,620
Sorry, I'm late.

412
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,220
Oh, you're working hard.

413
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:23,750
Cheese.

414
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,290
Cheese.
Kicking back

415
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:24,520
Kicking back

416
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,620
Kicking back
Beauty King

417
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,790
Kicking back
Beauty King
Yukino, you're working hard too.

418
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,790
Beauty King
Yukino, you're working hard too.

419
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,020
Beauty King

420
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,790
What, are we going to do a reading rehearsal?

421
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,160
Actress Queen

422
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Actress Queen
I know all my lines.

423
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,730
Actress Queen

424
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,200
Actress Queen
I actually wanted to ask Aya-chan something

425
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,230
Actress Queen

426
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,300
Actress Queen
Is she here?

427
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,660
Actress Queen

428
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:33,700
Actress Queen
About that, but, the situation's changed somewhat.

429
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,470
About that, but, the situation's changed somewhat.

430
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,110
Doesn't she seem a little nervous?

431
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,080
The novel that she wrote in first semester became so popular...

432
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,050
...that she was accepted to write a monthly for a magazine.

433
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,680
Amazing!

434
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,480
So she's feeling tremendous pressure, and she's been that way ever since yesterday.

435
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,590
So she's feeling tremendous pressure, and she's been that way ever since yesterday.
Pressure

436
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,750
Pressure

437
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,760
Pressure
She's a little on the timid side, so...

438
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,310
I quit! It's no good today.

439
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,210
What, already?

440
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,350
I've been writing and rewriting over and over since yesterday...

441
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,950
...about fifty times, but the perfect lines just don't come.

442
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,780
Really?

443
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,420
There's something going on.

444
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,320
Characters, setting, plot, all these things, if they come to me...

445
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,230
then I can just write smoothly, but if these don't come...

446
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,000
...then I have to keep digging until they do. That's how it is.

447
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,430
I wonder if it's like a slump.

448
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,430
Maybe.

449
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,440
Don't be timid and just write away.

450
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,580
If I write something that I don't enjoy writing, who would enjoy reading it?

451
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,880
The more I cannot write, the more worried I become.

452
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,580
I worry that maybe my writing powers are used up.

453
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,720
I worry that maybe my writing powers are used up.
She's merely a delicate sixteen year old.

454
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,220
She's merely a delicate sixteen year old.

455
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,280
She's merely a delicate sixteen year old.
Gosh, writers who can't write are depressing.

456
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,020
Gosh, writers who can't write are depressing.

457
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,220
You sure you should say that?

458
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,120
You always kick them when they're down.

459
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,630
You can console her sometimes.

460
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,790
She says quite a bit.

461
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Hey, the weather is so nice, why don't we go eat lunch at the river banks?

462
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,370
Materialistic Therapy Method

463
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,370
Materialistic Therapy Method
Aya-chan you too, put some oxygen in your brain.

464
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:20,600
Materialistic Therapy Method

465
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,410
Gosh it feels so good.

466
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,180
It would feel good to do a rehearsal right here.

467
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,480
that's a great idea.

468
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,950
That's right, maybe making those two into twins would expand the story somewhat.

469
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,520
It seems like it'll work out. Aren't you glad?

470
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,460
Yeah.

471
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,660
What's up? Aren't you going to say, "why don't you just quite the play?"

472
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,400
Um, no.

473
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,430
But if Aya-chan's this busy, we're really in trouble.

474
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,070
What, me? I'm going to do it. I'm the one who started this whole thing.

475
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,900
Yes, yes.

476
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,850
Hey.

477
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,880
Why did you all of a sudden decide to do the play?

478
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,390
You resisted the idea so much at first.

479
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,460
Oh that. Well, I thought that it would be more fun than studying.

480
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,930
I thought that there was something that I wanted to be involved in besides studying.

481
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,000
For me, there is only the world of me and Arima and study.

482
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,630
But for Arima, he has another world besides just us and study, and he goes to the Inter-cups and stuff.

483
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,240
You could say I'm jealous, but I also want to have a world of my own too.

484
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,240
You don't like to lose.

485
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,310
I just think it has to be that way.

486
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,180
And on top of that, Arima likes me.

487
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,820
What? What's with your talking about your love affair? Talking about your love affair?

488
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,750
Arima's world is deeper than mine.

489
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,860
I think that if there is anything that would make me worry or become distressed...

490
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,660
...he would just take it all upon himself.

491
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,360
That's what I thought.

492
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,200
That's why I wanted to just make my own world.

493
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,430
I like to be dependent and pampered by Arima...

494
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,830
...but I don't want to become lazy and complacent.

495
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,310
That's why Arima responds exclusively to Yukino, out of all the girls that he can respond to.

496
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,010
You laugh at me, that's not fair.

497
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,480
I'm always talking about myself. Why don't you tell me about yourself sometime, Maho-san?

498
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:16,880
No way.

499
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,150
No way.
Aw, come on, talk about it!

500
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,150
Aw, come on, talk about it!

501
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,390
No I don't want to.

502
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,860
Hey, you lezbos over there, the chimes' ringing.

503
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Stage 9

504
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,930
Contemplating.

505
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,530
Contemplating.
For me to understand Arima-kun

506
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,400
For me to understand Arima-kun

507
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,600
For me to understand Arima-kun
Contemplating.

508
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,130
Contemplating.
I don't understand the falling in love feelings.

509
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,730
I don't understand the falling in love feelings.

510
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,070
Sakura!!

511
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,810
...and... Asaba-kun

512
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:41,840
...and... Asaba-kun
Hi. Doing alright?

513
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,040
Hi. Doing alright?

514
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,810
Don't look the other way.

515
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,110
Of all the classmates, you and I have the worst affinity.

516
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,520
That's because you're just a facade.

517
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,650
Ridiculous!

518
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,390
I'm not just a facade!

519
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,990
You, they say that you only like cute girls.

520
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,690
I can't stand that kind of attitude.

521
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,930
All girls are cute.

522
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,530
Aw, shut up. I just like pretty things, that's all.

523
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,200
It is because of the cruel discernment, that beauty is beauty.

524
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,430
It is because of the cruel discernment, that beauty is beauty.
Beauty

525
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,530
Beauty
Otherwise, it doesn't accord with reason.

526
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,300
Otherwise, it doesn't accord with reason.

527
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,440
It seems that she argues philosophically.

528
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,270
It seems that she argues philosophically.
Not so! Absolutely not so!

529
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,110
What does it matter.

530
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,180
Summer clothes are going to be gone this month, so you better get your eyeful.

531
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,310
Look at them.

532
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,820
Look at the momentary brilliant light of those maidens...

533
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,280
...before they go out into the world and are tossed by its rough waves.

534
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,450
Yes, beautiful.

535
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,020
And he too was looking.

536
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,390
And he too was looking

537
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,890
He was looking.

538
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,520
Another parting.

539
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,530
Another parting.
Later

540
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:35,960
Another parting.

541
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:36,760
And then, realization.

542
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,860
And then, realization.
Oh, Tonami.

543
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,030
And then, realization.

544
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,500
And then, an ontological provocation.

545
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,830
And then, an ontological provocation.
FOOOOL!!

546
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,800
And then, an ontological provocation.

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Ouch!

548
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,140
Ow, what's with your frightening strength? You're not a woman.
Shut up.
What do you mean by "FOOL"?

549
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,340
Shut up, just said it cause I wanted to say it.

550
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,500
Shut up, just said it cause I wanted to say it.
And then, another ontological provocation.

551
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:47,540
And then, another ontological provocation.

552
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,370
And then, another ontological provocation.
I pity da foo!

553
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:48,510
I pity da foo!

554
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,710
Sparkle

555
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,710
Dammit, what's with this irritation

556
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,540
Dammit, what's with this irritation
And then.

557
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:51,780
Dammit, what's with this irritation

558
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,010
Unknown actions.

559
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,180
A vague perspective.

560
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,710
Uncertain feelings.

561
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,610
This gal

562
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,050
Was never a kind of person who would be laughing with another guy

563
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,020
Was never a kind of person who would be laughing with another guy
It's just that her
personality has
rounded out.

564
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,820
On top of that, she ki...kissed me yesterday.

565
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,120
And she kissed me and...

566
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,390
And she kissed me and...
Feeling a
weird aura
from the back

567
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:05,790
A sudden question.

568
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,820
A sudden question.
Why did I do such a thing?

569
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,090
Why did I do such a thing?

570
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,390
Why did I do such a thing?
Disbelief.

571
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,560
Disbelief.

572
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,790
Disbelief.
No way!

573
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,220
No way!
Deception.

574
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,730
Deception.
Am I a person
who likes men?

575
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,660
Perplexity.

576
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,160
Revelation.

577
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,660
Something remembered.

578
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,360
And panic.

579
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,230
Ultimate question.

580
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,800
Ultimate question.
Huh?

581
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:14,830
Huh?

582
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,430
Huh?
Complications of memory.

583
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,970
Complications of memory.
Was Sakura like that? Wasn't she a lot more strong looking...

584
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,700
Was Sakura like that? Wasn't she a lot more strong looking...

585
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,930
Was Sakura like that? Wasn't she a lot more strong looking...
The moment.

586
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,130
The moment.

587
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,630
The moment.
Hmm?

588
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,830
Hmm?
Eternity

589
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:18,970
Eternity

590
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,300
Eternity
There is a link in my mind that is disconnected.

591
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,200
There is a link in my mind that is disconnected.
Kindness

592
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Kindness

593
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Cruelty.

594
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,170
Cruelty.
There is something important that is missing.

595
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,970
There is something important that is missing.
Hope.

596
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:21,970
Hope.

597
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,370
Meaninglessness.

598
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:31,950
The beginning

599
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,650
The beginning
What

600
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,120
What
A beginning that started much too slowly.

601
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,180
A beginning that started much too slowly.

602
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,620
A beginning that started much too slowly.
Why is she so light?

603
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,050
Why is she so light?

604
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,250
The beginning of confusion.
Were her arms this thin?

605
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,020
Were her arms this thin?

606
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,490
Were her arms this thin?
The beginning of suffering.

607
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:38,990
Were her arms this thin?

608
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,120
Were her arms this thin?
The beginning of joy.

609
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,520
The beginning of joy.

610
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,420
The beginning of joy.
Yeah, this image of Sakura that's burned into my memory is aggressively more powerful than myself.

611
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Yeah, this image of Sakura that's burned into my memory is aggressively more powerful than myself.

612
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:42,590
The beginning of sadness.

613
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,960
The beginning of sadness.
That's why I always thought that she would be absolutely strong.

614
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,830
That's why I always thought that she would be absolutely strong.

615
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,160
That's why I always thought that she would be absolutely strong.
The beginning of retreat.

616
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,420
The beginning of retreat.

617
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,730
The beginning of retreat.
Why didn't I realize it all along?

618
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,140
Boink

619
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,070
You.

620
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,770
You help me, then you throw me.

621
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,380
Hey.

622
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:09,850
He came to realize.

623
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,720
He came to realize.
A long time ago, there was no sexual difference between us.

624
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
A long time ago, there was no sexual difference between us.

625
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,250
A long time ago, there was no sexual difference between us.
He came to realize.

626
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,320
He came to realize.
Therefore for the longest time, I haven't been able to name these feelings.

627
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,090
Therefore for the longest time, I haven't been able to name these feelings.

628
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,560
It's a simple matter.

629
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,030
Why did I become so deeply hurt about Sakura thinking nothing of me?

630
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,060
Why did I want Sakura to acknowledge my existence so much?

631
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,160
Why am I unhappy when Sakura is with another guy?

632
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,770
Because I love her.

633
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,630
At the limits of differences.

634
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,700
At the limits of differences.
All this time,
in my heart,
these feelings that
had nowhere to go...

635
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,100
At the limits of boundaries.

636
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,200
To wish, unto the future.

637
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,440
To go unto happiness.

638
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,410
And thus, His and Her Story

639
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,180
Will continue.
