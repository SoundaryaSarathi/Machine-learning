1
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,681
Right, I’ll tell her later.

2
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:14,688
Because there are too little of
clow cards that can talk.

3
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,950
– There wasn’t any problem?
– Your father came in for a second.

4
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,354
I see. Thank you.

5
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,294
I’m very tired!

6
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,027
You did very well.
Today you transformed

7
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,301
four Sakura cards without a breath!

8
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,328
That is true.
But I don’t know with this speed,

9
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,595
when I will transform

10
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:58,804
all of the cards.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,004
You can’t,

12
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,970
Don’t even think about transforming
all the cards at once again!

13
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,068
But if I don’t hurry

14
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:05,973
then the cards well lose their power.

15
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,907
I don’t want that to happen.

16
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,517
They won’t be losing
their power anytime soon.

17
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:12,485
This I know.

18
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:16,649
– I would like to ask… 
– What?

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,124
There is someone coming!

20
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:28,500
Hurry and go back! Hurry and go back!

21
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,303
Yes.

22
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:48,279
You still haven’t slept?
Hurry up and sleep.

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,284
You are a big monster.

24
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:06,501
Hurry up and sleep then.

25
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:08,305
Tomorrow I have to go to school early

26
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,472
Change into your pajamas then.

27
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,359
[Sakura, Card and Present]

28
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,998
Sakura, I’ve been thinking.

29
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,599
Does your brother know
what we are doing?

30
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,670
I’m gonna be late!

31
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,636
Are you listening? You brother he…

32
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,512
Tell me later.

33
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:46,575
I think that

34
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:48,381
so you should be…

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,617
he also has some powers

36
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,178
Yeah brother is very talented.

37
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,847
Piano, Drawing,

38
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:58,487
but he still loves me a lot.

39
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:00,555
Thats not what I’m saying!

40
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,326
Calm down!

41
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:07,794
If he knew then he would ask me
a lot of questions.

42
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:14,473
Good Morning Dad, Brother

43
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,032
Morning, Sakura-san

44
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,908
MORNING Brother!

45
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,075
Amennn…

46
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,749
Hurry up and eat.

47
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:32,816
Oh, it looks like

48
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:34,592
somebody is hungry.

49
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,523
You should save some food
for other people.

50
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:38,726
Because you are a monster.

51
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,702
How mean of brother!

52
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:49,136
He probably knows but he’s not saying anything!

53
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:50,344
It’s something that he would do!

54
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,770
It’s what Kero-chan thought.

55
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,979
I’m leaving!
Be careful.

56
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,182
It’s very cold!

57
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:05,389
It’s a Christmas Tree!

58
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,962
This years who should I give
Christmas presents to?

59
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,191
Tomoyo-chan, Chiharu-chan,
Rika-chan, Naoko-chan,

60
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,035
and Dad, Brother
and Yukito-san

61
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,171
It seems like there’s
someone I’m missing.

62
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,373
– Who is it?
– Hey.

63
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,748
Do you know what you’re getting for dad?

64
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,744
Not yet. What should I get?

65
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:37,090
Dad really wants a money bag.

66
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,084
So he can use it.

67
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,490
Alright, I am going to
buy a money bag for dad!

68
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,928
– Do you have enough money?
– Is it expensive?

69
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:50,864
It’s more than you can afford.

70
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:55,267
I really want to make dad happy,

71
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:58,143
but I don’t have enough money.
What do I do?

72
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:03,981
I’m also getting dad
a money bag for a Christmas present.

73
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,813
– We can give it to him together.
– Really?

74
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,716
I’m thinking we should go buy it today.

75
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,852
I want to go too!

76
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,332
Yukito-san isn’t coming?
What’s wrong?

77
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,973
Then at 4:00 I’ll come here
and wait for you.

78
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,604
I’ll see you at 4.

79
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:34,742
Morning.

80
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:39,420
Morning Yuki.

81
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:45,220
Hey Yuki, Yuki…

82
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,863
Touya, morning

83
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,701
You came here early?

84
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,629
Because I am very tired.

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,805
So I came early to sleep.

86
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:06,178
Yuki, Yuki,

87
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,706
– YUKI!
– What…

88
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,079
If you keep on acting
this way then you will fall.

89
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,720
Yuki, you are…

90
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:20,626
– GOOD MORNING!
– What do you want?

91
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:22,394
I really wanted to see you, Touya-kun!

92
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,829
You saw me yesterday at school.

93
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,131
But I haven’t seen you
in the last 12 hours!

94
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,601
Did you sleep well?

95
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,868
– Stop holding on to me! Let go!
– I don’t want to!

96
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:58,196
Morning!

97
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:07,340
Shao Lan-kun, you wrote
my name on the board?

98
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,274
Yeah.

99
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,405
Right, Mei Lin-chan wrote me a note.

100
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:16,383
She wrote…

101
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,692
She wrote this. What does this mean?

102
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,391
It means my very good friend.

103
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,131
I have to hurry and write her back!

104
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:40,969
Right,

105
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,904
does Hong Kong celebrate Christmas?

106
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,470
Do you give Christmas presents?

107
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,140
You give them to your good friends.

108
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,913
Then I’ll give a Christmas
present to you!

109
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,587
But my allowance is very small

110
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,092
so I can only give small things.

111
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,195
What?

112
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:15,642
Um… I…

113
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:17,936
Talking about Christmas presents…

114
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,648
Before they kept Christmas trees outside.

115
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,978
Then on top they put a lot of good food.

116
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,649
But outside is so cold,

117
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,052
won’t the food freeze?

118
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:35,694
Right,

119
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,828
That’s why they made frozen food.

120
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,162
Cake is also ice cream cake…

121
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,308
I will look around.

122
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:03,086
Where will Sakura-san play?

123
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,698
Do you want me to help
get your dad’s present?

124
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,608
Brother is going is waiting for me.

125
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,044
Sorry, but I can’t go shopping with you.

126
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,709
I’m also going to be busy
so don’t be worried!

127
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:29,412
Doing what?

128
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,241
Because its about to be Christmas!

129
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,844
I have to get a present for you!

130
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:39,916
Christmas Present! I’ll make a very good
video tape of Sakura-chan

131
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,686
I have to hurry and finish taping!

132
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,996
You don’t really want to make that…

133
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,634
I’m leaving now!

134
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,675
I also have to hurry and
write this stuff down.

135
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:58,712
Shao Lan-kun, you can put this board back

136
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,071
to the classroom then you can go.

137
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,584
I’ll be done writing soon.

138
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:10,890
I’ll write then.

139
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:14,323
Writing those words down is easier

140
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,092
I’ll write the words ok?

141
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,530
You go buy Christmas presents…

142
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:24,762
So, excuse me.
See you tomorrow.

143
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,202
Bleh, why didn’t I say it?

144
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,207
A very pretty piece of music

145
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,244
Thank you very much.

146
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:16,289
This is a thank you song.

147
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,688
On a mountain there was a place.

148
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,125
I want to go there for Christmas.

149
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:26,728
So today I’m playing this song.

150
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,035
That’s incredible.

151
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,034
It gives warm feelings…

152
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,338
Its really great that you can

153
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:43,449
play such a great song.

154
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:45,775
Playing this song is to thank

155
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,987
even the little things.

156
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:48,479
Small Thanks?

157
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:51,619
I’m playing this song

158
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,820
to thank the flowers,

159
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,492
water and air.

160
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,022
You can only use this kind
of thanks with the piano

161
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:05,336
Flowers, water, air?

162
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,368
It’s not for people.
It’s only for things.

163
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,781
You can go by yourself?

164
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,280
Last time I went to sleep
I was very tired.

165
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,918
So don’t worry…

166
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,854
Yuki.

167
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,966
– What?
– I really want to tell you,

168
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,631
– You are… 
– Touya-kun!!!

169
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,038
Let’s go home together ok?

170
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:47,542
How come you came here again?

171
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,182
Were you thinking of me?

172
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,051
– Of course not!
– So, I’ll see ya tomorrow.

173
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,013
Hey! Yuki!

174
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,194
– Are you happy now?
– What did you say?

175
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,729
She left already.

176
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,867
Shao Lan-kun!

177
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,169
I thought you left early.

178
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:18,109
I was doing something else.

179
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,574
Shao Lan-kun, what are you doing?

180
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,774
Nothing…

181
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,878
Your brother still hasn’t come.

182
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,247
Bye-bye!

183
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,124
Shao Lan-kun!

184
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,460
What?

185
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,328
I want to ask you,

186
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:39,624
what does it mean

187
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,165
to thank the flowers, water and air?

188
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:45,334
I’m sorry, asking you
such things all of a sudden.

189
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,774
No problem…

190
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,042
I want to thank

191
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,939
someone in some kind of way.

192
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:56,907
Though, I don’t really understand why…

193
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:01,518
Sorry!

194
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,818
– This is…
– Clow-san’s presence!

195
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,698
I’ll go look and you can stay here.

196
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,464
No you can’t, I want to go too.

197
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,368
But I thought you had to wait right here.
Your brother will be worried.

198
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:19,262
You’re right…

199
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,197
Oh yeah!

200
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:27,604
O Key which hides the forces of darkness,

201
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:30,376
reveal thy true form before me.

202
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,217
I, Sakura, command thee under contract

203
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,519
Release!

204
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,198
Mirror!

205
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,948
Mirror-san, I need your help again.

206
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:10,990
– Yes.
– That’s great!

207
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:13,551
I…

208
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:17,189
Please go with my brother to buy stuff.

209
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,623
– I… 
– You can’t?

210
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,125
– No, it’s not that.
– Thank you.

211
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:30,066
Hey, lets go!

212
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,110
When can I tell her?

213
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,783
Eh!?
Go with her brother to buy stuff?

214
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,754
I can really feel it,

215
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,288
it’s Clow-san’s presence.

216
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,832
It seems like something isn’t right.

217
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,206
Is it coming?

218
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:07,946
Were you waiting for long?

219
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:12,252
Shall we go now?

220
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:18,122
You’re not Sakura are you?

221
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,893
I…

222
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,758
It’s that direction, right?
If I go there now,

223
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,298
then you’ll be troubled right?

224
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,133
Let’s go together and buy stuff.

225
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,076
Yes.

226
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:45,951
Jump!

227
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,949
King of thunder, descend!

228
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,232
– Thank you!
– It’s coming!

229
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,502
It’s coming again?

230
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:12,872
I don’t know how to defeat this.

231
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,879
You can’t use that,

232
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,581
so how are we going to defeat this?

233
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:19,184
Sakura!

234
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:28,418
Right! That card!

235
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,260
O Key which hides
the forces of the stars,

236
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,502
reveal thy true form before me.

237
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,371
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.

238
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:48,440
Mist!

239
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:15,772
It worked.

240
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:18,337
Hey, are you ok?

241
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,239
Yeah I’m fine.

242
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,870
What’s wrong?

243
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:27,018
I know what it was. Right!

244
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,690
Will he be at the piano?

245
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:35,061
Shao Lan-kun, sorry I have to go now.

246
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,263
What?

247
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,167
Don’t worry, I won’t tell Sakura.

248
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,008
I bought this when we were

249
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,508
buying dad’s present.

250
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:56,512
Thank you for coming with me today.

251
00:18:57,017 --> 00:18:58,609
I shouldn’t give this to you so early.
But this is your Christmas present.

252
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,921
This is for me?

253
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:13,960
Your hair is really long right?

254
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:24,143
Thank you very much.

255
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,172
I should be thanking you.

256
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:27,940
Thank you for always helping Sakura.

257
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:40,757
Sakura! How come you came home so late?
Where did you go?

258
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:42,685
You made me worried.

259
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,589
Sorry, Sorry!
You’re back?

260
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:50,269
I want you to listen to this.
You want me to listen?

261
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:51,702
Yup.

262
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:08,477
What is that?

263
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:12,155
This is all of the cards present!

264
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:17,594
Thank you to all of you for helping me

265
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:19,826
out when I’m in a bad situation.

266
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,062
I want to thank all of the cards

267
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,735
for always helping me out.

268
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,966
Later you will help me with a lot more.

269
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:31,969
I…

270
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,179
Before, I wanted to tell you something

271
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,744
What?

272
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,450
You are always helping us

273
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:47,426
and changing us to new cards.

274
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,586
We really would like to thank you.

275
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,465
All of us like you a lot.

276
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,724
So whenever you need our help,

277
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:57,535
please call on us.

278
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,698
Ok!

279
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:11,817
Huh? Was that ribbon there before?

280
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:15,721
Sakura, can I ask you a question?

281
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:17,350
What, Kero-chan?

282
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:19,988
You don’t know how to play the piano.

283
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,154
So how did you get that song?

284
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:26,994
Eriol-kun, will you play the piano,

285
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,562
I want to give that song to somebody!

286
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:33,065
I thought what should I
get for the cards?

287
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,031
But it was Eriol-kun who helped me.

288
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,735
– Oh I see!
– What do you mean “Oh I see”!

289
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:40,340
I spent a lot of work making that!

290
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:42,237
You can’t even play the piano

291
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:43,741
but you used your heart instead.

292
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:46,820
Thank you.

293
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:50,017
All of us really like you,

294
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,747
so keep working, Sakura!!

295
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,088
Yup!
