-Pikachu, Thunder Shock, now!
-Pikachu!

172
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,771
Poké Ball, go!

173
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,958
Yes! We got Pidgeotto!

174
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,419
Pikachu!

175
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,589
-I am the greatest.
-You're the worst!

176
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,132
You have no idea what you're doing.

177
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,635
It'll be a long time
till you're a Pokémon Master

178
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,971
-like, a million years.
-Ugh. I'm trying to--

179
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,849
You should try to learn something
about Pokémon first.

180
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,185
With Pokémon,
you've got to use strategy.

181
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,854
Pidgeotto is a bird. Caterpie is a worm.

182
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,814
Birds eat worms,
Mr. Pokémon Master!

183
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,526
Well, if you just try hard enough,
things will work out, won't they?

184
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,029
No, Ash, I'm afraid
things won't just work out

185
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,405
if you try hard enough.

186
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,992
The Pokémon trainer's judgment
is more important than anything else,

187
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,079
and unfortunately for you,
the trainer has to have a brain!

188
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,498
-Uh...
-[Jessie] Ha-ha.

189
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,124
[James]
So we meet again.

190
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,960
I know that voice.

191
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,547
[Jessie] To protect the world
from devastation.

192
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,925
[James] To unite all peoples
within our nation.

193
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,135
[Jessie] To denounce the evils
of truth and love.

194
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,429
[James] To extend our reach
to the stars above.

195
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,515
-Jessie!
-James!

196
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,892
No, not this again.

197
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,312
Team Rocket,
blast off at the speed of light!

198
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,690
Surrender now, or prepare to fight.

199
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,942
Meowth! That's right!

200
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,488
-Uh, we're kind of busy now, So if you--
-Quiet, little boy.

201
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,450
We're not here to listen to you.
We're here to get your Pokémon.

202
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,661
-[James] Hand over that Pikachu.
-Huh?

203
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,539
Hey, this is my Pikachu.
Go out and find your own.

204
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,500
The only Pikachu we want is that one.

205
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,546
We're only looking for the rarest,
most valuable Pokémon in the world, kid.

206
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,674
And that special Pikachu's
just the kind of Pokémon we need.

207
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,050
[both groan]

208
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,678
[Meowth] You idiots,
stop giving away all our secrets!

209
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,223
Is my Pikachu really that special?

210
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,643
Your Pikachu's powers
impress even me.

211
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,439
I really got a charge out of it's
incredible attack the last time we met.

212
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,526
Its powers exceed its evolutionary level.
Your Pokémon would--

213
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,862
Now you're the one
giving away all our secrets!

214
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,197
Shut up
before you tell them everything!

215
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,366
I'm in charge! Cut it out!

216
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,453
Make things easy
and hand over that Pikachu.

217
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,373
-Huh, forget it!
-Then you leave us no choice.

218
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,126
Pokémon battle! Ekans, go!

219
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,837
-Koffing, go get them!
-Koffing!

220
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,799
-Ekans!
-Hey, two against one? That's cheating!

221
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,262
Well, as we say, "all's fair in love, war,
and Pokémon battles."

222
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,973
I say that saying's rotten
and so are you.

223
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,934
Of course we are. We're the bad guys.

224
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,230
Well, if they're going to use two Pokémon,
I don't see why we can't use two Pokémon.

225
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,108
The Pokémon league rules
say only one at a time.

226
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,195
Ash, if you follow the rules,
you're going to lose all your Pokémon.

227
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,490
Koffing, sludge attack, now!

228
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,784
[all gasp]

229
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,744
[groaning]

230
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,332
If you think you can use your dirty tricks
to beat me, you're wrong!

231
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,585
They might try anything
to get what they want.

232
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,339
But no matter what happens,
don't let them have Pikachu, understand?

233
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,386
Misty, come on!

234
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,765
-But what about the other two?
-[sighs]

235
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,975
So, what's your big battle plan?

236
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,021
<i>I can't send Caterpie.</i>
<i>It's too weak from the last battle.</i>

237
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,321
Pidgeotto, go!

238
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,037
Koffing, it's grime time.

239
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,622
Koffing.

240
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,251
Ekans, go get your dinner.

241
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,258
Pidgeotto, quick attack!

242
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,344
Ekans, go underground.

243
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,558
Pidgeotto, behind you. Watch out!

244
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,482
Pidgeotto!

245
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,572
We're going to get a Pokémon!
We're going to get a Pokémon!

246
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,073
We're going to get a Pokémon!

247
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,409
-Koffing!
-Ekans!

248
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,870
Gust counterattack, now!

249
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,830
[screeches]

250
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,498
Koffing...

251
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,542
[groaning]

252
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,461
Pidgeotto, return!

253
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,632
-Ah! I'll show you!
-Ash!

254

[grunts]

256
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,096
-All right, let's go! Put 'em up!
-Ha, what a fool.

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,183
In Pokémon battles, only the Pokémon
can fight each other.

258
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,436
-Buzz off.
-[grunts] Ow!

259
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,397
-Are you okay?
-Guess you've got no choice.

260
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,942
Let Pikachu in
and watch Team Rocket win.

261
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,278
Pikachu!

262
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,490
No, Pikachu,
you can't battle In this condition.

263
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,326
-Pi...
-Ash, what are--

264
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,496
I know you're still weak
From battling Pidgeotto,

265
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,831
but now, Caterpie,
you're my only hope.

266
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,917
Just give it your very best shot.

267
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,878
Caterpie, go!

268
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,174
[squeals softly]

269
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,677
-What's that?
-It's a bug, a measly little bug.

270
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,889
-[all laugh]
-Let's get the bug spray.

271
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,140
Koffing...

272
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,768
-Koffing!
-Ekans!

00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,355
Pika!

274
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,481
Hang in there.

275
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,649
Koffing!

[grunts angrily]

277
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,444
Caterpie, string shot, now!

[grunts]

279
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,925
-Ah!
-Uh? Beaten by a Caterpie?

280
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,510
That really bugs me.

281
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,472
Now watch
a real Pokémon in action.

282
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,017
[grunts and meows]

283
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,899
It's time Team Rocket blasted off.

284
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,278
You may have won this round
but we'll be back.

285
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,657
Come back anytime.
We'll be glad to beat you. Mm!

286
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,952
We did it. We did it!

287
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,122
We won our first Pokémon Victory
fair and square!

288
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:06,210
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

289
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,005
[chuckles]

290
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,009
Caterpie, I'm very proud of you.

291
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,553
You really did your best
and we won because of you.

292

-You're stronger than you look, Caterpie.
-Pika.

[squeals]

294
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,061
Well, Misty, I guess you feel different
about Caterpie now.

295
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,481
-Uh, well, I...
-So why don't you two make up?

296
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,651
Just pat Caterpie on the head
and say thanks for a really great job.

[Caterpie whimpers]

298
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:37,366
You like Pokémon,, so it's only right
to congratulate one for doing a good job.

299
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,827
I guess you're right.

-Caterpie?

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,760

-[Misty] It's evolving.

it could keep on changing

308

to make friends.

Let's just get out of this forest.
