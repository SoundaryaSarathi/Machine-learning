-It's morning.
-[both] That means...

141
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,948
we'd better run for cover.

but where are we running?

-To make a phone call.
-Huh?

144
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,040
But, Jessie, we don't have any money.

145
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,918
There's one number
we can always call for free.

00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,547
Hello, operator, I'd like to put this call
through collect, please.

00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,591
Who'd accept the charges?

[man] You fools had better have
a very good reason

for calling me this early in the morning.

152
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,685
Yes, but first,
we must do the introduction.

<i>-What?</i>
-Prepare for trouble.

154
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,482
Yes, and make it double.

[Jessie]
To protect the world from devastation.

156

Well, I suppose we'll have
to get off this island ourselves.

-The phone didn't help.
-But it will.

166

But where will this telephone cable
lead us?

167
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,981
It must lead to the phone company.
The people there

168
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,400
-can help us get off the island.
-Good point.

169

And if we stay inside this booth
the whole way, we'll be safe.

[both panting]

174
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,391
Jessie,
hauling this phone booth is exhausting.

175
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,226
Well, you could use a good workout.

176
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,021
-[both] Huh?
-[James] Is that a mirage?

177
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,983
Pikachu doesn't even see us.

178
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,402
So we'll have no trouble catching it.

179
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,365
[both] Come to us, Pikachu. [both gasp]

180
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,120
It is a mirage.

181
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,039
A really big mirage.

182
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,916
[both] It's Big-achu!

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,460
[both scream]

184
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,213
[all gasp]

185
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,882
[all] Let's get out of here!

186
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,967
[roaring]

187
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,385
[all screaming]

188
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,345
It looks like a Charizard.

189
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,389
An evolved Charmander?

190
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,849
But much bigger.

191
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,194
This is Squirtle's evolved form,
a Blastoise.

192
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,001
[growling]

193
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,717
[all grunts]

194
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,304
Squirtle.

195
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,475
[all screaming]

196
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,776
That's a Venusaur,
evolved from a Bulbasaur.

197
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,407
[Squirtle grunts]

198
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,924
[both screaming]

199
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,636
-This is a nightmare.
-Well, I hope we wake up soon.

200
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,097
[JESSIE] There's a railcar.
Let's hop in and make a run for it.

201
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,307
-Hurry! Let's go!
-[both grunts]

202
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,268
[wheel grates]

203
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,854
-Huh?
-Don't tell me we're...

204
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,189
[both] Going back the way we came!

205
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,442
[both scream]

206
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,864
Jessie, we've got to do something.

207
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,867
-Let's hit the brake and run for it.
-Right.

208
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,826
-One.
-Two.

209
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,786
[both] Three! Pull!

210
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,413
Huh?

211
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,333
[both] Runaway train!

212
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,881
[all panting]

213
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,507
-[all gasp]
-Pikachu!

214
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,384
[screaming]

215
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,802
Pikachu?

216
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,679
-Jumbo-sized.
-[rumbling]

217
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,847
[grunts]

218
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,477
I wonder what that is.

219
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,980
[all screaming]

220
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,608
[gasping and screaming]

221
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,528
[screaming]

222
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,198
Now we've got you
just where we want you.

223
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,950
Hand over Pikachu. Huh?

224
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,953
-[both scream]
-[James] But not that big one.

225
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,080
- Ash, look. Back there.
- [gasps]

226
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,251
[all screaming]

227
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,212
-Pikachu!
-[Pokémon yelling]

228
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,796
Pika pi!

229
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,091
Squirtle! Charmander! Bulbasaur!

230
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,345
They'll all be trampled
if you don't do something.

231
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,013
Stop the car right now!

232
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,182
-[James whimpers]
-We can't do that.

233
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,434
We can't stop. The brake's broken.

234
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,144
Give me a break.

235
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,104
[all scream]

236
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,065
-We've just got to help them.
-Huh?

237
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,900
-Ash, up ahead.
-Huh?

238
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,027
What is it?

239
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,198
-Prepare for big trouble.
-Make it double.

240
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,492
And I can't stand roller coasters!

241
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,453
-What do we do?
-Hold on tight! [grunts]

242
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,621
[screams]

243
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,500
Stop the ride! Stop the ride!
I want to get off!

244
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,420
-Whoa!
-[all scream]

245
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,632
We're going to crash!

246
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,841
[all grunting]

247
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,136
-Come on, jump in!
-Pika!

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,013
[all yelling]

249
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,390
[laughter]

250
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,058
[groaning and hissing]

251
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,478
-Pika!
-[laughs]

252
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,772
-Are you okay?
-Pikachu.

253
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,234
Wow, we made it.
Is everybody here?

254
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,280
-Aren't we missing someone?
-The furriest member of our team.

255
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,073
-You mean Meowth?
-[both grunts]

256
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,784
-You're safe.
-How did you make it?

257
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,453
[laughs] I catapulted.

258
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,122
[screeches]

259
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
[all screaming]

260
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,754
[Misty] They're after us!
[Ash] Maybe our luck will hold out!

261
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,384
Well, based on our recent run of luck,
I would say the cable should snap.

262
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,053
That should happen about now.

263
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,514
-[Misty moans]
-Next, we'll be hurled into the air.

264
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,391
[all yelling]

265
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,435
Then we'll probably crash into something.

266
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,354
[all screaming]

267
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,816
That's weird.
Looks like that was a mechanical Pokémon.

268
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,158
-And then, finally...
-We hit the water.

269
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,246
After a very, very long drop!

270
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,252
[tour guide]<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to Pokémon land.</i>

271
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,340
<i>Here, you'll see various Pokémon</i>
<i>at over ten times their natural size.</i>

272
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,759
Of course, the Pokémon are all mechanical,

273
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,053
So don't worry, it's very safe.

274
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,639
Now, if you'll look to your left...
[gasps]

276
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,561
We apologize, ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,648
but our giant Pokémon
are temporarily out of order.

[boss] Yes. What?

280
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,824
Pokémon land has been totally
destroyed? [growls]

281
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,453
I spent millions on that place.
