00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,634
<i>Kakarrot...</i>

2
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,460
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

3
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:15,393
Okay, let's find the remaining
Dragon Balls quickly, and go back to Earth!

4
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:19,659
Saying " do it quickly" is one thing,
but as spread-out as this place is...

5
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,337
We'll find them for sure, you'll see.

6
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:28,006
Thank you very much, Zarkuro-<i>san</i>.

7
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,008
Come to mention it,
where is Lychee-<i>san</i> today?

8
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:34,012
He said he was staying home
because he had some work to do.

9
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:38,949
That's strange. One of the Dragon Balls
is moving toward us rapidly.

10
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:52,955
What is that?

11
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,806
What are you doing!?
The Dragon Ball is inside that thing!

12
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,994
Hurry up and go get the Dragon Ball!

13
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:27,158
Y- you can't mean that. Let's just
wait until the tornado disperses.

14
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,002
That tornado isn't going to disperse.

15
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,439
On this planet, tornados
roam around the desert forever.

16
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:47,451
Snap to it. I'm going to be
taking shelter, okay?

17
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,692
What are you doing!?

18
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,027
Hurry up!

19
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,029
A- all right.

20
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,698
Gohan, we're going to release
our <i>Ki</i> toward that thing.

21
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,033
Right.

22
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,466
All right...

23
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,974
<i>Kienzan!!</i>

24
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>Masenko!!</i>

25
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:19,651
Stop that! If you do that,
you're going to destroy the Dragon Ball!

26
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,482
B- but...

27
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,254
What are you doing!?
Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy!

28
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,926
Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!

29
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:43,440
This is why I said I didn't
want to come to Planet Namek!

30
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:51,015
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

31
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,351
This is why I said I couldn't
go from the start, you know!

32
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:59,023
There's no way a delicate young lady
like myself can go looking for Dragon Balls!

33
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,786
You're not serious!

34
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:07,131
<i>Without that Dragon Ball, Piccolo-san</i>
<i>won't be coming back to life.</i>

35
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,911
There it is!

36
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,329
I did it!

37
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,331
All right...

38
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,765
<i>Masenko!!</i>

39
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:51,676
Gohan!

40
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:54,012
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

41
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,013
I got it out.

42
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,347
You did it!

43
00:05:56,347 --> 00:06:00,841
Yahoo! That makes
four of them! You did it!

44
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,633
Sure enough, this is
the best outfit for me!

45
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:38,080
This one is that way,
no doubt about it.

46
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:56,007
It sure is dark.
I can't see a thing.

47
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,942
Shall I make us a torch?

48
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:10,283
W- what was that just now?

49
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:19,517
This isn't a forest, it's a bird!

50
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,294
Aah! Help!

51
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,800
Look at that incredible castle!

52
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,009
We've got no choice
but to jump off!

53
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,011
It does look like that's
the only thing we can do.

54
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,681
Y- you're kidding, right!?

55
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,014
If we don't act fast,
we're going to become bird food.

56
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:32,029
All right! All right, already. But you guys
are responsible for catching me!

57
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,758
We know.

58
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:48,706
Remember this well, you trash...
There aren't going to be any more miracles...

59
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:51,971
Be sure to enjoy yourselves until then...

60
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,825
I can't beat that Saiyan like this.

61
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,475
Say, the Dragon Ball is right nearby.

62
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:30,273
Okay, Bulma-<i>san</i>, you keep
a lookout, if you please.

63
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,117
I- it'll be okay, right?
He's sound asleep, after all.

64
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:51,362
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, have you found it?

65
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:55,032
No, not yet. What about
you, Zarkuro-<i>san</i>?

66
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:57,466
I haven't found it.

67
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,475
Geez, where exactly have you hidden it?

68
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,612
There it is!

69
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,021
Here goes.

70
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,955
Ready, set...

71
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,452
Ready, set...

72
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,140
Safe!

73
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,813
Okay, let's get back, quickly.

74
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:37,334
I've looked everywhere I can think of,
but I have absolutely no idea where he went.

75
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:42,006
Good grief! My darlin' Gohan-<i>chan</i>
is off strugglin' hard on a distant planet,

76
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,676
and what is his father, Goku-<i>sa</i>, doin'!?
He never does anythin' a parent should!

77
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,346
N- now, now, Chichi, you don't
need to get so worked up...

78
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,684
Goku must have felt terrible that he
couldn't do anything, all here on his own.

79
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:59,023
No, he's not gettin' away with it!
Makin' others worry about him like this...

80
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,790
If he doesn't get back here soon,
I'm goin' to turn this sweater into hankies!

81
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:11,035
You won't get away from me!

82
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,371
Bulma-<i>san</i>, are you sure
this toy can fly?

83
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,637
You just hush! If I say it
will fly, then it will fly!

84
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:23,314
I told you, we should have
run away down the stairs.

85
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:27,648
Stop all of your complaining
and do something about that guy, now!

86
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,422
I guess we've got no choice.

87
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:33,324
--All right, Gohan, let's go!
--Right!

88
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:36,760
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

89
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,447
Oh, man!
Enough, already!

90
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:08,025
I did it! I really am
a mechanical genius! Amazing!

91
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,788
<i>Kienzan!!</i>

92
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:17,125
<i>Masenko!!</i>

93
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,964
We got him!

94
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,331
We're saved!

95
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:51,001
For goodness' sake, you guys
are nothing but trouble for me!

96
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:55,673
If I weren't around, we wouldn't have
gotten a single Dragon Ball. You're hopeless.

97
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,766
You don't say...

98
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,785
Now there's only two left.

99
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:11,355
At this rate, we should be able
to go back to Earth soon, huh?

100
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:13,289
That would be nice...

101
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,289
Huh!?

102
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:55,488
It's almost time...

103
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:08,328
All right.

104
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,184
You are now healed.
You may open your eyes.

105
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:38,035
Unfortunately, we were not able
to regenerate your tail.

106
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:40,629
No matter. It will
grow back in time.

107
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:56,976
<i>Vegeta has recovered at last.</i>
<i>The fearsome battle is about to begin again.</i>
