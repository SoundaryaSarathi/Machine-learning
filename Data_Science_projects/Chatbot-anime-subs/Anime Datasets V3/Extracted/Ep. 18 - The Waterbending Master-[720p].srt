1
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,924
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,800
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,912
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:09,206
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:14,412
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:18,497
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,816
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:25,980
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:30,148
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,198
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,937
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,564
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:02,461
I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?

15
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:08,323
I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?

16
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:14,901
I'd love to! Climb on everyone, Sokka's ready for takeoff!

17
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,150
Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky...

18
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,618
...because we've been flying for two days straight.

19
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,950
And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe.

20
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,690
There's nothing up here.

21
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,630
They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!

22
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:54,821
He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe.

23
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:59,794
The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.

24
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,683
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!

25
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:08,399
Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into.

26
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,705
The Water Tribe is a great nation.

27
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,071
There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war.

28
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,003
The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress.

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,296
We'll need a massive invasion force.

30
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,740
There it is!

31
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,630
The Northern Water Tribe...

32
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,385
We're finally here...

33
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,103
I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!

34
00:02:56,146 --> 00:03:00,155
We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!

35
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,064
This place is beautiful.

36
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:45,109
Yeh, she is.

37
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:08,082
<i> Winter, spring, summer and fall. Winter, spring, summer and fall. <i></i>

38
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:20,494
<i> Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves. <i></i>

39
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:47,746
Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe,...

40
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:51,150
...and they have brought with them someone very special,...

41
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:56,803
...someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now.

42
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,395
The Avatar!

43
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:06,901
We also celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday.

44
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:11,381
Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

45
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,434
Thank you, father.

46
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,569
May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.

47
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:22,783
Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!

48
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:44,856
Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

49
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:47,721
Very nice to meet you.

50
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:53,704
So... uh... you're a Princess, huh?!

51
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:57,301
You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!

52
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,211
Ha! Prince of what?

53
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:03,079
A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!

54
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,247
My apologies, Prince Sokka.

55
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:09,876
So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile.

56
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:14,046
I'm thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?

57
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,904
Do an "activity"?

58
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,614
Very smooth.

59
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:27,311
Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.

60
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:33,622
Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.

61
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:36,485
My friend and I can't wait to start training with you...

62
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,665
...after we relax for a couple days.

63
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:42,738
If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island.

64
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:48,705
If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.

65
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:55,419
For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.

66
00:06:55,471 --> 00:07:01,579
No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.

67
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,668
I'm taking your crew.

68
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:05,794
What!?

69
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:09,386
I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.

70
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:11,099
Uncle, is that true?

71
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:16,351
I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone. Even the cook!

72
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,875
Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar.

73
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:24,715
But I can't have you getting in my way again.

74
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:45,335
I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

75
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:49,672
I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.

76
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:52,961
Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?

77
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:56,504
Just rumors. I don't think he is real.

78
00:07:56,531 --> 00:08:01,653
He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.

79
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,143
But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.

80
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:11,676
General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.

81
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,700
I've waited for this day my whole life!

82
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:22,825
I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!

83
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,097
Good morning, Master Pakku!

84
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:30,231
No, please, march right in, I'm not concentrating or anything.

85
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:35,574
Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?

86
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,945
I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

87
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:41,316
You didn't tell me your friend was a girl.

88
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:48,082
In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.

89
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,166
What do you mean you won't teach me?

90
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,224
I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me "no"!

91
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,173
No.

92
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:04,275
But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!

93
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,667
Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal.

94
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:13,333
I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.

95
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:15,459
I don't want to heal, I want to fight!

96
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:19,781
I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.

97
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,433
Well your rules stink!

98
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:25,647
Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then...

99
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:26,822
Then what?

100
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:28,859
Then I won't learn from you!

101
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:32,838
Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.

102
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,529
Wait! Aang didn't mean that.

103
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,759
You can't risk your training for me.

104
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:44,510
You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.

105
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,455
Why don't we get started then?

106
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,822
Princess Yue! Good morning!

107
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,228
Hey, how about that picnic last night?

108
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,712
Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.

109
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,794
I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

110
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:05,811
Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.

111
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:09,479
So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.

112
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,696
Do an "activity", you mean?

113
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,681
Yes! At... a place! For... some time!

114
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:19,176
I'd love to! I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

115
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:22,449
Great! I'll see you... aahh!

116
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,992
Sorry!

117
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:29,789
That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight.

118
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,755
I'm very impressed.

119
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,348
You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.

120
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:42,368
That's some tasty gold!

121
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,380
What do you need us to do?

122
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,594
I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko?

123
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,423
Um, hi. Are you Yugoda?

124
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:02,246
Are you here for the healing lesson?

125
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,128
I guess I am.

126
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:10,560
Welcome! Welcome!

127
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:19,974
You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.

128
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,891
I'm trying!

129
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:31,544
Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?

130
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,453
Thanks for the lesson.

131
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,336
So, who's the lucky boy?

132
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:39,013
Huh?

133
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,002
Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?

134
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,440
Ah, no, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

135
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,728
My grandmother gave my mother this necklace,...

136
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:51,721
...and my mother passed it down to me.

137
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:57,206
I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner!

138
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:59,675
You're the spitting image of Kana!

139
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,819
Wait, how do you know my Gran Gran's name?

140
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:07,113
When I was about your age I was friends with Kana.

141
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:10,257
She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.

142
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,967
She never told me.

143
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:15,887
Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender.

144
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,265
He carved that necklace for her.

145
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,478
If Gran Gran was engaged, why did she leave?

146
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:28,772
I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.

147
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,122
Good luck!

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,364
The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.

149
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:37,416
Good riddance to those traitors.

150
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:41,237
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me?

151
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,495
It would clear your head.

152
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:49,464
Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark.

153
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:53,584
Whatever makes you happy.

154
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:22,652
Careful with the blasting jelly!

155
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:30,569
Uncle? Uncle, is that you?

156
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,827
Zuko!

157
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,851
Zuko...

158
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:39,266
Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.

159
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,402
It's a bear.

160
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,598
Actually, it's suppose to be a fish, see it has a fin.

161
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:54,397
Oh. I'm sorry! I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here!

162
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,995
How's warrior training going?

163
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,058
That bad?

164
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,915
No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it.

165
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,049
One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!

166
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:14,356
So how's waterbending training?

167
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:18,413
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.

168
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,882
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

169
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,094
Why didn't I think of that?

170
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,670
At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku.

171
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:30,202
That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending.

172
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,772
Everyone's happy!

173
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,288
I'm not happy.

174
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,947
But you're never happy. Come on, Aang!

175
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:47,035
Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.

176
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,268
I got it!

177
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:51,922
That was amazing!

178
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:54,985
That wasn't me.

179
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,575
I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.

180
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:02,067
You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.

181
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,183
I'm sorry, I...

182
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,987
You are no longer welcome as my student.

183
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:19,102
What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?

184
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,085
Yes... please!

185
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:30,106
I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.

186
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:32,976
Fine.

187
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:35,819
I'm waiting, little girl.

188
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:42,137
No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!

189
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,478
Uh, Katara...

190
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:47,293
I'll be outside... if you're man enough to fight me!

191
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,294
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

192
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,244
Yeh, I think she did.

193
00:16:55,922 --> 00:17:02,097
I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just devastated.

194
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:07,045
The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.

195
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,859
You know who... was behind the attack?

196
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:15,878
Yes... pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.

197
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,713
They wanted revenge.

198
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:22,810
So, have you reconsidered my offer?

199
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:30,658
Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!

200
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,795
To victory!

201
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,837
Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!

202
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,663
I know! I don't care!

203
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,045
You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.

204
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:49,391
I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!

205
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,160
So, you decided to show up?

206
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,140
Aren't you gonna fight?

207
00:17:56,215 --> 00:18:01,298
Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.

208
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:10,048
Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad, study closely!

209
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,086
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!

210
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,996
You can't knock me down!

211
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,988
Go Katara!

212
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:29,322
Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.

213
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,605
But you still won't teach me, will you?

214
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:33,641
No.

215
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,345
This fight is over.

216
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:01,598
Come back here! I'm not finished yet!

217
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,816
Yes, you are.

218
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,645
This is my necklace!

219
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:11,331
No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!

220
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:18,188
I made this sixty years ago... for the love of my life. For Kana.

221
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,536
My Gran Gran was supposed to marry you?

222
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:32,518
Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

223
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,077
You didn't have to do this.

224
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:39,149
No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!

225
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,064
Thank you, Uncle.

226
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,223
Someone's coming!

227
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:51,209
Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good luck!

228
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:56,560
I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged.

229
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:01,857
I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.

230
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,107
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.

231
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,090
Gran Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.

232
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:16,814
That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.

233
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,049
Go get her.

234
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,965
What do you want from me?

235
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,940
Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful...

236
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:35,130
...and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.

237
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:36,804
You don't understand.

238
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:41,356
No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now.

239
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:45,716
You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.

240
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,243
No, Sokka...

241
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:54,014
It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see ya around, okay?

242
00:21:55,726 --> 00:22:01,350
Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy... but confused!

243
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:08,387
I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together... and not for the reason you think.

244
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:12,974
It's because... I'm engaged.

245
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:16,279
I'm sorry!

246
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:28,400
Not bad! Not bad! Heheh!

247
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,730
Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!

248
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:35,959
Hey Katara!

249
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:42,057
What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise. You're late.

250
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,294
Good to see ya here.

251
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,477
You too.

252
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:59,565
My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.
