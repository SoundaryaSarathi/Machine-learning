00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,734
<i>Hmm? What is he planning to do?</i>

2
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:37,094
No! Your body won't be able to bear it
if you go higher than 2X, Goku!

3
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:10,622
<i>Times-three Kaio-ken!!</i>

4
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:11,884
What!?

5
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,908
A- awesome!

6
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,989
<i>Why, you-!</i>

7
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,447
W- why, you-!

8
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:01,387
H- he can do this! He just
might be able to beat him!

9
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:07,939
Goku's fightin' power readin'
has risen, you say?

10
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,608
What on earth is goin' on?

11
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:14,279
Baba-<i>san</i>, please hurry up
and show us how the fight is going!

12
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,213
How is Gohan?
How is Gohan!?

13
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,954
I- it's no use! The <i>Ki</i> over there is too
strong, and I can't control the power!

14
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:27,959
You don't suppose Goku has unleashed
some technique he's been saving, do you?

15
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,628
Sure! If that's the case, then...

16
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:33,965
H- he just might win!

17
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:37,162
I, on the other hand,
have a bad feeling about this.

18
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,641
It's said that the flame of a candle
burns intensely just before it goes out.

19
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,644
It seems to me that Goku is
tremendously overexerting himself.

20
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:50,080
Don't say anythin' so ill-fated!

21
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:06,924
<i>l</i>- <i>impossible! How could his</i>- <i>how could</i>
<i>Kakarrot's battle power be higher than mine!?</i>

22
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:22,035
Damn... He's a tough one.
If I don't finish this quickly-

23
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:28,279
Damn! My body can't-!

24
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,717
<i>What're you doin', Goku!? You should just</i>
<i>put him away right here'n now!</i>

25
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:40,592
H- how can I let this happen!?
I am super-elite!

26
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:45,630
There's no way I should be beaten
by that lower-class warrior!

27
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,966
I... I am...

28
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:50,628
I am the greatest in the universe!

29
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,639
<i>My whole body is aching!</i>

30
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,406
<i>Sure enough, it looks like performing</i>
<i>a times-three Kaio-ken was asking too much...</i>

31
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:04,839
<i>lf I dally around,</i> I'll <i>be</i>
<i>the one who goes down first!</i>

32
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,592
Blood?

33
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:19,597
I had my noble blood shed over
fighting a piece of trash like that?

34
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:26,093
This will not stand! This absolutely...
absolutely will not stand!!

35
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,276
I don't need this planet anymore!

36
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,770
I'm going to crush you,
along with the rest of the Earth!

37
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:40,614
You're going to what!?

38
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,294
Go ahead and try to
dodge this, if you can!

39
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:54,128
Even if you spare yourself,
the Earth will be blown to pieces!

40
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,068
Dammit, he thought this through!

41
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,070
I ain't got no choice
but to risk it!

42
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,912
<i>Times-three Kaio-ken...</i>

43
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,595
<i>...Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

44
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,758
<i>Ka... me...</i>

45
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,281
<i>ha...</i>

46
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:47,274
There's absolutely no way
you can stop my <i>Gyallic Ho</i> blast!

47
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>me...</i>

48
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:10,596
Let you and the Earth
together turn to space dust!

49
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,848
Damn it, man! If I hafta die like this,
I should've eaten more meaty buns!

50
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,909
<i>Ha!!</i>

51
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,500
W- what!? It's just like my <i>Gyallic Ho</i>!

52
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,278
Yow, that's hot!

53
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,591
What is this?

54
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,161
T- the power of the <i>Ki</i>
from Goku and that other guy

55
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:05,561
is manifesting itself
through the crystal ball!

56
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:36,327
<i>Kaio-ken... times four!!</i>

57
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,591
No! Goku!

58
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,767
H- he's pushing back-

59
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,067
M- my body!

60
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,979
H- he did it...
He did it!

61
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,982
Son! You did it, didn'cha!?

62
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,416
You bastard!

63
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,656
Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

64
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,259
What, you hadn't noticed?

65
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,663
For someone as good as you are,
ya sure fought desperately, huh?

66
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,664
I guess so.

67
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,667
Still, you done a good job
of blowin' that wicked guy away.

68
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,761
You sure are one helluva dude.

69
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,345
W- what? What's the matter?

70
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,283
I used a technique that was
too much for my body to take...

71
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,618
Well, it wasn't nothin'
normal, all right.

72
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:11,622
More importantly, Yajirobe,
you'd better get out of here.

73
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:12,957
H- how come?

74
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,959
D- don't tell me!

75
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,394
He's still alive.

76
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:20,631
If that's all it would have taken for him
to die, there wouldn't be any challenge.

77
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:25,970
S- still, there's no problem, right?
You're stronger'n him, ain'cha?

78
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,977
Like I told you, I overdid it, and now my body
is in shambles. I could be near my limit.

79
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,638
O- oh, yeah?

80
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,317
Well, then...

81
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,751
H- hang in there!

82
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:04,008
Dammit!

83
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:09,613
Why!? Why is Kakarrot's
battle power higher than mine!?

84
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:16,382
Damn it to hell! I am a Saiyan!
I am the strongest in the entire universe!

85
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:26,297
At this point, as much as I dislike
how ugly it is, I'm using my last resort.

86
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,967
I'll transform into a Great
Ape, and crush him!

87
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:33,637
The strength of my Great Ape
form is nothing to sneeze at!

88
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:37,908
Damn it all, we chose the day
of the full moon to come here,

89
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,644
so we could wipe out the people
on this planet quickly.

90
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:46,048
To think that I would have to transform
just to defeat Kakarrot- it's infuriating!

91
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:57,090
That's strange. The moon
should be out by now...

92
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:03,933
<i>Saiyan, no matter how hard you look,</i>
<i>it won't do any good. The moon is gone.</i>

93
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,941
<i>The one named Piccolo feared this might</i>
<i>happen, and eliminated it long ago.</i>

94
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:14,612
<i>Still, Son Goku can't have</i>
<i>very much energy left.</i>

95
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,881
<i>Even if the Saiyan doesn't</i>
<i>turn into a Great Ape,</i>

96
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,550
<i>it doesn't change the fact</i>
<i>that he's still in a pinch.</i>

97
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,720
<i>Then again, he's become weaker, too.</i>
<i>The Genki Dama!</i>

98
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,885
<i>lf you can just hit him with a Genki Dama,</i>
<i>the way he is now, you can beat him for sure!</i>

99
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,909
<i>That's strange. He's just</i>
<i>going around in circles up there.</i>

100
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,311
<i>Why ain't he coming at me?</i>

101
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,647
It's not here! It's not here!
It's not here!

102
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:54,346
Dammit, the moon isn't anywhere!
What's going on!?

103
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:59,990
So that's it! Dammit! He is one
thoroughly aggravating bastard!

104
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,596
Kakarrot must have taken out the moon
ahead of time! Then it's unavoidable...

105
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:09,930
My battle power might drop somewhat,
but there doesn't seem to be any other way.

106
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,733
I can't wait to see the look
of stunned panic on his face!

107
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,368
He's finally coming back down.

108
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:30,621
<i>The only way I can beat him</i>
<i>is with the Genki Dama.</i>

109
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:33,958
<i>Am I going to be able to</i>
<i>mentally focus myself for that?</i>

110
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,627
Kakarrot...

111
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:41,298
You might have thought you could outwit me
by getting rid of the moon, but it won't work!

112
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,633
The moon?

113
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,302
What are you talking about?

114
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:51,642
As if you didn't know! Are you aware
of why we can transform during a full moon?

115
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:53,310
Transform?

116
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,314
The light from the moon is what
gets reflected from the sun.

117
00:15:57,314 --> 00:16:02,653
Sunlight contains Bruits waves only
when it is reflected back by the moon.

118
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:08,926
During a full moon, those Bruits waves
reach a level of over 17 million zeno.

119
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,595
What is he talking about?

120
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,598
When over 17 million zeno's worth
of Bruits waves are absorbed by our eyes,

121
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,269
it triggers a reaction in our tails,

122
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,203
and our transformation begins!

123
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,875
A limited number of Saiyans are able
to create an artificial full moon

124
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,946
that emits over 17 million zeno.

125
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,284
Things are not going to go as you expected!
Even if you have eliminated the moon,

126
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,721
by mixing this planet's
oxygen with my Power Ball...

127
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,299
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

128
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,968
The time of your death
has finally come.

129
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:56,640
A lower-class warrior like you should not
have challenged a super-elite to battle!

130
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,978
<i>The moment that strange light</i>
<i>started glowing, his Ki dropped.</i>

131
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,243
<i>What the hell is he planning</i>
<i>to go this far to do?</i>

132
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:15,491
What!?

133
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,760
Burst open and blend together!

134
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,613
What is that?

135
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:47,455
What!? What have you done!?

136
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:56,296
I- it can't be!
He's created a moon!

137
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:08,143
You're going to regret
losing your tail, Kakarrot!

138
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,601
Is this the end?

139
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:52,949
W- what's that?

140
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,765
<i>Transforming himself</i>
<i>into a Great Ape,</i>

141
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:39,336
<i>Vegeta resorts to the final</i>
<i>measure available to him.</i>

142
