1286
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,710
Miyazawa Yukino's mornings begin early.

1287
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,723
And are just as methodical
as the novitiates of Mt. Kouya.

1289
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,250
Not a minute of my time goes to waste.

1290
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,522
The better part of my
day gets spent studying.

1292
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:39,227
When Arima and I were
going all out on our love power...

1293
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,599
...I bailed on studying and

1294
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,866
abandoned myself to amusement...

1295
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:44,598
But now I've begun studying again.

1296
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,641
I decided to work hard so that our
relationship would be accepted by the school.

1298
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:53,545
At least, that's the official reason.
Actually, it's because I'm mildly humiliated

1300
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:55,882
...that Arima's grades were much better than mine

1301
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,981
even though he was slacking off with me.

1302
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
*Miyazawa Awakens Family*

1303
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,090
They're still trying to sleep.

1304
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,190
But their sleeping faces really are angelic.

1305
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:16,000
GROSS !

1306
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,499
What the hell're you doing
at this hour of the morning ?!

1307
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:19,974
Oh, but now you're awake.

1308
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,905
It's so cute how I care about my family.

1310
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,074
Breakfast, Let's eat!

1311
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,445
See you later!

1312
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,589
Oh, Yuki. What about school?
*Once again studying in progress.*

1313
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:43,796
Today's make-up exam day.

1314
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:45,393
Those who don't have make-ups have the day off.

1315
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,561
After lunch I'm going over to Arima's house...

1316
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:50,300
...so I'll hang out the futons
and do the laundry before then.

1317
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,466
Dammit, it's so frustrating
how Yuki has no weaknesses.

1319
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,799
I'm off!
*Departure*

1320
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,774
I have a fast-track lifestyle,
but I'm still able to meet Arima.

1322
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,573
I don't have feelings for anyone
else the way I do for Arima.

1324
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,078
"Because I strove to be perfect,
whenever I was with someone..."

1325
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:08,411
...I always thought that

1326
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,452
I had to be the one to push things along.

1327
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,761
Because Arima is the one person
I can be on equal terms with...

1328
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:16,630
...I can let myself be
taken care of by him.

1329
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,333
Miyazawa, want to come over to
my place on make-up exam day?

1330
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,166
I only have practice in the morning.

1331
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:22,434
Sure, I'd love to!

1332
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,101
No one else will be home that day.

1333
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:31,037
C...c...come to think of it,
what did he mean by that?!

1335
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:33,537
This is bad. This is BAD.
This is REALLY bad !

1336
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:41,121
Yeah, whatever. I'm sure Arima
doesn't have any ulterior motives.

1337
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,280
He's decent about that kind of thing.

1338
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,562
Hi. I was just in the shower. Come on in.

1339
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,158
S...shower?!

1340
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,636
No way!  Not Arima!

1341
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,732
He just wanted to freshen up after practice...

1342
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:00,500
Yeah, freshen up...

1343
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,843
But this feels different from the usual Arima!

1344
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:04,209
N...no...no way!

1345
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,442
B...b...but how can I be
sure that nothing will go on

1346
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:07,374
when we'll be all alone in this huge house?!

1348
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,877
He IS a guy, after all!

1349
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,824
I feel tired...

1350
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,488
Here you go, Souichirou.  Vegetable ramen.

1351
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,855
Hot foods are good for you in the summer.

1352
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:25,526
Don't talk to me like a housewife.

1353
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,799
Miyazawa, please sit, sit!

1354
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,132
Here's some iced tea.

1355
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,100
Stop playing the host!

1356
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,632
Whaddya think? My cooking's delicious!

1357
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,542
It's delicious!

1358
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:41,338
Just the fact that a guy
made it makes it taste bad.

1359
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,916
Cooks and chefs are guys, too !

1360
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,877
And you're neither.

1361
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:50,549
But, Asapin, I guess you hadn't
been goofing off as much as I thought.

1362
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:53,489
If you're at home on make-up
day, you must've studied a lot.

1364
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:55,724
What?  Make-up day?

1365
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,663
I flunked most of my tests.

1366
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,266
Y...y...y...you DUMBASS !

1367
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,998
What the hell're you doin'
standing around making ramen?!

1368
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,634
How the hell did you get into
our school in the first place?

1370
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,804
It's not too late!
Get your ass to school!

1371
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,002
Dressed like this?

1372
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:11,975
JUST GO!

1373
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,275
I'll buy some Jello on my way back!

1374
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:15,445
Get going already!

1375
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,115
Sorry this had to happen
right when you got here.

1376
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:22,452
I don't mind.

1377
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:23,714
Want to go to my room?

1378
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,092
Sure!  Arima!

1379
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:27,358
What is it?

1380
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:31,700
Miyazawa...

1381
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,158
I'll get some drinks, so you can head on up.

1382
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,699
We're such glorified kids...

1383
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,608
I thought he was going to kiss me.

1384
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,713
We're often alone together, 

1385
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:47,374
but there hasn't been
much in terms of progress.

1386
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,146
We've only kissed that one time.

1387
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,743
Speaking of which,
I wonder what's going on there.

1388
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:53,212
Oh, well.

1389
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,511
There's books scattered all over.

1390
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:56,955
Must be Asapin's doing.

1391
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,254
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms,"
"Kou'u and Ryuuhou..."

1392
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:02,355
So Arima likes long historical novels.

1393
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:03,593
How cute.

1394
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,732
"Shiba", "Ikenami", "Yamamoto..."

1395
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:09,534
What's up?

1396
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,404
These books.

1397
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:12,836
You want to borrow one?

1398
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,470
What kind of books do you read?

1399
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,034
Money!

1400
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:29,218
Come to think of it...

1401
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,381
What?

1402
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,193
This is the first time I've been
to your house besides study group.

1403
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,019
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1404
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,729
Your room's really nice.

1405
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,136
It has its own A/C. I'm jealous!

1406
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,767
R...really?

1407
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,633
Morning practice must be really tough!

1408
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:54,943
I guess. The captain's a morning person, so...

1409
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:56,777
Wow, really?

1410
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:58,013
Yeah, that's right.

1411
00:05:58,819 --> 00:05:59,444
I see.

1412
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:00,811
Uh huh.

1413
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:05,588
Say!

1414
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:06,618
Huh?!

1415
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:08,686
Miyazawa, I was wondering...

1416
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,995
do you just want some attention ?

1417
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,594
Um, actually... yeah.

1418
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,897
All right, here's some attention!

1419
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,065
Hey, ow!

1421
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:27,136
I guess I'm the only
one who's showing their hand.

1422
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:28,704
You're so cold.

1423
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,979
I feel like I'm the only one expressing my love.

1424
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:34,110
I bet you don't really love me all that much.

1425
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,920
What?! How could you say that?!

1426
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,425
I don't want to hear that from someone

1427
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,748
who cares about their
own grades more than me!

1428
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,287
Ouch, that hurt.

1429
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:44,689
That's not what's going on at all!

1430
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,104
Did I make him mad?

1431
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,438
That was supposed to be a joke...

1432
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:57,374
Shall I show you then...

1433
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,503
...just how much I love you?

1434
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Ah...

1435
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,742
It seems that my emotions
get out of control sometimes.

1436
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,651
I didn't want to scare you,

1437
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,283
so I haven't let them loose yet.

1438
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,922
Could this be . . .

1439
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,687
Would you like to find out, Miyazawa?

1440
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:18,924
Would you like to find out ?

1441
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:20,897
Provoking me...

1442
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:22,359
We're now

1443
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,761
in a delicate balance.

1444
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,736
The slender thread of emotion...

1445
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,940
...is stretched to the limit.

1446
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Y...yes.

1447
00:07:56,537 --> 00:08:01,204
That was totally different
from our previous kiss.

1448
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,435
I felt like my heart would
fly off somewhere far away.

1450
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,140
I was acutely aware
of Arima's presence.

1451
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,116
Miyazawa!

1452
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:24,220
I'll walk you home.

1453
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,432
That's ok. I'll take the bus back.

1454
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,799
I bet my face is all red,
so I'll cool off on the way home.

1455
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:31,562
Oh, okay.

1456
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:32,495
Yeah.

1457
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:33,601
Sorry about that.

1458
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,232
It's ok.

1459
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:36,975
Well, see you tomorrow.

1460
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:38,604
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

1461
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:43,984
It was a strange day today.

1462
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,220
But I got closer to Arima.

1463
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:58,124
And so the days accumulate...

1464
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,097
...and the weight of love grows.

1465
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:08,971
I'm home!

1466
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,872
Dinner!  Let's eat!

1467
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:14,746
Good night!

1468
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,074
Sis...

1469
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,111
Are you an elementary
school kid or something?

1470
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,490
This is the story of how I met you.

1471
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,973
Oh, crap!  It's time for fifth period!

1472
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:45,176
Spring. Not long after starting high school.

1473
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:48,946
April. I was still alone.

1474
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,487
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

1475
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:55,684
I apologize for coming to class late.

1476
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on now someone who was just

1477
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,621
speaker for the incoming class
shouldn't be doing such a thing.

1479
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,991
When we're done,
you can clean all the lab equipment.

1480
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,102
Wow, Arima, you're covered
in cherry blossom petals.

1481
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,659
Oh, these?

1482
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:12,799
There's a row of cherry trees across the river.

1483
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,100
Really ? I went over there for lunch break.

1484
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:16,134
I didn't know there was a place like that.

1485
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:17,909
I went there to eat my lunch and read,

1486
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:19,674
but it felt so nice, I dozed off.

1487
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:24,041
Why didn't you take us
with you?  Not fair!

1489
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,000
Not fair!

1490
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,043
Sorry, sorry.

1492
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,482
Why don't we go on a picnic as a class?

1493
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:29,887
Oh, that's a great idea.

1494
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:31,019
With some snacks and stuff?

1495
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,282
All right ! Party-time !

1496
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,456
Hey, Arima, you're coming, too, aren't you?

1497
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,090
What?
Sure, sounds good.

1498
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:38,227
It's decided!

1499
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,030
If Arima's going, I'm going, too.

1502
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:54,939
Arima.

1503
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,812
Oh, you didn't have to do this.

1504
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:58,979
It's my turn for cleanup duty today.

1505
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,000
Miyazawa. It's okay.

1506
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,514
It's my own fault, so I'll do it.

1507
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,222
Really? But I still feel bad...

1508
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:09,321
Her name is Miyazawa Yukino.

1509
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:11,057
Starting this month, 

1510
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:12,659
she became the representative
for class A with me.

1511
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,263
She radiates "older sister,"

1512
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:18,135
and is responsible and very smart.

1513
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,773
She also does her committee
work very efficiently,

1514
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,105
and is a wise and mature person.

1515
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,038
Miyazawa,

1516
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,208
those are the printouts from the
committee meeting this morning, right?

1517
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,375
Give me half of them.

1518
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,316
Oh, but I already finished them all myself.

1519
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,511
What?!  All of them, by yourself?

1520
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,021
Yeah. I had some time...

1521
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,850
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it

1522
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:40,922
because of practice this morning...

1523
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:45,221
It's all right. Besides,
you helped me out with the cleanup.

1525
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,198
Thank you.

1527
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:56,533
Miyazawa's amazing.
She's nice, and doesn't
seem to have any faults...

1528
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:00,509
I've realized that there really
are people like her in the world.

1530
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:03,539
What the heck are you
talking about, Arima?

1531
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,544
You're talking about yourself.

1532
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:06,476
Ah...?

1533
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:07,717
Highest scorer on the entrance exams!

1534
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:08,817
Outstanding in sports!

1535
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:09,713
Handsome!

1536
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:10,523
Nice!

1537
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,256
The most popular person in the whole class!

1538
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,422
You're perfect!

1539
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,655
Ah...?

1540
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:18,328
How can you sit there and
be impressed by someone else?!

1542
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,623
You don't know who
you are, do you?!

1545
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,735
You're so famous that there's no one
at this school who doesn't know about you!

1546
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,402
R...really?

1547
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,431
I haven't done anything that conspicuous.

1548
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:30,438
You stand out just by speaking!

1549
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,740
You and Miyazawa are peerless!

1551
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,705
You can say that again!

1552
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:40,381
It looks like all the girls are
after you, too, you little punk.

1555
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:42,813
Awake or asleep, it's nonstop
"Arima, Arima..."

1557
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,417
Don't you get it?

1558
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,052
What a pain!

1559
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,653
I should be seriously pissed off.

1560
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,892
Yeah, you were born
under a lucky star.

1562
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,699
Unlike us...

1563
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:55,626
Such a beautiful world.

1564
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,170
There was always a

1565
00:12:58,605 --> 00:12:59,970
peaceful atmosphere around me.

1566
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:01,838
Arima,

1567
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,706
have you gotten used to high school classes yet ?

1568
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:06,136
Yes, more or less.

1569
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,771
You're a very smart student.

1570
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:10,281
All of the teachers

1571
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,751
enjoy teaching you.

1572
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,215
HaHaHa...

1573
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:16,847
Sorry I'm late!

1574
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:18,083
I'll get ready right away!

1575
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,986
Well, don't stress yourself too much.

1576
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,523
Captain!  You're going
easy on Arima again!

1578
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,057
You never give us a break!

1579
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,100
Shut up!
Arima is on the Academic Committee!

1580
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:29,799
HaHaHa...

1581
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,097
Arima, could you help me with this?

1582
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,198
Let's play soccer!

1583
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:36,305
Every day was fun,

1584
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,400
and I always thought I was happy.

1585
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,547
But...every so often,
there was a fleeting voice.

1586
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,152
"Are you really having fun ?" ...it said.

1587
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,717
That was inside me...

1588
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:53,382
Almost like ice that never melts.

1589
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:57,524
But the days passed by.

1590
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:02,325
The same quiet, peaceful days.

1592
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:14,672
I'm sorry.

1593
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,481
Um, are you going out with anyone? 

1594
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:19,351
Um, I...

1595
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,582
Do you have someone you like ?

1596
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:22,612
She likes you.

1597
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,815
I love you.

1598
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:24,814
Arima!

1599
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,253
I love...

1600
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,754
Why is it?
I felt like something was wrong.

1601
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:36,267
I felt like this tranquility
was somehow artificial.

1603
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:40,103
Surrounded by laughing classmates...

1605
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,305
...there were times when I suddenly
felt everyone was far away.

1606
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,777
On those days, I felt afraid.

1608
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:48,040
Because I thought I might not
actually be feeling anything.

1609
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,146
Even when I was laughing or
having fun with my friends...

1610
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:55,355
...it felt like it all might be
just brushing off the surface of my heart...

1612
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:59,053
...and that nothing was really
reaching the inside of my heart.

1614
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:02,193
Even when girls told me they liked me,

1615
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:03,654
my heart was totally unmoved.

1616
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,126
There was an indelible
suspicion in my heart -

1618
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,000
That I'm always alone.

1621
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,439
That there wasn't anyone I could
actually call a friend.

1622
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:18,206
I'm actually always alone.

1623
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,912
That uncertainty was
always within me.

1624
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,377
Why did I come to think like that?

1625
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:29,585
I'm blessed by many more
things than other people.

1627
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,322
But...the days flowed past...

1628
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,519
The same quiet, peaceful days

1629
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,557
that felt like there was

1630
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,058
nothing there at all.

1631
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,400
So, give twenty copies
to each section, okay?

1632
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:46,838
I'm so tired.

1633
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:49,308
You've got a lot taxing your
stamina, so it must be hard.

1634
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,172
You must be busy, too,

1635
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:52,701
with studying and the committee.

1636
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,777
I guess. But I figured
that this is the norm.

1638
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,910
I've been doing this stuff for a
long time, so I'm used to it.

1640
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,520
So you're predisposed to committee work, too?

1641
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,111
I don't know how everyone knows,

1642
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:04,986
but I always get picked

1643
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,189
for this kind of thing.

1644
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,657
Miyazawa, was Hokuei your first choice?

1645
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,222
Yeah. Why?

1646
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:11,855
You're so smart.

1647
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,328
I was wondering if you
applied to any private schools.

1648
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,904
Yeah, but I have two younger sisters.

1650
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:22,003
Besides, I decided not to
spend any money on studying.

1652
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:25,604
I want to place the absolute minimum
financial burden on my parents...

1653
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:29,080
...while getting the
maximum amount of education.

1655
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:34,919
Having that sort of objective in mind
while studying gets me going.

1658
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,021
Studying's really fun
when you have a goal.

1659
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:37,914
You're really mature.

1660
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,256
Well, I just think that way because
my family isn't that well off.

1661
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:42,994
If we had more money,

1662
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,592
I would have wanted to go to a private school.

1664
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:47,794
Some of the classes not in the public
curriculum look pretty interesting.

1665
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:49,331
How about you?

1666
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:50,694
What?

1667
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:53,435
Your family runs a hospital, right?

1668
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,136
I'd think it's pretty rare for someone
like you to come to a public school.

1669
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:00,206
Yeah, I guess I have
the same reason as you.

1670
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,813
I guess we're both stingy.

1672
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:08,511
That gave me a shock.

1674
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:13,586
I just realized for the first time how
the girl next to me is standing straight...

1675
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,619
...with such unclouded eyes.

1676
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:21,200
That she decides everything by herself,
chooses everything by herself.
That she has her own way of living.

1678
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:25,362
She left a strong impression on me

1681
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,467
because she was so different from me.

1682
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:30,341
I want to know about her.

1683
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,511
I want to know what she's thinking.

1684
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,913
I want to ask about so many things.

1685
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,077
I want to know if she ever
has doubts or anxieties.

1686
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,389
If she ever feels

1687
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,651
the same loneliness I do.

1688
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:47,249
I want to know more.

1689
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:55,125
After school, at the
row of cherry trees...

1690
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:02,898
A quiet spring day.
How should I turn her down?

1691
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:09,441
Something was trying to change within me.

1692
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,712
Um...What?

1693
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,158
Miyazawa...called me out?!

1694
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:35,667
I'm so happy!

1695
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:37,337
I'm so happy!

1696
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:38,373
U...Um...

1697
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,178
Sorry I kept you waiting.

1698
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,578
Oh, were you meeting here?

1699
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,846
I was just watching the
cherry blossoms for a bit.

1700
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,145
What?!

1701
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:52,887
I...I misunderstood!

1702
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,485
I misunderstood

1703
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,187
S...sorry...

1705
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,568
At that moment,
I realized I liked her.

1706
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,000
I want to catch her.

1707
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,340
I want that girl with such clear eyes to notice me.

1708
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,820
My feelings began to overflow.

1710
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,152
This is the first time I've ever
wanted something so clearly.

1711
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,222
The April breeze bore the
cherry petals aloft into the sky.

1713
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:30,828
Under the cherry trees
in full bloom...

1714
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,734
...I fell in love for the first time.

1715
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,170
After that, I came upon the surprising
true nature of the girl who seemed to
be a bright beautiful person

1718
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,505
...and I began following
an unexpected path myself.

1719
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,343
Well, I guess that's how life goes.

1720
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:51,851
I don't regret any of it.
I think it's a good thing.

1721
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:54,705
What'll happen next!

1722
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,649
Sis and Arima are totally in love

1723
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,072
and have achieved their second kiss!

1724
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,314
But a state of emergency

1725
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:00,415
is awaiting her!

1726
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:01,377
It's finally time

1727
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,689
to pay the price for what she's done!

1728
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,022
Next time on KareKano:

1729
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:07,393
