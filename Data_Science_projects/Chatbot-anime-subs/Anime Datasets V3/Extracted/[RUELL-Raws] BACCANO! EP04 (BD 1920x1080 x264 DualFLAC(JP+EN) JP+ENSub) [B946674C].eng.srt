1
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:08,779
Why now, of all times?!

2
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:14,411
Where is my brother?
Where is Big Brother Dallas?

3
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,732
We don't know anything.

4
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:18,538
All of you, get down on the floor!

5
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,902
Get your hands up, everyone!

6
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:22,292
Nobody move!

7
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,295
W-What do we do?

8
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,673
Sorry for all the commotion.

9
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,661
They're shooting, huh? They're going at it, huh?

10
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,778
Machine guns? That makes it...

11
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,334
...all the more fun!

12
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,078
What was that all about, Boss?!

13
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,465
Nobody said anything about that!

14
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,510
There's trouble. Trouble, trouble.

15
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,513
Trouble... trouble, trouble...

16
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:20,017
Trouble... What is it?
What's going on in the dining car?!

17
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,298
Are they killing? Are they
getting killed? Really, which is it?

18
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:26,773
Hey, this is getting me excited!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,228
What is this?!

20
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,478
Having our take stolen is one thing,

21
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:41,278
but you think you can fool
me with this ridiculous story?!

22
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:43,375
But it's the truth!

23
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,085
It was a pair of robbers, wearing
Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb uniforms.

24
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,712
Wham!

25
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:50,839
Impossible!

26
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:55,122
The thing is, we interrogated
the bag man who was careless,

27
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:57,332
and he doesn't appear to be lying.

28
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:01,225
Ha. And to top things off,
Sidaris screwed up, too?!

29
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:01,975
Yes...

30
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,479
It was on the outskirts of
the factory district... and...

31
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,566
what was left of him
barely even looked human...

32
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,778
From the likes of a delinquent like this?!

33
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,478
That bunch is quite formidable.
Elsewhere, they've been spotted--

34
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,575
Enough! This small-timer
is making too much trouble!

35
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,522
We'll start with those crazy robbers!

36
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:24,858
We're gonna put the squeeze
on every couple there is in the city!

37
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,584
Hold on, Uncle. If you do that,

38
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,338
people are going to think you're
an unpopular old man with a complex.

39
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:35,092
Hmph, Ladd! I don't have time
to mess around with you right now.

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,737
Now scram!

41
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:41,056
Oh? What a cold thing to say to me, Uncle.

42
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,878
You've had some money, which you hold almost
as dear as your life, taken from you, right?

43
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,862
And here, I'm bringing you some good news.

44
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,526
I don't want to hear any of your "good news."

45
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:56,892
So you might say, uncle,
but what you're planning to do

46
00:03:56,892 --> 00:04:00,062
is turn over every
stone looking for the culprits,

47
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,898
squeeze them by their necks,
and squeeze, and squeeze,

48
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,608
and squeeze, and squeeze,

49
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,666
and even when they start to
foam, you squeeze, and squeeze,

50
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:12,170
and when their eyes are about
to pop out, you keep squeezing...

51
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,386
Then, finally...

52
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,139
there, farewell.

53
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:23,348
That it?

54
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:30,747
Ladd, you homicidal maniac...

55
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:33,388
You sure do say the unkindest things,

56
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:36,547
to me, the greatest assassin
the Russo Family ever had.

57
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,489
That's because you've got no
other use besides being a killer!

58
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:44,369
Have you ever considered that
I'm the only one you can count on,

59
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,121
Uncle?

60
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,068
Now, listen. There's a special express

61
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:53,727
- the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i>, was it-
that leaves Chicago Union this evening.

62
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,952
It's a nonstop that goes directly to New York.

63
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,788
I was just thinking of hijacking it,

64
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:02,179
and running it right into
the middle of Manhattan.

65
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,292
But that's just a bluff.
I'll just threaten that at first.

66
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,752
Then, if they don't pay me any money,

67
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:11,396
I'll just switch it to a passenger kidnapping.

68
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,718
Oh, but then, if I kill half of the passengers,

69
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:18,638
I think that the railroad
company will pay me money.

70
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:21,955
I get to kill people, and we get some money.

71
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,858
Good idea, isn't it, Uncle?

72
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,427
Get out!

73
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,318
Hey, somebody throw him out of here!

74
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,248
Okay, okay.

75
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,250
Who are you?!

76
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,282
They're my men. Friends,
who share the same tastes.

77
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,742
Oh, by the way, this woman is Lua.

78
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:44,038
She's my lover, my girlfriend,
and my fiancee, so your regards, Uncle.

79
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,168
U-Um, hi there.

80
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:48,042
She's kind of a timid thing.

81
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:51,853
Although, that's just what
I need to soothe my excitability.

82
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,718
Silence, you filthy brat!

83
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:57,928
Now look, go ahead and kidnap, kill,
and do whatever else you want,

84
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:00,388
but I will not allow you
to bring our name into it!

85
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:04,642
You're gonna act like nobody
anyone knows, kill whoever, and die--

86
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,243
All right, already!

87
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:10,915
Killing ends up being more fun
when I do it for my own pleasure.

88
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,415
Ladd...

89
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,167
You know, Uncle,

90
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:18,198
there's a certain type of
folk that I especially like to kill.

91
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,924
It doesn't have to do with
whether they're weak or strong.

92
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,928
The ones that I kill...
the ones that I enjoy killing...

93
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:28,431
are the ones who are
most off-guard. You get me?

94
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,172
The folks who think they are
in an absolutely safe location,

95
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:36,928
never even <i>thinking</i> that
they might die in the next instant.

96
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,776
Those types of folks. In other words,

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,995
the type of person that you are now, Uncle.

98
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:46,825
Please, don't do it!

99
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:56,068
There's no way I'd kill you,
you know. It's not even loaded.

100
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,118
Uncle, you've been
looking out for me all this time.

101
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,288
Even a homicidal maniac like me
has that much sense of gratitude.

102
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,300
Am I right?

103
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,176
Get lost.

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,180
I think I will. It's just about
time for me to get changed.

105
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:14,519
Why are you wearing such festive outfits?

106
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:18,968
We're about to kill dozens of people
inside a crowded train.

107
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,983
Wearing white

108
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,152
will make the blood
spatter stand out, and look cool.

109
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:52,502
Hold on, just a minute!
As you can see, I am unarmed.

110
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,393
You... who are you?

111
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,229
We may be strangers,
but we are not your enemy.

112
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,798
Answer me!

113
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:03,693
I told you, I am not your enemy!

114
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:12,369
Whoa!

115
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,499
Damn it...

116
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,368
Now then, this is starting to get interesting.

117
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,216
It's starting to get there...

118
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:30,553
Don't think you can make
enemies of us and live through it!

119
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,838
Most of the Mafia folks
and the like that I've killed

120
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,810
said something along
those lines before they died, too.

121
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,319
Aw, too bad.

122
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:51,324
No problem, no problem!

123
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:55,137
You're a lot weaker than Pete Herman!

124
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,005
You're like Jack Johnson, or Jack Dempsey!

125
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,250
You've got no punch, and no technique!

126
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,963
Do you know the names of boxers?

127
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,532
You know them, right?

128
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:09,467
If you're an American citizen,
of course you know them.

129
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,685
If you tell me you don't
know them... you're gonna pay!

130
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:16,516
You better believe you're gonna pay!

131
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:24,399
But then, you're gonna pay...
even if you... <i>do</i>... know... them!

132
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:32,927
Oh, you're still conscious?
I guess I <i>don't</i> have any punch.

133
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,522
Hey, what are you doing to me here?

134
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:46,963
You think a dimwit... like you can...
stand in the way... of Master Huey?

135
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,918
I'm not interested in any Huey,
or whoever you guys really are.

136
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:57,307
All I know for sure is
that all of you are enemies,

137
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:00,950
that you're all packing weapons,

138
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,979
and most of all,

139
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,691
you think this

140
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:11,308
"With all the incredible weapons
we've got on this crowded train,

141
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:17,978
there's nobody who can oppose us!
We are mighty! We are safe!"

142
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:22,318
It's so much fun! It's so much fun,
killing folks like that!

143
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:28,546
Pulling their guts out!
Squeezing on them, like they were sausages!

144
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:37,305
Ladd, what the hell is this?

145
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:41,553
We hear what sounds like a machine gun,
so we come and find this.

146
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,853
Tell us what's going on, Ladd.

147
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,903
You're Senator Beriam's wife, right?

148
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,688
The order has been switched around.

149
00:10:55,688 --> 00:11:00,328
Once we've disposed of all of
the black suits, you'll be next.

150
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,955
Nice meeting you.

151
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,948
Let's go, you guys.

152
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:12,038
Let's go? What about these guys?

153
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,466
Leave them.

154
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,972
<i>I can use these guys.</i>

155
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:37,142
Miss, I's sure that Master Dallas is all right.

156
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:40,243
He will be dropping back
in at home any time now.

157
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:45,748
Yes. I'm sure you're right.

158
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,591
I don't feel very good about this,

159
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,372
pretending not to know anything.

160
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,095
It's not as if we are lying.

161
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,208
It is true that we don't know very much.

162
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:06,462
We led the Runorata folks on that
details would be forthcoming, too.

163
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:09,428
We've heard that Gustavo
is being shaken down by Dallas

164
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:13,167
over his killing of the
head of the Genoard family,

165
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,403
but that is a lie.

166
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:19,535
Baltro Runorata must have some ulterior reason.

167
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,602
But what that might be...

168
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:24,510
The Dallas matter is classified, and all.

169
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,124
Classified? The Gandor brothers
disposed of Dallas, didn't they?

170
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,112
Whoops, that just slipped out.

171
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:34,532
What? How is it that you
can't tell me, your colleague?

172
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,043
The president told me to keep my mouth shut.

173
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:40,958
Don't tell me it's <i>that</i>!
The thing about those folks who never die?

174
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,252
Sorry, I apologize, but
I can't be the one to say anything.

175
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,990
Please, I hope you'll excuse me.

176
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,226
Forgive me, okay?

177
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:52,523
Don't tell the president
that I let that slip out, okay?

178
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,705
Oops, excuse me.

179
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:09,863
Hey, watch yourself, will you?

180
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:11,751
Watch yourself, will you?

181
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,912
Listen, Miria...

182
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,679
What, Isaac?

183
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:26,168
Make absolutely sure not to draw any attention.

184
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:30,422
I know. Just move nice and simple-like, right?

185
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:33,690
That's right. So long as you know.

186
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,027
This is amazing! Which one shall I pick?

187
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,113
How about this one?

188
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,142
Are you sure you should
be selling stuff like this?

189
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:45,943
Is this even a hat?

190
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:49,288
Hmm, this one may be a bit too unusual.

191
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:52,792
This one might not be
suited for pulling heists

192
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:58,381
Old-timer, total that up for us!

193
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,056
Listen here, old-timer...

194
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:13,678
You just completely forget
that we ever came into your store.

195
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,314
Forget it!

196
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,406
If you report this to
the police... er, if you do...

197
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:26,200
What do we do?

198
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,858
If we haven't decided on anything specific,

199
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:30,568
then slugging him and stuff works, right?

200
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:31,831
Yeah.

201
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,902
Anyhow, old-timer, if you report us...

202
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,335
If you report us...

203
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,339
I'll hit you!

204
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,263
--All right then...

205
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,474
Hey!

206
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:51,934
Your change.

207
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,892
T-T-That was scary!

208
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,558
That was scary!

209
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:09,358
That old-timer was pretty formidable.

210
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:13,122
Imagine, him being able to frighten me
this much with just one glare.

211
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:18,669
Yeah, but of course, if we got into
a fight, I'd win, because, you know...

212
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,801
I would think how bad it
would be if you got hurt, Miria.

213
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,761
Really?

214
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:25,670
Yeah, really!

215
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,668
In this last year, since we
started our tour of robberies,

216
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,808
from San Francisco to
New Jersey, we've hit 87 spots.

217
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,628
We've been to all sorts of places,

218
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:38,632
but have I ever put you in any danger yet?

219
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:40,316
About 87 times.

220
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,392
There, you see?! That's still
less than a hundred times, isn't it?

221
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,495
You're right! Incredible!

222
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:53,232
Sure! We'll do our last
big job here in New York,

223
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:56,488
and then live the easy
life down around Miami.

224
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,112
Once we do, the word "danger"
won't have anything to do with us!

225
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,337
Nothing to do with us!

226
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,465
We'll buy a big house,

227
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:09,332
and build a pool there, where
we'll swim from morning until night.

228
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,737
But it gets cold at night.

229
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:16,247
That's all right! If we turn on
about 10 stoves, the pool will warm up!

230
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,672
Incredible! Incredible!

231
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,468
Even an Arabian king
couldn't turn on that many!

232
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:24,348
And let's have a railroad
that runs through our yard!

233
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,717
We'll ride a steam train from
our house to our gate, every day!

234
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:31,228
But are we really going to be that rich?

235
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:36,057
Sure we will! As long as I'm with you,
Miria, I could even be the president!

236
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:39,988
I could be a king, a queen, even a joker!

237
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:42,879
I don't know what that means,
but it's incredible!

238
00:16:54,932 --> 00:17:00,065
So, who the hell are these white-suited guys?

239
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,377
I have absolutely no idea.

240
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:05,735
In any case, call back
anyone who has their hands free.

241
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:06,944
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,408
Should we think of this as another trial?

243
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:15,818
I don't think we can arrive at that so easily.

244
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,608
Isn't that right, Guth-<i>dono</i>?

245
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,818
Yeah. We can't get to the
heights of where Master Huey is

246
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,948
by taking normal routes, after all.

247
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:25,421
Chane, where are you going?

248
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,458
You going to let her do that?

249
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,168
Leave her be.

250
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:37,099
She will do what needs to be done. Besides,

251
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,436
she'll only live until tomorrow, anyway.

252
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,525
Be careful. Why did you hit them?

253
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,445
I'm terribly sorry.

254
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,779
They suddenly ran out into the street,
and I couldn't brake in time.

255
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:50,988
That hurts, you know! It's
cowardly to hit someone by surprise!
They suddenly ran out into the street,
and I couldn't brake in time.

256
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,071
That hurts, you know! It's
cowardly to hit someone by surprise!

257
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,448
Cowardly!

258
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,449
Cowardly!
They appear to still be alive.

259
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:53,574
They appear to still be alive.

260
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:53,950
Hey, are you listening to me?!
They appear to still be alive.

261
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,283
Hey, are you listening to me?!

262
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:54,825
Hey, are you listening to me?!
Yes, our speed being as slow as it was...

263
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:54,951
Yes, our speed being as slow as it was...

264
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,410
Are you listening?!
Yes, our speed being as slow as it was...

265
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:56,938
Yes, our speed being as slow as it was...

266
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:58,057
Drive.

267
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,038
Yes, sir.

268
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,500
Hey, just a minute! Are you trying to get away?!

269
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,501
Come back and fight fair!

270
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,211
Fight! Fight!

271
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,368
I don't understand young folks these days.

272
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:13,622
Although, I didn't understand what young folks

273
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:16,222
were thinking 200 years ago, either.

274
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:20,758
Maiza... Ever since that young pup went mad,

275
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:24,632
I haven't trusted anyone younger than me.

276
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,508
Szilard-<i>sama</i>, from your perspective,

277
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:29,402
all the people in the
world are younger than you.

278
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:36,826
So, Ladd, who are those black suits?

279
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,358
They're a special treat. It's amazing.

280
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,625
Each one of us gets to
kill two or three of them.

281
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,488
What's more, they're all a bunch of slackers,

282
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,546
who are completely
convinced that they are superior.

283
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,843
Now, then...

284
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,987
It's risky for all of us to
cluster together here, so split up.

285
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,015
I'll tell Lua and the others.

286
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,065
We'll get back together at an appropriate time.

287
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:05,730
When you all feel like you've
let them have it, come back here.

288
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,057
Well, well, if it isn't Quates-<i>sama.</i>

289
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,559
It has been too long.

290
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,342
It's only been 20 years. That's not that long.

291
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,723
Oh, Quates-<i>sama</i>!

292
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,348
You're looking well.

293
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,695
You haven't changed at all.

294
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,808
Where are Barnes and Sturgeon?

295
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,242
Barnes-<i>sama</i> is busy distilling.

296
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:03,898
Sturgeon-<i>sama</i> passed away last year.

297
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:07,818
I see. With that defective,
unperfected product,

298
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:11,754
you were unable to be given eternal souls.

299
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,373
Sturgeon couldn't help
but grow old and infirm.

300
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:20,054
If he could have held out for one more year,
he could have been here today.

301
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:24,418
Since your fear of sudden death is gone,

302
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:29,088
your fear of aging must
be somewhat extraordinary.

303
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:32,473
But that ends today.

304
00:20:32,473 --> 00:20:37,978
At last, we have succeeded in
producing a completed product,

305
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,990
the perfect "grand panacea."

306
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,568
Does Barnes have the finished product?

307
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:45,818
Yes.

308
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:49,291
Ennis, go pick up Barnes in the car.

309
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:50,751
Yes, sir.

310
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,880
Ennis...

311
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:55,965
Yes?

312
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,958
If Barnes has gotten into the finished product,

313
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,883
then kill him. It makes no difference to me.

314
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:07,747
Also, kill him if he has failed to
preserve the remedy, and ruined it.

315
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,395
As you wish.

316
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,033
You think you can just kick someone
else's foot and keep going, Gramps?

317
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,203
You're the one who
stuck your foot out to trip me-

318
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:33,794
And you're the one who told us
to "get lost, you scum!" aren't you?

319
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,828
Thanks to you, my foot
just happened to stick out!

320
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,926
You're the one who went and tripped over it!

321
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:49,462
A-All right! It was my fault!
I-I'll give you money, if you want!

322
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,729
I didn't ask for your advice!

323
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,524
Huh? Is that liquor?

324
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,866
What's the deal, Gramps?
Is that box that important to you?

325
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,709
Barnes-<i>san...</i>

326
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,127
Excuse me.

327
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,952
Are you all right?

328
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,960
Y-Yeah.

329
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,136
I'm terribly sorry about that.

330
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:28,349
I'm looking for someone, so...

331
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,815
Hey, you!

332
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,400
Wait up!

333
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:07,460
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

334
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:21,724
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

335
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,278
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

336
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:40,322
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

337
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:47,372
<i>I believe so</i>

338
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:54,422
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

339
00:23:54,422 --> 00:24:01,928
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

340
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:08,602
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

341
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:18,656
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

342
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,788
