Yeah, but who knows if their bark

Having a Pokémon take
on an armed opponent

unless it has special training.

not thinking of having Pikachu train

It’ll make Pikachu even stronger.

00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,100
Team rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

171
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,686
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

172
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,688

Team Rocket.

177
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,203
They wouldn’t try to steal these Pokémon.

178
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,331
They must be crazy, breaking
into a school for police canine.

179
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,750
Isn’t that kind of like saying:
"Please arrest me"?

180
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,753
These police Pokémon
really give me the creeps.

181
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,714
Can’t we steal some Pokémon
that are more cat-friendly?

182
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,216
You coward!

183
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,427
We can do anything once we get
that pack of obedient Growlithe.

184
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,139
They’ll do whatever we command.

185
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,016
[James] They’ll rob banks
whenever we see them.

186
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,479
[Jessie]
They’ll steal artworks from every museum.

187
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,607
We’ll be the richest criminals
of all time!

188
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,443
The queen, the king, the cat of crime!

189
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,821
Luckily your dream won’t come true.

190
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,408
These police Growlithe would never
do anything to break the law.

191
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,577
-Don’t bet on it.
-[chuckles].

-Team Rocket’s esopho-gas.

195
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,806
Now those Growlithe
won’t be able to use their noses.

196
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,058
Right!

197
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,896
-Time for our next move.
-Ready when you are.

198
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,356
Take a sniff of this.

199
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,858
Just a whiff of this.

200
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,194
[both]
And hear the metamorphosis.

201
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,157
[both chuckle]

203
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,125
What kind of gas is this? Yeow!

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,629
What happened to my voice?
I sound like one of the chipmunks.

205
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,631
Something’s wrong with my voice.

206
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,593
That gas they just sprayed makes
your voice get high and squeaky.

207
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,055
Pika pi! Pika! Pikachu.

208
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,515
[chuckles] Our plan is working.

209
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,518
Yes, we’re certainly hitting
a career high note.

210
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,187
I don’t know what you’re planning,

211
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,773
but I’m placing you under arrest
for trespassing.

212
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,442
All right, Growlithe.
Round them up!

213
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,113
-Huh?
-[all groan]

214
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,033
[Jenny] What’s the matter, Growlithe?
Arrest them!

215
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,954
The Growlithe can’t understand Jenny’s
order now that her voice is changed.

216
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,456
If these Growlithe can’t use
their sense of smell

217
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,085
and they can’t understand Jenny’s orders,
they’re useless as police Pokémon.

218
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,712
Uh.

219
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,173
Heh. Their plan’s working!

220
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,675
[Jessie chuckles]

221
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,136
-Shall we move on to phase two?
-Sounds good to me.

222
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,390
All right then.
A little changing music.

223
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,518
Hmm. Pass me that, will you?
No, that’s mine.

224
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,438
-[Jessie] Almost ready.
-Oh, hand me those pumps.

225
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,816
[both] Ta-da!

226
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,901
And now for one more change.

227
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,363
This synthesizer will make
me sound just like Officer Jenny.

228
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,907
Sit, Growlithe!

229
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,450
Huh?

230
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,788
Beg, Growlithe! Lie down!

231
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,623
What’s wrong with all of you?

232
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,584
That’s not me, that’s Team Rocket.
Don’t listen to them.

233
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,254
All right, Growlithe, listen to me.

234
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,716
I want you to place
that woman under house arrest.

235
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,842
No, please.

236
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,261
[grunts]

237
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,556
No, stop it, Growlithe!

238
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,937
-Well, that about wraps things up.
-Mm-hmm.

239
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,525
-Line up, Growlithe.

-Attention, Growlithe.
-Now, Meowth, open the hatch.

244
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,123
- Everybody, in the van. Huh?
-[Ash] Hold it!

245
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,125
You can’t take those Growlithe.

246
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,086
And just how are you going to stop us,
squeaky?

247
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,881
Why don’t we teach them all
a lesson before we go?

248
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:05,053
Why not? Growlithe, about face.
Surround them.

[all growling]

We’ll use our Pokémon to battle them.

00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,236

-I left my Poké Balls behind.

254
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,948
-I didn’t bring mine either.
-I left mine in my backpack.

255
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,787
-We’re in trouble.
-You said it.

256
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
Don’t let the bad criminals get away
from Growlithe.

Uh, Pikachu?

261
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,389
This is perfect.
We’ll catch a Pikachu too.

262
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,933
-Aren’t we lucky?
-I should say.

263
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,769
This should be interesting. Let’s see.

-Pikachu!
-Huh.

266
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,320
I want you to get in the car with
these Growlithe. Come on, hurry up.

267
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,949
Don’t go. That may sound like me
but it’s Team Rocket.

Pika, Pi?

269
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,621
He’s lying. My voice doesn’t sound
that messed up. Get in the van.

270
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,708
-Hurry!
-Pikachu, don’t! Huh?

271

-Pikachu.
-Pikachu knew?

274

Ash and Pikachu recognize
what’s in each other’s hearts,

275
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,769
so Pikachu can’t be fooled
by somebody using a fake voice.
