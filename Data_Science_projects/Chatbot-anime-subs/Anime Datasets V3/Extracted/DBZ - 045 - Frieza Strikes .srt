00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:21,546
This is bad...
this is definitely bad...

2
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,883
There aren't supposed
to be any other Saiyans.

3
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:27,818
W- who could it be?

4
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:47,163
Now there are three more, yes?

5
00:00:54,246 --> 00:01:01,345
Hold them with care, Dodoria-<i>san</i>. It appears
that Vegeta is after them, as well.

6
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:11,693
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, Kewie, who is
pursuing Vegeta, has just landed.

7
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:20,538
And as for those two large
power readings that appeared earlier,

8
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,473
they suddenly disappeared,
and remain so.

9
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,881
We are searching the area
where the readings were located,

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,551
so we should soon discover
what their source was.

11
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:39,557
Well, the issue here is the disposal
of Vegeta, who has defied me.

12
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,560
In that case, you need not worry.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,564
Kewie should now be heading
after Vegeta to deal with him.

14
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:52,237
Those two have always hated each other,
and their abilities are roughly the same.

15
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:57,004
In any event, Vegeta is not
likely to come away unscathed.

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,512
Vegeta, you're not
getting away from me.

17
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:14,192
I've found you, Vegeta.
I'm under orders from Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

18
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:19,197
Are you reading me, Vegeta!?
Now I can kill you out in the open!

19
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:24,202
Don't make me laugh, Kewie.
You think you can kill me?

20
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:27,137
I'm waiting here for you,
so get here fast.

21
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,544
What are you, blind?
Take a good look at your Scouter.

22
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:36,810
My battle power is clearly
higher than yours!

23
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,560
We can't stay here,
in any case, can we?

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,326
I'll leave the Dragon Balls up to you.

25
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:59,571
Okay, well, I'm going
back to Earth, so good luck.

26
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:02,506
Bulma-<i>san</i>, just a minute.

27
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:11,182
What should we do, Gohan?

28
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:15,118
S- should we go back
to Earth now, too?

29
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,295
After all, it looks like
we've got one more foe now,

30
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,287
and even if we do have
the Dragon Radar...

31
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,138
Oh, I mean,
I'm fine and all,

32
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:36,875
but it wouldn't be right if anything
were to happen to Gohan.

33
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:43,144
B- but Kuririn-<i>san</i>, if we do that,
then he'll get the Dragon Balls.

34
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:47,819
Well, if we yield the Dragon
Balls to him this time,

35
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,888
we could always use them next time.

36
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,485
That would be okay, as long as he doesn't
kill Shen Long, like Piccolo did before.

37
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,830
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, someone is coming!

38
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,509
I- is it a Saiyan?

39
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,776
N- no, it's not Vegeta.
This <i>Ki</i> is weaker.

40
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:29,861
This should be the area
where the readings disappeared.

41
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,196
Must be Namekians.

42
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,198
Who is it?

43
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:36,133
Probably Namekians.

44
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,631
T- they're not Namekians!

45
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,879
Hmm? W- what is that?

46
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,814
Those aren't Namekians!
Who are they!?

47
00:04:53,551 --> 00:05:00,821
That doesn't matter. We were ordered
to just kill anyone who was on this planet.

48
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,495
Look at what they're wearing!

49
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:13,930
Those are just like what the Saiyans
were wearing. Yet... they're not Saiyans.

50
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:19,511
I haven't a clue what it means,
but I've got a bad feeling about this.

51
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:25,108
R- right... Any way you look at them,
those are not friendly faces...

52
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:35,527
Gohan, build up your <i>Ki</i> while
keeping your presence masked.

53
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:36,960
Right.

54
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,303
Do you see that? These guys are common
trash, with barely any battle power!

55
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,872
They're just tourists.

56
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:49,974
We won't get to have
any fun if they run away.

57
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,877
Take care of their spaceship first.

58
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:54,640
All right.

59
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:05,156
Oh, crap!
Our spaceship!

60
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,494
These guys are so unlucky to have
come here at a time like this.

61
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:15,262
Gohan, release your <i>Ki</i>.
These guys aren't all that tough!

62
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,171
Hey, did you hear that?

63
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,107
Not all that tough?
Does he mean us?

64
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,111
W- what kind of battle
power ratings are these!?

65
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
Let's do it!

66
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,957
Right!

67
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,972
Hey, nice, nice!

68
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,810
That was not nice!

69
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:16,149
What are we going to do about that?

70
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:24,836
Is something the matter, Zarbon-<i>san</i>?

71
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:30,001
Yes, Freeza-<i>sama</i>. It is about
the search that was ordered earlier.

72
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,346
It would seem that they
are no ordinary people.

73
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:37,849
Their battle powers rose momentarily,

74
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:42,854
then once they had defeated our pair
of scouts, their readings disappeared again.

75
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:48,526
Ho, that is curious. It does not
appear to be Vegeta, either.

76
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:51,362
Correct, the readings
are different from Vegeta.

77
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:54,532
Their battle powers
were both around 1500.

78
00:07:54,532 --> 00:08:00,204
1500, you say? We could leave them alone,
and nothing would come of it,

79
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,475
but their attitude does not
seem to be very good, does it?

80
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:08,036
The next time they are found,
eliminate them.

81
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:46,681
<i>All right, just a little more...</i>

82
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,365
Goku-<i>sa</i>...

83
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,210
Chichi...

84
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,214
What are you doin'?

85
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:19,217
Oh, you know, I was bored, so...

86
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:24,889
Really... How about you realize somewhat
that you were seriously injured?

87
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,326
If you don't lie there quietly,
you're goin' to open your wounds up again.

88
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:33,564
Ow! Yow-ow-ow-ow!
Don't be so rough!

89
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:37,000
Yow-ow-ow-ow!
That hurts! That hurts!

90
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:41,906
Never mind that, I wonder
if Gohan-<i>chan</i> is okay.

91
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:45,910
I hope he's washin' his hair,
and usin' that rinse.

92
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,249
His hair is so shiny and all,
so he has to look after his cuticles.

93
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:52,517
Is he usin' his hair dryer?

94
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:58,183
His hair dries out so fast,
and he has to take care of it right...

95
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,516
<i>Gohan...</i>

96
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:16,874
It's hopeless! It's all over!
We'll never get back to Earth now!

97
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:20,878
Uh, Bulma-<i>san</i>, for the time being,
let's get away from here.

98
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,881
It's dangerous here. Someone
even stronger might come along.

99
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:28,319
That's right. Those many <i>Ki</i>
that we sensed weren't Namekians,

100
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:33,154
but appear to be friends of Vegeta,
so we need to go hide somewhere.

101
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:38,896
Things will work out somehow.

102
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:43,568
I'm sure the Namekians
will repair the spaceship for us.

103
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,004
How nice that you can be so optimistic!

104
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:54,343
Bulma-<i>san</i>...

105
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,252
Hmph, you're finally here, are you?

106
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:03,186
You imbecile.

107
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,806
It looks like the time has come

108
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,976
when we can finally settle things
between us as fellow rivals, huh?

109
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,479
But it looks like
you've let yourself go.

110
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,550
You've got no chance of beating me
with that battle power.

111
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,144
Fellow rivals, you say?

112
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:39,557
Well, let me show you
a little something.

113
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:45,229
When I was on Earth, I learned
something interesting from them.

114
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:48,566
What, how to run away quickly?

115
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,501
How to control my battle power!

116
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,345
H- how to control your battle power?

117
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:08,178
Take a good look at my battle
power rating on your Scouter!

118
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:14,191
I- impossible! You and I have
always been evenly matched!

119
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:18,863
You idiot! I have been fighting
in actual combat constantly.

120
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,199
The battle on Earth was such
that it nearly killed me.

121
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,303
Did you think I would remain
equal with you forever,

122
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,295
as you just sat around
in comfort at Freeza's place!?

123
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,140
19,000... 20,000... 21,000... 22,000!

124
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,887
What happened, Zarbon?

125
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,890
I- I think it was a malfunction,

126
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,561
but the rating on my Scouter, which was set
on Vegeta, had just risen above 22,000...

127
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,330
22,000, you say?

128
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,901
That really was a malfunction.
Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

129
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,836
I'll find out his true
rating for you on mine.

130
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,508
What's his rating?

131
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:08,679
T- this is absurd... Could my newer
model be malfunctioning, too?

132
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,182
He's gone up to 24,000...

133
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:16,854
If he's at 24,000... Are you saying that
his battle power is even higher than ours?

134
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:21,525
I- it couldn't be. His battle power
would just barely reach 18,000.

135
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:24,528
It is nothing to be surprised about.

136
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:30,201
Vegeta has been fighting
on the front lines, you see.

137
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,538
He probably came upon
some sort of new skill on Earth.

138
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:35,539
But...

139
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:41,145
It is only 24,000. If the
two of you fight together,

140
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:44,979
it is a rating that you can
sufficiently beat, is it not?

141
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:54,658
Vegeta probably wants to obtain
eternal life with the Dragon Balls,

142
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:57,149
the same wish that I have.

143
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:02,833
Unless he does so, there is no way
that he can prevail against me, you see.

144
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:07,171
Vegeta never has been
respectful toward me.

145
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:09,507
He went to Earth without my orders,

146
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:13,341
and he even appears to be
after my position for his own.

147
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:18,849
Though I must say,
this is brash of him.

148
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:23,616
To think that he would come out
in open treason against me...

149
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:33,864
W- wait, Vegeta! I just had a great idea!
Let me work with you. I can lend you a hand.

150
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:40,538
I- I didn't like Freeza-<i>sa</i>-
I mean, Freeza before this, either.

151
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:44,875
T- that doesn't sound bad, does it?
If you team up with me at that battle power,

152
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,879
I think we could somehow
manage Zarbon and Dodoria.

153
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,647
Spout more of your worthless lies, will you?
You are one thoroughly disgusting bastard!

154
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,821
It's no lie, I tell you!

155
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,160
Believe me, Vegeta!

156
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:10,167
Oh! Freeza-<i>sama</i>!

157
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,169
What!?

158
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,431
Miserable fool!

159
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,972
No matter how much
his battle power had risen,

160
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:51,208
nobody could stand up
to being taken unawares by that.

161
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,544
You wish.

162
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:59,550
What an utterly pathetic strategy,
coming from someone like you. I'm astounded.

163
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,985
W- when did you manage to-?

164
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:07,158
Having an elevated battle power means
that my speed has been elevated as well.

165
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:12,494
In other words, you have now
gotten me thoroughly angry.

166
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,285
Die!

167
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:47,126
That was one foul firework.

168
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,304
V- Vegeta's 24,000 rating
is the real thing, all right.

169
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,540
He did in Kewie
with no trouble at all.

170
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,479
It is of little import. Now,
we search for the fifth Dragon Ball.

171
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>Thanks to their Scouters,</i>
<i>they'll know exactly what my actions are.</i>

172
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,824
<i>Even if I were careless enough</i>
<i>to get too close to them,</i>

173
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,827
<i>l might be able to take</i>
<i>Zarbon or Dodoria,</i>

174
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,497
<i>but there's still no way</i>
<i>l can beat Freeza.</i>

175
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,169
<i>Judging by the transmissions I heard</i>
<i>over the Scouter between Freeza and his men,</i>

176
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:30,841
<i>these Dragon Ball things don't work</i>
<i>unless you have all seven of them together.</i>

177
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,844
All right, I'll search out
just one of them.

178
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,680
Once they have gathered
the remaining six,

179
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,516
I'll look for an opening
and take theirs from them.

180
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,187
<i>lf things go right, and I get</i>
<i>them all, l'll gain eternal life.</i>

181
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,850
<i>Once I do, defeating Freeza</i>
<i>will no longer be just a dream!</i>

182
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,198
There is a reading of around
ten Namekians in that direction.

183
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,200
Very well.

184
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,037
It would be nice if they had
the fifth Dragon Ball.

185
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,474
Please make sure not
to let your guard down.

186
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:07,811
It would seem there are some mysterious
others out there, in addition to Vegeta.

187
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,046
Yes, sir.

188
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,378
Now, let us be going.

189
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:17,988
With him gone,
<i>l'll</i> be number one.

190
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:22,152
The whole universe will be ruled
by Vegeta-<i>sama</i> the Saiyan!

191
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,837
Bulma-<i>san</i>, we have to
hurry a little bit more,

192
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,670
or they're going to
find us out here!

193
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,514
You guys can fly, right?
Take me with you, and fly.

194
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:49,853
I wish we could do that, but we're
walking to mask our presence.

195
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:55,689
Flying through the air requires a lot of <i>Ki</i>,
and the enemy will know where we are.

196
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:03,523
Bulma-<i>san</i>, there's a good place.
It will be hard to find us in that hole.

197
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:09,536
H- how long am I going to have
to live in a place like that?

198
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:16,547
Kuririn-<i>san</i>...

199
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:19,216
Do you sense any <i>Ki</i> over there?

200
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:23,320
You're right. It feels different
from the <i>Ki</i> we felt earlier, huh?

201
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,652
It could be the Namekians this time.

202
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:30,561
Hide! There's another <i>Ki</i> coming
this way from that direction!

203
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:36,900
<i>What is this Ki that is coming toward</i>
<i>them at top speed? ls it Vegeta?</i>

204
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,997
<i>Or is it Freeza and company?</i>

205
