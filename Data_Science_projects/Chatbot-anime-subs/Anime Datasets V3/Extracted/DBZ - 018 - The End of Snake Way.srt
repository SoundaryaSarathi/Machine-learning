00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,485
Do you want to die!?

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,735
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

3
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,327
Wait!

4
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,942
Don't forget that your
opponent wants to kill you!

5
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,638
I know, Piccolo-<i>san</i>...

6
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,951
Nyah-nyah!

7
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,442
Is that all the jumping
power you've got?

8
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,260
You're even softer than your father.

9
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,772
Well now, shall I finally
put you out of your misery?

10
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:02,205
Die, Kakarrot!!

11
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,633
S- stop picking on...

12
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:34,669
... my father!!

13
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:41,808
That little brat!

14
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:47,489
Wake up... Kakarrot...

15
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:54,224
Wake up... Kakarrot...

16
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,954
What are you doing over there?

17
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:18,650
Wake up...

18
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,890
Wake up... Kakarrot...

19
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:34,503
You little brat!
What the hell has gotten into you!?

20
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,618
Damn!

21
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,030
Why, you-!

22
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,137
You dirty brat!

23
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,225
What's the matter?

24
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,023
Nowhere left to go!

25
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,014
H- his tail!

26
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,263
That's it, all right...

27
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,266
It was half a year ago
that I pulled it out.

28
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,632
And now it has grown back.

29
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,040
Which means... it can't be!

30
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,343
How can this be?

31
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,453
You little brat!

32
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,235
Die!!

33
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,626
Wha-?

34
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,287
What!?

35
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,627
A- at this rate, I'm done for!

36
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,238
Begone!

37
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,958
What!?

38
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,358
What's up with that moon!?

39
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:11,582
Cheers!

40
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:14,779
My, my, we've finally
gotten them together.

41
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:20,258
Now we'll be able to
bring Goku back to life.

42
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,260
We can take a breather now, too.

43
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,265
Now all we have to do is wait
for those infernal Saiyans.

44
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:29,567
You say that, but originally,

45
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,269
when Goku was a baby,
he was a Saiyan too,

46
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:36,274
who was sent here from Planet Vegeta
in one of those round vehicles, right?

47
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,610
N- no he wasn't! That might
be the way he was born...

48
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,740
...but Son-<i>kun</i> is an exemplary Earthling.
Right, Turtle Hermit-<i>san</i>?

49
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:49,283
Er, of course he was.

50
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,294
What's the matter?

51
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,962
The moon is out.

52
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,964
Oh, you're right.

53
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:01,932
It's been a while, huh?

54
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,566
Something about that moon...

55
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:31,484
Don't get too carried away,
you dirty brat!

56
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:46,966
T- that's Saiyan blood
you've got, all right.

57
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:51,675
<i>The power l've got right now won't</i>
<i>do any good against the Saiyans.</i>

58
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,698
Let go of me!

59
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,464
Dammit!

60
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,320
Damn...

61
00:10:54,946 --> 00:11:00,816
Dammit! At this rate, the earth is
going to be destroyed by that brat!

62
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,912
W- what's that?

63
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,885
Wake up... Kakarrot...

64
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,560
Wake up... Kakarrot...

65
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,603
So that's it.

66
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,605
The thing that's behind that moon...

67
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:58,473
...is the pod that Son Goku
came here in as a kid.

68
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:19,823
It's all over now!

69
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,238
Sorry about that.

70
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:17,883
I'm going to make sure that I draw out
those dormant abilities of yours.

71
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,860
Geez, you sure are a lot of trouble.

72
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:44,315
A tail!

73
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:48,115
Hooray! I'm there!

74
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:06,865
Huh?

75
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,264
There ain't anything here.

76
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:21,210
You've got to be kidding me.

77
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:25,012
What's that?

78
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:34,155
He's there! That's where Kaio-<i>sama</i> is!

79
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:55,018
This is it, all right.
There's his house.

80
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,219
What!? What!?

81
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:16,338
What's wrong with the ground?

82
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,709
Dammit!

83
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:30,717
Incredible... It's like I'm being
sucked in by some outrageous power!

84
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:38,653
I- it's no use! It feels like my body
is as heavy as lead! Dammit!

85
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:54,245
I've finally... reached... here...

86
00:15:54,245 --> 00:16:00,584
and I'm going... to meet
Kaio-<i>sama</i>... no matter what!

87
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,452
A little farther...
a little farther...

88
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,858
But before that,
let's find me something to eat.

89
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,929
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>?
Are you Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

90
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:01,435
<i>Despite how he looks,</i>
<i>l'm sure he must be incredible.</i>

91
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:09,443
G- good day. I'm Son Goku.
I ask that you train me.

92
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:19,029
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, before we do,
can I ask you for an apple?

93
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:28,136
Wow, Kaio-<i>sama</i>, impressive!
You climbed up there easily!

94
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:53,029
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, sorry, but pick me
another one. I'll catch it this time.

95
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,701
All right, whenever you're ready!

96
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,341
I caught it! I caught it!

97
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:22,585
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, teach me martial arts,
okay- I mean, please?

98
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,627
Is that training?

99
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,372
You're saying I should
move like that, right?

100
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:53,624
This is definitely hard...

101
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:56,889
K- Kaio-<i>sama</i>, what's the matter
with the ground here?

102
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:09,067
What are you doing?

103
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:22,653
<i>ls this curious man the real Kaio-sama?</i>

104
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:26,714
<i>When does Goku's training begin?</i>

105
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:37,714
