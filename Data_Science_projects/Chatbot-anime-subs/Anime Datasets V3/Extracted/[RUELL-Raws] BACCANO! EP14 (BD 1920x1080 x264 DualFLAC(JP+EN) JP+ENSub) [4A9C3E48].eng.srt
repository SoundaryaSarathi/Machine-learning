1
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,943
What'cha doing?

2
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:50,853
--Hey!
--Hey!

3
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:55,228
Shh! Keep quiet! You might knock them over!

4
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,536
You could knock them over!

5
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:04,402
Oh, these are dominos, are they?

6
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,282
What do you mean to do
by lining so many of them up like this?

7
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,328
What are we going to do, you ask?!

8
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,008
You ask?!

9
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,788
As you can see, it's so we can knock them over!

10
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,347
To knock them over!

11
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:22,838
Where's the sense in
lining them up to knock them over?

12
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:25,342
That is a difficult question, isn't it?

13
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:26,690
Isn't it?

14
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:32,388
If I had to say, it's because
there are dominos here!

15
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,906
Domina! Dominist!

16
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,858
It's a pastime that's
becoming popular among children.

17
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:43,068
It's something that kids who
don't know the rules for dominos do.

18
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,667
Oh, I get it.

19
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,242
Pecho-<i>san</i> and Randy-<i>san</i>?

20
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:53,368
Yeah, we tried knocking
a few over, and it was fun.

21
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:56,011
I did this a lot when I was a kid, too.

22
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,418
Lia and Ennis, you too?

23
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,008
Firo-<i>san</i>, why don't you come join us?

24
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,770
This is fun.

25
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,552
Yaguruma-<i>san</i>?

26
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:13,904
I amused myself a lot
as a kid knocking down <i>Shogi</i> pieces.

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,228
Even Ronnie-<i>san...</i>

28
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:24,318
I have to ask, who designed
something on this huge a scale?

29
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,334
I like this sort of thing.

30
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,880
Maiza-<i>san...</i>

31
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:34,748
All done!

32
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,051
We're finished!

33
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,351
Silence!

34
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,432
Keep quiet!

35
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,008
All right, we will now knock them over.

36
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:52,275
We're going to knock them over.

37
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,562
The fun...

38
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:03,954
...starts now, huh?

39
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,458
Is this really all that amusing?

40
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:24,015
Ah, how sad...
Let me tell you a very, very sad story.

41
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,588
And here, today is the day
when we had the perfect chance

42
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:30,313
to make ourselves
dramatically known in New York...

43
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:33,552
The day when the name Graham Specter would,

44
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:38,029
without a doubt,
ring throughout the whole city...

45
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,142
Such a...

46
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:44,455
such a sad story this is!

47
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,537
If you're going to cry,

48
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,457
now's the time.

49
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:54,171
They say people grow amid hardship,

50
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,800
and sing the praises of life
amid the pleasures of indolence.

51
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,597
But I have no plans to grow.

52
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,143
And yet, why is it that
I must tell this sad story?

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,718
What good is it going to do
to make me grow any further?

54
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,690
Where are you planning to take me?

55
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,388
I want to become depraved,

56
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:20,197
singing the praises of life
amid indolence, and yet...

57
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,914
Boss Ladd has been seriously
injured and caught by the police.

58
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,667
What's going on here?

59
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,046
Boss Ladd...

60
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,509
...not only have you
been caught by the police...

61
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:45,042
...someone threw you off the train!

62
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:49,002
Are you telling me there's
someone in the world that can do that?!

63
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:53,605
Someone who could
hurt you like that, Boss Ladd?!

64
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:57,638
The parts have been swiped?

65
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:00,638
The high-grade parts are being
swapped out with inferior goods,

66
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:02,682
and sold on the black market.

67
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:06,398
Zacharius, one of my regular customers,
noticed it, and came to tell me.

68
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,898
So, you want me to make them pay for it?

69
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:14,876
No, not yet.
He's allowed us to save face, for now.

70
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,465
Zacharius is being a patronizing bastard.

71
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,010
He's doing you a favor, isn't he, Uncle?

72
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,962
The Van Dyke auto plant.
Ladd, go have a word with them.

73
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:34,271
Oh? You mean,
you're going to let me handle it?

74
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:40,443
I'm just saying, go have a word with them.

75
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,978
To me, that means the same thing as

76
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,898
"Go there and kill everyone
to your heart's content."

77
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:51,621
Are you sure about it,

78
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,541
Uncle?

79
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:59,588
All I'm telling you to do
is go have a word with them.

80
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,221
I love you, Uncle!

81
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,891
Idiot.

82
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,768
You say something?

83
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,521
Would you get going!

84
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,638
Now then...

85
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:24,768
in a few minutes, you're
going to end up like that, too.

86
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:27,165
N-Now hold on...

87
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:30,272
I'll at least listen to
what you have to say for yourself,

88
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:33,188
before I put you to rest--
no, I'm not going to put you down that easy.

89
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,108
So, start talking.

90
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,448
I-I've got nothing to say...

91
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,336
Right, right, right...

92
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,658
You're saying you did it for no reason?

93
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:46,998
You're saying you made fools
of the Russo Family for no reason?

94
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:51,248
Nothing backdoor, then?
No one behind the scenes, then?

95
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:55,462
Are you saying that I,
Ladd Russo-<i>sama</i>, was a fool to expect

96
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:59,763
any sort of truth, that
would get me all fired up,

97
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:02,968
to come spilling forth out of your mouth?

98
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,722
D-Don't do this...

99
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:06,863
Uh-uh.

100
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:10,688
There really isn't anything shady going on...

101
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:16,988
Well then, can't you at least be...
considerate enough...

102
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:18,875
to lie to me?!

103
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,162
I'm not going to kill you easy.

104
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:31,582
You're lucky enough to
be killed by me, after all.

105
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:36,059
You should be more grateful,
and enjoy getting killed by me!

106
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,888
Who are you?!

107
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:46,683
How can this be? You want to know my name?

108
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:50,073
Which means that you're concerned about me!

109
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,577
That notwithstanding,
you've wounded my heart.

110
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:58,790
For you to wound the heart of someone
whom you're concerned about,

111
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:03,420
you don't seem to understand
what the meaning of love is, do you?

112
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:09,123
I mean, look!
<i>I</i> was supposed to dismantle this car.

113
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:15,098
And yet, you've gone and destroyed
the car in a most unsightly fashion.

114
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,146
No! No! No! I cannot accept this!

115
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:25,718
I cannot accept it, but it is the truth.

116
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,558
That is something I cannot tolerate!

117
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:34,018
You're going to pay for putting me
into this intolerable mood!

118
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:35,618
You're not making any sense!

119
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,246
Let me show you!

120
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,267
I don't much like you!

121
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,948
Since I don't like you, I'll clobber you!

122
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,908
--Stop it, Graham!
--I'd even clobber you if I <i>did</i> like you!

123
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,448
I'll clobber you because I want to!
I'm just going to clobber you!

124
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:51,038
What's wrong with that?
Tell me! You can't, can you?!

125
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,668
The reason why,
is that you don't have a chance to speak,

126
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:56,306
because of my violent attack! Now be grateful!

127
00:09:56,806 --> 00:10:01,922
Thanks to my attack,
you don't have to offer any foolish excuses!

128
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:04,689
Shut up, you rotten lowlife!

129
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,777
What you're doing is effectively
protecting this thieving old man!

130
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,197
Those who protect thieves
become thieves themselves!

131
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:16,159
In other words, you are a thief!

132
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,037
Die!

133
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,528
If someone who protects
a thief is a thief as well,

134
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,452
then what does that make a person
who is hit by a bullet shot at that thief?!

135
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:33,218
Something less than a thieving thief's thief?

136
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:39,265
Now you've <i>really</i> made me angry.

137
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,145
Die!!

138
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,915
That's impossible...

139
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:09,295
Did you think you could do
anything to me with just <i>this</i>?

140
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,341
Even if this <i>could</i> do something,

141
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,907
it couldn't do it against <i>me,</i>

142
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:19,347
you filthy little punk!

143
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:33,888
Just do as you please.

144
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:37,115
Nope. I won't do as I please.

145
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:42,568
I love killing people who are at ease,

146
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,238
not even realizing the possibility
that they're going to be killed,

147
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,738
but I don't go for killing anyone
who takes initiative

148
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:50,670
by <i>wanting</i> to be killed.

149
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,332
Besides, I love it when guys
are so brazen and impudent

150
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:01,890
that only <i>I</i> can kill them.

151
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,439
Oh, right.

152
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,692
To celebrate our advance into New York,

153
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:29,818
Boss Ladd was going to
wreck people spectacularly!

154
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:34,714
And, in return, I was going to
wreck something on a grand scale!

155
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,912
Just thinking about it made
me look forward to it so much,

156
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:42,605
I couldn't sleep! How ironic that
it would end up being a pipe dream!

157
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,800
Such a sad story...

158
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,758
Ah, what is God thinking,
making me tell such a sad story?

159
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,650
What is the world trying to do to me?!

160
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,058
Sad! Sad... It feels like being
snubbed by the rest of the world,

161
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,478
it's so sad, so sad, so sad,

162
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,953
so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad...

163
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,346
Oh! Ennis, Firo, and Maiza!

164
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,542
Long time no see, my fine fellows!

165
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,559
I'm so glad to see you're all doing so well!

166
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,968
You, too, Isaac-<i>san</i> and Miria-<i>san.</i>

167
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,146
We're doing fine!

168
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,507
You sure are looking well, Maiza.

169
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:46,953
Sorry, but I'll have to pay
my respects to you all a little later.

170
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:03,052
Yo!

171
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,128
What trick did you pull to get in here?

172
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,185
Hmm? Oh, that's simple.

173
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:16,399
Smiles, smiles.
I just made that crabby bunch smile.

174
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,888
To think that you would
resort to those methods.

175
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:24,228
Well, you live for 200 years,
and you get a little wiser.

176
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:28,036
I've learned that it takes
more than this to spoil mankind.

177
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,898
The more you change,
the more you're still the same.

178
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,568
You, too, right?

179
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,778
So, what do you want?

180
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:40,923
Oh, a smile. I came to see your smile.

181
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,828
What for?

182
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:46,288
I want to see it. That's all.

183
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,668
Ask me to smile,
and I'll smile all you want.

184
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:54,218
But what good will it do?
What does my smile change?

185
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:57,968
Will it bring the world happiness?
Will it cheer it up?

186
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:01,736
It sure will. My world, at the very least.

187
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:09,285
Come on, smile, Huey!

188
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:14,692
That's it!
That's the face I wanted to see, Huey!

189
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:19,322
You astound me.
Imagine, you coming here, just for that.

190
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:22,632
I'll do anything for a smile!

191
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:31,588
There's someone
I'd like you to meet. My daughter.

192
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,017
Daughter?

193
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:36,048
Will you be able to make her smile?

194
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:40,233
Will <i>you</i> still be able to smile,
once you've met her?

195
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,031
I'm curious. I'm very curious.

196
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,148
Chane...

197
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,858
Yes, Dad?

198
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,438
Do you love me?

199
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,372
Yes.

200
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,488
Could you do anything for me?

201
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:58,793
Yes.

202
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:04,215
You really are a fine little girl.
You would never disappoint me.

203
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:11,180
You are my daughter, my protector,
and guardian of my knowledge.

204
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,338
That is the reason you were born, after all.

205
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,852
Right, Dad.

206
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,815
I will tell you...

207
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:24,402
I will tell you a portion of
the knowledge that only I have.

208
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:29,058
But I am only telling you.
You will only be allowed to listen to it,

209
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,367
and memorize it.

210
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,858
You must not tell anyone this knowledge,

211
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,255
and you must not use it
for your own purposes, either.

212
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:42,572
Can you promise me that?

213
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:43,880
Yes.

214
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,884
Wonderful, Chane.

215
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,708
There's no way you will
ever let me down, after all.

216
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,838
That's my daughter.

217
00:16:55,838 --> 00:17:00,798
Chane, you're going to be
taking on a terrible burden for me,

218
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:05,860
so I will give you some sort of reward.
Ask me for anything.

219
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,654
I will grant it to you.

220
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,076
Elmer...

221
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,858
I wonder what you would
have said if you'd seen her.

222
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:21,585
Chane, my lab rat.

223
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:26,923
Sometimes, guinea pigs
take actions that are unexpected.

224
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,777
Your voice?

225
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:33,930
Please, take my words... my voice from me...

226
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:37,433
In order to protect
the knowledge you will get from me?

227
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:44,815
You really are a good little girl, Chane.

228
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,737
It's a simple matter to
take your voice from you.

229
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,573
A very simple matter.

230
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,492
Here...

231
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:01,068
Chane, my dear little girl,

232
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:05,211
keep meeting my expectations
from here on, as well, okay?

233
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:08,589
What loyalty she has...

234
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:13,872
"You must not tell anyone."
Having received that order from me,

235
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:19,141
Chane-- my daughter chose to
surrender her own voice.

236
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:24,842
Listen, Elmer...
Smile Junkie, Mr. Happy Ending...

237
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:29,277
do you think that a happy life
can come to that poor guinea pig?

238
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,781
I'll see the answer through for myself.

239
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,201
Such is my duty, as a researcher.

240
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:43,778
Huey, happiness is something,
like unhappiness,

241
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,960
that strikes without warning.

242
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,758
I'm sure that your daughter
cannot escape them, either.

243
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,243
I took it apart... I totally took it apart...

244
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,747
I took it apart
without it touching the floor once!

245
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,942
Did you see? Did you see?

246
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:28,072
Wow, that was damn refreshing, but now what?

247
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:31,992
Life is fun! Yeah, try chanting
that 10,000 times each day!

248
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:35,718
It will mess with your head,
and all of your pain will disappear!

249
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,538
Okay, okay, okay! I've gotten past the sadness,

250
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:41,588
and as of now,
I'm evolving to a higher stage!

251
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,726
Right? Don't you all think so?

252
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:48,928
It's magnificent! Life is magnificent!
I'm starting to get excited!

253
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:52,972
My okay brain is so beyond okay
that it smacks of okay!

254
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,433
You guys tell me an entertaining story.

255
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:59,951
Um, do you know about
the folks that entered the city

256
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:01,097
right after we did?

257
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:04,108
Oh, no. I don't know this story.

258
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,680
For some reason, I'm starting to get excited.

259
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,322
How am I going to control
the beating of my heart?!

260
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:12,421
Do I break it?
I'm going to have to break something!

261
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,622
W-Well, they seem to be
a gang of thugs, like we are.

262
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:23,418
I hear they've been coming
and going at Millionaire Row.

263
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,197
Millionaire Row?

264
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:26,922
--That rich area?
--Yes.

265
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:30,773
Nice. I love an upbeat story. So...

266
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:35,111
Why is a gang like
we are coming and going there?

267
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,906
Burglary?
It has to be burglary, right? Damn!

268
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,148
Before they get ahead of us,

269
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:44,522
we have to start dismantling houses,
carry out their sturdy safes,

270
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,795
bring them back here, and take
them apart, apart, apart, apart...

271
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:48,528
Ah, I'm starting to get wound up!

272
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:51,823
Transcendentally, hopelessly, wound up!

273
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:55,618
No, er, I hear they are
friends of the Genoard family head,

274
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:58,333
and they appear to be
hanging out at one of their villas.

275
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,958
Genoard? Oh, I know them.

276
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,418
The ones who, last year,
had their head and his son

277
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:06,548
killed out by the dam, or the river, right?

278
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:10,508
Yes. Right now, their other son, Dallas,
is also missing,

279
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:14,468
and their daughter, Eve, is said
to have inherited their estate.

280
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:17,722
I get you! What you're saying
is that these guys are kissing up

281
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:21,142
to this Eve, or threatening her, or something.

282
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,352
This is amazing! Ingenious, isn't it?

283
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,665
Sorry, I just wanted to use
the word "ingenious" right then.

284
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:29,692
What I mean is, if we can co-opt
these guys, and take over their turf,

285
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:33,836
then we'll be able to suck up
some of that sweet nectar for ourselves--

286
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:37,328
Yes, yes, yes, yes. No, no.

287
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:40,452
What sort of parasitically
disposed plan is that?

288
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,303
Still, no! The no!

289
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,878
What good is a timid ploy like that, I ask you?

290
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,517
I don't get to break
anything that way, do I?

291
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:53,355
What I want to break is
something physical, understand?

292
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,318
If you understand, I expect an answer.

293
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,572
What's your answer?

294
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,743
You don't have an answer.

295
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,914
In that case...
you can become a common corpse!

296
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,257
Rachel-<i>kun...</i>

297
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,010
thank you for your lengthy report.

298
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:29,378
Thanks to you, the outline of the events aboard
the <i>Flying Pussyfoot</i> will be made much clearer.

299
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,685
Please, go home and get some rest.

300
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,088
Excuse me.

301
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,941
Ah, Rachel-<i>kun</i>, about that boy...

302
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:43,268
If you would, stop by the honey shop
at the entrance to Little Italy.

303
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:46,733
You will probably find the information
you are looking for there.

304
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,496
Also, you are under
no obligation to report anything about it.

305
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,541
Thank you very much.

306
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,708
What's the matter, miss?

307
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,389
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

308
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,418
What are you talking about?

309
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:15,604
Sissy Ennis, I'm going to go
have a quick word with this lady.

310
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,399
Let's go, miss!

311
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,405
Miss, you saw me die?

312
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:29,410
When my head was shot off?
Or when I was mashed against the tracks?

313
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,068
I'm Thomas! Nice to meet you.

314
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,528
I-I'm Rachel.

315
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:41,328
I see. Miss, I'm so relieved
that you aren't an immortal.

316
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:42,756
Did you just happen to come by here?

317
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,972
No. The president of the <i>Daily Days</i> told me to.

318
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,918
Oh, the information brokers.

319
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:56,132
Well, since you'll find out anything
I lie about here later anyway,

320
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,327
I'll tell you the truth.

321
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:02,484
My real name is Czeslaw Meyer.
You can call me Czes.

322
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,518
The truth...

323
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:09,785
By your reaction, I see you
really don't know anything.

324
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:12,202
Where should I even begin to explain?

325
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,707
I guess I'll start with what an immortal is.

326
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,543
I'll tell you everything.

327
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,828
I was kidding, of course!
No reason to faint, is there?

328
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:28,288
I feel all full of guilt now!

329
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:30,880
Oh, no! I'm really starting to
get excited now! What do I do?!

330
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,252
This sensation is like sadness,
mingled with glee,

331
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:36,867
or the feeling you get the day before a trip!

332
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,980
So, in light of that sensation,
forgive me, okay?

333
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,302
Now, this group must have a leader, right?

334
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:46,388
Yes! I've seen him
once in a while at the hospital.

335
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:50,728
He has a sword tattooed on his face,
and is unusually timid!

336
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,978
A tattoo of a sword on his face, huh?

337
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:56,497
Sounds like something worth breaking, all right.

338
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,668
Here he is!

339
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,488
This is the guy, isn't it?

340
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,368
Yes, that's him. No two ways about it.

341
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:07,424
Bingo!

342
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:13,208
Now then, let me tell you
a happy, yet sad story.

343
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,752
Happy-- that's the flip side of sad.

344
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:18,628
Put another way,
it's heaven and hell, love and peace!

345
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:21,723
Love and peace!

346
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:25,693
We catch this guy Jacuzzi, then we'll get
some money out of the Russo bosses!

347
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:29,446
If we go to prison,
it will be a tribute to Boss Ladd!

348
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,852
We'll start by kidnapping this girl Eve.

349
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:36,097
Kidnapping a girl of her age

350
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:38,528
is enough to get me excited by itself,

351
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,208
but unfortunately for me, I prefer older women!

352
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,448
Once we use her as a hostage
to draw Jacuzzi out, we'll get Jacuzzi!

353
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:47,172
We'll also get some ransom money!

354
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:51,412
Well? It is indeed
a happy, yet sad story, right?

355
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:53,220
Where's the sad part to it?

356
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:58,934
We're the ones who are happy,
and they're the ones who are sad, right?

357
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:14,439
<i>Looking up at the starry sky</i>
<i>that goes on forever, we sing</i>

358
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:28,661
<i>a melody of a dream</i>
<i>we have of our limited eternity</i>

359
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:40,168
<i>The water of adoration,</i>
<i>overflowing in our hearts</i>

360
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:47,218
<i>will reach someone in the distant future</i>

361
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:54,308
<i>I believe so</i>

362
00:26:54,308 --> 00:27:01,398
<i>Running through time prolonged,</i>

363
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:08,897
<i>our voices calling out will</i>
<i>someday become a great song</i>

364
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:15,622
<i>We can go on spinning our love</i>

365
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:25,676
<i>though it may still be such a tiny light now</i>

366
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,392
<i>Let me tell you a sad, truly sad story.</i>

367
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,533
<i>The same as always? What does that mean?</i>

368
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,847
<i>Only these delinquents know what it means</i>!

369
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,522
<i>It's a simple matter to grieve over the unknown</i>!

370
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,442
<i>I'm not a simple man, so I won't grieve anymore</i>!

371
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>For now, I may be sad,</i>
<i>but you all are happy, right?</i>
