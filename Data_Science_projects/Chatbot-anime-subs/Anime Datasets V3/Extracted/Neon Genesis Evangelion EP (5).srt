00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,960
Rei!

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,570
I see.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Rei,
Beyond Her Heart

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,060
Rei Ayanami, age fourteen.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,700
The first test subject chosen by
following the Marduk Report.

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
The First Child.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,290
She is the designated pilot
for Evangelion Unit 00.

83
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,970
Her past has been eradicated. All
her personal records were erased.

84
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,180
So, what caused the accident
during the last experiment?

85
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,640
We still don't know.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,550
However, we believe that
mental instability

87
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,550
on the part of the pilot was
a primary cause.

88
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,420
Mental instability? In Rei?

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,520
Yes, her mind became much more
disturbed than we had anticipated.

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,660
So, what did happen?

91
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,820
I don't know.

92
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,100
But she could have...

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,030
Did something occur to you?

94
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,160
No, that can't be it.

95
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,780
<i>The demolition of block B-3</i>
<i>has been completed.</i>

96
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,050
<i>All technical department personnel</i>

97
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,950
<i>are to submit their data</i>
<i>to the analysis group.</i>

98
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,250
So this is our enemy.

99
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,800
I see. Everything except the
core remains intact.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,370
This is a perfect sample.

101
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,440
Thank you, this will help us a lot.

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
So, did you find anything new?

103
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,280
What the heck is this?

104
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
That's the code number for
"cannot be analyzed".

105
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,350
You mean, you don't know
what this is?

106
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,260
Correct. We do know the Angel
is composed of a type of matter

107
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,020
characterized by both particulate
and wave properties, like light.

108
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,830
But you've at least found its
power source, haven't you?

109
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,630
Something like that anyway.

110
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,700
But we haven't been able to figure
out any of its operating principles.

111
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,940
We've found something completely
outside our experience.

112
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,440
The world is filled with mysteries.

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,380
For example, take a look at this.

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,870
This is the Angel's inherent
wave pattern.

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,810
What? Let me see.

116
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,820
Could this be...

117
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes. Although they are composed
of a different form of matter,

118
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,460
their actual composition,
in terms of the arrangement

119
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,930
and spacing of the pattern, falls
within a 99.89% match of humans.

120
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,830
Unbelievable, 99.89%.

121
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,000
We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,010
Bring it down... slowly...
We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

123
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,340
Okay!
We must acknowledge our limited
level of understanding once again.

124
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,810
Okay!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

125
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,140
Keep going. Stop.

126
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,710
This is the core?

127
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,880
How's the rest of it?

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,880
It's pretty deteriorated. We can't
expect to use it as a reference.

129
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,750
That's not a problem.
Dispose ofthe remnants.

130
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes, Sir.

131
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,850
What's wrong?

132
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,580
Well, nothing's wrong.

133
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,100
Are you aware that when you
say "nothing" that way,

134
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,590
it's the same as asking others
to pay attention to you?

135
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,670
Well, it's just that my father seems
to have burned his hands.

136
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,160
Burned?

137
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
I was just wondering
how it happened.

138
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,780
Burns? Do you know anything
about those burns?

139
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,950
It was before you arrived at NERV.

140
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,390
Unit 00 went berserk during the
activation experiments.

141
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,720
You've heard about that, right?

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
Yes.

143
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,060
The pilot was trapped inside.

144
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,000
Ayanami was the pilot, wasn't she?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,770
It was Commander Ikari
who rescued her.

146
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,600
He opened the super-heated
hatch with his bare hands.

147
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
My father did that?

148
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,130
That's how he burned his hands.

149
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,880
Go, Hideko!

150
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,550
You lose!

151
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,590
You've got to treat us to
pizza if you lose!

152
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,020
There, go for it!

153
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,110
You won't make it!

154
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
Now, let's sink a shot!

155
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,430
Oh my gosh! Those guys
are looking at us!

156
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,030
Perverts!
Oh my gosh! Those guys
are looking at us!

157
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,860
Man, they've all got such
incredible breasts.

158
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,910
Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

159
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,610
Hi, Shinji!
Suzuhara's ogling us! Gross!

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,730
Hi, Shinji!

161
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,680
Hey, Big Shot!

162
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,850
What're you looking at so intently?

163
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,950
Nothing!

164
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,950
I think you're looking at
Ayanami! Right?

165
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,620
No!

166
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,550
Oh, come on, dude. Am I stupid?

167
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,260
Ayanami's boobs...

168
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,090
Ayanami's thighs...

169
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,260
Ayanami's...

170
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,530
...calves!

171
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,360
I told you, it's nothing like that.

172
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,100
Then, what were you looking at?

173
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,790
You can't fool me.

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,270
I was just wondering why
she's always alone.

175
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,240
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,680
she hasn't had any friends since
she started here in the 7th grade.

177
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,850
There's just something about her
that makes her hard to talk to.

178
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,510
She's probably just got
a lousy personality.

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,630
You're both Eva pilots, right? You
should know her better than us.

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,300
He's right.

181
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,890
Well, I've hardly spoken to her.

182
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,000
<i>Eva Unit 01 is now entering the</i>
<i>third stage cooling process.</i>

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,410
<i>Lower all systems to</i>
<i>Phase 3 in Cage 6.</i>

184
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,610
<i>The earlier harmonics and</i>
<i>synchronization tests were good.</i>

185
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,210
<i>All numerical conditions</i>
<i>have been satisfied.</i>

186
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,020
<i>Roger. Transmit the results</i>
<i>to Balthazar.</i>

187
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,220
<i>Roger.</i>

188
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,820
<i>Transmit the full range of the entry</i>
<i>plug's personal data to Melchior.</i>

189
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,490
<i>Data transmitting.</i>

190
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>This is Melchior, roger.</i>
<i>Circuits connected.</i>

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,400
<i>Initiating third stage</i>
<i>cooling process.</i>

192
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
<i>CBL circulation has begun.</i>

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,700
<i>Vent liquid wastes to the second</i>
<i>purification system.</i>

194
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,570
<i>The protein walls are in good</i>
<i>condition. No problems detected.</i>

195
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,970
<i>T-Minus 1,050 minutes until the</i>
<i>Unit 00 re-activation experiment.</i>

196
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,880
What is this?!

197
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,350
It's curry.

198
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,950
So you're still eating
this instant stuff.

199
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,510
Look, you're a guest, so you've
got no right to complain.

200
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,690
Here, Misato...

201
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,850
Oh, here.

202
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,030
Here, put all of that into this!

203
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,600
Are you serious?

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Oh, don't you know how
good this is?

205
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,270
Okay...

206
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,710
Ordinary curry flavored instant
ramen can't compare to this!

207
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,110
Let's eat!

208
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,140
The trick is to put less hot
water in the soup.

209
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,990
Misato cooked this, didn't she?

210
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,460
Yes.
Misato cooked this, didn't she?

211
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,490
Yes.
Oh, can you tell?

212
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,330
Oh, can you tell?

213
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,460
Yes, by its taste.

214
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,260
How can she make something
ready-to-eat taste so awful?

215
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,630
Next time, invite me when
it's Shinji's turn to cook.

216
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,260
Shinji, you really ought to move.

217
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,460
You shouldn't let one bad
roommate ruin your life.

218
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm used to it now.

219
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,900
He's right, Ritsuko.

220
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Never underestimate the ability
of the human animal

221
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,000
to adapt to its environment.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,470
And anyway, if he does move...

223
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,870
Shinji, why don't you bring
me another one, please?

224
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,170
Right.
Shinji, why don't you bring
me another one, please?

225
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,470
Right.
He's going to have to go through
a lot of trouble and red tape.

226
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,710
He's going to have to go through
a lot of trouble and red tape.

227
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,050
He just got his permanent
security card, you know.

228
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,210
Oh, I almost forgot!

229
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,350
Shinji, would you do me a favor?

230
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,750
What is it?

231
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,510
Rei Ayanami's renewal card.

232
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,760
I keep forgetting to
give this to her.

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,930
Would you mind delivering it
before you go to headquarters?

234
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,420
Sure.

235
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,910
What's the matter? You're staring
at Rei's picture, aren't you?

236
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,640
No!

237
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,680
Oh, I think you are, Shinji.

238
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,910
No!

239
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,450
Oh, come on! You're embarrassed,
aren't you?

240
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,680
Well, you've got an official excuse
to go to Rei's place now.

241
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,620
This is your chance, isn't it?

242
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,420
Stop teasing me!

243
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,790
But I love teasing you.
You always go ballistic!

244
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,930
Just like Misato.

245
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,130
I just find it strange that I know
so little about Ayanami,

246
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,330
even though we're both Eva pilots.

247
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,740
She's a very nice girl, but
she's like your father.

248
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,970
She's not very adept at...

249
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,060
Not adept at what?

250
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,710
Living.

251
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,660
Excuse me?

252
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,230
Excuse me, it's Shinji Ikari.

253
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm coming in, Miss Ayanami!

254
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,100
Are these hers?

255
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,130
Well...

256
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,790
I didn't mean...

257
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,810
Will you get off?

258
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,200
I...

259
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,900
What is it?

260
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,130
Well, I mean, I was...

261
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,740
I was asked to, so...

262
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,980
What was it? The card, your card...

263
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,080
It's been renewed!

264
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,850
So I was asked to deliver it.

265
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,350
I didn't mean for any of
this to happen.

266
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,790
Ritsuko said she forgot
to give it to you.

267
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,570
It's true. I rang your bell,
but there was no reply,

268
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,400
and the door was unlocked. So...

269
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,330
<i>Central Dogma is currently</i>
<i>open to the public.</i>

270
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,160
<i>Group 3 should proceed directly</i>
<i>to the fourth gate.</i>

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,560
This is your new card. Ritsuko
asked me to deliver it to you.

272
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,740
About what?

274
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,720
Aren't you going to have a
re-activation experiment today?

275
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,590
Say, aren't you scared?

276
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:45,170
Aren't you afraid of
piloting Unit 00?

277
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,660
Why?

278
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,780
I heard that you were hurt pretty
badly in an earlier experiment,

279
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,910
so I thought you might be...

280
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,290
Aren't you Commander Ikari's son?

281
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,260
Yeah.

282
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,890
Don't you have faith in your
own father's work?

283
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,690
Of course not! How could
I trust him?

284
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,890
What?

285
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,990
Rei, are you all right?

286
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,480
Rei...

287
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,230
The pilot was trapped inside.

288
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,170
It was Commander Ikari
who rescued her.

289
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,540
He opened the super-heated
hatch with his bare hands.

290
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,700
That's how he burned his hands.

291
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,080
<i>Rei.</i>

292
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,450
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

293
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,850
Yes.

294
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,560
We will now commence the Unit 00
re-activation experiment.

295
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,150
Commence first connection.

296
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,690
