<i>[Episode 6]</i>

4
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,032
Qing Cang is so ridiculous.

5
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,951
He hasn't even won the war yet
and he's already started to celebrate.

6
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:25,792
- Master.
- Master.

7
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,912
These two are my disciples,
Si Yin and Ling Yu.

8
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:37,991
Greet the Heavenly Lord's three princes
and Yao Guang.

9
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:40,792
Kunlun Mountain's 17th disciple, Si Yin

10
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,431
Kunlun Mountain's 9th disciple, Ling Yu

11
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,111
greet Yao Guang and the three Highnesses.

12
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,592
Let's end here for tonight.

13
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:59,872
Master, why have the people of
Celestial Palace come as well?

14
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:02,991
Master, did the Celestial Palace
receive bad news?

15
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,312
Even the Heavenly Lord's
three princes have come.

16
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:07,192
No.

17
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:11,072
The three princes have never
been in a war before.

18
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,632
They have come for the experience.

19
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,671
I also happen to need someone with
tremendous magic power to lead the army.

20
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,592
This time, I have arranged
seven formations.

21
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:22,872
Each formation has seven variations,
for a total of 49 variations.

22
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,271
Although the princes
have seen the formations

23
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,391
they have never practiced them
in actual combat.

24
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,792
Ling Yu.

25
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,032
Lead 10,000 soldiers
as vanguard tomorrow.

26
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:32,912
That will put me more at ease.

27
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,271
Yes, Master.

28
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,365
What about me, Master?

29
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,271
You will follow me to lead
the main force.

30
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,151
Yes.

31
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,872
Although the formations are ingenious,
Qing Cang is not one to be taken lightly.

32
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,391
Do not underestimate him.

33
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:49,111
Yes, Master.
I will not let you down.

34
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,592
Master.

35
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,072
Are you worried about tomorrow's battle?

36
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:16,192
When I think that this place will soon be
littered with corpses tomorrow

37
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,432
I feel it is a shame for
Ruoshui Riverbank's beautiful scenery.

38
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:26,312
This war can at least bring
700,000 years of peace to the world.

39
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:33,951
Would it be any better to
think of it this way?

40
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,432
Seventeenth.

41
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:45,632
You once asked me about the method
to seal the Bell of the East Emperor.

42
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,632
- Do you still remember?
- I remember.

43
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:52,391
I will pass on the spell to you tonight.

44
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,872
Really? Thank you, Master.

45
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,232
I have 17 disciples.

46
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,992
You are the one with the most talent
and able to perform this spell.

47
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:04,192
If it were not so

48
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:07,672
I really do not wish to impart
such a dangerous spell to you.

49
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,672
Thank you for your praise, Master.

50
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:14,632
<i>Could Master have
seen through my disguise</i>

51
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,711
<i>and know I am the Fox King's daughter?</i>

52
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,831
What is the matter?

53
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,911
It's nothing, Master.
You can begin.

54
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,351
Charge!

55
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,312
Break into the Celestial formation!

56
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:15,312
Those who behead a general
will be conferred a rank of a nobility!

57
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:16,351
Attack!

58
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,951
Attack!

59
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,631
Attack!

60
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,751
Attack!

61
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:57,631
The formation has been broken!

62
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,032
Impossible! How could the formation
be so quickly broken?

63
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,231
Li Jing, don't go!

64
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:24,912
I cannot watch A-Yin die.

65
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,272
Li Jing, you clearly know--

66
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,511
You clearly know
they will undoubtedly lose.

67
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,591
Why must you still go?

68
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:36,511
Is it really as Li Yuan says?

69
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,351
The one you like is Si Yin?

70
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,032
Ninth!

71
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:42,792
Seventeenth!

72
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,552
Seventeenth, don't come any closer!

73
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,192
Ninth!

74
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,351
Ninth!

75
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,351
Ninth.

76
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:37,991
Ninth!

77
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:49,912
Ninth!

78
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,991
Ninth! Ninth!

79
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,152
Seventeenth.

80
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,792
Leave quickly.

81
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,432
Ninth!

82
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,471
Ninth, hold on!

83
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,871
Ninth! Ninth!

84
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,432
Wake up, Ninth!

85
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:07,471
Ninth! Ninth!

86
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,111
I'll get you out of here.

87
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,192
Master will definitely
be able to save you.

88
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,951
Ninth.

89
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:15,351
Ninth!

90
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,871
Si Yin.

91
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:25,672
You should worry about whether
you yourself can escape.

92
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:37,111
Li Jing!

93
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,991
You dare side with the enemy?

94
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,152
The formation was broken by my men.

95
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,591
Naturally, I should be the one
to take the credit.

96
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,192
What's the matter?

97
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,711
Do I not even have the right
to keep one person alive?

98
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:51,831
All right.

99
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,751
You are correct.

100
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,351
Your Xuan Nu has indeed earned merit.

101
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,751
She helped you steal
the tactical formation strategy

102
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,991
and gained you an advantage.

103
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,111
But now, you dare to
openly defend the enemy!

104
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,471
I also have the right to
execute you on the spot!

105
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,192
What did he just say?

106
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:14,072
A-Yin, I will explain this to you later.

107
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,272
Li Jing.

108
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:17,225
You had Xuan Nu steal

109
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,231
our Kunlun Mountain
tactical formation strategy?

110
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,511
A-Yin, I...

111
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,392
God Mo Yuan.

112
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,711
Master! Master!

113
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,352
Master, hurry and save Ninth.

114
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:21,231
Send word to Die Feng.

115
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,720
Have him come

116
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,592
and take Ling Yu's body
back to Kunlun Mountain.

117
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,632
Master!

118
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:40,632
Not even you can save Ninth?

119
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:44,031
Ninth! Ninth!

120
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,592
I'm sorry, Seventeenth.

121
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:49,352
This time, there is nothing
I can do either.

122
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,112
It's all my fault.

123
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:56,311
Master, it's all my fault.

124
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:02,711
If I had noticed earlier,
Ninth wouldn't have died.

125
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:05,271
This isn't your fault.

126
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,991
The formation was broken.

127
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:11,471
Master, the formation was broken

128
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,271
because of Xuan Nu.

129
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,951
She stole the formation strategy.

130
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,112
What did you say?

131
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:24,231
Xuan Nu stole
the tactical formation strategy

132
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,231
and gave it to Qing Cang.

133
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,912
Mo Yuan, once this formation
has been arranged

134
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,056
there is no leeway for change.

135
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:35,872
So we...

136
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,231
We...

137
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:45,951
not only will suffer a crushing defeat

138
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,336
but 200,000 Celestial soldiers will also
lose their lives at Ruoshui Riverbank.

139
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,112
Report!

140
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:56,071
Report, after Ghost Tribe
broke our formation

141
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,471
they formed a strange formation
and had my troops enveloped.

142
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,653
- Report!
- Report!

143
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:02,031
My left flank has been breached
with disastrous casualties!

144
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:05,632
Report, my right wing and rearguard have
been breached with grievous casualties!

145
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:14,432
Thank you for your assistance.

146
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,592
You are of the Fox Clan?

147
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,592
I am Bai Zhen.

148
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,751
You are the fourth son of the Fox King?

149
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,271
Yes.

150
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,711
You aren't a high-ranking officer
in this war.

151
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,256
You need not stay here.

152
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,392
Please take my disciple
out of the tent as well.

153
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,592
All right.

154
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,112
I won't intrude then.

155
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,031
Si Yin.

156
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:59,551
Fourth Brother.

157
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:03,152
I am the cause of Ninth's death.

158
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,751
If I hadn't met Li Jing

159
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:10,711
and didn't let Xuan Nu stay with me

160
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,071
then Ninth wouldn't have died.

161
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,991
Fifth Sister, going by what you say

162
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:20,711
I am the one who sent Xuan Nu
to Kunlun Mountain to find you.

163
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,991
Then won't we both
have to pay with our lives?

164
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,711
Eldest Sister-in-law even
sent a letter a few days ago

165
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,876
saying she was quite satisfied with
Xuan Nu's marriage

166
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,352
and told me to thank you.

167
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,791
If not for Eldest Sister-in-law, I would
have already slashed her to pieces.

168
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,791
Since she has chosen the Ghost Tribe

169
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,592
then she is no longer
affiliated with Qing Qiu.

170
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:46,832
If you ever see her again,
you can kill her with one stroke.

171
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,991
You need not think twice.
It is what she deserves.

172
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,271
Mo Yuan, I request to fight.

173
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:05,392
- Mo Yuan, I also request to fight.
- Mo Yuan, I also request to fight.

174
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,751
Princes, you need not rush to fight.

175
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:11,071
If there's a need to lead troops,
Kunlun Mountain has 16 disciples.

176
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,469
Since we have come,
we are not here just for show.

177
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,632
We're willing to live or die
with all the soldiers.

178
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,751
We are willing to live or die
with all the soldiers.

179
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,751
Right now, I need 100,000 men
to throw away their lives.

180
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,672
Throw away their lives?

181
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:35,511
That is correct. Throw away their lives.

182
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,791
The soldiers outside are all
descendants of the Celestial Tribe.

183
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,912
Although they're not as respected
as the royal family

184
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,071
they are all precious lives.

185
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:55,432
Please reconsider.

186
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,551
The present situation is urgent.

187
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,071
We must take a risky move.

188
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,816
Only then can we
turn defeat into victory.

189
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:08,751
If this plan succeeds,
the rest can live.

190
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:12,031
If we do not make this move

191
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,231
I'm afraid the world
will have a new ruler.

192
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,711
I will personally lead the troops and
create an opening in their formation.

193
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:25,471
However, I need a brave and skilled
military officer

194
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,071
to lead these 100,000 soldiers

195
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,751
towards the southeast corner
to break the enemy's encirclement.

196
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:32,751
If it can lure 100,000 soldiers
of the Ghost Tribe in pursuit

197
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,432
it can gain us
one last hope at surviving.

198
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,471
Mo Yuan, I am a part of
the Celestial Tribe.

199
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:42,192
This time, I happen to have brought
100,000 soldiers.

200
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:45,991
My entire clan is willing to
clear a path for you!

201
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:48,751
Are you of the Su Jin Clan?

202
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:50,751
That is correct, Su Jin Clan.

203
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:51,832
Very well.

204
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:53,632
Mo Yuan.

205
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,031
In terms of bravery and skill in warfare

206
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:11,231
in this tent, aside from you,
there is no other but me.

207
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,672
If you send an unknown officer
to lead the troops

208
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:17,071
I'm afraid Qing Cang
will not fall for it.

209
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,832
I am willing to personally lead
the army of 100,000

210
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:26,711
and offer one more to the count for you.

211
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,791
This path is doomed to have no return.

212
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,672
For the people

213
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:39,432
I am willing to accept the order.

214
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:45,511
Fourth Brother.

215
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,592
If we lose this war

216
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:52,311
then won't we be
letting down Ninth Disciple?

217
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:56,392
If Ninth Disciple's parents were to know
he already died at Ruoshui Riverbank

218
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:57,912
how upset would they be?

219
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:02,991
All people eventually die.
It is only sooner or later.

220
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,031
Live with a clear conscience

221
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:09,231
then even in death,
there will be no loss of dignity.

222
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,991
His death was worthwhile.

223
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,751
I had originally wanted to
watch the war from afar

224
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,951
but who knew nothing would
happen as expected.

225
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:20,912
Fourth Brother, do you know of
the Bell of the East Emperor?

226
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:23,711
Yes. I've also seen it when I was young.

227
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:27,152
However, its whereabouts are unknown now.

228
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,352
It is in Qing Cang's possession.

229
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:32,551
Is that true?

230
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:35,751
This is another serious matter then.

231
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:57,672
In an hour, we will carry out the plan.

232
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:00,392
Remember, after you have
broken through the encirclement

233
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:02,872
thin out the enemy's frontline
as much as possible.

234
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,551
Understood.

235
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:05,951
Farewell for now.

236
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,991
On the day I return

237
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,071
I will have another contest with you.

238
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,751
No matter the outcome

239
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,592
after our duel

240
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,672
let us wipe the slate clean.

241
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,071
What do you say?

242
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,551
Very well.

243
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:34,392
Everyone, I will be going first.

244
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,192
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

245
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,912
Of the seven formations I laid out

246
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:09,471
one general has perished,
and one general will lead a diversion.

247
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,352
I still need two other generals to lead.

248
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,511
We have already split our troops.

249
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,592
If we request for more troops
from Heavenly Lord

250
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,392
I'm afraid they won't get here in time.

251
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,551
Master, I request to lead.

252
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,672
You have never led an army, Seventeenth.

253
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,751
I have followed you for 20,000 years.

254
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:33,352
I have long since committed
the formation to heart.

255
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,951
Please believe me.

256
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:39,632
I am also willing to lead.

257
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:41,711
You?

258
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:45,031
In this canopy, in terms of magic power

259
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:49,192
aside from you, I'm afraid
I am the only other choice.

260
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,751
Very well.

261
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,271
The two of you will lead the troops.

262
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:56,791
Si Yin will lead
Yao Guang's left flank forces.

263
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,152
Bai Zhen will lead Ling Yu's vanguard.

264
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,311
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:02,994
In a bit, according to
my agreement with Yao Guang

266
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:06,090
I'll lead the main force to break through
the enemy's southeast corner

267
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,271
and allow Yao Guang to escape
from the encirclement.

268
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,551
At this time

269
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:14,392
Yang Cuo, Sang Ji, and Lian Song
will pretend to give up and retreat.

270
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:49,751
Mo Yuan, Qing Cang has already
changed his formation

271
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,951
and diverted at least 100,000 soldiers
in pursuit of Yao Guang.

272
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:56,271
Good.

273
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:04,031
Seize Qing Cang's head

274
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:07,144
as an offering to Celestial soldiers
who heroically sacrificed their lives!

275
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,403
Seize Qing Cang's head

276
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:11,471
as an offering to Celestial soldiers
who heroically sacrificed their lives!

277
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:12,991
Seize Qing Cang's head

278
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,352
as an offering to Celestial soldiers
who heroically sacrificed their lives!

279
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,071
Qing Cang.

280
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:06,112
If you allow yourself to be captured

281
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:09,231
your troops behind you
might have a chance to live.

282
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:12,271
But if you do not surrender

283
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:13,832
then you shall pay with your life

284
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,016
for the Celestial soldiers
who died in this war.

285
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:22,551
As long as I am lord of the Ghost Tribe

286
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,231
I will never surrender.

287
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:28,632
It is time for a change in this world.

288
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:34,352
With all these gods to accompany me

289
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,551
I deem this war worthwhile.

290
00:29:56,432 --> 00:30:00,632
Mo Yuan, do you recognize this?

291
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,832
The Bell of the East Emperor?

292
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:04,432
This Bell of the East Emperor
was created by you.

293
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:08,751
Today, you will die by it!

294
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,432
Si Yin!

295
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,672
Catch him!

296
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:55,192
Si Yin.

297
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,271
Qing Cang.

298
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:59,672
Since I was the one who created
the Bell of the East Emperor

299
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,551
then I know how to control it!

300
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,352
Master!

301
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:24,271
Seventeenth, are you all right?

302
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:25,271
I'm fine.

303
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:08,552
Wait for me.

304
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,711
Master.

305
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:26,512
Master.

306
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:38,911
Master!

307
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:57,672
Master.

308
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,351
Master!

309
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:02,791
- Master!
- Seventeenth!

310
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:04,791
Master!

311
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,032
Master!

312
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:09,871
Master.

313
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:12,672
Master!

314
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:18,552
Master!

315
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:21,711
- Master!
- Master!

316
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,512
Master!

317
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:37,791
Master.

318
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:48,911
- Master!
- Master!

319
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,311
Master!

320
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:58,871
Immortals, this is the Ghost Tribe's
document of surrender.

321
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:01,311
My father has been sealed in
the Bell of the East Emperor.

322
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:04,192
The Ghost Tribe no longer wants to
stand against the Celestial Tribe.

323
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,711
Please accept this document of surrender

324
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:09,831
and allow my 30,000 defeated troops
a chance to live.

325
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,271
What is the use of
a document of surrender?

326
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:30,472
I'll have you all buried with the dead!

327
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:34,351
Seventeenth!

328
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:36,351
- Seventeenth, stop!
- Seventeenth!

329
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:38,735
This concerns all the people
in the world! Do not be rash!

330
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:42,552
The Ghost Tribe has millions of people.
You'll never kill us all!

331
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,032
I'll annihilate the entire Ghost Tribe

332
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:47,456
even if I have to
devote my whole life to it!

333
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,152
Si Yin, casualties are unavoidable
when it comes to war.

334
00:36:52,152 --> 00:36:54,271
Moreover, my father
has already been sealed.

335
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:56,552
Please do not implicate any others!

336
00:36:58,192 --> 00:36:59,512
Let go of me!

337
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,831
- Si Yin!
- Seventeenth!

338
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,871
Let's go back to Kunlun Mountain.

339
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,072
What did you say?

340
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:26,072
Mo Yuan used his spirit as a sacrifice
to the Bell of the East Emperor

341
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,351
and his soul has been scattered.

342
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,831
All right.

343
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:40,791
I understand.

344
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,871
Wait.

345
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,552
What orders do you have, Dijun?

346
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:54,072
Regardless, Qing Cang has
already been sealed.

347
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,032
Go quickly to Grand Ziming Palace.

348
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:58,032
Go sooner rather than later.

349
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:00,152
Yes.

350
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:37,472
Here, have some fruit.

351
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:39,032
Go away!

352
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:46,751
I was beaten half to death for you.

353
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,711
I also went to Kunlun Mountain
to steal the formation strategy for you.

354
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:53,632
Now that we have lost,
it is just your father's destiny.

355
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,072
Why must you still treat me so?

356
00:38:57,672 --> 00:39:00,911
What does winning or losing
have to do with me?

357
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:06,791
And what do the things you've done
have to do with me?

358
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:10,271
How do they not?

359
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:13,271
Now that the Ghost Tribe has lost

360
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:15,952
and Mo Yuan has consequently died

361
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:18,351
I have become a sinner
of Kunlun Mountain.

362
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:23,231
From now on,
on heaven or on earth

363
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,791
I can only rely on you, Your Highness.

364
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,552
Do you know, Xuan Nu?

365
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:32,152
You've relied on the wrong person.

366
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:37,952
I have no power or influence
in the Ghost Tribe

367
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:40,192
and I've always been
antagonistic to Li Yuan.

368
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:43,311
Now that Father is dead

369
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:44,831
Li Yuan will succeed the throne.

370
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,231
Very soon, I will be dead.

371
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:49,711
You rely on me?

372
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,672
Then who am I to rely on?

373
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,952
Second Prince.

374
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:00,952
What is it?

375
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,751
Someone from Celestial Tribe has come.

376
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:08,751
- Send him in.
- Yes.

377
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:17,952
I am Star Lord Si Ming.
Greetings, Your Highness.

378
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:20,777
Hasn't my brother already handed over
the document of surrender?

379
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,311
What are you people from Celestial Tribe
coming to see me for?

380
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:28,831
I am here to help Your Highness
take the position of Ghost Lord.

381
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:31,672
The position of Ghost Lord?

382
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:34,552
I have absolutely no interest.

383
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:35,791
You can leave.

384
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,952
Your Highness, supposing that
Eldest Prince succeeds the throne

385
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:44,911
you will probably not live past tomorrow.

386
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:48,632
Besides, he and you have animosity
over the death of your mother.

387
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:52,032
You have yet to take revenge.
How could you possibly be resigned?

388
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:02,192
How could Master...

389
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,592
Master...

390
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,231
Master!

391
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:42,512
Master!

392
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,152
Master!

393
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,672
Master.

394
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:53,592
Zhe Yan, when will Master wake up?

395
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:05,431
