1
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:05,519
My dream was to make it big
with my band

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,289
and have everyone in Japan
know my name.

3
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:14,629
Even if it meant that one person
would never call my name again.

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,519
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

5
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:21,399
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,239
Baby I'm standing alone

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,039
An unforgettable rainy day

8
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,049
Chasing after your shadow

9
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,919
And it's over, it's like sand now

10
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:39,219
I sigh every night

11
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,259
I scream like a child and cried

12
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,989
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow

13
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,049
Please, please God, forgive my sins

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,789
I don't need to hide no more

15
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,739
Flowing toward the turquoise light

16
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:58,769
Just keep going on

17
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,379
You've got the chance now

18
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,579
You've got the power

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,079
Know you gotta be so true to yourself

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,709
I show you my life now

21
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,149
I show you my love now

22
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,379
I show you my everything yeah yeah

23
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,619
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now

24
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,419
Don't ever change so be yourself

25
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,859
I'll show you my strength now

26
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,229
I'll show you my love now

27
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,499
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah

28
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,519
Baby don't be afraid

29
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,169
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

30
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:31,869
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

31
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,639
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

32
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:37,539
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

33
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:55,429
Our rehearsal is from
twelve o'clock for one hour.

34
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,999
17:00~18:00 SOUND CHECK
18:00~19:00 RUN-THROUGH
19:00~19:45 STAND-BY FOR ON AIR
Our rehearsal is from
twelve o'clock for one hour.

35
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,399
If you're hungry,

36
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,429
you'd better eat a box lunch
while you have the chance.

37
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,969
You still have thirty minutes.

38
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:07,399
Hey, what's this "run-through" at six?

39
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,069
It's a dress rehearsal.

40
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,069
You do the exact same thing
as you will live.

41
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:14,779
There's a lot of time between
the rehearsal and the run-through.

42
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:16,179
Do we have other work
during that time?

43
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,479
Today, there's just this music show.

44
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,809
It's your first time on live TV, isn't it?

45
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,549
Focus, and get yourself geared up for it.

46
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:24,279
What?!

47
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,819
Then can we go out before
the run-through?

48
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,759
Did you even listen to what I said?

49
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,659
Focus, I said, focus.

50
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:31,799
I...

51
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,029
Is it okay if I take a nap in the car?

52
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,709
I'm about to pass out from
lack of sleep.

53
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,229
And I can't relax here.

54
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,179
Okay. That was good.

55
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,489
Yasu!

56
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,819
Yay! How've you been?

57
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,989
You're always so loud,
even on the job.

58
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:02,989
Traitor.

59
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,799
Women are so scary.
They can be so vindictive.

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,049
Hey, Ren.

61
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,909
I need to talk to you.

62
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:26,349
What?

63
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:27,919
Just come with me.

64
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,059
Ren, are you still?

65
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,359
No, I'm okay.

66
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,859
No, you're not! Your eyes say so!

67
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,159
It's just a little...

68
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,459
A little what?

69
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,499
It'll never become a habit.

70
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,159
It already has,
and you've gotta stop!

71
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,629
Sorry.

72
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,399
I'll never do it again, so...

73
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:01,849
Ren...

74
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,419
Don't worry.

75
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,219
I'm not gonna steal Nana from you.

76
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,629
I didn't think so.

77
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,969
You've always let me have
whatever I want since long ago.

78
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,009
It pisses me off that
you're looking down on me.

79
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,579
Whenever you're not with Nana,
you become unstable like that!

80
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,349
And it's the same with Nana!

81
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,519
Nana, too?

82
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,479
She's been hyperventilating.

83
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,859
If this continues,
who knows how she'll end up.

84
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,429
I realized it through that incident
with Takumi and Nana.

85
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,329
She's probably quite traumatized
from being abandoned by her mom.

86
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,709
You're not suited for this industry.

87
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,449
I really regret encouraging you
to come to Tokyo.

88
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,479
Don't push yourself, Ren.

89
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,319
You're not like Takumi or me.

90
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,229
Stop trying to reason it out and
just do as you wish.

91
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,029
If you keep forcing things,
you're not gonna last long.

92
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:23,669
"Shadow of Love" is so great,
no matter how many times I listen to it.

93
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,539
Tonight's show will be
a good promo,

94
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,339
and I'm sure the initial stock of
the CDs will sell out right away.

95
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,709
You think so?

96
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,649
I think the sales department
is overestimating

97
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,479
by putting out 800,000 singles at once.

98
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,539
Don't blame me if they're stuck
with a bunch of left-over CDs.

99
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,619
By the way,
how many is BLAST putting out?

100
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:40,549
I'm not sure.

101
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,279
Given all the publicity they're getting,
they might break a million.

102
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,529
But I can't imagine Gaia putting out
800,000 copies of a single

103
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,329
for a new band with no track record.

104
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,189
We'll hit number one on
the charts for sure.

105
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:53,969
You're right!

106
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:54,989
You think so?

107
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,939
If I were Gaia,
I'd make that gamble.

108
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,239
One million copies on
the first release.

109
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
I know it's not my business,
but it's kinda thrilling.

110
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,669
THRILLING?

111
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,869
But if it tanks, that would be
a tremendous loss!

112
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,919
They've already spent
hundreds of millions of yen

113
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,779
in promoting them.

114
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,919
That's exactly why.
They've come this far.

115
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,649
Now they have to recoup
that investment.

116
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,219
If they release more singles than us

117
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,019
and become number one with
their first release,

118
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,089
then the party continues.

119
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,489
We're living in a time where
popular things sell.

120
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:28,469
If there's a pile of CDs from
a new band that's just topped the charts,

121
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,439
you're gonna buy it
purely out of curiosity.

122
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,779
Okay.

123
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,839
Thank you very much!

124
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,249
Hey, Ginpei, can I go out
until the run-through?

125
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,749
You're being persistent.
Is it to see a woman?

126
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,249
I don't have one.

127
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,789
Women are evil.

128
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,679
Ginpei, the car key...

129
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:55,899
Are you feeling all right, Shin?

130
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,329
I could find you a vacant dressing room
for you to sleep in.

131
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,589
No. I'd feel more relaxed
in the car.

132
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,439
Aren't you being nicer to Shin
than to me, Ginpei?

133
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,329
Don't come to wake me up
until it's time.

134
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,029
That kid has no stamina for his age.

135
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:12,879
I'd say you've got too much, Ginpei.

136
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,649
Nana, you should return to
your dressing room

137
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,019
and also take a nap while
you have a moment.

138
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,159
Yeah. I have my own private room,

139
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,449
so maybe I can relax
and get a little sleep.

140
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:24,829
COME ON!

141
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:25,789
COME ON!
Wanna sleep with me?

142
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:27,389
Enough of that.

143
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:27,659
ENOUGH OF THAT...

144
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:28,559
ENOUGH OF THAT...
Where's Nana going?

145
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:28,789
ENOUGH OF THAT...

146
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:29,859
To her private room to take a nap.

147
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,429
How come girls get their own rooms?
Because they're evil?

148
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,829
What do you mean, "enough of that"?

149
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:36,769
We haven't done anything yet.

150
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:42,299
But how does Yasu manage to
stay completely harmless?

151
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,009
He's like a Buddhist priest
who's transcended earthly desires.

152
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,749
Could that mean his love for me
is more like love between siblings?

153
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:54,419
TRAPNEST
MISS REIRA

154
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,079
But Yasu's a guy.
And all guys get horny.

155
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,319
I wonder if he jerks off to Yuri.

156
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,589
BLACK STONES
MISS NANA

157
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,369
I've neglected Ren for a month,

158
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,599
so he's gotta be sleeping with
other women by now.

159
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,469
Not that I care.
I'd actually be relieved.

160
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,279
Good work.

161
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,009
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:24,049
House-sitting.

163
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,739
Oh, I took a cigarette.

164
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:30,659
Leaving your stuff around with
the door unlocked is unsafe.

165
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,389
There are dangerous people
out there who will enter uninvited.

166
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,089
I agree! What if someone sees you here?!
Get out!

167
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,129
Don't be so upset.

168
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,329
I'm sorry that I neglected you
for a whole month.

169
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,999
No, I'm not mad.
After all, I'm just as guilty for that.

170
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,739
I have to... end it.

171
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,349
This style of dating...

172
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,439
to meet occasionally and
talk to each other, making love,

173
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,259
like we're in some cool love drama...

174
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,129
It just won't work for us.

175
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:12,089
If we can't always be together,
it would be easier to just end it.

176
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,529
I'm sure Ren feels the same way.

177
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:17,129
Nana.

178
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:20,099
I have something to talk to you about.

179
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,439
Do you have time?

180
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,079
I prepared myself...

181
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:26,909
but I'm scared.

182
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,789
RE: DO YOU HAVE TIME?
I HAVE AN INTERVIEW FROM 3:00.
BUT I HAVE AT LEAST TWO HOURS.
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DONE
REHEARSING AND I'LL HEAD OVER.

183
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,339
That was fast.

184
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,939
I was hiding behind the car.
I just couldn't wait.

185
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,079
This Volkswagen bus is so cute!

186
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,909
It stands out, so I found it right away.

187
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,779
You're so lucky to get to ride
in this every day.

188
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,849
Actually I think it's a problem
to have our car stand out.

189
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,619
But the glass is tinted,
so no one can see in, right?

190
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,689
So we can do anything.

191
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,059
What do you have in mind?

192
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,329
What do you wanna do, Reira?

193
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,769
"Look each other in the eye
and talk without pretense."

194
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,939
Let me do what you wanna do, Shin.

195
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,299
Huh? What I wanna do?

196
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,099
I'm no longer your client.

197
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,989
But doing what an adolescent boy
wants to do

198
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,189
is not much different from
what we've been doing.

199
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,619
There's no point then.

200
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,929
I'll quietly listen to anything
you wanna talk about.

201
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,969
But there's a difference between
doing it for someone

202
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,159
and having it done for you.

203
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:07,539
Why don't you sit?

204
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,009
No, not that one. Over here.

205
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:16,749
What's wrong with this one?

206
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:20,349
We're not gonna be making out when
we're having this conversation, are we?

207
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,499
Well... that's up to you.

208
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:36,539
What is it?

209
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,479
Ren's lost some weight.

210
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,079
I wonder if he's been eating properly.

211
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,239
Nana...

212
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,819
What is it?! Just say it!

213
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,609
I feel like I could suffocate and die!

214
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:25,289
Marry me.

215
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,139
What's going on? A drama?

216
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,799
A drama? Who's in it?

217
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,979
What are you doing here?
Don't you have rehearsal?

218
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,689
Is that supposed to be a disguise?

219
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,419
It actually makes you
stand out more.

220
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,229
I got a little time off,

221
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,029
so I wanted to come and
see how you look as an actress.

222
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,629
I'm just an extra.

223
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,899
That bank employee uniform
looks good on you.

224
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:07,629
You look so grown-up.

225
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,069
I kinda feel that...

226
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,429
you've been trying to make
a move on me since this morning.

227
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,809
No! I didn't mean to...

228
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,639
Well, maybe a little...

229
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,799
Don't tease grown-ups.

230
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,679
No, wait!

231
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,679
I may look like a kid,
but I am twenty years old!

232
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,749
Really? I thought you were probably
still in high school.

233
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,319
I'll be 21 in three months.

234
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,459
January? What day?

235
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:34,489
The 23rd.

236
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:35,719
Then you're an Aquarius.

237
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,099
Yep! All the guys in my band
are Aquarius.

238
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,659
You're a Virgo, right?
Born on September 12, blood type A.

239
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:45,169
My blood type's A, too.

240
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,969
You look like you're in your teens,
but you're 22, right?

241
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:51,139
I was surprised when
I saw your profile at the agency.

242
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,499
But if we were in school,
we'd only be one grade apart.

243
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,879
That's what my profile says.

244
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,239
Huh? How old are you really?

245
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:59,779
Twenty-seven.

246
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,919
Don't be so obviously shocked.

247
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:04,759
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,419
It's fine. I'm used to it.
Now get back to work.

249
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:09,499
Yes...

250
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:09,859
VACANT CAR

251
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:09,929
METER RUNNING

252
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:10,969
METER RUNNING
It's over.

253
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,829
There's no way someone seven years older
would pay any attention to me.

254
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,969
Age aside, she probably thinks
she can't depend on me.

255
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,169
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms.

256
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,869
Yes. Totally.

257
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:24,609
It's impossible.

258
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:31,519
When I was a child,
I thought no one would ever love me.

259
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:36,719
So that winter back when I was sixteen
and got involved with Ren,

260
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,459
I thought I was having
the most unbelievably happy dream.

261
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,359
It didn't feel real.

262
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:44,759
Shin...

263
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,299
It's my birthday next week.

264
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,799
Happy birthday!

265
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,609
There's nothing happy about it!
I'll be 23!

266
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,599
I'll be an old lady!

267
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,799
That's still young.

268
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,599
But I'll be eight years older than you.

269
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,679
Still seven years.
My birthday's next week, too.

270
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,669
I'll be sixteen.

271
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,079
Huh? What day?

272
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,849
November 1st. Scorpio,
blood type AB.

273
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,489
We're the same!

274
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:09,649
Really?

275
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,089
It's the red string of fate!

276
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,919
But you don't believe in fate, right?

277
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,089
I believe it now.

278
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:23,159
To be loved by the man I love...
To me, that was a miracle.

279
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,609
I thought we were destined
to be together.

280
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,039
Nana...

281
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,379
Will you?

282
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,579
Again? You're such a pervert.

283
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:42,019
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

284
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,289
Will you marry me?

285
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:45,529
Impossible.

286
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,149
If you won't, I'll die.

287
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,759
Then go ahead and die!

288
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,159
When I die, I'm bringing you with me.

289
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,909
Then kill me.

290
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:14,479
He nearly did kill me.
And then he took me to heaven with him.

291
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,009
I guess I'm a pervert too.

292
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,849
You're looking much better, Nana.

293
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,219
Were you able to get some sleep?

294
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,819
Shut up, baldy! Just shut up!

295
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:26,169
- What are you upset about?
- Because you didn't wanna do it with me,

296
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:26,599
- I ended up doing it with Ren again.
- Well, Nana's rage is usually irrational.

297
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,439
SIGH
- I ended up doing it with Ren again.
- Well, Nana's rage is usually irrational.

298
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:29,869
And that idiot totally got carried away.

299
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,869
I COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT
And that idiot totally got carried away.

300
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:32,269
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED
And that idiot totally got carried away.

301
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:32,739
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED

302
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,939
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED
I definitely will not marry him.

303
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:34,979
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED

304
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:35,809
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED
She probably looks better
because of the makeup.

305
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:36,709
She probably looks better
because of the makeup.

306
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,509
That's Mika's great technique!

307
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,079
I think it's the pheromones.
That's Ren's technique.

308
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:44,539
I saw Ren leave Nana's dressing room.

309
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:45,919
That was a bold move to do it
right in your dressing room.

310
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,119
YOU BEAT ME
That was a bold move to do it
right in your dressing room.

311
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:47,289
That was a bold move to do it
right in your dressing room.

312
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,819
- It wasn't!
- That's good news.

313
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:49,089
What's so good about it, baldy?!

314
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,359
GOOD NEWS?!
What's so good about it, baldy?!

315
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,589
There's no need to hide it.

316
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,589
All of us staff know the two of you
are truly lovey-dovey.

317
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:57,599
We're not lovey-dovey at all!

318
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,199
He snuck in without my permission!

319
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,129
Nana.

320
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,739
Ren may try to act cool,

321
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,359
but he's no different from
how he was as a kid.

322
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,599
Be a little kinder to him, will you?

323
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,069
Please.

324
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:09,109
I see...

325
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,449
Yasu is harmless not because
he's achieved enlightenment,

326
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,349
or because he sees me as
his little sister.

327
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,479
Yasu!

328
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,859
It's simply because...
I'm Ren's woman.

329
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,589
Why didn't I ever notice something
so obvious before?

330
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:32,529
This is like a class reunion!

331
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:33,699
Lots of coincidences, right?

332
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,169
The reason Yasu sacrifices himself...

333
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,799
- to protect me,
- You did this on purpose,

334
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,209
- is so he can support Ren,
- using us as bait!

335
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,759
- who can't take action himself.
- You just wanted to see me, right?!

336
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,339
Yasu's bond with Ren is
much stronger

337
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,239
than the one he has with me.

338
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,969
Because they've been together
since Ren was born.

339
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,609
In the same orphanage.

340
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,889
My last ray of hope has been severed.

341
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,219
No one can save me from the pain...

342
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,559
of drowning in Ren's love.

343
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,069
It's a destiny I can't escape.

344
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,469
Yo, Nobu. You doing okay?

345
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,549
Y-Yes.

346
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:21,919
How does this guy manage to
throw people in hell

347
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,879
ENTER
How does this guy manage to
throw people in hell

348
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:25,219
ENTER
just by being there?

349
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,349
His existence itself is evil.

350
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,249
This guy's definitely the Demon Lord.

351
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,259
- Long time no see, Nobu.
- Your woman is totally weird.

352
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,449
And you too, Shin. How've you been?

353
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,489
It's been a while, Reira.

354
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,959
There she is. Reira in person.

355
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,389
She has finally made her appearance.

356
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,759
We finally perform on the same stage.

357
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:41,999
STARE

358
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,069
STARE
And she's looking at me.

359
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:46,099
She's coming!

360
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:47,839
She's coming.

361
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,199
She's coming.

362
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,079
She's coming!

363
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,949
Glad to meet you, Nana!
I'm Reira of Trapnest!

364
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:57,419
I hope we get along!

365
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,319
Okay!

366
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:58,619
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT
Okay!

367
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,049
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT

368
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,589
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT
I can't underestimate this woman.

369
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:01,819
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT

370
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,419
What a huge TV!

371
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,959
I coaxed him for the biggest one,
and he got it for me.

372
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,949
I also rearranged the room.

373
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:12,359
Don't you think you're going
a little overboard with everything?

374
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,229
You do realize how spoiled you are,
don't you?

375
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,339
That's not true!
He's being really strict with me.

376
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:18,769
He tells me if I don't behave,

377
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,139
he won't blow-dry my hair
after I take a bath.

378
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,499
Dry it yourself!

379
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,309
I wish eight o'clock would
come around quickly.

380
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,009
There's still another two hours!

381
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,379
Time passes whether
you want it to or not.

382
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,289
In the meantime, aren't you hungry?
Let's order delivery.

383
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:35,149
If you don't mind salad and spaghetti,
I can make that right away.

384
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,659
I made lots of tomato sauce with
the tomatoes from your place.

385
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,229
Wow. You've become quite
an expert in cooking.

386
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:44,059
You used to be the expert
in falling in love at first sight.

387
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,359
Mhm. It turns out I really enjoy it.

388
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,069
My nausea's subsided,

389
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,729
so I may just attend cooking class
and become a real expert.

390
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,939
Seeing that you've found
something you're good at,

391
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:54,769
I guess it was worthwhile coming
to Tokyo, after all.

392
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,509
But if I had lived alone,

393
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:00,009
I probably would've never learned
to cook much.

394
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,849
I wouldn't have the urge to cook
anything special for myself.

395
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,539
Yeah, I know what you mean.

396
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:08,019
I guess I like cooking for people
and having them enjoy it.

397
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,959
I can feel that even
I'm of use in some way.

398
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,559
On top of that,

399
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,599
Nana would always use way
too much seasoning in her cooking,

400
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,299
so I ended up cooking
almost every day.

401
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,589
So naturally, I got better at it.

402
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,359
I mean, that much sodium
can't be good for your health.

403
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,769
Then, I guess it's all thanks
to the guru, huh?

404
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:25,299
Huh?

405
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,869
Nana's also the one who brought
you and Takumi together, right?

406
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,079
You've been telling me all kinds
of stuff, but you know,

407
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,519
I've never seen you so happy, Nana.

408
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:41,979
I think you finally have
both feet on the ground. I'm relieved.

409
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,929
- Hey, Hachi. Back then...
- Here are your positions for the opening.

410
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:47,989
Everyone, please come forward.

411
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:51,629
I was full of deep regret
for introducing you to Takumi.

412
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:57,939
But, if you're still with him now,
and you're happy,

413
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,469
that makes me feel better.

414
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,739
It's my only ray of hope.

415
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:10,779
Will you hold me now?

416
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,849
Hold me now?

417
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:18,349
My frozen heart

418
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,199
Kiss my lips and maybe

419
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:28,759
you can take me
to your world for now

420
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:32,589
I can't be alone right now

421
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:37,099
Will you hold me now?

422
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,009
Hold me now?

423
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,439
My frozen heart

424
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:48,789
I'm lost in a deep winter sleep

425
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:53,959
I can't seem to find
my way out alone

426
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:59,799
Can you wake me
