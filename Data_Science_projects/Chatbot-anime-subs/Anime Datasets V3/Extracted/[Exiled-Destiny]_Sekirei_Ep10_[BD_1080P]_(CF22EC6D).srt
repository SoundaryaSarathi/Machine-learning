1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,870
That day, my world was all white.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,680
My hands and feet
felt numb from the cold.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,340
I couldn't find my Ashikabi-sama...

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
Wait!

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,850
This is for your own good!
Just let us defeat you!

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,760
Hey, are you okay?

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,170
Shit! She's gone.

8
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't have the strength
to fight with other Sekireis.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,390
All I can ever do is cry.

10
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm no good, I'm hopeless...

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,920
Hey.

12
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,500
You've been sitting there quite a while.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,730
Eh... um...
you looked like you were crying.

14
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,080
So, here.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,750
When the weather's cold like this,
these are the best things.

16
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,340
They'll make you feel better,
so eat them while they're hot, okay?

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,090
Wait! Why are you crying?

18
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,430
Those meat buns were really warm.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,100
Really, really warm...

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,650
See ya!

21
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,450
I found you.

22
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,890
My Ashikabi-sama.

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,640

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,720
Feather 10:
"The Night Before the Escape"
Wow! What a nice story!

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,550
Feather 10:
"The Night Before the Escape"
Grabbing a scarf...
the beginning of the little love story...

45
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,690
Grabbing a scarf...
the beginning of the little love story...

46
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,220
"Carp?"
Grabbing a scarf...
the beginning of the little love story...

47
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,490
"Carp?"
I knew it! Sekireis should live for love!

48
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:49,960
I knew it! Sekireis should live for love!

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,900
You don't need to be ashamed
of not fighting, Incompetence-chan!

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,230
I'm Kuno.

51
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,900
Sekireis' real nature is love!

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,240
- All the Sekireis in the world...
- Why is she here?

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,240
- Should live for love...
- After I talked about the escape plan,
she just came along with us...

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
So?

55
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,250
I understand those two kids
want to escape the capital but...

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Kids?

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,520
Why the hell did all you guys barge
into here this early in the morning?!

58
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,560
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,930
Well, I wasn't happy about the
way MBI's been doing things lately.

60
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,600
Then?

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,930
Yeah, I'll help you guys.

62
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,670
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,800
So, pay up.

64
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,870
Are you going to charge a fee?!

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,280
Ha! That's why I said you're kids.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,510
Grownups don't move for free.

67
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,980
Don't call me a kid!

68
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,750
This is Sahashi.

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm twenty, already!

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
Seo-san.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,480
For me?

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,790
Kaoru-san?

73
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,920
No! I wasn't bullying them! Really!

74
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,930
You won't let me eat there anymore?!

75
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,630
No! That's bad! That's really bad!

76
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,970
Who did you call?

77
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,970
The Landlady.

78
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,300
Ah, she's unbeatable.

79
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,650
You bastard! Using a dirty trick on me!

80
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,650
I thought you were a pure and amiable kid!

81
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,780
That Minato... What is he thinking?

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,660
If that will let them stay together,
then I want to help them.

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Yes! Let them run
away as fast as they can!

84
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,340
If that's what you want,
I won't spare any cooperation.

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,130
Thank you.

86
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,010
Trying to help someone who
doesn't fight escape... Unthinkable!

87
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,280
I warned him how
dangerous this plan was.

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,550
He decided knowing that.

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,660
In truth, thou art not keen
on this plan either, art thou?

90
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,360
To do the best for one's
Ashikabi is the Sekirei's duty.

91
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,500
The first duty of a Sekirei is to fight on!

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,030
And yet thou hidest thyself in this place...

93
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,630
In the end, thou art the same as those two!

94
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,270
Ah, Tsukiumi-san!

95
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,010
Landlady.

96
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,990
I cannot understand what Musubi and even
Number 03 are thinking by helping them thus...

97
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,730
They may not be thinking anything.

98
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,410
There is somebody in trouble,
so you help them...

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,740
That may be the
natural thing for a person to do.

100
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,410
But we are Sekireis!

101
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,080
Sekireis must fight until the end!

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,420
Refusing to fight is!

103
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Tsukiumi-san, I wonder if you mean,

104
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,430
"It's not fair for her to live
happily ever after with her Ashikabi

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,090
even though she won't fight!"?

106
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,500
La-Landlady!

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,170
But, well... perhaps thou art right.

108
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,570
Number 95's feebleness irritates me,

109
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,770
but on the other hand, I might envy her.

110
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,780
I heard you are aiming to be the strongest.

111
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,450
At first, I thought I could be the
strongest even without an Ashikabi.

112
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,450
But now...

113
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm aiming to be strongest in order
to live happily ever after with Minato.

114
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,800
Don't tell this to Minato!

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,130
Yes, yes.

116
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,140
Well then, shall I train you, too?

117
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,470
Train me?

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,310
Ku-chan, please take care of the laundry.

119
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,470
Okay!

120
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,140
Come to the empty lot in the back.

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,630
I'll judge your ability.

122
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,550
The capital is divided into four areas
centered around the Teito tower:

123
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,390
North, West, South and East...

124
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,490
The areas other than the North
area are territories of three Ashikabis.

125
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,160
You're connected to one of them.

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,630
Eh? Me?

127
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,830
The one who was after the Green Girl.

128
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,370
Number 43, Yomi, whom you guys defeated...

129
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,510
Her Ashikabi, Hayato Mikogami.

130
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,510
He reigns over the South.

131
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,510
The West is the territory of a man named
Sanada, but I don't know much about him.

132
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,180
I have met Higa of the East several times,

133
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,850
but he is opposed to the Sekirei Plan,

134
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,530
and there are even other Ashikabis
who follow him. A cunning man.

135
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,930
I'm sure he'll cause trouble sooner or later.

136
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,290
And then, it's so funny. That girl...

137
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,140
What's the matter, Uzume-chan?

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,880
Ah, nothing. I just feel a bit thirsty,

139
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,210
so I'll go buy something to drink.

140
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,780
What?

141
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,890
You lost your target, did you?

142
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,980
Someone disturbed me.

143
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,390
You have only one more chance.
There's no more next times.

144
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,700
I know that.

145
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,570
Please don't forget the life of your
precious Ashikabi depends on Higa-sama.

146
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,090
Well, then...

147
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,580
We'd better avoid their territories if we can.

148
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,250
Excuse me,

149
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,050
how can the North be controlled by nobody

150
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,590
despite there being three
such powerful Ashikabis?

151
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,590
Because there lives a very,
very scary monster to the north.

152
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,930
Ah! Maison Izumo is in the north!

153
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,170
Here I come.

154
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,930
Come on!

155
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,370
Water Celebration!

156
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,970
What the?!

157
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,780
You open yourself up too much.

158
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,590
You still have a long way to go.

159
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,630
You don't use your power properly.

160
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,630
I have lots to teach you.

161
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,970
Landlady, who art thou?

162
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,310
She won't do anything unless we bother her.

163
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,510
So the North is the best
escape route from the capital.

164
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,020
In the north, there's a big river dividing the
capital from the outside called the Araha River.

165
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,030
Once you cross it,
MBI can no longer pursue you.

166
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you suggesting we swim across?

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Idiot! Who said that?

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,240
They are watching not only all
the train stations, airports, ports

169
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,810
and the junctions of the main roads,
but also the sea and rivers.

170
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,240
Then how can they?

171
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,680
Now, the only way is to run
across the bridge straightforwardly.

172
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,680
There are checkpoints on
the bridges. We were there and...

173
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,790
Even so, a loophole can exist.

174
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,250
"The Araha River"
Even so, a loophole can exist.

175
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,460
"The Araha River"
Here. The bridges for regular roads
and for railroads stand in parallel.

176
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,020
Here. The bridges for regular roads
and for railroads stand in parallel.

177
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,030
There are guards on this side of the railroad
bridge, but there are no inspection stations.

178
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,700
So one risk can be eliminated there.

179
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,370
But there are two problems.

180
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,040
One is MBI's surveillance satellites.

181
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,710
If you're caught by one of these, you
could be killed instantly by its laser beam.

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,380
Ah... um... how about asking
Matsu-san to hack the satellites?

183
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,720
Hack the satellites?

184
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,380
She's very good at those things.

185
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,050
All your Sekireis are truly amazing.

186
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,660
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I haven't said anything!

188
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Now then, the only remaining
problem is MBI's hounds.

189
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,030
The Sekireis called the Discipline Squad.

190
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,760
The Discipline Squad?

191
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,640
The Blue Sekirei,
the Red Sekirei, and the Black Sekirei.

192
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,420
They exist to purge other Sekireis,
and they are outrageously strong.

193
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,040
That one, huh?

194
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,090
I'll fight with them!

195
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,760
Musubi-chan.

196
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,430
Then I'll explain the plan.

197
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,170
We'll carry it out tomorrow night.

198
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,370
Tomorrow?!

199
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,110
Three Ashikabis secretly doing something.
There's no way MBI won't notice.

200
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,110
We'd better make the
move as soon as possible.

201
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,780
So we're seriously skipping out by night...

202
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,780
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,520
Because I'm so weak, you have to...

204
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,450
See?

205
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,130
You should've listened to us
and let us shut you down that time.

206
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,330
She's right. If you'd been shut
down before your emergence,

207
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,800
you wouldn't need to go through all this.

208
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,800
But she found him after all.

209
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,870
Kuno-san could meet Shigi-san
because she didn't give up.

210
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,820
Don't worry. You are my girl,
so you just shut up and follow me.

211
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,480
Got it?

212
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,150
Then stop crying!

213
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,680
Yes.

214
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,490
It's love, indeed!

215
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,730
Sekireis get stronger from their love!

216
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,170
By the way, why are you with them?

217
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,500
It's just how things went.

218
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,170
Are you acquaintances?

219
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,470
Anyway!

220
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,510
I regret helping free
of charge, but nonetheless

221
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,840
since I'm in it, I'll enable you guys
to escape from the capital without fail!

222
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,180
Let's kick MBI butt!

223
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,520
I wish you luck, youngster.

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,850
R-Right.

225
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,120
Ah, so pure...

226
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,590
This boy really does rather remind me of him...

227
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,530
Incredible!

228
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,200
I received the outline of
the plan from Seo-tan by e-mail.

229
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,540
And... do you think it's possible?

230
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,210
There's nothing that I, Matsu can't do.

231
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,880
Great!

232
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,210
But... there's a time limit of how long
I can hack the surveillance satellites.

233
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,550
Time limit?

234
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,350
This will be different from
invading stealthily like before,

235
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,560
so more than an hour
would be quite tough...

236
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,230
So you mean that we
must escape within an hour?

237
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,030
Everybody!

238
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,900
The preparation for the party is all done!

239
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,260
- Party?
- Party?

240
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,570
And now, wishing for
their successful elopement.

241
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,570
Cheers!

242
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,170
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

243
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,910
Now, I'll take off all my clothes!

244
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,250
No!

245
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,250
And yours!

246
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,580
No!

247
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,820
Am I the only one
feeling tense about tomorrow?

248
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,250
Hey, Sahashi?

249
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,390
What?

250
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,590
Don't you want to come with us?

251
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,590
Retiring from this bogus game.

252
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,270
Don't you want to live peacefully
with those girls on the outside?

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,700
That is...

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,660
Excuse me for a sec.

255
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,940
Tsukiumi.

256
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,270
What is it?

257
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,940
It's so noisy.

258
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,950
Kazehana-san insisted on a farewell
party for Shigi-kun and Kuno-san.

259
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,280
Why don't you join us, Tsukiumi?

260
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,290
Nonsense!

261
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,950
Did you get hurt?

262
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,620
No need to worry. Just a scratch.

263
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,630
Hey.

264
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,290
What?

265
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,300
You told us that you wouldn't help the escape
plan, but would you please change your mind?

266
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,970
No! I do not go back on a
decision once I have made it!

267
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,410
If... If we're attacked by the
Discipline Squad or the Veiled Sekirei there,

268
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,640
Musubi-chan is the only one who can fight...

269
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:30,320
So if... If something
happened to Musubi-chan, I...

270
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Minato, art thou worrying about the plan,

271
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,990
or is it Musubi thou art worried about?

272
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,330
I'm home!

273
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,330
Huh? It's lively.

274
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,670
Ah, welcome back!
Hurry and come join us, too!

275
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,340
What? A party?

276
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
We're in the middle of a farewell party.

277
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,670
A farewell party?

278
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,870
Yup! A farewell party for the eloping couple.

279
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,020
I'll pass.

280
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,680
That's too bad.

281
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,350
Later.

282
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,020
You're not doing it willingly, are you?

283
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,690
I wonder what the person
forcing you to do it is after.

284
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,030
If you talk about that again here...

285
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,700
You're so scary.

286
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, right, I just came to get sake. Later!

287
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,550
I'm sorry. I said something very insensitive...

288
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,710
Minato.

289
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,720
It's been a while since I married thee.

290
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Dost...

291
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,590
Dost thou not wish to make love to me?

292
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,400
Mina-tan!

293
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,670
Kazehana-tan brought more sake.

294
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,430
Ah, yes.

295
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,080
A stray impulse.

296
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,250
That was just a trivial
stray impulse! Forget it!

297
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,420
Otherwise,
I'll kill thee, Minato. I'll kill thee!

298
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,090
- I'll strip you!
- Please stop!

299
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,250
Tsukiumi's...

300
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,440
Is anybody there? The bath is not ready...

301
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,810
It's fine! Just leave me alone!

302
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,040
This is the perfect temperature
to cool my overexcited head.

303
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,760
When did this happen?!

304
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,130
Yukari? What is it?
You haven't called for a long time...

305
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,800
That's the same for you, Big Bro!

306
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,140
I'm quite busy these days.
I can't go there so easily.

307
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Yes, I know. Then, later.

308
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,480
I'm sorry. Because you are helping me...

309
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,610
Don't worry. Looking for
number 108 is our priority now.

310
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
We'll make the move tonight.

311
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,820
She's always like that.

312
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,630
Don't you want to live peacefully
with those girls on the outside?

313
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,840
Shit!

314
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
Good morning.

315
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,180
It sounded like fun last night.

316
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,180
You should have joined us.

317
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,850
No, I get more than
enough partying in the club.

318
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,180
You've been taking off from
your work for a while, haven't you?

319
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm not in good shape these days.

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,520
The change has begun, hasn't it?

321
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,860
What are you talking about?

322
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,190
I can tell looking at your body.

323
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,860
It's not completely decided, yet.

324
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,530
This is great, Landlady!

325
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,870
She really is the strongest!

326
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,700
L... will not... lose to... her!

327
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,080
I'll protect everybody!

328
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,550
Kusano?

329
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,420
What dost thou want?

330
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,230
You aren't his wife.

331
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:41,570
Somebody who can't help with
big brother's fervent wish isn't his wife.

332
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,570
You can run faster than
Ku but you don't do anything!

333
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,640
So you are not big brother's wife anymore!

334
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Wow! It's the perfect
star-filled sky for the escape!

335
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,600
Now everybody, let's go!

336
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Right!

337
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Tsukiumi... never came out...

338
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,940
Sahashi, we really owe you.

339
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,610
Don't worry about it.

340
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,620
And... about what I said yesterday...

341
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,620
For right now, the success
of the plan is the top priority.

342
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,620
You're right.

343
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,300
Okay then, Operation:
Escape from the Capital...

344
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,160
...begins now!

345
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,200
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!

346
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
This is renai no shinansho

347
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,840
Don't let it go, aserazu so

348
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,170
Without furaingu de show time

349
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,480
Get the funky beat!

350
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,960
Hayai mono gachi?

351
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,090
