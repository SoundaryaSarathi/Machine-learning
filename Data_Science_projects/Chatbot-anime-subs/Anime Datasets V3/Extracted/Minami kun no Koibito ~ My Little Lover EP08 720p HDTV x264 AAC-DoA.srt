A person who needs her?

150

That's right.

151
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,340
She will appear before those who work very hard to be happy.

Because you are a fairy to me.

156
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,750
But I am a bad child.

157
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,300
You might disappear.

158
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,880
Eh? You are a good child.

159
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,680
No. I keep doing things Mom doesn't like.

160
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,550
I make Mom angry all the time.

161
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,550
Mom doen't laugh probably because of me.

162
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,670
That's why I got sick.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,550
That's not true.

164
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,130
It is true.

165
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,700
Then, why don't you show your pictures to your mom?

166
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,820
Then, I think your mom will be happy.

167
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,580
I can't. I can't show them to her. She only thinks of me as a bad child.

168
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,790
<i>She wouldn't be happy to see these pictures.</i>

169
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,320
Mom would be happy if I didn't exist.

171
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,780

A mom who doesn't love her own child?

173
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,190
There isn't even one mom like that in the world.

174
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,490

Miyu-chan, you are so considerate of your mom.

You see, I have to make plans for my future romance, too.

362
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,810
Do you love... Horikiri-san?

363
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:38,420
I... finally realized

364
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,230
that, for a long time,

365
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:51,510
I have loved Chiyomi... all along.

366
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,540
So... I'm sorry.

367
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:19,010
Oh, what a humiliating way to be rejected.

368
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,580
Thank you.

369
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,800
Well then... I am going first.

370
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:44,740
At least, see me off until I am out of your sight.

371
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,470
Okay.

372
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,210
Grandma Toyo is not nice.

373
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,120
Poor Kotoko.

374
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,760
<i>That's right.</i>

375
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,780
<i>What is Minami-kun talking about with Nomura-san?</i>

376
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,100
<i>So, he should be kind to her.</i>

377
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,260
<i>No, that's not right. That's not how Irie-kun is.</i>

378
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,570
<i>My Little Lover<br>Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

379
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,120
Was it... Kanae-san?

380
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,790
How is she doing?

381
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,300
I feel bad about what happened.

382
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,380
Don't worry. Time has passed.

383
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,780
In October, we are going to have a baby.

384
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,510
I see.

385
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,610
Congratulations.

386
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,680
Then, we have all the more reason to do the right thing.

387
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,000
- Here you go.<br>- What's that?

388
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,660
The divorce paper you gave me.

389
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,580
I saw you here yesterday, so I brought it with me, thinking I might run into you.

390
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,110
Sorry for being late.

391
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,220
But, I wanted to hand it to you in person.

392
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,030
But, what a lousy disguise.

393
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,550
You have zero talent in deceiving people, as before.

394
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,530
That guy...

395
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,660
You idiot!

396
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,580
Hey, Nomura-kun!

397
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,700
Do you know how much Emi-chan suffered because of you?

398
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,830
Nomura...

399
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,260
She's been working from morning to night, all by herself.

400
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,390
She supported her family and raised her kid.

401
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,710
Do you know how hard it was for her? Do you?

402
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:51,040
Emiko, Shunichi... I am sorry.

403
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,790
Emiko.

404
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,570
- I will take my mom with me --<br><i>- I won't let you take her.</i>

405
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,300
I decided to protect Mom and Grandma when you left us.

406
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,400
That's what I decided to do.

407
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,040
I am sorry... Grandma is our important family.

408
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,810
I see.

409
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,800
Shunichi, I am leaving your mom and grandma in your care.

410
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,330
You don't have to tell me. I know.

411
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,710
Oh, Shunichi. You should continue with kendo.

412
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,210
You don't want to quit right after you lost.

413
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,790
You should protect your partner this time.

414
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,320
Oh, my goodness.

415
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,260
Oh, no... Can Irie-kun work hard to make it?

416
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:56,990
Minami-kun! Could it be that he and Nomura-san...?

417
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,790
Grandma. I'm going now.

418
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,110
Ah, okay. Thank you.

419
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,930
Sorry, but I will stay a little longer.

420
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,710
Hey, Princess. Let's go.

421
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,950
Sure.

422
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,270
<i>Fairy-san.</i>

423
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,140
Hmm?

424
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,160
Thank you for the wonderful magic.

425
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,300
You are welcome.

426
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,430
See you later.

427
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,420
Eh? Eh? what's happening, Minami-kun?

428
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,880
Don't you ever leave me.

429
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,720
This is... where you belong now.

430
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,510
Eh? What did you say?

431
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,530
Well... nothing.
