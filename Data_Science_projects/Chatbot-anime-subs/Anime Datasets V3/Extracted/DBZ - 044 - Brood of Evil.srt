00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:26,010
Dammit!

2
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,696
Don't worry, you're just
entangled in them.

3
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:40,961
Just wait until evening,
and you'll get loose all on your own.

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,712
Who are you guys?
Is this not Planet Namek?

5
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:57,048
It doesn't have any
fancy name like that!

6
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:00,385
This scummy planet is like
a big trash heap in space.

7
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:05,056
It doesn't have any cities, or people,
or anything decent to eat or drink.

8
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:09,394
We were forced down on this planet
when we got caught in some cosmic tides.

9
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:14,331
Our spaceship was smashed up, and we were
at our wit's end when you folks showed up.

10
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:32,017
We were going to swipe your spaceship
and get out of here right away,

11
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:35,120
but unfortunately, there is a gigantic
cosmic tidal current in the way,

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,688
and we couldn't move.

13
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,624
So, you're saying that you were
just killing time up to now?

14
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:04,049
That's right. While you were out,
we probed you to find out about Earth,

15
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,146
the secret of the Dragon Balls,
and even what Namekians looked like.

16
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,010
Then, the lake, and the giant,
and the ice cave were all...

17
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,679
Illusions that we made you see.

18
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,015
W- what kind of despicable joke is this!?

19
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,684
It was pretty thrilling, wasn't it?

20
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,020
Get bent, you bastards!

21
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,689
A- as hectic as things are right now-!

22
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,625
Don't be mad. In exchange
for taking your spaceship,

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,694
we just let you have a bit
of a dream, didn't we?

24
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,696
It's better than being killed, right?

25
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:57,702
Yeah, we aren't the barbaric
type. We're more gentle.

26
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:01,706
The cosmic tidal currents
move just a little bit each day.

27
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:05,710
But once in a very rare while,
an opening appears in them.

28
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,711
An opening?

29
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:10,648
Yeah. And this fog
is our indicator of that.

30
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,811
As long as this fog
is out, we can escape.

31
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,390
What are you doing!?

32
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,159
We're going to search
for the Dragon Balls.

33
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,996
We never thought anything
in the world could be so amazing.

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,665
This time, <i>you</i> guys stay here.

35
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,336
You'll wait until someone else
comes down on this planet. Later!

36
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,005
J- just a minute!

37
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,006
Hey!

38
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,343
Bulma-<i>san</i>, what are you doing!?
Hurry and go after them!

39
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,678
Are you saying I should get
our stuff back by myself!?

40
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,613
W- well, the way things are...

41
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,033
Hey, by the way, you <i>do</i> know
how to fly this, don't you?

42
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:07,372
It's simple. You tell this thing
to fly, and it flies, all on its own.

43
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,040
That's amazing.

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,134
Okay, let's take off!
Open the door!

45
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,320
Hey...

46
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,312
What's the matter!?
Open the door!

47
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:32,361
<i>All right! They don't know</i>
<i>how to open the door, do they?</i>

48
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,775
--How are you coming, Gohan?
--No good!

49
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,107
They're squirming all over,
and I'm getting nowhere!

50
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:52,107
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

51
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:56,452
D- darn it!

52
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,801
<i>All right, now!</i>

53
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,991
<i>Kuririn-san...</i>

54
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,083
<i>All right...</i>

55
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,368
What is this?

56
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:20,132
If we don't hurry it up,
the fog is going to lift!

57
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,309
Why didn't you make sure
to look into this?

58
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:28,313
Shut up! We just need to bring
the girl with us, right?

59
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:31,805
Huh? Ah, h- hold on...

60
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,012
We did it!

61
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,946
Yahoo!

62
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:07,018
Come on, open it!

63
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:11,022
We can't afford to dally around! Once the
opening in the cosmic tidal currents closes,

64
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,358
there's no telling
when it will open again!

65
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:16,694
L- listen, let's all
go together, like friends.

66
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:21,032
You're saying you want to come with us
back to our planet? It will take 50 years.

67
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:22,634
Huh? 50 years!?

68
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:25,303
Hurry it up!
Hurry, or else!

69
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,635
A- all right.

70
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:31,468
" Piccolo"

71
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,318
All right!

72
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:44,152
So, there's a password, is there?

73
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:53,998
Take care, now. There is food
to eat, if you're not too fussy.

74
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:56,000
Like snakes, and lizards.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,163
They can be pretty good,
depending on how you cook them.

76
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,504
" Piccolo!"

77
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,673
What!?

78
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,351
Whew, you're here at last.

79
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,683
I hate snakes.

80
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,852
D- damn it, if that's
how it's going to be...

81
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,967
Oh, wow, they're
weaker than I thought.

82
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,636
You're right.

83
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,973
I told you, we're not barbarians,
like you guys are.

84
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,308
Oh, no!

85
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:42,302
The fog is about to lift! We have to hurry,
or the tidal opening will close! Let's go!

86
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,822
Thank you. If it weren't for you,

87
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,815
we wouldn't have known how to
get out of here. See you later.

88
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,338
Bulma-<i>san</i>, where is the
opening in the cosmic tide?

89
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,675
I can see it now. It's where
that gas is blowing through.

90
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,677
It's almost closed!

91
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,679
It's all or nothing.

92
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,169
Here we go!

93
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,365
We got through!

94
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,033
We've slid in safe!

95
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,703
Now, we have to make up for lost time.

96
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,729
Destination: Planet Namek.
Full speed.

97
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:51,048
How strong those guys were!
They were too much for us.

98
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,313
I wonder when the next one
will come down here.

99
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,321
<i>At that moment,</i>

100
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:02,987
<i>Vegeta was hastening along his route toward</i>
<i>Planet Namek from a different direction.</i>

101
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,003
<i>l won't let Freeza</i>
<i>have it his way any longer.</i>

102
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:15,495
<i>l will make sure I get the</i>
<i>Dragon Balls, just you watch!</i>

103
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:50,041
Say, Goku-<i>sa</i>...

104
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,709
W- what?

105
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,046
It's been a month already, huh?

106
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,048
Y- yeah...

107
00:10:57,048 --> 00:11:01,052
I forgot to give him
some nail clippers.

108
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:05,056
I'd send him some if there
were a delivery service.

109
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:08,822
Y- yeah, I guess so.
That's too bad, huh?

110
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:21,672
Y- you were standing guard, huh?

111
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,343
<i>34 days after blasting off from Earth,</i>

112
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:30,681
<i>Bulma and the others had finally arrived</i>
<i>at their destination of Planet Namek.</i>

113
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:34,352
We made it!
There it is! There it is!

114
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,020
Wow, it sure is pretty.

115
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,689
It's the real one this time, right?

116
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:43,694
No question about it. The computer says
that this is the genuine Planet Namek.

117
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:47,031
We got here four days
later than we planned.

118
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,700
It's just like those kids said.

119
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,037
It's a good thing
we took that shortcut.

120
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,373
Everything turned out
all right, didn't it?

121
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:59,377
I guess so. Now, we're going to land,
so sit down and fasten your seatbelts.

122
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,712
There's going to be quite a jolt.

123
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:04,806
Commence landing
in a suitable location.

124
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:38,015
We did it! We've landed
on Planet Namek!

125
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,279
We're here!

126
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:47,692
Hang on, now. I'll examine
the composition of the atmosphere.

127
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:51,362
I made sure to install some sensors.
Wasn't that prudent of me?

128
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:54,031
We'll be lucky enough if there's
some level of oxygen here,

129
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,967
but I also prepared
some atmospheric masks,

130
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,959
though that will limit
our time out there to roughly...

131
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:14,147
This looks sort of like the place
where I trained with Piccolo-<i>san</i>.

132
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:20,725
Yeah, where we first
fought the Saiyans, right?

133
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:24,661
I suppose a place that was similar to his
home would instinctively be more settling.

134
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,666
Piccolo-<i>san</i>...

135
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,670
You guys don't <i>ever</i> learn
from your previous lessons, do you!?

136
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,339
How can you just waltz
on out here like this!?

137
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,342
You sure are as scary as ever.

138
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:43,014
For crying out loud. Well, it's okay,
as long as there are Dragon Balls here.

139
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,777
Please...

140
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,352
Look! I'm reading them!

141
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:52,023
Hooray! Now we can finally-

142
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,691
What are you doing?

143
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:59,363
Oh, I was wondering if we weren't being
tricked again, so just to make sure...

144
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,698
It's for real, I tell you!

145
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:03,701
Yow! All right!

146
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,703
Hooray!

147
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:09,139
--Hooray, hooray!
--Hooray, hooray, hooray!

148
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:15,379
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, there's a strong
<i>Ki</i> coming from over there.

149
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,744
A <i>Ki</i>?

150
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,209
You're right.

151
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,653
I'm sensing a lot of them.

152
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah, and they're all
incredible <i>Ki</i>, too.

153
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,659
W- what does it mean?

154
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,329
Oh, come on, what are you talking
about? Those are the Namekians.

155
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,665
With Kami-<i>sama</i> and Piccolo
being as strong as they were,

156
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,334
it's not at all strange that
the Namekians from their home

157
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,336
would have incredible <i>Ki</i>, too.

158
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,104
But still...

159
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,673
Those <i>Ki</i> do feel
a little bit evil, huh?

160
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:49,680
It's okay, I tell you. Kaio-<i>sama</i> said that
Namekians were gentle by nature, didn't he?

161
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,351
There are four Dragon Balls
gathered together in that direction.

162
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,354
Come on, let's go meet the Namekians.

163
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.
They must be Namekians.

164
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,127
I shouldn't have
gotten so jittery, huh?

165
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,137
H- haven't we seen
that someplace before?

166
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:24,315
It's a Saiyan spaceship!

167
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,476
I knew it!

168
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:32,990
It can't be!

169
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,993
Again? Are you serious? How?

170
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:38,662
Gohan, mask your presence!
We'll be detected!

171
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:39,997
R- right.

172
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:44,668
I- it's Vegeta.
He's the only one it could be.

173
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,670
Dammit!

174
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,935
Has he already healed?

175
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:55,608
Come to think about it,
he knows about the Dragon Balls, too.

176
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:02,353
What do we do? It's hopeless. The only thing
we can do now is return to Earth, right?

177
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:04,688
Isn't that so?
Let's hurry back.

178
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,025
If that guy gets
the Dragon Balls, it's over.

179
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:13,697
Bulma-<i>san</i>, please contact Earth and tell
them about this, then go on back by yourself.

180
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:17,368
Me and Gohan will stay here
and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

181
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,702
But...

182
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:22,973
It's okay. We'll have
the Dragon Radar.

183
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,308
Isn't that right, Gohan?

184
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,643
Right.

185
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:27,311
All right.

186
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:31,649
Once I get back to Earth, I'll bring
Son-<i>kun</i> on board and come back for you.

187
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,987
The round trip will take a little
over two months, though. Wait for us!

188
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:40,324
It's okay! Two months
will pass like <i>that</i>!

189
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:45,996
I mean, it's only 60 days! 1440 hours!
86,400 minutes! 5,184,000 seconds!

190
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,665
Right!?

191
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:51,601
R- right. A little more
than two months, right?

192
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:13,115
Freeza, you bastard! I won't
let you snatch them away from me!

193
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,028
I should be able to handle
everyone besides Freeza,

194
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:21,298
but I don't stand a chance of winning
if I fight him head-to-head.

195
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,969
Whatever happens, I have to get the Balls
away from him and gain eternal life.

196
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:28,803
Tch! To think I'd be stuck
using a Scouter again...

197
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:34,968
This way, huh?

198
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:42,976
He's brought Zarbon and
Dodoria with him too, has he?

199
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,325
W- what was that?

200
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:52,663
S- so now what?
Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...

201
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,332
Right. So tell that
to Son-<i>kun</i> and the others.

202
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:59,670
Do you read me? Just don't
tell Chichi-<i>san</i>. Got that?

203
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,006
Right... right... mm-hmm...

204
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:06,010
I already told you...
are you listening to me?

205
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,013
No, tell everyone
<i>but</i> Chichi! Sheesh!

206
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:13,017
Right! Got it!?
We're counting on you! Goodbye!

207
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,352
Good grief...

208
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:18,014
What's the matter, you two?

209
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:26,195
Huh? What?

210
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:37,975
W- why is there
another one coming?

211
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,967
T- that's what <i>l'd</i> like to know.

212
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:08,494
Here it is, Freeza-<i>sama</i>.

213
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,344
Oh, very good, very good.

214
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:17,007
Now there are three more, yes?

215
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:34,630
<i>At last, the evil hidden hand,</i>
<i>Freeza, appears.</i>

216
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:54,310
<i>Will Gohan and Kuririn indeed</i>
<i>be able to collect the Dragon Balls?</i>

217
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:05,310
