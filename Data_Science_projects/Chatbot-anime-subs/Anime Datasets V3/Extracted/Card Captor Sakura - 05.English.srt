00:00:55,366 --> 00:01:00,599
[Sakura, the panda and the cute shop]

2
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,132
Good morning

3
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,032
Good morning

4
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:22,752
Good morning

5
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,328
Good morning

6
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:34,971
Thanks

7
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:36,033
for your trouble

8
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,975
Well shall I get down to it

9
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,847
A new shop is opening

10
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,129
Thank you

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,932
You have a lot of cute stuffed animals

12
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,407
Is the store opening today?

13
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:14,404
Yes I am Maki Matsumoto,

14
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,540
The owner of this store.
Pleased to meet you!

15
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,105
I’m Sakura Kinomoto

16
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,244
Sakura is it?

17
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:21,317
Stop by on the way home from school.

18
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:24,016
By then the preparations should be done.

19
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:24,913
OK!

20
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:30,591
Umm…

21
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,232
Sakura-chan

22
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,833
A new store is opening did you know?

23
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:46,231
You mean the Twin Bells right?

24
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:47,968
Do you want to take a side trip?

25
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,777
You really love stuffed animals right?

26
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:51,706
Yeah.

27
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:53,947
I invited Rika-chan and Naoko-chan too

28
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:56,249
Won’t you come too?

29
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,915
I also promised Tomoyo-chan I would go

30
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,581
Let’s all go together

31
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:01,414
Yeah

32
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,425
It’s Tomoyo-chan’s voice

33
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:22,144
Tomoyo-chan is in the chorus club

34
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,570
She is really good at singing

35
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:26,983
and has won in competitions many times.

36
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,554
What a beautiful voice

37
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,137
Tomoyo-chan is looking for a pouch

38
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:49,969
I have been having trouble

39
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:52,635
because I don’t have a pouch the right size
to put camera batteries in.

40
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,433
I wonder if I should look for a notebook

41
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,676
Don’t you get excited in a new store?

42
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:57,571
Really

43
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,092
It looks like the store isn’t open yet

44
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:18,624
No it is

45
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,442
But it’s not cleaned up at all

46
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:31,872
I did it again

47
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,512
Welcome in

48
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,923
Ah you’re the one from this morning

49
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,758
Hello I brought my friends

50
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,455
I’m sorry it’s such a mess

51
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,464
Shall we help

52
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,626
But I couldn’t ask a customer to do that

53
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:55,196
But we want to see the cute things soon

54
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,262
Right?

55
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,541
Yeah I want to see them

56
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,601
Thank you everybody

57
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:31,197
I just moved to this town,

58
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:32,870
so there is nobody that I know.

59
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,745
You saved me.

60
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:38,048
So go ahead!

61
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:41,315
Thank you

62
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,718
In this state you can’t tell
what there is at all

63
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:50,152
Tomorrow I will have it,

64
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,528
so you can take a look around
Come over and see

65
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,725
Yeah, let’s come again tomorrow

66
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:55,862
It really is a nice shop

67
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:59,064
Chiharu-chan loves
stuffed animals so it is good

68
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,002
Yeah I’m really happy

69
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,766
Do you like stuffed animals?

70
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:04,333
Yes I love them

71
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,442
Hey tomorrow
do you want to come to my place.

72
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,538
I got a lot of new ones

73
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:25,425
How cute

74
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:27,093
I thought it was a soccer ball

75
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,428
You have a lot of different ones

76
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,233
Yeah

77
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,342
It’s like a safari park.

78
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,106
Yes.

79
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,772
I suppose it does in the living room
there is a bigger one.

80
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:47,676
I’ll show it to you.

81
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,987
What was that?

82
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,083
I’ll go check

83
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,127
What’s wrong Chiharu-chan?

84
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,862
The stuffed panda doll

85
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,505
It’s gone

86
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:16,908
A thief?

87
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,847
I wonder if they ran out from here?

88
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,479
Even though we came right after
we heard the sound.

89
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:24,649
It’s strange

90
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:34,793
How cool!

91
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:35,689
Nice shot

92
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,568
Poor Chiharu-chan.

93
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:42,767
I hope the catch the culprit soon

94
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,837
But they say there wasn’t any evidence

95
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:48,442
where the thief left the house

96
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:55,643
Actually I heard something that worried me

97
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,784
Worried you?

98
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:00,755
When I got home

99
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,423
and mentioned that Chiharu had been
robbed to my mother

100
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:08,493
A store where
if you shop there chaos ensues?

101
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,067
You don’t mean things
like being robbed and such?

102
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,036
Yes

103
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,564
Is that Maki’s shop?

104
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,403
I don’t know that far.

105
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:18,333
Kinomoto…

106
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:19,766
It was just a rumor in the toy business.

107
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:20,634
Forget I!

108
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:21,569
Kinomoto

109
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,402
Sakura-chan

110
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,812
Oh, no!

111
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:32,548
Welcome!

112
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:33,548
Hello!

113
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,856
What is it?

114
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:41,053
Maki-san that is Chiharu’s…

115
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:47,601
It’s happening again

116
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,434
Again?

117
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,736
The the previous town I opened a store,

118
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,504
the same thing happened

119
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:56,544
countless times

120
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,976
Rumors saying If you shop at that store

121
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,353
you will be robbed began to spread

122
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,811
They never caught the culprit

123
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:10,249
People suspected that perhaps I was doing it

124
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,622
Maybe I should just give up on this shop

125
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,959
You can’t mean that

126
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,867
It would be a waste,
this is such a nice shop

127
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,232
There was no way I could do it on my own

128
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,039
I was engaged

129
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,775
He was a designer

130
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,407
But he died in an accident

131
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:36,813
He loved stuffed animals,

132
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:39,878
So he always said
he wanted to sell animals

133
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:41,884
he designed himself in his own store

134
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:44,761
Maki-san

135
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:45,992
If I quit,

136
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:49,090
he would be sad, wouldn’t he?

137
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,461
But I can’t take any more

138
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,644
A Clow Card that collects
stuffed animals?

139
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:14,717
Why would there be such a silly card?

140
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,457
Don’t you think it has nothing to do with this

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,393
Check it out, Kero-chan.

142
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,820
You can tell a Clow Card’s
aura can’t you?

143
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,032
Well on a case by case basis.

144
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,365
If it is a card doing it,

145
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,794
I may be able to do something about it

146
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,465
Kero-chan, please!

147
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,404
I guess there is no choice
shall I go with you

148
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:37,036
Maki-san,

149
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:39,712
the tea you served early was very delicious

150
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:43,077
I would very much like to learn how to make it.

151
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,719
Can you teach me how to make it?

152
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,616
Yes sure!

153
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,489
OK, she managed to convince her.

154
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,054
Let’s look for the card Kero-chan.

155
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,454
The roundish panda is suspicious

156
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,291
So we need to find the panda

157
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,902
It was right here earlier today.

158
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,436
Aren’t you a cute one?

159
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:07,744
What are you doing?

160
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:14,845
The key is letting water you have boiled
once cool a little bit

161
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,312
I see.

162
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,821
Well I have to get back to the store

163
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,618
Maki-san

164
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:24,158
Sri Lanka used to be called Seilong,

165
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,291
so the stuff that is picked
there is called Seilong tea

166
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,425
Seilong was the name of a country?

167
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,866
I had no idea

168
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:37,803
And also milk-tea can have the result
of settling the stomach

169
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,373
If you aren’t quiet she’ll find us

170
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:49,947
The aura of a Clow Card

171
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:51,980
Where?

172
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,218
Under here

173
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:58,718
Got ya

174
00:11:59,196 --> 00:11:59,992
No, it ran away.

175
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:00,888
Ran away?

176
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,366
Didn’t it just change over to another doll?

177
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,136
Did you know that

178
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:10,835
video editing

179
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:13,732
doesn’t mean cutting and splicing the tape.

180
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:17,238
Just dubbing the scenes you like,

181
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,505
can be editing.

182
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,577
But when you dub the video quality falls

183
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,853
That’s why you use a good camera with
good tape and a good VCR

184
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,523
Sakura-chan, if you don’t hurry up,

185
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:31,119
I will run out of things to about.

186
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,154
This isn’t it

187
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:34,986
This isn’t it either

188
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:36,597
That’s not it either

189
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,156
It’s not one of those either

190
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,132
No it’s not in those either

191
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,274
The picture in digital video
is the best after all

192
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:49,341
It is convenient that

193
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:50,637
the video software can dub it cleanly.

194
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:54,181
But there is the complex issue
of the artistry of it

195
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,409
Oh Yeah now that

196
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,585
I mention it recently camera batteries
have been able to last a long time.

197
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,948
It’s really convenient.

198
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,252
Until just recently,

199
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,827
you had to bring a mountain
of batteries for filming.

200
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,589
They were so heavy

201
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,664
I certainly do feel the aura

202
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,795
I wonder if it isn’t here anymore

203
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:15,193
That’s it!

204
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,900
That is the Jump card

205
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,350
At that time you take the inside of the lens

206
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,597
Somebody is in the store

207
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,191
Ah Maki-san!

208
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,568
Wait!

209
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:54,467
Maki-san!

210
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:56,244
Tomoyo-chan take care of Maki-san

211
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,274
I’m going too

212
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:02,350
That’s too bad
I won’t be able to video this time

213
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,066
It’s painful.

214
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,570
Jump Where is it?

215
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:29,434
Above!

216
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:37,880
It doesn’t hurt at all

217
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:40,953
It plans on running away

218
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:49,327
Wait right there!

219
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,319
Key that hides the power of darkness

220
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,948
Show your true form before me.

221
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:19,990
Under the contract I Sakura command,

222
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,727
Release!

223
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:28,661
Fly

224
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,305
Over there

225
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,719
Return to your rightful form

226
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,592
Ah hey

227
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,044
Tree luxuriating in green come to my aid.

228
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:13,776
Help me!

229
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,614
Wood

230
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,428
I caught it

231
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,372
That was horrible

232
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,241
What?

233
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,716
Did you already seal the card?

234
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,883
Tomoyo-chan I am just about to begin…

235
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,488
So I made it in time

236
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:00,527
What about Maki-san?

237
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:01,728
She is fine

238
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,265
What is that?

239
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:12,799
What is going on?

240
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,174
I don’t know

241
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:33,220
I wonder if it plans on chasing us

242
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,932
Here it comes

243
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,535
Let’s run away separately

244
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:48,572
Yeah

245
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:49,410
OK

246
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:50,609
Here goes

247
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,414
Our step size is too different

248
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,711
Sakura!

249
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:38,290
Strange?

250
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:56,070
Alright, seal it while you have the chance

251
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,639
OK!

252
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,713
Return to your rightful form,

253
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,183
Clow Card!

254
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:20,764
Well done Sakura

255
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:22,535
It couldn’t hold out until the end

256
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,675
This one is aggressive but pretty stupid

257
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:29,111
Really?

258
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,281
Now is the hard part

259
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,108
Now?

260
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:38,820
Now we have to return
the stuffed animals to the shop

261
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:53,530
How cute

262
00:19:58,074 --> 00:19:59,598
As a friend for the panda?

263
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:02,501
Yes so he doesn’t get lonely

264
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:05,073
But it is a mysterious panda

265
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,312
I was surprised when it came home

266
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:11,011
I was so surprised I fainted

267
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,886
Maki-san has cheered up

268
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,116
The store is doing well too

269
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:22,356
You even learned
how to make the delicious tea

270
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,164
Kero-chan,

271
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:29,060
you said there were no silly cards
that would collect stuffed animals

272
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:33,071
Well the Jump itself was
like a stuffed animal

273
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,840
Wasn’t it just looking for friends?

274
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:43,407
Sakura-chan, are you OK?

275
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,181
I’m sorry

276
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,048
It seems it isn’t just Jump causing trouble

277
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,883
for Maki-san
