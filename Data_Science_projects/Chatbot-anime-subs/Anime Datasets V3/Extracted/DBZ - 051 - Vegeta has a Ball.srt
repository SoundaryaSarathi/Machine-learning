00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,267
Oh, is that so? So that's
what happened, huh?

2
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:27,107
Mm-hmm. I really thought
we were done for.

3
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,528
You should eat something. It may not be
that good, but feel free to help yourself.

4
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:45,792
What was that?

5
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:54,139
You're complaining about the food
that I made, after all you've eaten!?

6
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,206
Eh!?

7
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,876
N- no, I- I would never-!

8
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:00,811
I meant that it may not be that good,
but it's still delicious.

9
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:13,825
I don't blame him. Just about everyone
from his village has been killed, right?

10
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:17,829
Oh, right. This isn't the
right time for a meal, huh?

11
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:23,268
We don't eat things like this.
We just need to drink water.

12
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,937
No way! There were
fields at your village

13
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:30,508
where you were raising vegetables
or something, weren't there?

14
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,178
Those were Ajissa seedlings.

15
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,513
Ajissa seedlings?

16
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:39,184
Yes. Long ago, before
the abnormal weather occurred,

17
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:45,123
Namek was said to be a beautiful
world, rich with Ajissa trees.

18
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,120
However...

19
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:56,459
The Ajissa forests and most
of the Namekians died out.

20
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,147
So now, we're trying to make Namek
beautiful again by growing more Ajissa trees.

21
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,812
And after we'd finally raised
some Ajissa seedlings...

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,134
We got him!

23
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:48,279
Why, you-!

24
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:19,143
Say, what is your name?

25
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:24,581
Dende. Uh, who exactly are you people?

26
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,086
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, is that-?

27
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,837
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
Is someone else coming?

28
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:48,931
N- no, it's not that.

29
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,780
The <i>Ki</i> are dropping,
one after another.

30
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,287
T- the Namekians are
being killed once again.

31
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:11,129
T- the one killing them is someone
we know very well! It's Vegeta!

32
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,798
He's attacking a different village!

33
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:17,468
W- what a horrible
bunch these guys are!

34
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:22,140
V- Vegeta has acquired the technique
for sensing <i>Ki</i>, all right.

35
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,408
This is going to be trouble.

36
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:26,811
Now we'll have to be wary about
moving around until Goku gets here.

37
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:32,817
I'm not sure whether Vegeta and that Freeza
bastard are on the same side or not,

38
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,920
but if either one of them gains
eternal life with the Dragon Balls,

39
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,157
it will be the end of the world.

40
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:43,595
If we are able to find and hide
even one of the Dragon Balls,

41
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:46,831
they won't be able
to get all seven together.

42
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,834
W- we can't!
If we were to do that,

43
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:54,172
then they would keep searching until
they had killed all of the Namekians!

44
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,436
O- oh, no...

45
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:03,848
It's appalling, no matter
which way it turns out.

46
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:10,788
A- and even once Goku gets here,
there's no guarantee that he can beat them.

47
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,449
Damn!

48
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:20,620
If only I had finished
Vegeta off back then!

49
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:25,136
Please tell me about yourselves.

50
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:30,808
W- where have you come from?
How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

51
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:34,801
P- please save everyone
else on the planet!

52
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:51,485
W- why, you-!
How could you do this!?

53
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:59,835
No matter what happens, you have no intention
of handing over the Dragon Ball, do you?

54
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:05,002
I- I'm not about to hand it
over to the likes of you!

55
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,180
You are one interminably
stubborn old geezer.

56
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,173
Well, fine, suit yourself.
I'll look for it myself.

57
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,623
Wait!

58
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,303
You are getting on my nerves.

59
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:49,481
Here I thought it was going to be hidden,
but there it is, on regal display.

60
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,822
Now then, for this thing...

61
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,846
If I submerge the Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

62
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm the only one who knows about it.

63
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,522
Freeza and his men have
five of the Dragon Balls.

64
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,787
I guess I'll search for the last one.

65
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,891
Dodoria is taking far
too much time, isn't he?

66
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,227
Could he still be chasing
after those odd pipsqueaks?

67
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:08,833
Never mind him. If that fool cannot
catch those kids, then let him be.

68
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,837
More importantly, go and search
for the remaining two Dragon Balls.

69
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,505
Yes, sir, understood.

70
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:18,843
If we search the remaining villages,
they are sure to have the Dragon Balls.

71
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:22,847
With the two of us searching, we should
be able to find a village, at least.

72
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,786
Well, I will take these five Dragon Balls
and wait for you at the spaceship.

73
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:32,523
I am counting on you.

74
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:36,527
With just two more of them, I will be able
to have my wish granted, after all.

75
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,188
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:47,538
You search over there. If you find a village,
do nothing, and come inform me.

77
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:51,542
If there are any strong Namekians there,
they would probably be too much for you.

78
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,877
Yes, sir.

79
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:56,214
For now, we will meet back
at the spaceship in three hours.

80
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:57,647
Yes, sir!

81
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:09,160
It is possible that Vegeta may have
already found the remaining pair.

82
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,165
And if he has, he ought to be
coming for our Dragon Balls.

83
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:18,836
As such, he may be saving me
the trouble of searching for them.

84
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:22,673
When Vegeta comes to get ours, I will
kill him, and take his two from him.

85
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:25,335
Then I will have all seven of them.

86
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,777
Is that how I am to be
endowed with eternal life?

87
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:42,785
Now then, to wait
leisurely at the spaceship.

88
00:11:54,872 --> 00:12:00,211
Right, this Kami-<i>sama</i> person was a
Namekian who had made his way to Earth.

89
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:07,151
We want to use the Dragon Balls here
to bring our dead friends back to life.

90
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,153
If things go right
when our wish is granted,

91
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:11,489
the Dragon Balls on Earth
will be revived as well.

92
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:19,163
S- so that's why you're here, is it?
I've finally unraveled the mystery about you.

93
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:23,100
I'm begging you,
please come with me!

94
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,933
I will show you where
the Grand Elder is!

95
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,840
Grand Elder?

96
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,842
Who is this Grand Elder?

97
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:35,513
The one who gave birth
to all of us here on Namek.

98
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:39,183
The only one who survived
the abnormal weather long ago,

99
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:43,120
and once again
brought life to Namek.

100
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,191
I am Grand Elder's 108th child.

101
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:52,530
The only one? How do you
guys have children?

102
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:57,535
How, you ask? We spawn
eggs out though our mouths.

103
00:12:57,535 --> 00:13:00,805
O- oh, yeah?
T- that's unusual, huh?

104
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:04,542
Then, this Grand Elder
person is a woman, right?

105
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:08,638
Woman? What's a woman?

106
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:16,487
W- what's a woman? There are two kinds
of Namekians, right? Male and female.

107
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:21,826
Let's see... f- for example,
you have a father and a mother...

108
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:27,164
Huh? Two kinds?
W- well, um...

109
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:31,502
Did you hear that? They don't have male
and female. What a dull planet, huh?

110
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:35,268
Thank goodness I'm not a Namekian.

111
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:42,179
N- never mind that, tell me why
we're going to this Grand Elder.

112
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,185
T- the ones who attacked our village
already had four Dragon Balls.

113
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:50,287
A- and you just said

114
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,122
there were a lot of people being
killed in that direction, right?

115
00:13:57,194 --> 00:14:00,531
Y- yeah, probably by
someone named Vegeta.

116
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,868
T- there isn't a single <i>Ki</i> left anymore.

117
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,470
They were probably all wiped out.

118
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,809
If that's the case, then there are
hardly any Namekians left on this world.

119
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,815
I see. Assuming that Vegeta found the
Dragon Ball from the village he attacked,

120
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,817
then there's only one left.

121
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,821
By any chance, does the Grand
Elder have that last Dragon Ball?

122
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,823
Y- yes.

123
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,491
Oh, no!

124
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,261
Those Freeza guys may
have lost their Scouters,

125
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,497
but Vegeta has gained
the ability to sense <i>Ki</i>.

126
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,168
If he searches for <i>Ki</i>, he'll arrive
at the Grand Elder's place before long,

127
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,504
and he'll take the seventh
Dragon Ball from him!

128
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,842
T- then we have to hurry and go tell
the Grand Elder about this!

129
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,179
Please! Please!

130
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,948
Whether it's Freeza or Vegeta,

131
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:54,852
if either one of them is given
eternal life, it will be terrible!

132
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,190
A- all right, let's hurry.
Show me the way.

133
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,858
Right.

134
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,527
I'll go with Dende
to meet the Grand Elder.

135
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,797
Gohan and Bulma-<i>san</i>,
you wait here for us.

136
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,467
It won't do any good
for all of us to go, right?

137
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,630
U- understood. Be careful.

138
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:19,143
Remember, you be careful, too!

139
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:21,407
Right!

140
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:36,494
<i>Vegeta seems to be even</i>
<i>stronger than he was before,</i>

141
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:40,498
<i>and I sensed an even more</i>
<i>incredible Ki from that Freeza guy.</i>

142
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,833
<i>l don't know what kind</i>
<i>of training Goku is doing,</i>

143
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,503
<i>but this time, even he</i>
<i>might not be up to the task.</i>

144
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:49,173
<i>ln any case, we'll get the one</i>
<i>Dragon Ball the Grand Elder has,</i>

145
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:53,511
<i>and then just hide for five</i>
<i>and a half days until Goku arrives.</i>

146
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:56,847
<i>After that, all we can do is wait</i>
<i>for Goku to perform a miracle.</i>

147
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,851
<i>Ah, if l'm starting to hope</i>
<i>for miracles, then we've had it.</i>

148
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:04,947
<i>Geez, l've never had a single</i>
<i>woman in my life, either.</i>

149
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,501
All right... terrific... I'm pretty
used to this 20-times gravity now...

150
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,171
Okay, maybe I should try 30-times now.

151
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:59,609
<i>Goku! Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Goku! Huh?</i>

152
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:03,847
Oh! That voice!
Is that you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!?

153
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,784
<i>Oh, indeed it is Kaio.</i>

154
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:13,791
<i>By any chance, is that outer space you're</i>
<i>in now? What are you doing in space?</i>

155
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,127
Oh, I get it.
Planet Namek, right?

156
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:20,130
It would be nice if you could
find their Dragon Balls, huh?

157
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,468
What's with you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!?
Don't you know anything?

158
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:27,805
There's something terrible
happening on Planet Namek.

159
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:32,309
Something terrible?
Well, I'll ask about that later.

160
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:35,813
As it happens, I've had
some visitors come by here.

161
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:39,149
<i>Visitors? What about them?</i>

162
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,818
<i>lt's amazing.</i>

163
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:48,826
<i>These visitors cleared the Serpentine Road</i>
<i>and arrived in far less time than you did.</i>

164
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:50,828
What's more, there are four of them.

165
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,162
<i>Huh?</i>

166
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,497
Four of them?

167
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:57,501
<i>That's right. You know</i>
<i>these four quite well.</i>

168
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,833
<i>Y</i>- <i>you don't mean-?</i>

169
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:11,680
They all want even tougher training
than what you went through.

170
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:16,120
T- that's awesome!

171
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,125
You mean that each of them has arrived
there together at your place, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

172
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,794
Can I talk to Goku?

173
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:27,286
Place your hand on
my shoulder and speak.

174
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,467
Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

175
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,136
<i>Yamucha!</i>

176
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:34,405
We met the dead Kami-<i>sama</i>
here on the Other Side,

177
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,474
and he told us about this place.

178
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:41,779
Hey, we hear that you're going
off to Piccolo's homeworld

179
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:45,149
in search of the Dragon
Balls there for us.

180
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,811
In order to bring us back to life.

181
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,156
He said there were four of you, right?
Yamucha and Tenshinhan...

182
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,158
By any chance, is Piccolo there, too?

183
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:56,493
<i>Yeah, Piccolo is here.</i>

184
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:02,833
Hmph. My pride won't allow for only
<i>you</i> getting stronger, after all.

185
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,502
<i>ls the last one Kami-sama?</i>

186
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,171
No, it's not.

187
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,841
Kami-<i>sama</i> stayed in the Next World.
It's Chaozu, if you can believe that.

188
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:16,180
<i>Chaozu!? Chaozu got blown</i>
<i>to pieces. ls he still okay?</i>

189
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,851
Yeah, Kami-<i>sama</i> apparently regenerated
his body, especially for him.

190
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:25,948
<i>Wow, that's amazing!</i>
<i>Good for you, Chaozu!</i>

191
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,860
Awesome!

192
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,198
That's awesome! With everyone alongside,
my courage is a hundred times greater!

193
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:40,204
<i>What's this? Familiar faces</i>
<i>gathered together under Kaio-sama.</i>

194
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:46,439
<i>However, Goku is still unaware of the</i>
<i>atrocities taking place on Planet Namek.</i>
