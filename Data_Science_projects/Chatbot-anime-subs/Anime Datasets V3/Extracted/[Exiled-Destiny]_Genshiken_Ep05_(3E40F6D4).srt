<i>Genshiken</i>

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,110
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

3
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,910
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

5
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,850
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

6
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,620
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,200
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

9
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,300
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

10
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,740
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

11
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,980
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

12
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,330
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

13
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>At this tempo!</i>

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,840
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,330
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

16
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,390

<i>Episode 5, The Boundary Between Rejection
and Acceptance Seen in Autonomous Behavior</i>

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,630
This sure is sudden.

19
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,170
And it's this semester.

20
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,210
At least wait until the
end of the school year.

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,840
You said it.

it has been determined that...</i>

24
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,610

dissolved by the end of December.</i>

26
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,700
S-She's all smiles.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,390
That's a Kohsaka-esque smile.

28
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,500
You really look happy...

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,200
You can speak, you know...

30
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,530
Oh well, what can you do when the
whole club's getting closed down?

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,240
Right?

32
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,910
That's true.

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,440
Yeah!

34
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,710
What do we do?

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,750
What's that supposed...

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,590
I guess it's legit, then?

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,150
Um...

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,520
Isn't that what it means
now that they've decided?

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,690
But I only just recently joined...

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
I guess you should've joined the
Manga Club or whatever after all.

41
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,570
Well, not that I'd really know.

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
How can you say that, Saki?

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,510
Because I'm not a member here!

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,780
Yet you're here all the time.

45
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,720
It ain't because I wanna be.

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,320
Even if Genshiken is dissolved, it
won't solve your otaku problems...

47
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,660
Nothing.

48
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,420
I wonder why we got chosen.

49
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,630
Aren't there other clubs that
don't appear to be active?

50
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,440
Being chosen before Kingaiken does
certainly seem a little unreasonable.

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,700
K-Kingai?

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,610
The Society for the Study of the
Present-day Food Service Industry.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,510
What's that?

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,640
They mainly try the food
at family restaurants.

55
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,440
That's it?

56
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,350
That's it.

57
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,980
And you're below them...

58
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,250
All righty.

59
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,990
Well, it is true that we
hardly ever "do" anything.

60
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,220
I guess recycling 90% of what we
used...

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,960
...at the school festival
was a bad idea after all...

62
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,230
Yeah, well...

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,900
Hmph, you guys.

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,500
You don't have the guts to
protest the council, do you?

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,410
It looks like you're just going to give in.

66
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,910
Hi there!

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,540
So Genshiken's going under?

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,480
I had a feeling it would
happen eventually, you know.

69
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,980
I mean, it doesn't serve any purpose.

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,790
Kohsaka, once this place is
gone come to the Manga Club.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,330
Our arms are open!

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,500
Ohno, cosplay's the "in" thing.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,540
We could really use you.

74
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,330
Right...

75
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,030
Sexual harassment.

76
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,370
We don't need Madarame and crew.

77
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,880
Is that so.

78
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,340
I don't like him.

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,080
Nobody likes him.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,690
So that's it?

81
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
I can't have Kohsaka
joining that guy's club.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,030
But once this one is gone...

83
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,370
You'll join them?

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,570
It's not like you don't do anything.

85
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,310
What about that cosplay
photo session at the festival?

86
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,450
But later on, the club council got mad
at us for not arranging that beforehand.

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,450
Yeah.

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,750
They were mad, all right.

89
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,080
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,560
You guys all piss me off.

91
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,760
So, what's it going to be?

92
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,860
Come again?

93
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,370
Are you going to let
one scrap of paper and...

94
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,740
...that abdominal-breathing aardvark
dude be the end of Genshiken?

95
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,770
Well?

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,380
Hold on, didn't you want
to see Genshiken fail?

97
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,490
Oh yeah, I sure do.

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,820
But, I can't stand to
see it happen like this!

99
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,000
Or to see you guys not
even get mad about it...

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,670
Ohno.

101
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes?

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,680
Let's go.

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,010
W-Where?

104
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,380
The council office! Come on, stand up.

105
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,950
But, right now?

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,850
Yes!

107
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,010
Why me?

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,850
Sex appeal!

109
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,490
Wh-What do you think?

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,460
I think she's totally lost it.

111
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,090
L-Looks like trouble.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,390
What do we do?

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't know if it matters anymore...

114
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,170
<i>Club Student Council Of fice</i>

115
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,070
Ahh, I knew you'd come...

116
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,080
Stick out your chest.

117
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,510
I can't.

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,650
Maybe that notice was a little abrupt...

119
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,740
I'd like you to reconsider.

120
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Chairman, I'll handle this.

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,420
I'm Vice-chairman Kitagawa.

122
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,800
Let me explain the situation.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,020
One reason is that we are at
capacity for club office space.

124
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,870
The applications for new
clubs are listed here...

125
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,600
Not every one of them is legitimate...

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,800
...but several have submitted
detailed written activity programs.

127
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,140
Still, announcing the closure of
clubs without any previous notice is...

128
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,510
Wait.

129
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,540
There's one more important thing.

130
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,810
The number of clubs that hardly
do anything is considerable.

131
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,450
That itself wouldn't be so bad...

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,860
...but some abuse their office
simply as a gathering spot.

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,660
They chat, they eat, they smoke, they
drink, they nap, they store things.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,660
These uses are unacceptable and they
are extremely widespread!

135
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,610
Why do we have to provide precious
office space to scum like that?

136
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,610
I don't understand it!

137
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,270
Uh, Kitagawa...

138
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,480
Furthermore, according to
something I overheard today...

139
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,980
...there are some who say they plan
to ignore our warning and remain!

140
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,580
Scum like that will be forced to vacate
with the help of the athletic clubs!

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,950
Their property will be
divvied up between other clubs!

142
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,160
K-Kitagawa...

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,090
Hold on.

144
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,260
Genshiken has been investigated.

145
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,570
All they do in their
office is play video games!

146
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,000
At the school festival
they held what became a...

147
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,010
...cosplay photo shoot
without authorization!

148
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,780
The only things of enough value to
warrant a precious club office are here!

149
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,510
Those game systems are older ones,
and they have a lot of research value.

150
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,740
Huh?

151
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,810
It may look like they're
just playing, but games and anime...

152
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,290
...are the most essential elements of
modern visual culture.

153
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,690
Watching over its development and
transformation is the main activity of...

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,930
...Genshiken, namely the Society for
the Study of Modern Visual Culture.

155
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,830
And regarding the
school festival cosplay,

156
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,960
it was certainly wrong to
not make advance arrangements...

157
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,340
...but wasn't it also evidence
of the club's activity?

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,140
That alone is enough to keep it out
of the doomed inactive club category.

159
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,150
Any way you look at it, I'd
say that someone is using...

160
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,780
...some nasty screwed up
interpretation...

161
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,720
...to crush Genshiken
through treachery and malice.

162
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,890
What'd you just say, you otaku?

163
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,580
I'm not an otaku!

164
00:09:59,690 --> 00:09:59,890
Kitagawa, calm down.

165
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,190
<i>Saki...
Kitagawa, calm down.</i>

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,000
Saki did the best she could.

167
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,660
So, how'd it go?

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,360
Isn't that obvious?

169
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,370
She seems even more
unapproachable than usual.

170
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,770
S-She's dangerous right now.

171
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,180
<i>Genshiken</i>

172
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,350
That dick, Kitagawa...

173
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,640
"Dick"...

174
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,150
She's a woman...

175
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,920
A dried up sexless wench like
her is the same as a dick.

176
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,860
She's the type who'd strap on a
helmet...

177
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,230
...and plunge right into
the riot police if she could.

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,760
Ouch...

179
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,730
Calling people otaku...

180
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,370
Hey, can anyone figure
out what her weakness is?

181
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,380
Like with a wiretap, or hidden camera.

182
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,040
What makes you ask?

183
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,880
Is that really the light you see us in?

184
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,080
But you're all otaku.

185
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,680
None of us are techie otaku!

186
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,050
Useless...

187
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,190
Ow...

188
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,690
Besides, isn't this
a personal grudge now?

189
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,190
That's because you guys weren't there.

190
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,390
We can't be careless
about things about this.

191
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,930
Kitagawa's serious.

192
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,260
You're really gonna be
crushed and driven out of here.

193
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,930
You okay with that?

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,270
We aren't...

195
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,810
Dammit!

196
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,030
<i>Suioh University</i>

197
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,440
<i>Takana Soba
discontinued</i>

198
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,340
Excuse me, why isn't
there any more takana soba?

199
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,150
I don't really know, but I
guess not many people bought it?

200
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,090
If that's the case, I've
never seen anyone buy or eat...

201
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,150
...any of the "mackerel bean sprout
tendon" or the "taro gyoza" out of...

202
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,890
You know, you should ask
someone above me about it.

203
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,500
They don't have the
one you like anymore.

204
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,780
It's not a big deal...

205
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,320
Oh, I always just get this.

206
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,820
Hey, about those new clubs
that want to start up...

207
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,150
You're here alone?

208
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,320
And early, too.

209
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,030
I was wondering if there's a
good way to get at Kitagawa.

210
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,130
You're headstrong too, Saki.

211
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,830
I have something you may find useful.

212
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,110
Mr. Chairman, when did you get here?

213
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,410
Just now.

214
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,170
You know something I can use?

215
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,140
Yeah, listen to this.

216
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,510
The Variety Discussion Group?

217
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,050
Maybe it's a chat club?

218
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,750
That's absurd! It must be a joke!

219
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,190
Hi.

220
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
Hello.

221
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,130
What do you want?

222
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,830
Well...

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,230
Kitagawa, let's talk outside real quick.

224
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,330
Huh?

225
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,370
What gives?

226
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,540
Oh there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,170
Watch your step.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,870
I don't trust this.

229
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,220
If Genshiken goes away, the first
problem we'll be up against is...

230
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,860
...losing a room where we can gather.

231
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,960
Are you guys cold?

232
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,200
Let's go to the cafeteria,
it's warm in there.

233
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,970
What's this about?

234
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,170
Winter sure has arrived.

235
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,980
Isn't winter great?

236
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,840
Huh?

237
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,480
I mean, summer sucks
because it's so hot!

238
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,010
I think summer and winter
both have their good points.

239
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,460
Yeah, but y'know, when it's hot and
muggy it makes you feel all itchy.

240
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,460
Like on your head and... feet!

241
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,440
How did you know?

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,980
W-Whatever do you mean?

243
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,440
Oh, it's not hot...

244
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,590
You'd even threaten me to make
sure your club can keep going?

245
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,260
All I'm trying to say
is that summer sucks.

246
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,890
Just tell me how you know.

247
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,200
Did you hear it from someone?

248
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,630
I saw it with my own eyes.

249
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,140
It must have been about a month ago.

250
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,100
A month ago?

251
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,610
The council office door
was slightly ajar...

252
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,250
You were putting on
athlete's foot medicine...

253
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
I had a feeling I was being watched...

254
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,040
Now, don't you have something to say?

255
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,910
Or rather, aren't we the ones
with the bargaining chip now?

256
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,680
Pardon me.

257
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,350
Is anything wrong, Kitagawa?

258
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,490
No, it's nothing...

259
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,400
But...

260
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,030
You can go back in the office...

261
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Hey, Mr. Chairman.

262
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,540
What do you think about all this?

263
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,310
The way that notice went out
about the clubs closing down.

264
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,680
<i>Don't you think it's mean, not
giving them a foot to stand on?</i>

265
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,660
Hmm, it might have been better to
go through a probation period first.

266
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,980
Wouldn't it?

267
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,150
That's what Kitagawa
and I were discussing.

268
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,390
It looks like she understands too.

269
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,560
So, Mr. Chairman, let's just
pretend that never happened.

270
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,190
Just a moment.

271
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,340
Kitagawa, are you sure nothing's
wrong?

272
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,240
Nothing, really...

273
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,710
Is it the athlete's foot?

274
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,060
How did you know?

275
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,250
Well... sorry, I've seen it.

276
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,560
The medicine was
sticking out of your bag.

277
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,430
It looks like he knew...

278
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,270
Wait, no, that doesn't matter!

279
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,500
Would you like to go out with me?

280
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,510
All of a sudden...

281
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,650
Seriously?

282
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,620
I'm serious, I've been
waiting for the chance.

283
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,160
But you might catch
it from a floor mat...

284
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,090
Fine! Infect me!

285
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,440
Thank goodness.

286
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,780
As long as we submit a written activity
program, we can be re-evaluated.

287
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,850
At this rate, I'm sure
Genshiken won't be shut down.

288
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,310
I guess.

289
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,720
But in a way it feels like
this worked out too well.

290
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,450
Huh?

291
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,330
Did our chairman
already know about them?

292
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,760
Hey!

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,140
Listen, Kasukabe.

294
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,330
You're saying it here?

295
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,510
It's not like we're cool
with Genshiken shutting down.

296
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,150
So, well, we can at least help you.

297
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,520
Let us!

298
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,850
You guys are a riot, worse than useless!

299
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,690
We've already taken care of it.

300
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,130
Uh, you have?

301
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,530
Hello, porcini!

302
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,160
Tokino Akiyama spotted! Shall I attack?

303
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,400
Wait, a fool like you would
never hit her at that range.

304
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,100
Encircle her, then...

305
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,140
Ah, Mr. Chairman.

306
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,370
It went well.

307
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,350
The scenario turned out
a little different though.

308
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,540
I see.

309
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,910
Now the chairman and
vice-chairman are an item.

310
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,280
Really...

311
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,550
Did you know about them?

312
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,520
No, I didn't...

313
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,260
But how about officially
joining Genshiken, Kasukabe?

314
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,490
No.

315
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,830
That was prompt.

316
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,730
Mr. Chairman, there's no way
she'll ever join, is there?

317
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,870
Well, I guess you needn't
be forced into it...

318
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,770
You've used this
office so much as it is.

319
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,780
You're practically a member anyway.

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,750
What do you mean?

321
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,160
Kohsa...

322
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,890
Mr. Chairman, the student
council thing was weird enough...

323
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,490
...now why do you know about that?

324
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,290
Is it really a coincidence?

325
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,600
Yeah, you and Kohsaka
are also a coin...

326
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,800
That's a lie!

327
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,770
I made sure I was very careful.

328
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,470
Don't tell me you use spy cameras?

329
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,210
I would never do such a thing.

330
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,510
Something like that would be really
bad...

331
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,780
A ton of trouble for me!

332
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,880
What a bind...

333
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,920
What're you doing?

334
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,990
If I were that kind of person...

335
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,260
...there would already be
a large number of people...

336
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,800
...irrespective of gender who
could no longer attend this school.

337
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,330
But there are no such people, are there?

338
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll join.

339
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,000
What?

340
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,230
What's wrong, Kasukabe?

341
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,400
S-Seriously?

342
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,670
T-Then are you going to cosplay?

343
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,750
I doubt it.

344
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,910
I'm thrilled to be "one of us."

345
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,810
That being said...

346
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,510
...for now it would be best not to
use the 1st or 2nd floor bathrooms...

347
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,520
That was a joke...

348
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,570
Frigging athlete's foot couple!

349
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,010
Thanks to you I had to...

350
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,410
It sure was a surprise when
you joined Genshiken, though.

351
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,020
It surprised me too.

352
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,390
Otaple.

353
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,490
Otaple?

354
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,060
I'd say it probably
means "otaku couple."

355
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,700
What'd you say?

356
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:11,880
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

357
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:21,360
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

358
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:30,630
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

359
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:40,380
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

360
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:50,760
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

361
00:22:51,830 --> 00:23:02,110
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

362
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:11,710
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

363
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:21,690
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

364
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:30,570
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

365
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,140
<i>Viva! Model Train</i>

366
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>Viva! Mushrooms</i>

367
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,110
<i>I say we do this.
Viva! Mushrooms</i>

368
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,910
Thirty minutes remain.

369
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,450
We're out of time.

370
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,710
Chihiro, you're into computers.

371
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,750
I'll bet you know what kind of
homepage draws in the most people.

372
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,850
Well, yes I do.

373
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,690
Then tell us!

374
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,460
We can make a homepage
based on that theory!

375
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,860
But I don't think you'll...

376
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,960
This is no time to argue about it!

377
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,400
What? I'm not doing that!

378
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,700
Chihiro! What's gotten into you?

379
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,970
That's why I didn't want to tell you...

380
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,070
Fifteen minutes remain.

381
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,140
We've got no choice.

382
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,110
Huh?

383
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,410
Their site's lame-o!

384
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,420
We're about to demolish them!

385
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,590
WTF!

386
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,200
One minute remains!

387
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,580
What's the matter?

388
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,450
When you cosplayed for the school
festival, where'd you get changed?

389
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,580
In here...

390
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,950
What is it?

391
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,630
Hey, what's wrong?

392
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,490
Did you see Kujiun yesterday?

393
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah, I saw it. It was crazy.

394
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,160
"The Federation's art
department is a monster!"

395
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,100
Oh, but I saw on the homepage that the
art director is setting up a new studio.

396
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,970
What? "I'll become
the executive king"?

397
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
And so, it seems there's a lot
of trouble brewing there now.

398
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,910
"He stole something quite
precious. Your employees."

399
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,280
Hey, all those otaku
quotes are really stupid.

400
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,280
"Once again I have
said a worthless thing."

401
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,250
Knock it off!

402
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,550
Coming! I'm coming!
