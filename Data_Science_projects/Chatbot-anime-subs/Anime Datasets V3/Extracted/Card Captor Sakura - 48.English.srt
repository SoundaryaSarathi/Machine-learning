1
00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:01,631
The rain that has been falling

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,005
in Tomoeda since last night.

3
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,373
…is not going to stop any time soon…

4
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,842
But why is this persistent rain

5
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:12,512
only falling in Tomoeda?

6
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,458
O Key which hides
the forces of darkness,

7
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,561
reveal thy true
form before me.

8
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:35,700
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

9
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:39,103
Release!

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,484
Why won’t it transform
into the wand?

11
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,792
Oh, you got up on time, monster.

12
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,857
You’re not fighting back.

13
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:17,146
Invite the snow-rabbit over tomorrow.
(Yukito = snow-rabbit)

14
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:18,781
Yukito?

15
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:20,948
Why Tsukishiro?

16
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,148
Yue is the one I need to talk to.

17
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:31,058
Um, do you know

18
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:33,294
if Yukito is coming over today?

19
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,690
Yuki? He didn’t mention.

20
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,426
Um, Can you…

21
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,031
um… um…

22
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,867
He’ll probably come

23
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:46,348
if you make something to eat.

24
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:47,331
Ok!

25
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:49,274
I’ll do my best at it today!

26
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:51,638
I guess I’ll ask him,

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,581
since it’s such a rare occasion

28
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:54,646
that the monster is cooking.

29
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:55,816
What did you say?!?

30
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,761
[Sakura and the Awakened Star Key]

31
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,501
That aura yesterday…

32
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,774
No, that shouldn’t be…

33
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:25,041
But…

34
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,863
This rain isn’t stopping at all.

35
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,960
They say it’s only falling
in Tomoeda and nowhere else

36
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,268
Maybe this is a
supernatural phenomenon!

37
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:58,488
About supernatural phenomenon… ,

38
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:02,216
The world’s highest mountain
was found in Antarctica,

39
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,852
and they said it’s
all because of penguins!

40
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:05,951
Penguins?

41
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,256
They said they had
some sort of strange powers,

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,250
and they could even fly!

43
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:11,888
Maybe they’re aliens!

44
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,498
And by the way,
they said some American mountaineers…

45
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,399
…even saw giant penguins

46
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,398
flying in the sky!

47
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,135
Bunch of lies again.

48
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,501
This rain is no ordinary rain.

49
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,973
But all the Clow Cards
have been gathered already…

50
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:33,510
How come…

51
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,188
Please have them.

52
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,522
Eriol…

53
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,155
A smile fits best on your face,
Sakura.

54
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:57,102
Thank you.

55
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:07,049
– Good morning!
– Good morning!

56
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,089
Good morning, everyone.

57
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:22,394
– Good morning, Tomoyo!
– Good morning.

58
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:29,997
The situation has upped already.

59
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,840
The Key won’t
transform into the wand?

60
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:42,677
What’s going on…

61
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:46,882
And besides,
this rain…

62
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,662
All the Clow Cards have been captured.

63
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:56,166
I wonder why strange things
are happening again?

64
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,665
Maybe someone

65
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:00,229
who has power made it happen?

66
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,300
But I can’t sense any.

67
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:04,632
Maybe we just don’t notice it.

68
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:07,409
Maybe it is someone

69
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,713
even more powerful than us.

70
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:14,445
Someone even more
powerful than us…

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,922
Sakura…

72
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:25,157
Really?

73
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,764
Why is she with that brat!

74
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,400
Touya, you have really good eyes.

75
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,005
Yuki…

76
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:42,808
I…

77
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:45,181
There’s something
I gotta tell you.

78
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,348
– What’s it?
– I…

79
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:52,022
– About you, I… 
– Touya!!

80
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,350
The teacher said
the meeting is starting,

81
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,024
so hurry and bring the printout.

82
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:00,629
Got it.

83
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,562
Yuki, stack yours up here.

84
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:04,794
It is heavy.

85
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,033
I can carry them myself.

86
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:08,965
Then…

87
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,836
– Akizuki… 
– Call me Nakuru.

88
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,003
I can’t move.

89
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,721
Bye!

90
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:40,434
You don’t know, do you?

91
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,377
In that case, it is mine.

92
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,299
I wonder if it’s like Li said,

93
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,805
it’s because of

94
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,109
someone more powerful than us.

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,876
Sakura.

96
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:31,920
Eriol.

97
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,025
Thanks for the flower this morning.

98
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,792
Did your problem get solved?

99
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:46,694
Not yet…

100
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,603
But thanks for the flower,
I felt better.

101
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,165
I’m glad.

102
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:56,405
Did you buy that flower?

103
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,944
No,

104
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,576
it was from my garden.

105
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,417
That’s wonderful.

106
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:05,184
Next time, please come visit.

107
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,322
– Can I?
– Of course!

108
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:10,857
Thanks!

109
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,124
I’m going this way.

110
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:18,597
I’m turning here.

111
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,832
– Then, see you tomorrow.
– See you tomorrow.

112
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,507
Eriol is really nice.

113
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,424
– Thanks for the dinner!
– Thanks.

114
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,157
This was really delicious!
Thanks, Sakura.

115
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,767
Then I’m off to my part-time.

116
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,235
I’ll help clean up.

117
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:00,571
Sorry about that.

118
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:03,407
Thank you very much!

119
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:12,748
It’s still raining…

120
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,960
Because this isn’t just any rain.

121
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,397
Nothing. I’m leaving now.

122
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,598
Take care.

123
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,242
Back to your original form, Yue!

124
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,510
What? You look like you just woke up

125
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,641
and already having a bad mood.

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,180
Having two different personalities
between the true self and the false self.

127
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,748
It is rather troublesome.

128
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:49,368
Umm, Yue, have some tea…

129
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:52,127
This guy doesn’t eat anything…

130
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:58,091
But you love to eat sweet things.

131
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,391
Because Yue and
I have different eating habits,

132
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,767
and that’s simply what I need.

133
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:09,001
More tea.
Okay.

134
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,052
You send her out of the room
on purpose.

135
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:27,946
Because she isn’t aware of what
I’m thinking yet.

136
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,227
What do you think of this rain?

137
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,623
Looks like someone
purposely created this rain.

138
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,399
That’s what I thought.
The question becomes,

139
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:43,030
who is this… someone.

140
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:02,450
In the meantime,

141
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:03,817
the aura I felt yesterday.

142
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,958
I wanted to confirm it was his.

143
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,223
His…

144
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,164
That guy both you and I know so well…

145
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,598
Thanks for waiting.

146
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,507
– What’s the matter!?
– You got me!

147
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,005
You transformerd…

148
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,541
Just get used to it.

149
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:08,753
Kero,

150
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:11,117
I don’t know what’s going to happen.

151
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,557
I’ll leave Tomoyo to you, ok?

152
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,767
Please be careful.

153
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,874
– What??
– No, nothing… Hmmm,

154
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,508
Yukito doesn’t know
about you at all, right?

155
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,483
Right.
Then what about when you are him?

156
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,393
– I remember everything.
– I… I see…

157
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,837
This is making me so nervous…

158
00:13:58,709 --> 00:13:59,698
In the end,

159
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,237
I still can’t imagine that

160
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:03,602
Yukito and Yue are the same person.

161
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:06,973
Yue is handsome,

162
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,884
but Yukito…

163
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:11,748
Sakura!!

164
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,636
Sakura!

165
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:44,984
Yue!

166
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:01,195
O Key which hides
the forces of darkness,

167
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:03,840
reveal thy true form before me.

168
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,840
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

169
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,843
Release!

170
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:16,847
Release!
No! It doesn’t work after all!

171
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:26,927
Able to overpower me and Yue,

172
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,522
that means it must be…

173
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:32,191
Sakura!

174
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:36,902
Kero!

175
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,968
I can’t move!

176
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:42,175
Kero…

177
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:43,774
Sakura! Run!

178
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:55,953
Sakura!

179
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,222
Sakura…

180
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,862
This power…

181
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,830
I can’t breathe…

182
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:28,181
Tomoyo! Kero! Yue!

183
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:33,561
This feels terrible!

184
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,355
At this rate,

185
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:40,128
I’ll… Everyone will…

186
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:43,165
No!

187
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,133
This can’t happen…

188
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:56,717
I can’t… let this happen!

189
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,424
that magical formation…

190
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,394
It’s not the one Crow created.

191
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,166
That wand…

192
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,942
That wand holds a new power.

193
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,084
Neither the Sun or the Moon,

194
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,985
it is your mere power of the Stars.

195
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,617
Power of the Stars…

196
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,857
O Key which hides
the power of the stars,

197
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,563
reveal thy true form before me.

198
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:47,797
I, Sakura,
command thee under contract.

199
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:51,174
Release!

200
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,822
Firey!

201
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:16,031
Why?

202
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,433
The Key transformed into the wand,

203
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,663
but why doesn’t
it work on the card?

204
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:31,037
What should I do…

205
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:34,115
How do I save everyone…?

206
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:37,677
A new wand.

207
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,547
If this is a new wand,

208
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,820
maybe the cards too…

209
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:48,956
Card, I beg of you,

210
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,833
lend me your power!

211
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,266
O Card created by Clow,

212
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:00,604
discard thine
old form and be reborn.

213
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,942
Under the name of Sakura,

214
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:06,781
thy new Mistress

215
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:14,084
Firey!

216
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,509
The Spells changed.

217
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,915
Because the wand holds
the power of the stars,

218
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,653
it wouldn’t work unless I changed
the wording of the spell to “star”.

219
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:20,623
And besides, the card…

220
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:24,788
…has changed as well…

221
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,667
O Key which hides
the power of the stars,

222
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:36,128
reveal thy true form before me.

223
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,397
O Card created by Clow,

224
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,201
discard thine old form
and be reborn.

225
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,375
Under the name of Sakura,

226
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,509
thy new Mistress.

227
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,025
– Sakura.
– Are you okay?

228
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,258
I’m ok, oh, you know, the card…

229
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,492
Sakura.

230
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:11,536
– How is she?
– Is she hurt?

231
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:16,739
Asleep.

232
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:32,089
Is something wrong, Yue?

233
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,162
No.

234
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,069
Not bad.

235
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,572
To be able to create a new card

236
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,812
from a Clow Card

237
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:53,740
That’s impressive.
