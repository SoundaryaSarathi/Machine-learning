1
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,705
Every weekday's tightly packed.

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,310
Madly dashing around
again since morning.

3
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,654
Rat race? Looks like fun.
But surprisingly death-defying.

4
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,820
What I'd like is a slow lifestyle.

5
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:34,128
My wish made on a shootin'star.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,930
But there's no mercy, 100÷3.

7
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,239
Full of things you can't divide.

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,298
Full of things you can't divide.
Genshiken

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:47,472
That's why I've carried
this in my hands...

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,641
...a limitless dream!

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:57,247
I jam-packed the rest with it...

12
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,123
...or at least I've tried to!

13
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:09,327
A modest happiness.
A shared joy!

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:16,308
We're about to etch them now
right into our youth.

15
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,812
So Ionely to just walk on by.

16
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,280
So sad to have this frustration!

17
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,979
Let's take a break from today...

18
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:33,583
...and break into song!

19
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,197
Aren't anime and video game costumes...

20
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,711
...nothing but weird outfits
that embody male desires?

21
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,443
Many of those who create them are women.

22
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:00,145
Then in other words, warped
male and female desires.

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,156
I just can't believe you would wear
such things and pose in front of people.

24
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,557
What you express through
cosplay is the character herself.

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,119
That includes inner essence,
not just outward appearance.

26
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,091
You're quibbling. Photos
don't show inner essence.

27
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,993
Yes, they do!

28
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,172
This is embarrassing. Don't
you think you're exaggerating?

29
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,871
Oh? This is no exaggeration.

30
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,478
I can't understand it.

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,476
There are people who do, though. Right?

32
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,517
Huh?

33
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,781
Last year, Saki did such an admirablejob
portraying the president through cosplay!

34
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,787
Wha?

35
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,721
Please, speak up!

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,190
Don't even go there.

37
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,260
So, in any case, is it
safe to say Ohno's...

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,164
...cosplay shoot will be our main
part of this year's school festival?

39
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:52,494
Sure, why not? It's more
like our only main, though.

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,205
Thus making the festival all hers.

41
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,468
Why don't you give it a try too?

42
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,637
I won't do something that embarrassing!

43
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,814
You want to try it,
in reality, don't you?

44
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,818
Episode 15
Then I'll Undress You!

Society for the Study
of Modern Visual Culture

46
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:17,529
I wish things could be a little
smoother between Ohno and Ogiue.

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,960
Maybe getting Ogiue to cosplay
for the photo shoot's a good idea.

48
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,168
Huh? What for?

49
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,040
I mean, you got more well-rounded
after cosplaying last year.

50
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,301
Huh?

51
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,874
I did?

52
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,012
You no longertalk
about smashing Genshiken.

53
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,281
Whoa!

54
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,290
And here you are, even without Kohsaka.

55
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,854
Huh?

56
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,386
Back on topic...

57
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,293
I'll make any number of outfits
if that's all I have to do...

58
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,859
...but who's going to tell Ogiue?

59
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,504
L-let's leave that to Kasukabe...

60
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,804
No way.

61
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh... okay.

62
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,248
I'm not against making her cosplay.

63
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,077
Well then!

64
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,781
But I don't like you
capitalizing on my success.

65
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,516
Hmm. What now?

66
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,460
First, we should pass
word along to Ohno.

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,663
Th-that's true.

68
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,936
Who'll do that? Tanaka?

69
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,903
Who'll do that? Tanaka?
Huh?

70
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,228
Well, that's fine.

71
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,844
Y-you two're the c-cosplay
team, so n-naturally.

72
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,810
That decides that, then.

73
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,785
Hm?

74
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,747
What's this?

75
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,846
Gulp!

76
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,249
Is this a Kujiun uniform?

77
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,521
Gulp!

78
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,394
But it's small.

79
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,753
Renko?

80
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,066
Is this Rimururu?

81
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,969
EE Sakura, and Ink Seizuyo?

82
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,242
Tanaka?

83
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,879
Not one of those is a
character geared towards me.

84
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:23,585
Well, you see. It's not
like I was hiding them.

85
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,691
They weren't hidden anyway.
I always keep costumes in the closet...

86
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,624
Tanaka...

87
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,365
University Ouran Festival

91
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,855
Let's bring that right a little.

92
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,721
Yes, sir! Whoa!

93
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,621
I got it!

94
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,630
So, what? Ohno's ticked off
and not getting anywhere?

95
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,495
That's how it is.

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,162
Shames me to say it.

97
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,332
Well, don't look at me.

98
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,012
Keep out

99
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,745
Uh, never mind Ogiue cosplaying.

100
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,686
Could you maybe go placate Ohno?

101
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,947
She's in there in the changing room.

102
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,958
You are too pathetic.

103
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,119
Yeah...

104
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,391
So it's me, after all.

105
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,164
Huh, after all or inevitably?

106
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,463
Sorry about this.

107
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,605
I don't mind playing go-between, but
you do understand what the problem is?

108
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,646
Huh?

109
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:59,007
Yeah... That I went ahead
and made Ogiue costumes.

110
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,986
Wrong!

111
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,611
Wrong!
Eh?

112
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,815
That doesn't matter. Even
Ohno wanted to make her do it.

113
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,090
But...

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,094
You're missing the point.

115
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,958
Look, the focus of Ohno's
discontent isn't Ogiue, it's...

116
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,193
Good morning.

117
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,335
Good morning.

118
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,324
Good morning.
M-morning!

119
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,768
H-hi!

120
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,534
Cosplay photo shoot
The Society for the Study of Modern Visual
Culture

121
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,366
Good morning!

122
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,042
Good morning.

123
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,339
Good morning.
Guten morgen!

124
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,912
What is it?

125
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,004
What is it?
Nothing.

126
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,671
Yeah, nothing.

127
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,511
Nothing at all!

128
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,944
I'll give it a shot.

129
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,043
Okay...

130
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,491
I don't really mind him
making outfits for Ogiue.

131
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,396
He's made a bunch for you, too.

132
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,001
That part I mind.

133
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,869
They're right there.

134
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,876
What're they thinking?

135
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:03,576
I mean, it's cosplayer's instinct to
want an appropriate person to wear them.

136
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,446
Instinct, huh?

137
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,084
It's just, he made them
without telling me...

138
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,851
It's not like I'm defending him...

139
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,291
...but maybe he thought you'd
object if he tried asking?

140
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,555
No, I wouldn't.

141
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,596
Really?

142
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,562
Too much arguing would be... you know.

143
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,034
Yeah, well, it's give and take.

144
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,099
Still, though... Take a look at this.

145
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,235
The Ogiue outfits are... this and this.

146
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,712
And then... this and this.

147
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,182
And this.

148
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,714
There's more over there.

149
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,652
Well... I'd get mad too.

150
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,330
You think? This amount! This zeal!

151
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,628
He ran with all these Lolita
characters that I can't do!

152
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,459
Then there's the fact that
he brought them here today.

153
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,768
No, I'm the one who did that.

154
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,098
Oh.

155
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,841
But hey, Tanaka lives
for cosplay in a way.

156
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,073
I say let it go.

157
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,174
I know that.

158
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,510
You do?

159
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,450
So therefore, or maybe nonetheless...

160
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,196
...I thought being a
team meant something else.

161
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,490
Being a team, huh...

162
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:31,699
Definitely. I mean, here
you are, our go-between.

163
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,366
Yeah, well...

164
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,841
Oh, here she comes.

165
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,607
How'd it go?

166
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,583
I'd say she's okay.

167
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,546
But...

168
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,680
It'd be best if you apologized.

169
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,053
All right.

170
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,854
Properly! Don't leave anything out.

171
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,417
You're totally right.

172
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,994
Oh, I'm sorry. We're not ready yet.

173
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,230
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,968
But I think now I kinda
want to get Ogiue to cosplay.

175
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,704
Wha!

176
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,873
There's plenty of outfits...

177
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,676
H-here it comes...

178
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,420
Besides, in my experience, doing it
does bring about a certain breakthrough.

179
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,649
I knew it!

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,688
But right now?

181
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,828
That could never happen.

182
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,661
We'll see about that.

183
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:40,798
Remember how she bought that outfit
just because the clerk recommended it?

184
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,047
Aha, she sure did.

185
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,007
I'm a pro at that job!

186
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,951
I'm not sure whatjob you mean.

187
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,682
I think I get the gist.

188
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,015
Just watch.

189
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,416
Ogi! C'mere a sec.

190
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,482
Huh?

191
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,226
That's right.

192
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,420
What is it?

193
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,862
You'll find out.

194
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,760
Tanaka, Ohno! Can I come in?

195
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,437
Huh? Uh, sure. Feel free.

196
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,202
Might I be intruding?

197
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,633
In what way?

198
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,343
Then, Tanaka, could you excuse us?

199
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,610
What's this about?

200
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,613
Wha?

201
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,083
What's up?

202
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,044
Oh, nothing.

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,379
Now get a move on.

204
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,284
Huh? What?

205
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,986
No way!

206
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,357
Way, indeed.

207
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,622
Another one bites the dust!

208
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,001
Genshiken

209
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,598
Here you go, Ogi!

210
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,665
What are you doing!
I won't wear that. It's creepy!

211
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,702
Nobody said wear it!
We're just seeing how it looks.

212
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,108
Somebody bothered to make it,
so why not see how it'd look on you?

213
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,176
Someone else made it, not you!

214
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,652
Oh, come on.

215
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,882
Look in the mirror.

216
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,815
Hey, pretty nice!

217
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,856
You have big eyes, so this
kind of thing's nice and cute.

218
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:11,897
Wha?

219
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,831
Wha?
So cute!

220
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,797
See, and this.

221
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,769
And this! Wow! Nice!

222
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,738
Or like this. Oh, very nice!

223
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,272
Try letting your hair down.

224
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,272
No thank you.

225
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,439
You don't have to wear
anything. It's just your hair.

226
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,781
But I don't want to.

227
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,113
Doesn't it contrast with these styles?

228
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,688
Just this once, real quick.

229
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,228
Hey, Saki, what's the big idea?

230
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:49,131
Well, I thought maybe
I'd get her to cosplay.

231
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,431
Huh! What for?

232
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,404
Why not? You won't be a
drag and stop me, will you?

233
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,376
Forcing her to do it
is against the rules.

234
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,881
Like how I was forced
to do it last year!

235
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,243
Very nice! Let's see.

236
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,584
Wow...

237
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,225
Y'know...

238
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,296
...it really works.

239
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,266
Well, I'll admit that much.

240
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,235
They're looking at me!

241
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,766
So there you have it!

242
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:31,707
Huh?

243
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,445
Thanks, you did great!

244
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,109
Hm?

245
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,275
Okay...

246
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,186
What's up? Did you want
to see a little more?

247
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,244
No.

248
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,821
Why not try one on?

249
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,153
No thank you!

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,356
Oh! This is Saki's gift of gab.

251
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,665
Yeah, but...

252
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,523
It's right here!

253
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,060
Never mind! I have no
interest in cosplay!

254
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,470
She almost even had me that time.

255
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,442
Oh, really?

256
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,545
Then look, would you if I wore one?

257
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,973
Huh?

258
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,750
Y-you will?

259
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,211
I will if you wear one.

260
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,988
Wow, that turned around in a hurry.

261
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,158
And Ogiue hasn't realized it.

262
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,567
So, what do you think?

263
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,627
About what?

264
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,065
Will she wear one?

265
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,107
Ogiue?

266
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:40,173
50-50... no, maybe 60-40 against.

267
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,140
I-it won't happen.

268
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,344
She'll do it.

269
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,048
You're confident enough.

270
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,846
Mhm. It's Saki, after all.

271
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,122
Even Kasukabe has her limits...

272
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:56,594
Your humble servant Coochy hereby
bets this Kujiun cell strap!

273
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,463
I own one...

274
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,426
Then I'm going with yes, she will.

275
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,798
Huh?

276
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,164
Hey, hey, you're party to this!

277
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,865
All the more reason.

278
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,067
I don't think she will.

279
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,036
Won't.

280
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,381
Will.

281
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,681
We don't really need
to go to this trouble.

282
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,349
It's been downgraded to just trouble.

283
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:30,322
You can just wear it in here! You
never have to show it to the guys.

284
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,765
Of course! Who'd ever...

285
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,926
Of course! Who'd ever...
Then just for a little!

286
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,297
No thanks.

287
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,594
Really quick, right on then back off!

288
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,401
No, no thanks.

289
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,768
One more push, Saki!

290
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,471
We won't take any pictures!

291
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,536
Uh, pictures...

292
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,573
You're just trying it on,
so come on, change.

293
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,246
Well, I don't know how much to take off.

294
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,895
Then I'll undress you!

295
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,919
Then I'll undress you!
No!

296
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,860
I'll undress myself! I'll do it!

297
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,627
Are they okay in there?

298
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,131
Who knows...

299
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,167
Down she goes!

300
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:23,080
If Saki was a guy, she might
make a good porno scout.

301
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,786
University Ouran Festival

302
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,084
Ouran

303
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,392
Authorized personnel only
All others, entry prohibited

304
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,301
Wow, now that's cosplay!

305
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,529
Yes...

306
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,372
M-maybe you could say it's cute.

307
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,546
Well, Ohno?

308
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,639
She's Renko from Kujiun.

309
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,206
I don't mean that.

310
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,915
Y-yes, well, I guess
she looks cute in it?

311
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,121
Pardon?

312
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:10,521
Oh, fine. She looks cute. Don't
ask again like you didn't hear me.

313
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,087
She said cute. But then, you really are.

314
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,533
It's k-kind of drafty on my legs.
And the material's cheap.

315
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,000
Huh?

316
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,111
I have no idea about the
character's inner essence.

317
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,580
You can always just get
into it through appearance.

318
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,982
That's news to me.

319
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,254
If you try it and have even a
little fun, that's good enough.

320
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,921
Ah, I'm sorry. We're a little behind.

321
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,897
Ohno!

322
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,363
It's about that time!

323
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,570
Oh, already?

324
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,832
Are you wearing it?

325
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,168
Not yet.

326
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,609
Is there a problem? I'm coming in.

327
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,667
Is there a problem? I'm coming in.
No!

328
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,503
Saki, Ogiue, could you help me?

329
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,074
But I need to...

330
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,616
You can change later!

331
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,979
Just go out like that.

332
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:09,884
No!

333
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,622
Grab that MOS-KOS headgear.

334
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,342
A booming success.

335
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,904
That's our Cosplayer Youko for you.

336
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,883
There are some who came
here today just forthis.

337
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,250
It w-was advertised online.

338
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,320
Here they come finally.

339
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,861
Hey.

340
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,363
Incredible.

341
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,200
We might have you to thank.

342
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,001
So, what happened?

343
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,835
What do you think happened?
She cosplayed.

344
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,210
She really did?

345
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,675
No way! What character?

346
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,382
The one from Kujiun... uh...

347
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,922
Renko Kamishakujii!

348
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,059
Kamishakujii, huh? Makes sense!

349
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,528
I don't like how natural
it apparently seems!

350
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,499
Oh no, not my first edition Wild Soul!

351
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,671
Yes! Jackpot!

352
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,511
Were you guys betting!

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,511
Uh, well...

354
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,981
It was a joke, a joke!

355
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,109
It never ends up as a
joke when you say it!

356
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,677
Kasukabe!

357
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,419
I had high hopes.

358
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,927
We all wanted to see it.

359
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,830
Because Saki looked so good in hers.

360
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,471
So how'd you bet, Kohsaka?

361
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,436
That Ogiue would do it,
of course. So did Tanaka.

362
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,176
Who bet against?

363
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,504
I did!

364
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,186
Idiots.

365
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,848
In the end, Kohsaka's
the only one who gets it.

366
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,224
So what do you get for winning?

367
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,524
Wild Soul.

368
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,489
A Harahoro prize.

369
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,603
Plus! You guys pay for drinks.

370
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,764
Wh-why shouldn't you pay?

371
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,740
Kohsaka's win is my win!

372
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,470
Nice Gianism!

373
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,516
The v-vice president.

374
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,220
Now I really wish I
could've seen Ogiue's Renko.

375
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,891
You should've taken part
in the photo shoot too.

376
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,490
Not on your life.

377
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,666
The highest priority was improving
her relationship with Ohno.

378
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,074
Cosplay was just a means, right?

379
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,475
Well, that's true.

380
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:26,079
Hey, Ogiue kept complaining,
but she finally did it.

381
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,181
She'll let you see it eventually.

382
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,154
Eventually, huh?

383
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,226
H-how do you feel about cosplay?

384
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,693
H-how do you feel about cosplay?
It's horrible!

385
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,955
Now I know for sure it's not for me.

386
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,624
Just so long as this
improves the mood a bit...

387
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:06,654
We took no detours or shortcuts...

388
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:17,200
...and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...

389
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:25,404
...as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.

390
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:35,542
Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.

391
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:45,394
We were simple
when we were young...

392
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:57,933
...with our endlessly
glistening marbles.

393
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:02,571
The time we spied from there...

394
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:07,380
...sparkled, even if
nothing big happened.

395
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:12,788
What is seen from the marbles...

396
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,522
...in our hands now is a little different...

397
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:26,300
...but they shine faintly nearby.

398

400
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,070
Irohagokko
What's wrong, Ohno? You look down.

401
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,148
Kujiun's ended, and now
it's like, what do we do now?

402
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,707
Ahh, that's true. I guess we
can't have Kujiun meetings anymore.

403
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,083
It sure is sad.

404
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,952
I fail to see why
you're so absorbed in it.

405
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,718
Huh? You do?

406
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,786
You guys can breathe easy!

407
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,794
Mourn not, for Ritsuko
Kübel Kettenkrad...

408
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,355
...Chihiro Enomoto, and Tokino
Akiyama live on in your hearts!

409
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,402
Theirjourney's only just begun!

410
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,696
Aha.

411
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,068
Eh, never mind.
