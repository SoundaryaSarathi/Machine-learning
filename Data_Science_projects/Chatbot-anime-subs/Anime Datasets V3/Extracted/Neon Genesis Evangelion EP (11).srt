00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no youni</i>
Like an angel without a sense of mercy...

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare</i>
...rise young boy to the heavens as a legend.

Neon Genesis

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Aoi kaze ga ima</i>
Cold winds, as blue as the sea...

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Mune no door wo tataitemo</i>
Tear open the door to your heart...

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Watashidake wo tada mitsumete</i>
But unknowing you seem, just staring at me...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Hohoenderu anata</i>
Standing there smiling serenely.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Sotto fureru mono</i>
Desperate for something to touch...

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>Motomeru koto ni muchu de</i>
A moment of kindness like that in a dream..

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>Unmei sae mada shiranai</i>
Your innocent eyes as yet have no idea...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Itaikena hitomi</i>
...of the path your destiny will follow.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Sono senaka niwa</i>
...everything that you've got behind you.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>Haruka mirai mezasu tameno</i>
Your wings are for seeking out...

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>Hanega arukoto</i>
...a new future that only you can search for.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Zankoku na tenshi no thesis</i>
The cruel angel's thesis bleeds...

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,600
<i>Madobe kara yagate tobitatsu</i>
...through a portal like your pulsing blood.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>Hotobashiru atsui pathos de</i>
If you should betray the chapel of your memories...

00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Omoide wo uragiru nara</i>
...the cruel angel will enter the window of your soul.

So boy, stand tall and embrace the fire of legend...

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>Shonen yo shinwa ni nare.</i>
Embrace the universe like a blazing star!

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,290
Cool! I won a free ice cream bar!

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,630
<i>Laundromat</i>
<i>Open 24 hours</i>

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,040
Boy, the cost of doing laundry
has been killing me lately.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,670
I just wish I had the time to wash
my clothes for myself.

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,880
You should appreciate the fact
you can at least sleep at home.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,790
<i>Don't forget your ticket!</i>

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,990
<i>Train arriving.</i>

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,620
Hello, Vice Commander.

30
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,690
Good morning, Sir.

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,900
Good morning, Sir!

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,390
Good morning.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,070
You're quite early today.

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,810
Well, I have to go uptown as
Ikari's representative.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,880
I see. Isn't today the City Council's
regular meeting?

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,750
It's a boring job.

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,240
He always forces the most
tedious work on me.

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,350
Without the Magi's help,
I couldn't do it.

39
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,960
Speaking of which, election
day is coming up, isn't it?

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,090
The City Council has
no authority at all.

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,560
Actually, the Magi run
everything now.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,760
The Magi? You mean the three
super computers?

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,170
Government by majority decision
of three different computers.

44
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,970
It's a sort of democratic system.

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,410
And the council just obeys
their decisions?

46
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,710
It's a most effective form
of government.

47
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,510
This truly is a City of Science.

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,050
We are fortunate to live in an era
when Science reigns supreme.

49
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,980
Talk about old fashioned
viewpoints.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,520
Come to think of it, don't you have
an experiment to run on Unit 00?

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,990
Yes, we're going to run the second
prolonged activation test at 10:30.

52
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,980
I'm expecting good news.

53
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,900
Abort experiment! Cut the circuit!

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Switching circuits.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,690
Power supply restored.

56
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,710
This component is the
problem again.

57
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,180
Yes. I think the problem is that
the conversion efficiency

58
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,850
is 0.008 lower than our
theoretical calculations.

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,590
It's within the tolerance
though, barely.

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,950
What are we going to do?

61
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,520
Let's try it again using the
same configuration,

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,390
but lower the reciprocal
conversion rate by 0.01.

63
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,360
Roger.

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,890
Now, let's recommence the
reactivation experiment.

65
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,400
Now, let's recommence the
reactivation experiment.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,300
Episode 11:
In the Still Dark

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,860
Hey, hold up!

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,910
Man, I've never had to
run this much!

69
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,480
So, what's with the black
expression?

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,350
It's from seeing your loathsome
face first thing in the morning.

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,010
<i>Yes, hold just a moment please.</i>

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,490
<i>What?</i>

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,100
Well, Father...

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,730
<i>What? Hurry up.</i>

75
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,780
Well,

76
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,050
I'm supposed to

77
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,110
tell my parent that an interview

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,410
for Advanced Vocational Education
is going to be held at school.

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,560
<i>I've delegated things like that</i>
<i>to Captain Katsuragi.</i>

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,620
<i>Don't bother me with</i>
<i>such nonsense.</i>

81
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,260
<i>Don't forward any more</i>
<i>of these calls to...</i>

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,370
What?

83
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,240
A black out?
What?

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,540
A black out?
<i> </i>

85
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,870
A black out?
No, it can't be. It's not possible.

86
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,210
No, it can't be. It's not possible.

87
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,850
Something's strange. An accident?

88
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,010
Perhaps Dr. Akagi
made a mistake?

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
The main power supply
has been interrupted.

90
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,380
Voltage level is zero!

91
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,690
It's not my fault.

92
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,360
What do you think?

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,950
It'll switch to the backup
power supply soon.

94
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,100
No, the backup circuits
aren't working.

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,670
That can't be.

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,440
Which circuits are functioning?

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,940
Only one point two percent!
Only nine circuits out of 2,567!

98
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,080
Connect all remaining live circuits
to the Magi and Central Dogma.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,780
But that could interfere with
life support systems.

100
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,440
Do it! That's our top priority!

101
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>Nozomu Takahashi, wants a happier government.</i>

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,690
Boy, she's such a lazy slob.
<i>Nozomu Takahashi, wants a happier government.</i>

103
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,020
Boy, she's such a lazy slob.
<i>We need your support for this honest candidate.</i>

104
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,790
Can't Katsuragi at least pick up her own laundry?
<i>We need your support for this honest candidate.</i>

105
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,690
<i>Thank you!</i>

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,770
Maybe Commander Ikari
was just really busy?

107
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,270
I doubt it.

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,070
It wasn't like he hung up. It was
more like a mechanical failure.

109
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,880
Hey, are you a man or what?

110
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Stop letting every little
incident bother you!

111
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,710
What?

112
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,650
What do you think you're doing?
Here, let me try that!

113
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,260
Damn! It must be broken!

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,440
Heave...

115
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,430
Ho!

116
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,580
We'd better head for the
command station.

117
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,540
It's been seven minutes and the
power hasn't been restored. This...

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,310
...is very unusual.

119
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,610
What's the backup power
system here?

120
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,250
There are three circuits, main,
sub and reserve.

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,950
It's virtually impossible for all
of those to fail at once.

122
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,760
Then that means...

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,120
...the circuit breakers didn't
go on their own.

124
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,790
Someone must have blown
them intentionally.

125
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,060
Regardless of the cause,

126
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,900
it would be disastrous if an Angel
were to attack right now.

127
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,270
<i>Radar has detected an</i>
<i>unidentified object.</i>

128
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,700
<i>Projected landing point is in</i>
<i>the former Atami region.</i>

129
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,210
It must be number eight.

130
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,040
I agree, it must be an Angel.

131
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,180
What are we going to do?

132
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,410
Go to alert status. That's
the procedure, anyway.

133
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,020
This one's destination
has to be Tokyo-3.

134
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,050
I agree. Well, this is no job for us.

135
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,530
<i>The Angel has landed.</i>

136
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,930
<i>It's still advancing.</i>

137
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,030
What about Tokyo-3?

138
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,930
<i>It's still silent.</i>

139
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,460
What in the hell are those
NERV guys doing?

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,410
I never thought I'd actually have
to use one of these trap exits.

141
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,880
I thought they were just holdovers
kept for our peace of mind.

142
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,900
To provide is to prevent.

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,850
This one doesn't work either!

144
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,450
None of the facilities work.
This is odd.

145
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,560
Could this mean that something's
happened down in the Geo-Front?

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,420
It is natural to assume that.

147
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,900
In any case, let's try to make
contact with NERV Headquarters.

148
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,420
No, the emergency phones aren't
getting through either.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
No, there's no answer on Line 77.

150
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,230
No, no response.

151
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,040
Not here either. So the main and
emergency cables are both down.

152
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,530
What do we do now?

153
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,650
What're you doing?

154
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,990
What are you, stupid? I'm looking
for my emergency manual.

155
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,120
Anyway, let's go to NERV
Headquarters.

156
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,460
Yeah, but first we'll need to
decide who will be group leader.

157
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,630
And naturally, I am the leader.

158
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,120
Any objections?

159
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,940
Now, let's go.

160
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,840
We can proceed through
Route 07, right here.

161
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,080
But the doors don't work.

162
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,550
We can open it manually.

163
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,240
There you go, Shinji.
That's your job.

164
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,690
I don't believe it! You want
to control everything,

165
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,850
but you always defer to
me at times like this.

166
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,330
Damn those Joint Staff bastards!
They always defer to us at times like this.

167
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,760
What does the government say?

168
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,890
Those Tokyo-2 buttheads?
They're getting ready to run.

169
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,630
<i>The Angel is still advancing.</i>

170
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,440
In any case, we must
contact NERV.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,340
But how?

172
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,010
By going there yourself.

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,580
<i>This is the 3rd District ASDF!</i>

174
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,090
<i>An unidentified object is moving</i>
<i>toward this area.</i>

175
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,620
<i>All residents must evacuate to</i>
<i>their designated shelters.</i>

176
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,720
Big trouble! I've got to report
this to Headquarters!

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,420
But how?

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>Remember Takahashi remains</i>
<i>calm even in situations like this!</i>

179
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,010
<i>Please support candidate</i>
<i>Takahashi!</i>

180
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,310
Lucky!

181
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,310
It's too hot.

182
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,580
Yeah, the air conditioners are out.

183
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,210
Katsuragi, if you're so hot, why
don't you take off your shirt?

184
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,010
There's no reason for shyness
between you and me.

185
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,020
Don't even think about trying to
take advantage of this situation.

186
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,090
Okay, okay!

187
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,650
It's getting even worse. Now,
the air is getting stagnant.

188
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,330
Hard to believe this facility represents
the most advanced technology on Earth.

189
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,070
But look at the Commander
and Vice Commander.

190
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,040
Even in this much heat, they're
cool and in command.

191
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,210
It's getting warmer.

192
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,400
Neon Genesis
Evangelion

193
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,830
<i>...along with the declaration of</i>
<i>emergency in this district.</i>

194
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,930
<i>Emergency vehicle!</i>
<i>Passing through!</i>

195
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh, my! Excuse me, it's blocked!

196
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,500
It's okay! Charge!

197
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,300
This is an emergency!
Everything is permitted!

198
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,370
Aye, Sir!

199
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,730
No! Let me off!

200
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,570
This Geo-Front was designed to
be a self-sufficient colony,

201
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,010
even when isolated
from the outside.

202
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,080
Theoretically, it's impossible
for all of the power sources

203
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,950
to be shut down at once.

204
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,390
You mean that someone
caused it to happen?

205
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,050
Their purpose would be
to map this facility.

206
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,360
So they could determine HQ's
structure through the restoration?

207
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,560
Disrespectful bastards.

208
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,930
I'll run a dummy program
through the Magi.

209
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,520
That will make it harder for them
to get a complete picture.

210
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,770
I'll leave it to you.

211
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,630
Yes, Sir.
I'll leave it to you.

212
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,130
Yes, Sir.
<i> </i>

213
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,670
I can't believe the first havoc
wreaked upon our headquarters

214
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,240
wasn't caused by an Angel, but by
another member of our species.

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,530
One of Mankind's greatest
enemies is Man himself.

216
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,140
But it usually only takes
two minutes.

217
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,680
Are you sure this is the right way?

218
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,050
Yes, I'm sure! If we can get past
this point we'll be there.

219
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,820
Haven't I heard that four
times already?

220
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,330
Picky! You always focus on the
most insubstantial little tidbits.

221
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,260
Silence, please.

222
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,830
What now, Wonder Girl?
Silence, please.

223
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,200
What now, Wonder Girl?
<i> </i>

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,690
A man's voice.

225
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,470
<i>Ang... proaching...</i>

226
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,110
That's Hyuga!

227
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,170
Hey! Hey! Hey!

228
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,440
<i>An Angel is approaching!</i>
<i>Repeat, an Angel is approaching!</i>

229
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,180
An Angel?!

230
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,950
We can't waste any more time.
Let's take a short cut.

231
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,890
Hey, I'm the leader! Don't take any
initiatives without my permission!

232
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,480
Now then, where is this short cut?

233
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,650
This may be the quickest way,
but we look really stupid.

234
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,530
Say, just what do you think
the Angels are?

235
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,800
Why are you talking about that
at a time like this?

236
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,330
Angels are messengers of God but
our enemies are named after them.

237
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,940
So, why are we fighting them?

238
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,750
What are you, stupid? Strange
beings started attacking us.

239
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,910
When someone's attacking you,
you can't just sit and do nothing.

240
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,920
To the right!

241
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,520
I think the correct path is to the left.
To the right!

242
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,820
I think the correct path is to the left.
<i> </i>

243
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,590
Stop bothering me!

244
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,020
What do you think, Shinji?

245
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,450
Well...

246
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm not sure.

247
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,300
Damn, I'm the leader, so just
shut up, and follow me!

248
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
I expected that this would be a
little odd. The path is going up.

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,330
What do you mean, "expected?"
You always nit-pick and worry!

250
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,240
Look, this has got to
be it this time!

251
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,170
Well, we've visually confirmed
the Angel's presence.

252
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,430
Now, we know we have to hurry.

253
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,540
<i>Angel is approaching! Immediate</i>
<i>Eva dispatch will be necessary!</i>

254
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,610
Oh, my gosh!

255
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,510
Fuyutsuki, take care
of the rest of this.

256
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,710
Ikari?

257
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,920
I will help prepare for the
launch in the cage.

258
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,720
Are you serious?

259
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,220
You mean by hand?

260
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,320
We have a diesel generator
for such emergencies.

261
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,810
But...

262
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,050
We have no pilots!

263
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,250
Not again!

264
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,960
This way.

265
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,110
I've heard that you're the
Commander's favorite, aren't you?

266
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,580
You're a favored smart ass who's
treated differently than us.

267
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,200
Stop it! This isn't the time for that!

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,990
You've always got that smug
look on your face.

269
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,230
Do you think you can act superior
just because you're treated better?

270
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,890
I don't act superior.

271
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,660
And I'm not treated better either.

272
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,990
I know that quite well.

273
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,110
Roger. Ejection of the termination
plug is complete.

274
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,320
Good, prepare to insert
the entry plug.

275
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
But the pilots aren't here yet.

276
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
Don't worry, they'll come.

277
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,160
There's no way I can open
this with my hands.

278
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,230
It can't be helped. We'll have to
break into a duct to get through.

279
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,400
This First Child isn't someone
to mess with.

280
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,100
She'll do anything to accomplish
her objectives.

281
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,840
She's a real self-righteous bitch.

282
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,620
The plug is fixed and ready.

283
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,280
Now, we just have to
wait for the kids.

284
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,920
If you dare look forward,
I'll kill you!

285
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,600
You jerk! Ignoramus! Nincompoop!

286
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,430
I told you not to look!

287
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,560
I have to see to go forward!

288
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,500
Ah, there you are.

289
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,680
Prepare for entry!

290
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,650
Roger, open the hatches manually.

291
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,750
How are the Evas?

292
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,310
They're in standby.

293
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,620
How? Nothing's working.

294
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,920
It was all done by hand.

295
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,590
It was the Commander's idea.

296
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,080
My father's?

297
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,990
Commander Ikari believed in you
three, and prepared everything.

298
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,950
Plugs inserted.

299
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,390
All units activated using
backup power supply.

300
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,480
Remove primary lock bolts.

301
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,330
Hydraulic locks numbers 2
through 32, released.

302
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,600
Zero pressure.

303
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,260
The situation is free.

304
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,670
Go ahead and remove
the restraints.

305
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,660
Begin the attack!

306
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,080
<i>The target has stopped</i>
<i>right above us.</i>

307
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,020
Get ready! Hurry up!

308
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,000
<i>The emergency batteries</i>
<i>have been installed!</i>

309
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,570
Well, we're ready.

310
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,550
Launch!

311
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,840
Geez! I look so pathetic!

312
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,000
We're approaching a vertical shaft.

313
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,150
This is still pathetic.

314
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,820
Watch out! Dodge!

315
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,690
No!

316
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,940
It appears the target is going to
invade HQ using liquid solvent.

317
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,810
What'll we do?

318
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,080
We're going to beat it, of course.

319
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,920
Sure, but how?

320
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,520
We dropped our rifles, and the
battery packs are running out.

321
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,320
They won't last more than
another three minutes.

322
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,060
I have a plan.

323
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,190
One of us will take the defensive
position, and stay here.

324
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,930
Their job is to neutralize
the Angel's AT Field,

325
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,130
and to protect the offensive
player from that acid.

326
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,700
The backup player

327
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,700
will go down, pick up the rifles,
and hand them to the offense.

328
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,370
The offense will then fire a volley
to destroy the target.

329
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,640
How does that sound?

330
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,510
I see, I will take the defense.

331
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,310
Sorry, but it's not you.

332
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,510
It's me.

333
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,040
It's too dangerous!

334
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,650
That's why.

335
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,590
I'll feel bad if I don't repay you for
the one I owe you from last time.

336
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,420
Shinji will be the offense.
Wonder Girl is the backup.

337
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,020
Got it?

338
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,460
Understood.

339
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,460
Here we go!

340
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,190
CHARGE!

341
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,910
Ayanami!

342
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,260
Asuka, get out of the way!

343
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,830
Now, we're even.

344
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,880
Oh, damn it! Why doesn't it open?!

345
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,340
This is a desperate situation!
I've got to go to the bathroom!

346
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,450
Hey, I told you not to look up!

347
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,940
Okay! Yes, Ma'am!

348
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,260
Disgusting...

349
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,740
It's ironic.

350
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,270
Without electricity and artificial
light, the sky looks so beautiful.

351
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,240
But without the lights, it's as if
there were no humans there.

352
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,190
See? I feel much more
comfortable this way.

353
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,560
Man has always feared the Darkness, so
he scrapes away at its edges with fire.

354
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,960
He creates life by diminishing
the Darkness.

355
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,660
A philosopher!

356
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,130
Is that what makes Mankind
a special species?

357
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Is that why the Angels
keep attacking us?

358
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,540
What are you, stupid?

359
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,070
Who knows what they think?

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,750
<i>To be continued...</i>

361
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Preview

362
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Misato's career has been a crusade
to exterminate the Angels.

363
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Shinji finds a similar
sentiment within himself.

364
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
The largest Angel yet comes
flying through the stratosphere,

365
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,000
making many people abandon all hope.

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Next time:
"The Value of a Miracle"

367
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Watch it with everyone together.
