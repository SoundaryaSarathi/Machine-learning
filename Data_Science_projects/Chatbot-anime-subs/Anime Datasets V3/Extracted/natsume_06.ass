Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.28,0:08:36.61,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,Natsume-sama, it's going to rain.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.85,0:08:38.86,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,I can tell.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.37,0:08:41.58,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,A bird that can predict rain?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.16,0:08:45.81,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,I see. You used to be a swallow?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.31,0:09:08.70,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,but then some humans found the nest and returned it to its place.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.79,0:09:14.64,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,However, our parents came to hate us because we smelled like humans,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.64,0:09:18.28,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,and so they left and abandoned us.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.29,0:09:30.58,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,And then...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.20,0:09:32.29,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,I...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.06,0:09:34.76,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,became a spirit.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.25,0:09:38.71,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,But one day,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.71,0:09:42.43,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,a human appeared and gave me food.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.92,0:09:47.98,natsume,,0000,0000,0000,,And he would come day after day...
