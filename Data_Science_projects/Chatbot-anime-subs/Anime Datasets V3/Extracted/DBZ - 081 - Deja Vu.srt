"Piccolo's Self-Confidence! 'I Will Be the
One to Defeat Freeza' "

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,250
I'll do this by myself. You guys stay out of it.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,160
It's senseless! Not even Piccolo has
a chance of winning against that guy!

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,390
Piccolo-san...

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,820
Piccolo's Ki has increased considerably since
he left his training here. What's going on?

6
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,330
In that case, Kaio-sama, are you saying Piccolo
has the potential to win against Freeza?

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,360
No...

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,570
They have touched that which should have remained
untouched. Freeza's power is unmatched.

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,580
If Piccolo is beaten, Kami-sama will also die.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,580
If that happens, our chance at resurrection
will probably be forever lost.

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,620
Piccolo, you have to stick it out until
Goku has recovered!

12
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,960
That is the issue, isn't it?

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,790
Leave this to me, he says. He doesn't
understand how terrifying Freeza is!

14
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,290
He'll realize it soon enough.

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Piccolo-san isn't the kind of person who
doesn't know his opponent's strength.

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,930
But Gohan, Piccolo hasn't...

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm sure of it! Piccolo-san has a
chance of winning!

18
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,770
A chance of winning?

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,810
There's no way he can win! Even though he may have
shown up, our situation hasn't changed a bit.

20
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,770
But Piccolo-san is...

21
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,430
This Ki is Piccolo's. Piccolo has been
resurrected! But this time his Ki is different,
more incredible than ever!

22
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,140
H- He looks just like Nail-san, but is this
Piccolo fellow also a Fighter-type Namekian?

23
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,410
You appear to be quite sure of yourself.
But soon enough,

24
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,220
that surety will shatter and give way and
turn to your begging for your life from me.

25
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,450
Enough from you.

26
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,770
Take this!

27
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,130
He did it!

28
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,460
Way to go, Piccolo!

29
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,030
Struggle though he might, there's no
way he can win.

30
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,430
I hate to admit it, but all I can do is escape
and wait for another chance.

31
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,570
I'm not stupid enough to just wait around
to be killed by Freeza.

32
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,810
Well, come on out! You've got greater
power than that, haven't you?

33
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,820
Piccolo-san!

34
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,900
You're not that bad. I mean, you were able to
dodge that from close range by a hair's breadth.

35
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,580
Vegeta!

36
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,740
Where are you going? Don't tell me you
need to go pee, now.

37
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,150
Dammit!

38
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,220
Vegeta...

39
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,500
It won't do to have the prince of the warrior
race Saiyans sneaking away with his tail
tucked between his legs.

40
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,230
However...

41
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,700
No matter what you may try, your destiny
is to be killed by me.

42
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,680
You just sit still and wait for it.

43
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,650
Once I kill the Namekian,
your turn comes next.

44
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,770
Sorry for the delay. Now, show me the
power of that onfidence you hold.

45
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,950
You are a fool not to feel my terror!

46
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,440
Gohan! Piccolo has greater power than
we can imagine! We may be able to hope
for something here.

47
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,270
Right! Piccolo-san will do it!

48
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,110
He's your sensei, after all, right?

49
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,780
Right!

50
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,550
N- Nail-san!

51
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,220
Could it be?

52
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,630
Piccolo-san...

53
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,730
Piccolo-san!

54
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,710
Do not be upset.

55
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,670
It will take more than that to kill him.

56
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,350
But I will show you how I'll take him apart!

57
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,340
You fought well, for a Namekian. I'll give
you credit for that. But it's over.
The fun stops now.

58
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,430
Damn.

59
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,840
Piccolo-san!

60
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,760
We are now completely out of Namekians.

61
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,070
What!?

62
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,410
Piccolo-san!

63
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,710
Don't take me so lightly.

64
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,250
G- Gohan! We might be able to win!

65
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,080
You could be right.

66
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,160
With Piccolo and the three of us, this
could turn out all right after all!

67
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,490
Okay then, it's decided!

68
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,090
Stay out of this!

69
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,140
I thought I told you I'd do this by myself.

70
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,710
But...

71
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,300
We can contribute at least something.

72
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,180
Leave this to me.

73
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,610
That fool! This is our one chance
to defeat Freeza!

74
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,150
He's no match for Freeza's
power just by himself!

75
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,000
You filthy maggot!

76
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,980
Haven't you realized it yet? We can see
through your every move!

77
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,450
What!? What do you mean "we"?

78
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,770
What does this mean?

79
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:33,830
Piccolo!

80
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,370
Piccolo...

81
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,270
Piccolo's Ki has surged yet again.

82
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,410
What's happening!?

83
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,420
You've become a giant, and you're using
both hands, yet this is the best you've got?

84
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,420
That voice...

85
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,360
I know! What if I were to fight using only
my left hand for you?

86
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,230
Something like that cannot possibly work
against me, can it?

87
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,380
Surely you see there is no way you can win.

88
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,560
I have merged with Piccolo.

89
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,160
What!?

90
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,500
l- I knew it!

91
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,730
By doing so, my power has increased
several times over.

92
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,510
Unite with me.

93
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,520
I am the... last Warrior-Type Namekian
left on my world.

94
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,420
What? Unite with you?

95
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,530
That's right. If you do, your current power
will be increased several times over.

96
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,940
What incredible power! What an unbelievably
fearsome power this is!

97
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,540
Is this what uniting with someone is like!?

98
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,320
Awesome!

99
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,790
Impossible! I don't believe it!

100
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,430
I have obtained the ultimate power!

101
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,690
Piccolo-san!

102
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,660
Piccolo!

103
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,500
Impossible!

104
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,290
What!?

105
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,710
He did it!

106
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,060
Why, you... !

107
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:50,130
Nail has merged with Piccolo, but can
Piccolo defeat Freeza?

108
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,340
And what about Goku?

109
