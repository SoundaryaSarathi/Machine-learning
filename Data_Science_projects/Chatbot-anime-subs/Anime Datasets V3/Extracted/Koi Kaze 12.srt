1
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,200
Ah, I'm sorry. Ow...

2
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
A-are you all right?

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Uh-huh, I just scraped my knee a little.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay?

5
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
J-just wait here a bit.

6
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,800
Thank you.

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,300
S-sure.

8
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,120
Spring thunder

9
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,250
Is this for me?

10
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,750
Yeah.

11
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,350
I thought your diet might be unbalanced from eating out too much.

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,950
I see.

13
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,150
Thanks.

14
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,350
Sure.

15
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,650
I'll...

16
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,050
It's fine, just sit down.

17
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,750
Brother...

18
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,250
Did it bother you?

19
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,550
The letter...

20
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,450
That's not it! This is...

21
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,950
I'm sorry, I broke the promise.

22
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
No, that's not it!

23
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,550
I won't ever come again.

24
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,050
That's not it.

25
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,350
This isn't what you think it is.

26
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,350
So, please stay here.

27
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,350
Brother, my arm hurts.

28
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,750
S-sorry.

29
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,250
I read your letter.

30
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,950
Yeah.

31
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,650
Try it on.

32
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,450
Come on, try it on for me.

33
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,950
Futaba.

34
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,850
Hey Futaba!

35
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,350
Why are you so out of it?

36
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,050
You're the one who invited us.

37
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,950
Oh yeah!

38
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,950
He's so cute!

39
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,850
You have bad taste.

40
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,050
No way...

41
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,050
Damn, he's such a handful.

42
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,550
Why am I the only one who has to work in this dim room?

43
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,950
If only Koshiro-san didn't take the day off.

44
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,750
If only he didn't take the day off.

45
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,250
Th-this is...!

46
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,150
So close.

47
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,550
Yes?

48
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,550
Thank god.

49
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
Thanks.

50
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
You want something to drink?

51
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,150
W-wait a second.

52
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,650
Ah...

53
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,350
I'll go buy something!

54
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,650
J-just wait a little bit.

55
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,250
Brother?

56
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,150
Do you want me to make you something?

57
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,350
Eh?

58
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,450
For dinner.

59
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,250
If you keep eating things like this, you'll really get sick.

60
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,250
But...

61
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,350
Let's go together!

62
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,950
I said don't move!

63
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,450
I'll go buy it, so write it down for me.

64
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,450
What do you want to eat?

65
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,850
Anything's fine.

66
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,450
How about seasoned rice?

67
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,550
Uh... Yeah, but...

68
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,450
I don't have a rice cooker...

69
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,650
Eh? Then you really don't cook at all by yourself?

70
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,650
I was thinking of buying one someday.

71
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,250
You have a frying pan, right?

72
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,250
Yeah.

73
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,750
Then...

74
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,650
What on earth am I doing?

75
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,850
Until a moment ago I was so depressed,

76
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,450
but now I'm all happy...

77
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,650
What did I leave the house for?

78
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,450
What was the past month for?

79
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,450
H-hi! Long time no see, Nanoka-chan.

80
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,850
H-hello.

81
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,350
Where's Koshiro?

82
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,350
He's out shopping right now.

83
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,050
I see.

84
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,350
Umm... Is there something you need?

85
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,150
Oh yeah, I left my pass here, when I slept over the other day.

86
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,250
Oh, don't mind me. I know where it is.

87
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,950
Are you going out with him?

88
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,750
Are you... going out with my brother?

89
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,250
That's right. You didn't know?

90
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,150
I guess he doesn't tell you about these things.

91
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,750
Is there something wrong with that?

92
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,850
I...

93
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,850
Sorry.

94
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,150
Kazuyoshi! You shouldn't stare at people like that!

95
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,150
I've fallen off...

96
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,650
I've totally fallen off...

97
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,600
What did Koshiro go to buy?

98
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Ingredients for dinner.

99
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Oh, are you going to make it, Nanoka-chan?

100
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

101
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I might stay for dinner too then.

102
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,300
Why is that?

103
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,800
Koshiro only offers me things he has on hand, so at least sometime...

104
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,400
Found it.

105
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
What's the meaning of this?

106
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Please go home.

107
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,000
Eh?

108
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please go home!

109
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
Why?

110
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Because you're in the way.

111
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,300
In the way?

112
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
I want to spend today with just my brother...

113
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,800
You know what?

114
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
How is it that I'm taking this from you,

115
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
who is only his younger sister?

116
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,400
I won't lose.

117
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,400
I won't lose to anyone over my feelings towards my brother!

118
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Siblings can't fall in love with each other.

119
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
They can't even get married!

120
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Do you understand that?

121
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Your feelings are just temporary.

122
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,500
You're not able to see straight because there's too much blood rushing to your head.

123
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,900
You're probably only able to see your brother who is right in front of you.

124
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,600
But, I don't think such things will last very long.

125
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,100
Isn't it painful? It'll hurt when your feelings disappear.

126
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,400
He's your big brother!

127
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,400
I'll think about him for the rest of my life.

128
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,000
There is such a love, where you can think that.

129
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
The rest of your life?

130
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,600
So naive! Naive! The rest of your life, you say?

131
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,500
You can say it so easily. That's why you're called a child.

132
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,200
Old woman.

133
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you think everyone else will say?

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That won't matter.

135
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
It will matter.

136
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Please go home!

137
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,100
You...

138
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,200
Go home!

139
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,700
Your parents will be saddened.

140
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
What a horrible face.

141
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
What horrible clothes.

142
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,800
I visit, worried about you and you're out shopping happily.

143
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
What the hell are you doing?

144
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Why did you let her into your aparment?

145
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
You saw her?

146
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,600
I did.

147
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,600
I tried to make her leave by telling her we were going out,

148
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
but she chased me out instead.

149
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
What were you thinking of doing after this?

150
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Why didn't you push her away?

151
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,700
What are you going to do now that you've got her hopes up?

152
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,900
I don't understand what you want to do at all, Koshiro.

153
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,900
I see that Nanoka-chan is also serious.

154
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm sorry I said that you were the only one doing wrong.

155
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,700
But if that's the case, then it's more important for you to be firm!

156
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,500
I know...

157
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
You obviously don't!

158
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
It's fine already.

159
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Wait! What's fine?

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,300
It's fine.

161
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Have you thought about the future?

162
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
It doesn't matter to you!

163
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
Whether it matters is not the point!

164
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,700
How can I leave someone alone who is about to become knee-deep in misery?!

165
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,400
Don't judge who is miserable and who is not.

166
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,500
I won't ever involve myself in your affairs again.

167
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm sorry I was so nosy from the beginning.

168
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,100
This is how it is.

169
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,800
Even though she seriously faced me like that,

170
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,200
I've finally lost her.

171
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Welcome home!

172
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I can still go back.

173
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm home.

174
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,800
If she really is precious to me,

175
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,000
You're still soaking wet!

176
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
there is only one thing I can do...

177
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
Just say it to her...

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
That even if she does things like this for me it's only a nuisance.

179
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Hurry up and understand.

180
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,000
It's no use telling her you don't need anything else.

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,700
Should we live together somewhere far away?

182
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Eh?

183
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,000
Someplace where nobody knows us, so we can live as more than siblings?

184
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Discarding everything else.

185
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
That's impossible for you, isn't it?

186
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,600
I love you more! More than Chidori-san.

187
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,900
I love you way more, brother!

188
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:05,100
Sorry...But... if you're going out with Chidori-san and you hate me,

189
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,700
I want you to tell me clearly.

190
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Chidori and I are...

191
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,300
Tell her that's exactly right.

192
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
if I do that, everything will end.

193
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300
That's exactly right.

194
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,400
Chidori and I are...

195
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
not going out.

196
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,800
She was just worried

197
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
about us siblings.

198
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,700
W-why can't siblings fall in love with each other?

199
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,300
I don't want to give up!

200
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
Stop it.

201
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,700
Don't say it.

202
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
That's just glossing over the problem.

203
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I...

204
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
don't need anything else.

205
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,200
As long as I have you, I don't need anything else.

206
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
You understand, right?

207
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,900
It won't be the same anymore.

208
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

209
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you really okay with that?

210
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Yeah.

211
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,000
If you're fine with it, then I'm fine with it too.

212
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,800
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I fell in love with you.

213
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
That goes for the both of us.

214
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,000
Though there are other people we should apologize to.

215
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,000
We can't apologize, can we?

216
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

217
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,100
Hello? Is this Nanoka?

218
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
No, it's me.

219
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,400
It's already late. I'll let her stay at my place.

220
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Yeah, it's fine.

221
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
She doesn't have school tomorrow.

222
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah.

223
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,100
Okay, don't worry about it.

224
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,400
Bye.

225
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,460
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

226
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,490
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

227
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,390
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

228
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,860
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

229
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,950
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

230
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,350
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

231
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,930
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

232
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,180
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

233
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,620
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

234
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,420
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

235
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,830
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

236
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

237
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

238
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,820
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

239
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,610
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

240
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,280
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

241
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,430
With Koshiro-san gone, having Chidori-san harass me feels nice.

242
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,490
But I want to stick to teenagers! This is my goal!

243
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,210
Punishment: No role in the next episode!

244
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,760
Oh, please at least one scene.
