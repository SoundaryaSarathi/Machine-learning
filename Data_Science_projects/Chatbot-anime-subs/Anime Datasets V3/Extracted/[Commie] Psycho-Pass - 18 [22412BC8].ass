Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.45,0:05:43.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Makishima probably knows whether that's true or not.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.15,0:05:47.05,Default,,0,0,0,,They used an aircraft to transport instead of a paddy wagon.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.05,0:05:49.66,Default,,0,0,0,,On top of that, only Drones were on board to guard him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.66,0:05:52.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Nothing about this case is normal.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.14,0:05:54.58,Default,,0,0,0,,To start with, whose body was that being taken out from the site?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.12,0:05:59.39,Default,,0,0,0,,It's been erased from the record, but we clearly saw it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.39,0:06:02.80,Default,,0,0,0,,We all know something's up, Ko.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.18,0:06:06.46,Default,,0,0,0,,But the details are top secret. The Inspectors wouldn't know the answer, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.46,0:06:09.38,Default,,0,0,0,,You're barking up the wrong tree.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.38,0:06:11.01,Default,,0,0,0,,I guess you're right.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.09,0:06:40.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Again?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.64,0:06:45.33,Default,,0,0,0,,The part where the Dominator ignored Makishima was gone without a trace.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.33,0:06:49.13,Default,,0,0,0,,From how the report was written,\N he was probably forced to delete it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.47,0:06:56.49,Default,,0,0,0,,The top brass are trying to erase the very fact that there are people who can't be judged by Sibyl.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.49,0:06:58.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Well... I guess they don't have much choice.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.45,0:07:25.75,Default,,0,0,0,,How do you think we can deal with those who are outside the law?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.13,0:07:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,We have no choice but to make this case an exception and go back to the old system.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.28,0:07:35.47,Default,,0,0,0,,We prosecute him, open a court, let him defend himself, and then sentence him.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.70,0:08:00.37,Default,,0,0,0,,But I was wrong to ask you to do it. I'll finish him off myself.
