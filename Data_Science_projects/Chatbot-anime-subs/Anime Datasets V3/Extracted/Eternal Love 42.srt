<i>[Episode 42]</i>

3
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,981
I've always hoped that you could
forget what happened 300 years ago.

4
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:16,460
Now that you've fallen
for this high god...

5
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,883
It made me worried instead.

6
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,873
Ye Hua, tell me.

7
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,967
Have you really fallen
for Qing Qiu's Bai Qian

8
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:28,713
or do you see her as that mortal?

9
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,503
Mother, you worry too much.

10
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:35,705
My wife is Qing Qiu's Bai Qian
as bestowed by Heavenly Lord.

11
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,143
I never saw her as anyone else.

12
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,778
That's good.

13
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:51,465
Reasonably, as his side consort,
you should greet this high god.

14
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,275
I've been to visit her today

15
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,375
but unfortunately, she's away in
the Heaven's Spring

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,856
of the Realm of Supreme Purity.

17
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:01,973
I'll visit her again tomorrow morning.

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,586
All right.

19
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,004
- High God.
- High God.

20
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,742
Don't the both of you always
serve by his side?

21
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,800
Why are you outside the hall today?

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,942
Crown Prince is in the hall
with Consort Le Xu.

23
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,086
Consort Le Xu? Ye Hua's mother?

24
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:33,159
Exactly. What brings High God
here to see His Highness?

25
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:38,318
It's nothing important.
I'm just here to visit A-Li.

26
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,568
Should I inform them?

27
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,346
Don't bother. I'll swing by later.

28
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:06,289
Mother, you're always teasing me.

29
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,448
You've been married into
Xiwu Palace for 300 years

30
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,250
but still there's no news
of your pregnancy.

31
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,646
Shouldn't I ask about it?

32
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,954
Consort,  I don't have a say in that.

33
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,495
High God Bai Zhen.

34
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,132
Don't stand on ceremony.

35
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,896
Is Zhe Yan in there?

36
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:41,514
High God arrived last night and has
stayed by my brother's side since then.

37
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,908
He's never once panicked.

38
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:48,831
I kept thinking that there's something
amiss about your brother's illness

39
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,670
but I can't put a finger on it.

40
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,641
High God Bai Zhen is right.

41
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,908
Be it my brother's illness,
or High God Zhe Yan's reactions

42
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,435
it all seems strange.

43
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,663
Enough said. Show me in.

44
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,242
High God, this way, please.

45
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,038
High God.

46
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,541
You haven't had any rest since
you arrived here last night.

47
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,165
Would you like a room to get some rest?

48
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,713
Don't bother.

49
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:37,137
I have a way to save him.

50
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,300
I'll be away for a few hours.

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,413
I'll come back with an emissary
to nurse your brother's health.

52
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,543
- Thank you, High God!
- Thank you, High God!

53
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,639
Thank you, High God!

54
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,548
My son has been ill for 600 some years.

55
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:54,788
He can finally be cured now!

56
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,947
Could you both step out for a moment?

57
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,072
- Yes.
- Yes.

58
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,730
I thought of your expression and voice
when you left two days ago.

59
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,502
Something seemed amiss.

60
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:23,624
Now that you dismissed them,
is there something important to tell me?

61
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:30,182
Speak up!

62
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,490
Zhen, you might be right.

63
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,778
Heavenly Father's legal son

64
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:39,610
and the only God of War
in all realms, Mo Yuan

65
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,317
he's so weak that he relies
on the wisp of

66
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,023
someone else's celestial aura
to survive.

67
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:46,541
Mo Yuan?

68
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,786
He's Mo Yuan?

69
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:53,987
It's him, but not him.

70
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,990
Mo Yuan is here.

71
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,793
He's been here in West Sea
for 600 years.

72
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,452
<i>Do you know that Kunlun Mountain
has been deserted for 70,000 years</i>

73
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:14,225
<i>and your 16 disciples are wandering
around all four seas in search of you?</i>

74
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,452
<i>Do you know that your Seventeenth
fed you a bowl of blood from her heart</i>

75
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:23,064
<i>for 70,000 years every day
just to keep your body intact?</i>

76
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,266
<i>Mo Yuan, you've finally returned!</i>

77
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,040
Master?

78
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,620
Is it you, Master?

79
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,101
<i>What is happening?</i>

80
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,773
Ninth Senior!

81
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,268
Wait for me...

82
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:11,097
Master...

83
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,345
Master...

84
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,969
I haven't dreamed of the battle
by Ruoshui Riverbank for some time.

85
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,087
What is the matter with me?

86
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,597
I still can't believe it.

87
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:45,585
Mo Yuan has really returned?

88
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:51,352
Zhen, stay here.

89
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll bring Qian Qian here.

90
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,118
You're telling Qian Qian about this?

91
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,115
This is her mentor.

92
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,427
The man she fed blood from
her heart for 70,000 years.

93
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,477
The man she's been
waiting for for 70,000 years.

94
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,244
I definitely have to let her know
right away and bring her here.

95
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,296
No, you can't do that yet.

96
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:13,745
You mean... Ye Hua?

97
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:17,849
Yes, I'm worried what
Ye Hua might think.

98
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:21,038
You have to remember that he's the
Crown Prince of the Celestial Tribe.

99
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,561
If he learns that his fiancée has
treated another man in such a way

100
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:28,775
it still seems inappropriate
even if he is her mentor.

101
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,378
Ye Hua already knew about Mo Yuan.

102
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,267
Back in the battle at Grand Ziming Palace

103
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,990
he rescued Qian Qian and Mo Yuan.

104
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,006
Have you forgotten?

105
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,354
This is different!

106
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,525
Even if he saw Mo Yuan's body then

107
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,075
he must have sensed that
his soul and spirit were gone.

108
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,407
However, Mo Yuan's spirit is now here.

109
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:48,878
Some day, he will return
to Kunlun Mountain

110
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:50,808
and restore the Celestial Tribe to glory.

111
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,554
This will then be different.

112
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:57,480
Mo Yuan would then be
a true living being to him.

113
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,024
You do have a point.

114
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:04,054
It seems that before I inform Qian Qian

115
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:07,626
I should visit the Crown Prince
of the Celestial Tribe first.

116
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,442
Your Highness.

117
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,061
Why do you look so poorly today?

118
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,058
I'm fine. What is it?

119
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,096
High God Zhe Yan is here.

120
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,258
Zhe Yan?

121
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:44,735
High God Zhe Yan.

122
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,081
Crown Prince.

123
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,496
What brings High God here today?

124
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,129
Mo Yuan will soon be awake.

125
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,278
Is that so?

126
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,926
Is there nothing you wish to say?

127
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,884
No.

128
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:23,552
It's just that... I don't know
when he will wake up.

129
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,504
He's now using the Crown Prince
of West Sea's body

130
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,293
to recover his spirit slowly.

131
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,240
Judging by his current condition

132
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,101
it might take another 7,000 or 8,000
years to return to his immortal body.

133
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,282
When I visited Mo Yuan's spirit
last night

134
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:48,447
I suddenly recalled the year
Qian Qian was taken in as his disciple.

135
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,714
It was her first trip to Kunlun Mountain.

136
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,394
I took her there.

137
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:57,460
She heard that Mo Yuan was
the God of War and was thrilled.

138
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,532
She imagined Mo Yuan as a majestic
high god with three heads and six arms.

139
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,696
Even after having him as her mentor

140
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:14,827
she still couldn't believe that
Mo Yuan looked nothing like that.

141
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,567
You really didn't lie to me?

142
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:24,054
He really is the one and only
God of War in all realms, Mo Yuan?

143
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,214
What now?

144
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:28,966
You already took his Jade Purity Fan
of Kunlun and became his disciple.

145
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,797
Have you regretted it?

146
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:33,222
But he doesn't look like a God of War.

147
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,809
How do I not look like a God of War?

148
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:54,062
Master, your facial features
are so delicate.

149
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,342
You're just like one of
those pretty boys in those plays

150
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:59,393
who would meet up with mortal ladies
secretly at the back of gardens.

151
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:02,514
How could you wield
Sword of the Yellow Emperor?

152
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:07,620
Did you call me a pretty boy?

153
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,101
Yes.

154
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,570
Mo Yuan, I've sent you a great disciple.

155
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,309
You are in for some fun.

156
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,225
It was just nostalgia.

157
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,932
Crown Prince, don't mind me.

158
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,352
It's fine.

159
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,855
Ye Hua, have you ever doubted
that you could be Mo Yuan?

160
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,370
No.

161
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:55,115
But I did mistake you for him.

162
00:14:56,447 --> 00:15:00,455
Even up until last night
I was still confused.

163
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,211
I have to find Qian Qian now!

164
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,269
High God, please halt.

165
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:13,100
Is there a way to revive
High God Mo Yuan sooner?

166
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,312
You'd actually want
Mo Yuan to wake up sooner?

167
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,777
This has been Qian Qian's wish
for the past 70,000 years.

168
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:30,611
The sooner he wakes up,
the fewer days Qian Qian has to wait.

169
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,892
All right, I'll be honest with you.

170
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:45,243
In order to revive him
I need the Soul-gathering Lamp.

171
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,501
Soul-gathering Lamp?

172
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,764
High God, you're awake?

173
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,870
Wash your face first and
I'll make you breakfast.

174
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,004
Don't bother.

175
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:11,703
I'm going to have breakfast
with Riceball in Zichen Hall.

176
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,136
Do you think he'd like that?

177
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,414
Certainly! Little Prince really
likes High God.

178
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:16,682
He will be so happy!

179
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:17,798
I'll take you there now.

180
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:23,448
Forget it.

181
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,923
I'll go to the Realm of
Supreme Purity instead.

182
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,745
Why isn't High God visiting
the little prince?

183
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,066
He is after all not my child.

184
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,100
If I'm not attentive enough,
tongues will wag again.

185
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,015
I should avoid seeing him.

186
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:54,311
I've been helping Consort Le Xu
look after the little prince

187
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:58,389
in Zichen Hall yesterday
and finally get to leave this morning.

188
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,871
I rushed off especially
to greet Sister Qian Qian.

189
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,884
Since you're in such a hurry to greet me

190
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,169
why didn't you do so when we first met?

191
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,635
You had to wait until now?

192
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,477
Celestial Palace is unlike
any other place.

193
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:23,396
If it's a formal greeting,
it has to conform to the rites.

194
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,965
Only then would it demonstrate
the sincerity of the worshiper.

195
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,105
According to regulations
of Celestial Palace

196
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:31,741
I should have come to
greet you when you first arrived.

197
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:37,607
It's just that Crown Prince never
told me about you.

198
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:42,250
Yesterday when we first met,
I didn't recognize who you were.

199
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,303
Sister Qian Qian must find me impolite.

200
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:49,821
I apologize for greeting you so late.

201
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,673
This is my first visit
to Celestial Palace

202
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,612
so I know nothing of such regulations.

203
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:01,642
What you just said was quite interesting.

204
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:04,813
You may now greet me accordingly.

205
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:10,733
I... I already did just now.

206
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,973
That was it?

207
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,722
Your greeting seemed too informal.

208
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,153
What is this for?

209
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:49,997
I greeted you as a side consort
would to the legal consort.

210
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:54,240
This is now a greeting to a benefactor.

211
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,560
I thank Sister Qian Qian for
looking after A-Li these months.

212
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,824
I'm very grateful.

213
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,736
A-Li lost his mother at a young age.

214
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:06,903
It's because of your appearance
that he mistook you for his mother.

215
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:12,211
I hope that Sister Qian Qian won't
take it to heart if he offended you.

216
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,550
I won't take it to heart.

217
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,240
I do like him very much.

218
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,708
Crown Prince was very devoted
to A-Li's mother.

219
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,544
When she jumped off from Zhuxian Terrace

220
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,508
Crown Prince jumped in after her.

221
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,711
After High God Zhe Yan rescued him

222
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:36,674
he stayed in a coma in
Zichen Hall for 60 years.

223
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,471
Sister Qian Qian, look.

224
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,392
The peach blossoms in
the Hall of Beautiful Youth

225
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:47,002
were planted by Crown Prince
in memory of A-Li's mother.

226
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:52,083
His Highness hasn't been
happy for 200 years now.

227
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:56,671
Sister Qian Qian,
since you resemble A-Li's mother

228
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,083
I do think that it's fate.

229
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:06,580
I greeted you so formally in hope that
you could marry the Crown Prince sooner

230
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,497
and bring some comfort to
his half dead heart.

231
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:17,401
<i>This side consort is quick-witted.</i>

232
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,690
<i>She means to say that I,
Bai Qian of Qing Qiu</i>

233
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,791
<i>won the affection of Ye Hua
because I resemble A-Li's mother.</i>

234
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:29,833
<i>Fortunately, I've read quite a few
plays when roaming in Mortal Realm.</i>

235
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,782
<i>I could figure out
her underlying sarcasms.</i>

236
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:37,421
Since you've confided so much in me

237
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,643
I should reciprocate.

238
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:42,910
Sister, do tell.

239
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,459
Su Jin...

240
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,143
What you seek isn't what everyone wants.

241
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:54,943
It's best not to be too smart as a deity.

242
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,941
I don't understand what you said...

243
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,067
You don't?

244
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:03,727
If so, you should be grounded
for a few days to reflect on yourself.

245
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,424
Then you'll figure it out.

246
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,183
Yes.

247
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,585
There's no rush in getting up yet.

248
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:13,343
I have to remind you about a few matters.

249
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:19,346
I've always been greeted by
all gods and deities of all realms

250
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,813
according to the rites of Qing Qiu.

251
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,707
When it comes to a formal greeting

252
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:28,590
one must bathe and get changed
three days in advance.

253
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,320
Refrain from eating meat,
and burn incense.

254
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,768
Then three days later, you may then kneel
three times to kowtow nine times to me.

255
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:37,124
It might be a bit troublesome

256
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:40,002
but even if your husband
Ye Hua greets me so

257
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,248
I am worthy of such a greeting as well.

258
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,166
It's just that I don't fancy
having minor deities greet me so.

259
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,695
I find it too troublesome.

260
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,211
A salute is just fine
as long as one means it.

261
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:55,673
Next time, if you say that
you wish to greet me formally

262
00:21:55,673 --> 00:22:00,186
abide by Qing Qiu's rites
and not that of Celestial Palace.

263
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,490
I've overlooked the formalities.

264
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,982
Furthermore, my mother never
gave me any younger sisters.

265
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:15,279
It makes me uneasy to hear you
address me as Sister at your young age.

266
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,963
Address me as High God
according to the rules.

267
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:23,917
High God.

268
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,329
You're dismissed.

269
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:27,714
Yes.

270
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,705
I never thought that
Ye Hua was such a hopeless romantic.

271
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,276
He must have loved
Riceball's mother deeply.

272
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,157
If I guessed it right

273
00:22:50,157 --> 00:22:54,796
Riceball's mother must have been forced
by Su Jin to jump off Zhuxian Terrace?

274
00:22:56,412 --> 00:23:00,124
Judging by Ye Hua's temper,
why didn't he split her in half?

275
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,983
High God, you got it right.

276
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:04,029
He did it once.

277
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:06,753
What did you say?

278
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:13,124
When Crown Prince came out of his coma

279
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,632
he was frail and in great despair.

280
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:20,263
He acted as if he were a corpse
and locked himself up in the palace.

281
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,297
He didn't even care about
the little prince.

282
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,002
However, two months after he woke up

283
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,737
Heavenly God sent Lady Su Jin
into Xiwu Palace.

284
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:35,398
That day, Crown Prince drove a sword
right into her chest.

285
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:39,433
Heavenly Lord arrived
in time to save her.

286
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:44,939
She has been protected by Heavenly Lord
and moved into Xiwu Palace successfully.

287
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:52,535
Crown Prince only saw her as
the container of my mistress's eyeballs.

288
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:54,317
Eyeballs?

289
00:23:55,443 --> 00:24:00,892
She stole those pair of eyes
from my poor mistress!

290
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:11,905
Consort Le Xu said that
Crown Prince kept his affection concealed

291
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:14,105
in hope of making others in
Nine Heavens think that

292
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:18,693
he cared little for my mistress,
so as to keep her safe.

293
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:28,637
He fooled those deities,
but he also disappointed my mistress.

294
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:32,987
She thought that he no longer loved her.

295
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,477
Heavenly Lord never fell for it.

296
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,834
He had her killed in the end.

297
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,057
I've spoken out of turn.

298
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:02,412
Zhe Yan.

299
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:08,279
Did that side consort only
greet so formally because she saw you?

300
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,171
I haven't seen you act up in years.

301
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:15,490
I have learned much today
from eavesdropping.

302
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,107
Your fourth brother always blamed me
for sending you to Kunlun Mountain.

303
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:25,192
You were supposed to learn
celestial skills, not lose your wits.

304
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,974
You're no longer lively and naive
as you were when he mentored you.

305
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,230
I'm already 140,000 years old.

306
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,117
How am I to be lively and naive?

307
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:39,079
I really don't like
Ye Hua's side consort.

308
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,301
I've always preferred witty deities

309
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:46,602
but when they cross the line
and act as if they are smart

310
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:48,363
I don't like them as much.

311
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:54,669
You can't possibly have come
just to eavesdrop on me?

312
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:02,105
I'll head over to the Realm of
Supreme Purity first to wait for you.

313
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:11,096
Zhe Yan,  you had that expression
300 years ago

314
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:15,044
when you told me that my mentor
might be waking up.

315
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,681
I ended up rejoicing over nothing.

316
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:21,001
And now...

317
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:31,095
Will you not be excited if I tell you
that Mo Yuan will soon return?

318
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,038
You...

319
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:38,045
You're really not lying to me?

320
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,603
Lass, definitely not.

321
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,946
Some time ago, Zhen and I
went to West Sea for a matter.

322
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,683
We ran into Crown Prince
of West Sea there.

323
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:56,981
I thought that his celestial aura
was quite unsual.

324
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,984
So I used my powers to investigate a bit.

325
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:04,847
That was when I realized that
there are two spirits in him.

326
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:11,617
He's the one who is awake,
but the one that's asleep…

327
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,009
What about the other one?

328
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,336
The other spirit is that
of your mentor, Mo Yuan.

329
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:22,990
How would you know?

330
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:27,442
You learned that magic from me
at a young age.

331
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:31,454
Someone else is asleep in
the prince's body.

332
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:37,387
I followed the traces and found
fragments of broken spirit in him.

333
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:42,882
Who else in all the realms
could patch up

334
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:48,376
pieces of spirit with
just a bit of magic?

335
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,192
Only Mo Yuan could do so.

336
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:56,920
Moreover, he's the son
of Heavenly Father.

337
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,482
I was raised by Heavenly Father,
and we grew up together.

338
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:03,459
How could I not recognize
his celestial aura?

339
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:09,169
You told me that before
Mo Yuan's spirit vanished

340
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,730
he told all his disciples
to await his return.

341
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,089
I thought that he was just
offering you some comfort.

342
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,827
I was truly impressed when
I saw him last night.

343
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:23,132
Mo Yuan never disappoints.

344
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:25,907
That is one true man.

345
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,597
Master...

346
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:40,066
It took him 70,000 years
to recover to this state

347
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:43,166
and still, his powers are scattered.

348
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,784
He's in need of someone else's
immortal powers to recuperate.

349
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:49,618
Hence, Mo Yuan is now sleeping in

350
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:54,375
Crown Prince of West Sea's body
to recuperate.

351
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:59,974
I wonder if that prince can
cope with my mentor in his body?

352
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:05,555
The Crown Prince of West Sea
is just about mediocre.

353
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:12,376
His immortal powers are used to
nurse himself and also Mo Yuan.

354
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,571
As days go by, his body weakens.

355
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:21,519
It will probably take another 7,000
or 8,000 years for Mo Yuan to wake up.

356
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,722
It's just that...

357
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:30,383
Why would Master choose this prince?

358
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:36,055
Mo Yuan surely has his reason for
choosing the Crown Prince of West Sea.

359
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:41,429
He owed Mo Yuan a favor when
he was still young.

360
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,912
Let's just say that
he's repaying his kindness.

361
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:48,442
Moreover, the second prince of
West Sea is your Senior.

362
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:51,573
We'll regard it as repaying
his brother's mentor.

363
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:11,566
Lass, why are you crying?

364
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:20,040
This matter has been on my mind
for 70,000 years.

365
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:26,157
I'm afraid that I might
be let down again.

366
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:52,688
You were so eager to just catch
a cloud and fleet off to West Sea.

367
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,576
Why are you stalling for time?

368
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,987
After hearing what you said

369
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,826
I really can't stay put in Nine Heavens.

370
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:03,175
Even if my mentor isn't awake yet,
I have to visit him.

371
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:07,459
Are you afraid that you can't answer
to your fiance if you leave now?

372
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:12,771
I owe him a favor for recuperating
here in the Realm of Supreme Purity.

373
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,486
If I leave without a word, I'd seem rude.

374
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:16,990
But if I bid him farewell...

375
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:20,483
Forget it.

376
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:28,288
<i>Ye Hua... Thank you for
your hospitality these days.</i>

377
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,691
<i>Qian Qian, are you really
going to leave me?</i>

378
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:38,885
High God left this letter behind.

379
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,451
Did she leave any other message?

380
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,746
Not a word more.

381
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:56,308
It seemed as if something urgent
came up at home.

382
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,098
Her eyes were red and swollen.

383
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:00,663
She didn't even get to
visit Little Prince before she left.

384
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,053
You're dismissed.

385
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,281
Didn't she only come here a while ago?

386
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,344
Why has she suddenly left?

387
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:16,488
She has to handle a matter
back in Qing Qiu.

388
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,119
Are you feeling all right?

389
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:31,807
I've been waiting here
to ask you for a favor.

390
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:35,138
What favor could you ask of me?

391
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:37,902
It's your cousin.

392
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:41,935
Princess Zhi Yue is now kicking up
a fuss in Heavenly Lord's palace.

393
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:45,551
She's crying and asking to take
on the heavenly trial with Lord Donghua.

394
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:49,615
Only you, the Crown Prince of
the Celestial Tribe can stop her.

395
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,501
I already broke so many things!

396
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,529
Shouldn't you punish me to
a heavenly trial?

397
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,652
This is said to be valuable.

398
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,518
If I break it, would you punish me?

399
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,387
Princess! You mustn't break that!

400
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,557
If you do,
you'll really get into trouble!

401
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,025
Let her break it.

402
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:22,111
Crown Prince. Third Prince.

403
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:27,451
Cousin.

404
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,078
You wish to see Lord Dong Hua so badly?

405
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:34,433
I haven't seen him for over a month.

406
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,416
I wish to see him.

407
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:39,268
I also wish to endure
the heavenly trial with him!

408
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:44,156
Why does that Qing Qiu's Bai Feng Jiu
get to do so and I can't?

409
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:49,780
I'm also a princess and
Crown Prince Ye Hua's cousin!

410
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:54,935
Would you risk everything to see him?

411
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:57,881
Yes, everything!

412
00:33:57,881 --> 00:33:59,151
Break it then.

413
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,244
Once you break it

414
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:02,317
I'll send you to the
Mortal Realm for 20 years.

415
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,593
Really?

416
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:05,865
Yes.

417
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:17,422
Didn't I ask you here
to talk this lass out of it?

418
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,322
Why did you tell her to break it?

419
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,465
She knows she can't get
what she seeks

420
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:24,021
and yet she's willing to
risk everything to do so.

421
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,648
How many others are like her?

422
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:29,054
Why shouldn't I fulfill her wish?

423
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,376
What's wrong with everyone today?

424
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,592
They are all acting weirdly.

425
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:36,657
Uncle Lian Song!

426
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,248
I'm really going to endure heavenly trial
in the Mortal Realm!

427
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:42,358
My dear lass, quit stalling.

428
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,635
Head off to meet your Lord Dong Hua
whom you can't have.

429
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:46,742
Sure!

430
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,280
<i>Little Princess, we can't hold
this matter off much longer.</i>

431
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,150
<i>It's already been two years now.</i>

432
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,806
<i>Lord Dong Hua cherishes you
more than ever.</i>

433
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:03,141
<i>You're the only one on his mind.</i>

434
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:08,159
<i>In a few days, you must come up
with a plan to break his heart</i>

435
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,811
<i>so that he can pull through
his heavenly trial of love</i>

436
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:14,353
<i>and you can then head back
to Celestial Palace.</i>

437
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,943
Pure Consort.

438
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,722
Crown Prince.

439
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:36,715
Why does Your Highness look so glum?

440
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:39,418
Crown Prince doesn't seem
to be much happier either.

441
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,403
Ever since my mentor left,
I've miss her preachings.

442
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,507
I just took this fan out.

443
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:51,367
I miss her all the more
as I look at this fan.

444
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:52,471
Your mentor?

445
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:55,876
You're referring to that female taoist?

446
00:35:57,858 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>Aunt Qian Qian did get
herself a good disciple.</i>

447
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,188
<i>He misses her even now.</i>

448
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:07,840
May I take a look at that fan?

449
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,108
Sure.

450
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:16,498
Do you know what this fan is called?

451
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:22,797
Master left this behind when she left,
but she didn't say a word about it.

452
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:28,248
Your mentor once had
a chat in the palace with me.

453
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,094
She told me about the fan.

454
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,007
It's called Cloud Clearing Fan.

455
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,088
Cloud Clearing Fan?

456
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:39,019
<i>When Shao Xing was still a maid
in Qing Qiu's Fox Den</i>

457
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:41,898
<i>Aunt Qian Qian gave it to her
for self-defense.</i>

458
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:45,041
<i>Although she's no longer her maid</i>

459
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,302
<i>Aunt Qian Qian still gave this fan
to Shao Xing's son.</i>

460
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:51,644
<i>She must have already forgiven her.</i>

461
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:54,190
<i>Aunt Qian Qian has a sharp tongue,
but a kind heart.</i>

462
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,699
This is a magical artifact.

463
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:57,860
Please keep it safe, Crown Prince.

464
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,851
A magical artifact?

465
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:25,132
What are you doing?

466
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,483
I...

467
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,579
The fan...

468
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:34,751
The fan... I...

469
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:36,521
Crown Prince lost his grip on the fan.

470
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,201
Lost his grip on the fan?

471
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:40,105
How big is a fan?

472
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:41,719
He can't even hold it?

473
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,811
Why would you be on top of her?

474
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,998
This... This is a magical fan.

475
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:51,351
I fanned it lightly
and it suddenly expanded.

476
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:53,855
It gave me a fright, so I flung it out.

477
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:58,271
Yes! Crown Prince panicked and
I reached out to pull him back.

478
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:00,949
Then we both tripped over this stool.

479
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:01,989
Shut up!

480
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,750
Keep an eye on them!

481
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,239
I'm going to inform His Majesty!

482
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,492
Shut up!

483
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:21,400
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

484
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,523
When I went past Imperial Garden
with the other concubines

485
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:27,606
I really saw Pure Consort Chen
in Crown Prince's arms.

486
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:31,532
They even lied and said that
the fan is magical

487
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:35,362
so it expanded when fanned lightly.

488
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:38,217
They even claimed that
Crown Prince lost his footing

489
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:42,565
so he flung the fan out
and Pure Consort pulled him back.

490
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:44,295
They then tripped over a stool.

491
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:47,947
Your Majesty, the fan is right
before you now.

492
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:49,878
What is so special about it?

493
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,440
I'll tell you one last time.

494
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:16,793
Should I hear such words
from anyone in the harem again

495
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,922
it will be death penalty.

496
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,822
Including you.

497
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:25,505
If Consort Chen hadn't taken
that lethal arrow for me

498
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:27,128
I would be dead already.

499
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:32,728
Her affection for me is so much
more than that of vying concubines.

500
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:39,615
Where did you lock her up?

501
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,275
She's in the Imperial Dungeon.

502
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,516
How dare you!

503
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,795
Father!

504
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,079
You have to believe me!

505
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,753
I've been wronged, Father!

506
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:05,547
I've been wronged.

507
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,530
I've been wronged, Father!

508
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,934
Father...

509
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:23,804
As long as you claim to have
an adultery with Crown Prince

510
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:27,077
it will surely be a huge blow
to Lord Dong Hua.

511
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:34,202
One is his only trusted son for years,
and the other is his beloved concubine.

512
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:35,838
Fantastic.

513
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,409
It's even better
than those written playscripts.

514
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,847
If you do so, my aunt would
have come here for nothing.

515
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:51,019
It's still the adultery between his son
and concubine that sow a discord.

516
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:56,865
However hard we try
we can't get past our predestined fate.

517
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:00,094
Forget about Yuan Zhen's predicament.

518
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:02,164
What matters is to fulfill
Lord Dong Hua's wish

519
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:04,237
to overcome his heavenly trial of love.

520
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:05,735
Greetings to Your Majesty.

521
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:14,987
Father...

522
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,336
Father...

523
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,262
I'm innocent!

524
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:21,384
I've been wronged!

525
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:23,114
- Father...
- Unlock the door.

526
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,143
Yes.

527
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,579
Little Princess, stay firm.

528
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,309
If not, Lord Dong Hua will blame us
when we get back to Nine Heavens.

529
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:45,019
Jiu'er, I'll take you home now.

530
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,498
I... I...

531
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,405
Tell him that you had
an affair with Yuan Zhen. Quickly!

532
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,851
I...

533
