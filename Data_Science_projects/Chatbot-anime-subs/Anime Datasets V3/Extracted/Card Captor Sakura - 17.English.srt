1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,339
It’s hot.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,717
And I can’t turn on the air
conditioning since nobody else is here.

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:13,115
No, that will just make me hotter.

4
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,790
I want to go to the ocean too!

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,099
Sakura-chan isn’t home, right?

6
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,004
School camping trip.

7
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,367
I wonder if something
on her desk fell over.

8
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,170
Eh? Yeah!

9
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,407
So Sakura is at the ocean right now?

10
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:45,391
[Sakura and the scary kimodameshi]

11
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,262
Sakura-chan!

12
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:30,901
Let’s play beach volleyball.

13
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:32,998
I’m coming.

14
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,777
Sakura-chan really is a good swimmer.

15
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,874
She was really looking forward
to this school camping trip.

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,784
She was saying
The sea, the sea, the sea, the sea!

17
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,055
The sea, the sea, the sea, the sea!

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,523
Sorry to keep you waiting, let’s play.

19
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:14,973
Sorry.

20
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:16,042
It’s OK.

21
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,046
You know something
about beach volleyball…

22
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,217
It started a long time ago

23
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,221
On the beaches of Hawaii,
using coconuts.

24
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:31,261
With coconuts?

25
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,366
And you know, coconuts
are heavy and hard.

26
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,068
Yeah, they are heavy and hard.

27
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,801
I hear that beach volleyball

28
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,607
caused countless injuries.

29
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,510
Eh!

30
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,272
It’s a lie. A lie.

31
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,843
Is it a lie?

32
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:53,345
Anything Yamazaki says that begins
with “I hear” that is usually a lie.

33
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,801
It seems Li-kun is a good swimmer too.

34
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,098
Really.

35
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,845
He has been swimming
all around for a while.

36
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:21,907
Eh!

37
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,311
I wonder if he is
doing distance swimming?

38
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:27,451
You know about distance swimming…

39
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,412
Yeah, yeah…

40
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,683
Gather up!

41
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:38,430
Long ago in the Edo era
there was a certain samurai…

42
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:39,359
Yeah, yeah…

43
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,499
Chiharu-chan is used to it.

44
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:46,038
I hear she has been with
Yamazaki-kun since kindergarten.

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,631
They have been together a long time.

46
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,774
It’s wonderful to be together
with someone for a long time.

47
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:52,907
Yeah it is.

48
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,910
And therefore putting the honor of
their house on the line the two samurai…

49
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,980
Yeah, yeah…

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,509
Pull it with a heave-ho.

51
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,380
OK!

52
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,686
I never thought we would
get to pull in a fishing net like this.

53
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,118
Really. Really.

54
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:11,692
Right, Sakura-chan?

55
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,102
You seem all set.

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,568
Yeah.

57
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,171
It’s too bad I couldn’t
bring a video camera.

58
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,975
1, 2, 3.

59
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,003
Heave ho! Heave ho!

60
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:28,837
Come on, you can do it!

61
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,376
Heave ho!

62
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,016
Try your hardest.

63
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,514
Heave ho!

64
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,518
Pull it in evenly.

65
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:40,324
Heave ho!

66
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,352
All right, just a bit more.

67
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:47,833
Heave ho!

68
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,847
It seems like
we got a big catch.

69
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:12,955
Sakura-chan, you’re good.

70
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,217
I always do it at home.

71
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:16,557
Really.

72
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,932
She’s right.

73
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,168
He’s skilled.

74
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,030
Amazing.

75
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,977
You can’t give up Sakura-chan.

76
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,310
I don’t think that is the issue.

77
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,150
Today with fun with

78
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,421
the fishing and cooking.

79
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:46,223
Yeah.

80
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,022
What are we doing tomorrow?

81
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,556
I think it was kimodameshi.

82
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,655
Oh yeah.

83
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,792
In that cave.

84
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,630
The cave we can see from the beach?

85
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,507
Yes.

86
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,707
Now that you mention the cave…

87
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,916
Do you all know the old story?

88
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:14,316
Naoko-chan seems really into this one.

89
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,415
Yes.

90
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,887
You know, a long time ago a
group of elementary school kids

91
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:21,794
the same age as us came here

92
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:25,120
for a school camp trip.

93
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:31,235
The first day they swam
in the ocean and fished from the beach,

94
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,568
so it was like a fun school trip.

95
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,669
But…

96
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,908
On the next night they were
going to play kimodameshi.

97
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,213
That’s the same schedule as us.

98
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,412
I heard they did it

99
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,218
in the middle of that cave…

100
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:52,153
There was a small lake
in the middle of the cave

101
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,255
with a bridge over it…

102
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,459
That bridge ran to a shrine
in the middle of the lake.

103
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,724
For the kimodameshi

104
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,967
the students were to go in pairs

105
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,737
to the shrine and leave a candle.

106
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:11,135
Eventually one group went in
and no matter how long they waited,

107
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:12,902
they never came back.

108
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,505
The teachers and
other students got worried,

109
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,349
so the went to look.

110
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,848
In there they found…

111
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,821
What’s wrong?
Did something happen, Kinomoto?

112
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:30,827
Eh?

113
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,391
Sensei.

114
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,796
The door opened so suddenly

115
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,333
it surprised us.

116
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:42,498
Sorry. Sorry.

117
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,774
Sorry about surprising you,

118
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,642
but it is past light out time.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,805
Hurry and go to sleep.

120
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:49,413
OK!

121
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,130
It’s no good,
I am too scared to sleep.

122
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,112
I will tell them I am scared

123
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,446
and ask the teachers
if I can stay with them.

124
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,545
I wonder if they will laugh at me.

125
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:28,980
That doesn’t matter,
even if they do laugh at me.

126
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,784
It’s better than being scared.

127
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,462
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:41,658
Eh?

129
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,035
You surprised me.

130
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,734
I was surprised too.

131
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,050
You went over to that
cliff during the day, right?

132
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,680
I felt a strange aura from that cave.

133
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,020
A Clow Card?

134
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:07,551
No.

135
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,252
Then maybe a g-g-g…

136
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,491
Are you trying to say ghost?

137
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,898
I can’t tell what it is yet.

138
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:19,438
I felt a strange aura from the
cliff just a little while ago.

139
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,271
I think I just saw something.

140
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,205
Stop it!

141
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,384
Let’s talk about something else.
OK? OK?

142
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:35,688
You’re the one who asked.

143
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,820
You came from Hong Kong right?

144
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,030
Yeah.

145
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,264
With your whole family?

146
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:49,826
No.

147
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,164
By yourself?

148
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,671
Along with Wei.

149
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,304
Wei?

150
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:01,146
A person who has been taking
care of me since I was little.

151
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,981
He must be a nice person.

152
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,148
Why do you know that?

153
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,421
You seem somehow happy.

154
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,224
I’m going to sleep.

155
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,523
Wait. Li-kun!

156
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:38,343
If you couldn’t sleep
you should have woken me up.

157
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:39,816
I would feel bad doing that,

158
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,685
and I talked to Li-kun
on the beach anyway.

159
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,184
He walked me back to the bungalow.

160
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,621
Is something wrong?

161
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,816
No, it’s nothing.

162
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,299
Sorry to keep you waiting,

163
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,491
we are going to
start the kimodameshi

164
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:30,925
you have been waiting for.

165
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,935
Deep in the cave,
there’s a small lake.

166
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:45,984
There you will leave
your candle behind.

167
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:46,843
Got that?

168
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,016
Yeah!

169
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:51,180
It’s the same as Naoko-chan’s story.

170
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,218
It’s a common story.

171
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,786
Naoko-chan seems to be having fun.

172
00:11:57,497 --> 00:12:00,694
In your groups split into
smaller groups of two or three.

173
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:06,898
The cave is a one way path

174
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,240
and ends at the shrine,

175
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,132
so you don’t need to
worry about getting lost.

176
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,169
Once you leave your candle,
come straight back here.

177
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,705
OK!

178
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,377
Well, let’s begin.

179
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:19,381
The first group.

180
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:20,343
OK.

181
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:22,914
All right, next.

182
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,048
Yeah.

183
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,648
All right, next.

184
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:27,820
OK.

185
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:33,622
It’s almost to us.

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,864
It’s OK.

187
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:38,700
I am sure there is a teacher
in there to scare us.

188
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,266
I hope it’s scary.

189
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,240
Kinomoto seems pretty pale.

190
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,075
Are you scared?

191
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,206
Are you OK?

192
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:50,774
I’m excited.

193
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,184
Naoko-chan.

194
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:54,577
Next. Next. Next.
We’re next.

195
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,785
It’s all right. Everything is fine.

196
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,257
OK, next group.

197
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,933
I wonder if Kinomoto will be all right.

198
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,347
It’s Terada-sensei.

199
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,023
See.

200
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,021
It’s fun to surprise Kinomoto.

201
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:43,168
Well, be careful.

202
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:43,969
Yes!

203
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,049
But it’s strange isn’t it?

204
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:07,521
Eh?

205
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,090
After the first Terada-sensei

206
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:14,258
there haven’t been any
teachers to scare us.

207
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:16,559
That’s right.

208
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:20,661
And I wonder why we don’t
pass anybody going the other way.

209
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,331
There should only be
one path through this cave.

210
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,070
It’s strange not to meet anybody

211
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:29,208
who has left their candle
and is on their way back.

212
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,448
It’s the same as Naoko-chan’s story.

213
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:36,579
Tomoyo-chan!

214
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,385
Naoko-chan! Naoko-chan!

215
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,219
It’s Chiharu-chan’s voice.

216
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:43,925
I wonder what happened.

217
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:45,861
Let’s go check.

218
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,670
What happened?

219
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,137
Naoko-chan disappeared.

220
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,701
What do you mean disappeared?

221
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,641
I don’t know why,

222
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,013
but she disappeared.

223
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,379
Right in front of my eyes.

224
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:05,883
Right, Rika-chan?

225
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:08,982
Rika-chan!

226
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,751
It’s the same, Naoko-chan
disappeared in the same way.

227
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:16,986
Chiharu-chan.

228
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,558
She disappeared.

229
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:22,627
This is the same as
Naoko-chan’s story after all!

230
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,363
Let’s go back and
let the teachers know.

231
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:57,233
What’s wrong?

232
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:58,260
Li-kun?

233
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,136
Tomoyo-chan and everybody…

234
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,608
They disappeared?

235
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,510
Yamazaki who was with me
also disappeared.

236
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:07,905
Is it a ghost?

237
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:11,048
A ghost erased Tomoyo-chan
and the others?

238
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,145
That’s not it.

239
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,548
Calm down and read the aura.

240
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,494
It’s the aura of a Clow Card.

241
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:41,741
Over there?

242
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,213
Yeah.

243
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,116
The problem is how to get close.

244
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:48,819
Can’t we use Fly?

245
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,615
We should get close
as quietly as possible.

246
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,592
So the card doesn’t notice us.

247
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,160
I’ll try it.

248
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,905
Envelop me and
carry me to that land.

249
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,474
Float!

250
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,353
Since we don’t know
our opponent’s identity,

251
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,885
we need to first find
its true form.

252
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,857
My compass can’t find
it’s exact position.

253
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,136
It worked.

254
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:46,941
Li-kun!

255
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,910
You’re disappearing too.

256
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,946
Calm down.
Since the card is acting

257
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,185
you should be able to
find it’s location.

258
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,219
Concentrate.

259
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,716
Can you let everybody disappear?

260
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,328
I’ll do it!

261
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:21,340
Over there!

262
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,042
Now!

263
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:30,788
Return to your rightful form,

264
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,681
Clow Card!

265
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,635
It’s the Erase card.

266
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,537
So that’s why everybody disappeared?

267
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:49,641
Here.

268
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,211
This is yours.

269
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,041
Without you

270
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,051
I would have just been crying
and not been able to do anything.

271
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:03,515
That is yours.

272
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,890
Li-kun.

273
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:10,892
Bring out Float.

274
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,459
Sure.

275
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,638
We’ve waited kimodameshi for a long time,

276
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,997
I don’t remember anything about
what happened in the kimodameshi.

277
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,236
Me too.

278
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:25,674
It was the same for me.

279
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:27,844
Me too.

280
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,280
I don’t remember anything at all either.

281
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,747
Was it a Clow Card after all?

282
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:37,480
Yeah.

283
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,524
Nobody remembers anything.

284
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,332
Why is that, Li-kun?

285
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,662
Erase also made their memory go away.

286
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,260
I see.

287
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,068
Thank you for yesterday.

288
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,047
It’s not like I’ve acknowledged you.

289
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,514
Sakura-chan! Li-kun!

290
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,746
Want to play beach volleyball?

291
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,257
Sure!

292
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,187
There is a history to beach volleyball.

293
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,097
In ancient Egypt there
is a saying that the person

294
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,435
who stays to the end
without dropping the ball

295
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,130
will have success in love.

296
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,569
Another pile of lies.

297
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,842
Those two resemble each other a lot.

298
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,412
Yes, yes.
