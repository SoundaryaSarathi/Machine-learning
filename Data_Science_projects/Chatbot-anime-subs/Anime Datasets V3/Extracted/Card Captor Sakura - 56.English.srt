1
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,718
Huh? That’s strange… this goes here…

2
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,531
and this here…

3
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,195
Something different…

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,002
Ah? Like this?

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,665
I get it!

6
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,106
I’ve got you now!

7
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,882
What’s wrong with you!?

8
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:44,957
I can’t get my head out!

9
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:57,730
What are those clothes for?

10
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,501
Tomorrow we’re having a bazaar at school.

11
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:05,478
Our class is running a cafe

12
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:08,077
to sell tea and candy

13
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:09,711
So everyone is

14
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,745
making uniforms like this.

15
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:13,715
Tomoyo-chan

16
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:15,487
designed that.

17
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,186
Ca…n…dy!?

18
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:21,252
I’m going too!!

19
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:26,166
I’ll go to the bazaar
and eat lots of candy!

20
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:27,930
Hey Kero-chan…

21
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,999
Tomorrow will be so much fun!

22
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:38,009
[Sakura, Kero and a Candy Encounter]

23
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:48,878
That’s

24
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,019
your suit for the bazaar isn’t it,

25
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,221
– Eriol?
– Yes.

26
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,853
What? What? What are you talking about?

27
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:00,167
– Welcome back.
– Welcome home.

28
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,403
I’m home, Eriol.

29
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,738
I’m home, Suppi!

30
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,067
Who are you calling Suppi?

31
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,467
But,

32
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,642
Suppi is so cute!

33
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,317
There’s a bazaar at school tomorrow.

34
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,818
My class will be
providing tea and snacks.

35
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:24,647
If you wish to come, you may have some

36
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:25,957
Really??

37
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:28,122
I’m going for sure!

38
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,353
Suppi, you come too!

39
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:34,162
– No.
– Eh? Why?

40
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,867
I don’t like sweet things.

41
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:40,801
Why are you laughing?

42
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:44,438
You’re the one

43
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:45,678
who told me to stay away from them.

44
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:48,909
I didn’t say never,

45
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:51,852
just don’t eat so much you’d become fat.

46
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,274
– Sorry for making you wait.
– Thank you.

47
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:02,655
Sakura-chan makes such a cute waitress!

48
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,317
Tomoyo-chan!? Hoe!

49
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,362
By the way,
what did you do with Kero-chan?

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,031
He’s hidden

51
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,733
in the woods out back.

52
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:17,467
Kero-chan.

53
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,839
Will he be alright there?

54
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,576
He just wants to have lots of snacks.

55
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,115
Yummy!

56
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:44,321
This is so great!

57
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,659
Lots of people have

58
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:49,936
come to the bazaar this year.

59
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,202
Really.

60
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,839
About bazaars,

61
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,732
the word bazaar
originated with the Nigerians.

62
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,007
At festivals they

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,977
used to call Zabaa, zabaa…

64
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:08,115
and so it was called Bazaa and

65
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,758
Whatever. Take this to table 3 ok?

66
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,791
In those times,

67
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:16,253
the most famous booths were…

68
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:18,488
Well done, Chiharu-chan!

69
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,289
Sure.

70
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:21,894
Well, he’s always the same.

71
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,370
Sorry for making you wait.

72
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,472
Thank you.

73
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,314
You were in charge
of decorating the class,

74
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,249
weren’t you?

75
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:40,279
Yes!

76
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:44,515
It looks very nice. Well done.

77
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,837
You two look very handsome.

78
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,406
Thank you very much!

79
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,907
You look very fine as well.

80
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:07,538
Eh? Um thank you.

81
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,852
What is it?

82
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,156
Nothing!

83
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,436
Two more orders please.

84
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,796
Ok!

85
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:39,143
Sorry for mak… ah!

86
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,649
– Good afternoon!
– Yukito-san!

87
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,218
Thank you for inviting me.

88
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,821
– You’re welcome!
– So… the food…?

89
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,060
B… Brother!

90
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,465
Well… ready to eat.

91
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,228
Ok!

92
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:14,108
Looks cute.

93
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:17,140
The outfit.

94
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:21,016
Teasing again? It was Sakura I meant.

95
00:07:21,322 --> 00:07:22,949
Yuki, have you forgotten your glasses?

96
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,351
No I haven’t.

97
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,222
I’ll get you some more ok?

98
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,176
What is it?

99
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,946
Nothing, just an odd aura.

100
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,619
It seems that Sakura-san’s
older brother

101
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,623
has noticed me.

102
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,200
I shall have to be careful.

103
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,207
This is good!

104
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:22,946
This is good!

105
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,944
Candy! Candy! Ca…n…dy!

106
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,618
Oh no, someone’s coming.

107
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,724
Sweet chocolate

108
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,785
and coo–kies! I must eat them quickly!

109
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,458
Suppi are you sure you don’t want any?

110
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,869
– Quite sure.
– Why?

111
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,805
I’ll eat them all

112
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,036
Do as you wish.

113
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,446
Ok, I’m going then!

114
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,616
Wait there

115
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,952
and we’ll go home together!

116
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:12,825
Chocolate and sweets…

117
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:15,261
Are very good to eat.

118
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,063
Don’t you know… it’s so much fun to eat…

119
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,101
something that is sweet!

120
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:38,489
There’s no one here.

121
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,493
I’ll finally get some peace and quiet.

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,197
Ah! That was close!

123
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,067
Time to eat some more!

124
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:06,218
Kerberos…

125
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,519
Who…?

126
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,364
This isn’t good…

127
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,328
this is not the proper time
for out meeting.

128
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,239
I’ll tell Eriol later.

129
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,084
You…

130
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,650
you…

131
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,020
have a big head.

132
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:55,827
My head is no bigger than yours!

133
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:57,937
If I am careless,

134
00:10:58,305 --> 00:10:59,829
he would have figured out.

135
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,007
I can only tolerate!

136
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:05,073
Wow! A talking toy?

137
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,339
I’m not.

138
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:12,077
Ah, I didn’t know there
were such strange animals in Japan.

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,745
And you speak the human language too!

140
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,997
Huh, wait a minute. Your form.

141
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,898
Those wings. That tail.

142
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:31,829
That round face!

143
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:33,195
He figured it out.

144
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:35,135
A fairy?

145
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:46,749
No matter it is me, or snoopy,

146
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,112
under the body-borrow circumstances.

147
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,252
I know our magic
is hidden in these forms

148
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,752
and he can’t sense a thing.

149
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,485
But a FAIRY!?

150
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,819
How would you like to be called a fairy?

151
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,261
That must be it.

152
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,102
Wow this is the first time
I’ve met a fairy.

153
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,797
I’m Kerberos,

154
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,297
the magical beast created

155
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:08,668
by Clow Reed.

156
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,668
But I don’t really look like this.

157
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,711
My real form

158
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,672
is much cooler.

159
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,215
Cool eh?

160
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,781
Even with all his knowledge,

161
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,256
he hasn’t figured it out.

162
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,658
Oh well I might

163
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,460
as well keep the deception up.

164
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:31,990
So, what’s your name kid?

165
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,993
Spi…

166
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,062
I shouldn’t say my real name.

167
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:40,468
Su… ppi!

168
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,233
I have no choice.

169
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,707
Su… ppi.

170
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,209
Suppi? That’s a strange name!

171
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:56,115
Hahahah! SUPPI

172
00:12:57,758 --> 00:12:59,487
How strange! Let’s be friends, ok

173
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,154
You are such a blockhead.

174
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:10,332
Huh? Something wrong?

175
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,265
No.

176
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,198
Might as well keep him happy.

177
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,238
I’ll tell Eriol about this later

178
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,172
Hey just a minute.

179
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,743
Shall we eat these sweets together?

180
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,085
Have you never had any?
You’ll like ‘em.

181
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,186
Actually I don’t like…

182
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:33,720
It’s ok, it’s ok.

183
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,690
Wait a sec.

184
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,570
You haven’t eaten it yet?

185
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:48,040
Come on, there’s plenty more.

186
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,904
Try this and this

187
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,244
and this and this…

188
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:57,144
This is good, too, and this…

189
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:03,120
Tasty?

190
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:06,826
Tasty?

191
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,757
What’s wrong? Do you not feel well?

192
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,897
Wasn’t that good?

193
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:19,500
Sweet things are so sweet! Hahahah!

194
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:26,042
More… more… and more…

195
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:30,506
Are you okay?

196
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:32,245
I want more!

197
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,716
Hey! What’s wrong Suppi?

198
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,155
I’m so glad you’re here Touya-kun!

199
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,261
Let go.

200
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,827
Don’t want to! Touya-kun!

201
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,103
– Do you want any more?
– Thanks.

202
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,234
– Me too!
– Ok!

203
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,077
I’m so happy!

204
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:08,755
Spinel?

205
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,024
Want more! More candy!

206
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:20,666
Thank you very much.
Found some.

207
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,500
Time to eat!

208
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,512
More!

209
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,919
He did this?

210
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,461
Let’s bring out more candy.

211
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:49,820
Good idea.

212
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,992
It’s gone!
Really? Where could it have gone?

213
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,094
Geez! Where’d he go?

214
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:59,100
Ah! It was just here! What?

215
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,633
Where’d…?

216
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,531
I just had it…

217
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,036
Why this happen?

218
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,778
Eh, all candies are gone.

219
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:12,343
Sakura’s going to think I did it!

220
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,552
Want more candy!
Yum! This way… ha!

221
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,227
Found you

222
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:32,037
Ready to eat!

223
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,768
Suppi!

224
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,676
I finally found you.

225
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,283
Want some?

226
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:48,379
Ready to ea…

227
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:50,817
Stop eating already!

228
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,358
Listen to me!

229
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:57,023
If you keep eating like this,

230
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,821
Sakura will get very mad!

231
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,035
What’ll I do if anyone comes!

232
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,066
Thank you very much for listening.

233
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:12,577
This is bad.

234
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,477
Hey, Suppi!

235
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:21,378
Why can’t I eat??

236
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,621
You meanie!!

237
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,373
What was that?

238
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,206
You’re so mean!!!

239
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:06,965
People are going to notice

240
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:08,559
if he keeps this up

241
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,100
That’s it

242
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:21,180
What’s going on…

243
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,075
Trouble!!

244
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:30,214
It’s bad!

245
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:39,762
Kero-chan!
I told you not to come in here!

246
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,498
No time for that!

247
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:43,531
Hurry and use SLEEP!

248
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:46,164
Make everyone

249
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:47,665
fall asleep quickly.

250
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,005
Why?

251
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:50,970
I’ll explain later! Hurry!

252
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:55,672
Ok.

253
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:05,549
Oh card Created by Clow.

254
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,888
Hear my words and be reborn.

255
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,956
I, Sakura, command you,

256
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,027
Sleep!

257
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,688
Alright!

258
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,824
Wait! Kero-chan!

259
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:53,106
Yummy!

260
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:55,997
Oh dear.

261
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:58,305
Meanie, go away!

262
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,079
No way!

263
00:20:09,356 --> 00:20:11,085
Stay away!

264
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,724
Will you wait a minute!

265
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:26,832
What? That was Clow’s aura.

266
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,433
Kero-chan!

267
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:33,141
It’s no use. He got away.

268
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,439
It was you!

269
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:37,013
What?

270
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,112
You ate all
the candy at the stalls!

271
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:40,475
And knocked down a tree!

272
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:45,252
And the stuff in the staff room!

273
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,891
No! It wasn’t me! It was Suppi!

274
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,225
And Suppi is?

275
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,560
He looks like this…

276
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:58,562
wings… face…

277
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,828
tail…

278
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,874
This is him. He did it.

279
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,206
This is…

280
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:11,080
Kero-chan isn’t it?

281
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,120
No! It wasn’t me!

282
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,617
And you promised

283
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,152
to behave yourself!

284
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:21,518
I’m telling the truth!

285
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,986
When you tell lies, they soon
come back to haunt you!

286
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:26,231
That’s mean!

287
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:32,229
Where did you go, Suppi!?

288
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:42,310
You seem to have eaten a lot of sweets.

289
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:47,645
I guess you like them

290
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,224
don’t you Spinel

291
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,449
You and Kerberos

292
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,886
are more alike than you’d think
