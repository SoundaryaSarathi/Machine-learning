1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>hajimete no kimochi</i>
my first feelings

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
<i>shonbori no mune ni</i>
upon my downhearted chest

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>sotto nagerareta hidamarine</i>
a sunny ray of light was gently thrown

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,610
<i>hitori aruiteta</i>
walking alone...

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>sora miageta toki</i>
when I looked up at the sky,

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>haru ga soko ni kiteta</i>
spring was near,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,680
<i>misetekureta</i>
it showed me

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>kowareru omoiwa</i>
these trembling feelings are

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,970
<i>maichiru hanabirane</i>
fluttering petals,

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>sukininatte iino</i>
is it okay for me to fall in love?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>soretomo</i>
or will...

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>tamerau kokoro ga</i>
my hesitating heart

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,100
<i>bureiki kakerukedo</i>
put on my brakes,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>kurushikute</i>
it's so painful

15
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>ikiga tomarisou desu</i>
I can't breathe

16
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,270
Wind flower

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,980
I thought about moving out of the house.

18
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,780
I love you, brother.

19
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,580
She's cute.

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,140
Honestly, she's a lot of trouble, but I can't leave her alone.

21
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,230
Where?

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:23,990
I was feeling constrained by forcing myself to think that she is my younger sister.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,220
That guy with the black jersey.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,490
Eh, where?

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Isn't he cute?

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,780
I can't tell; he's too far away.

27
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,080
Didn't he just look this way?

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,680
You don't mean that second year, do you?

29
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,680
He's famous for having a girlfriend who is in college.

30
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,270
Eh!? What a bummer.

31
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,660
Hey, what are you girls doing?

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,080
Teacher.

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
You girls look like you're bored.

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,680
Not really... umm...

35
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,280
Ah! I can't believe this! What's the meaning of this?

36
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,480
We should've just made an excuse and ran away.

37
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,580
He had that look on his face when he came to us, so it was already too late.

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm sorry. It's because I was too slow.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Why are you apologizing Nanoka?

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,480
It's because Yama-chan is a slave driver.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,580
Yeah.

42
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,080
Do you think this is good enough?

43
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,280
Yeah, good job.

44
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay, mission complete!

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,180
Hey, don't we have to put these books over here in order?

46
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,580
Hey Nanoka, it's fine. Let's go home.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
How much do you plan on spoiling Yama-chan?

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Spoil him?

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
You're so damn honest!

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,780
We don't have to do that much.

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,480
But I guess that seriousness is Nanoka's good point.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,780
I'll go get our stuff.

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,580
Wait for us at the front gate.

54
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,580
Okay. I'll go tell the teacher that we have finished cleaning.

55
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
Don't get caught again!

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,180
Be careful!

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm not that serious...

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,480
Nanoka!

59
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,480
Yes?

60
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,180
The bath is free! Hurry up and take a bath.

61
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,580
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm home.

63
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,780
Welcome home. You're early.

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,380
Yeah.

65
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,780
What the heck is this?

66
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,980
You should at least clean it up a little.

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,380
Don't spread out cookie crumbs on top of the newspaper.

68
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,480
But they keep crumbling.

69
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,280
If you keep munching on too many snacks, you're going to turn into a pig.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Pig?

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Oink, oink.

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,980
No I won't!

73
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,780
Just kidding.

74
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,080
Hurry and clean it up.

75
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,780
No! I won't, I won't I won't become a pig!

76
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,780
I'll do that for you Nanoka, so hurry and take your bath!

77
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,080
Oh shut up!

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,780
Oh, Dad...

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Hey, Dad?

80
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,580
I'm sorry, Dad.

81
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,980
Mom... Nanoka has finally entered her rebellious phase...

82
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,380
This little girl will take another step towards adulthood in this way...

83
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,280
Dad?

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,280
Why do you put on the innocent face in front of Dad?

85
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,780
Don't force yourself.

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,180
I'm not forcing myself!

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,580
How shocking... even my brother...

88
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,580
Why do people always think of me like that?

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,180
Brother's at work, huh?

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,980
It's boring...

91
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
Dad

92
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
Heat it up and eat it.

93
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
pack in the freezer.

94
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
Your lunch is the fried-rice

95
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
with Yamada-san and company.

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
I'm going to eat together

97
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,530
To Nanoka

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
Oh, you're there.

99
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,980
Yeah.

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,380
Were you still sleeping? It's past noon already.

101
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
What? What is it?

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,780
Hey, was there an envelope on the table or somewhere?

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,580
Just a minute.

104
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,080
Hello? The white big one?

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,880
Did you find it? The one with my company's name?

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm sorry, but could you bring that over?

107
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,080
You said never to go to your work place.

108
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,680
Did I ever say that?

109
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,580
Yeah, you did.

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Fine. I'm sorry I relied on you.

111
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,780
It's not like I can't go out. I'll come home and get it.

112
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,180
If you really need me to, then I can bring it for you.

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,980
Why can I only say it like that?

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,780
Nobody wants an uncute younger sister like me.

115
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,180
Oh, so sorry.

116
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,280
Did you rush here? I just needed you to bring it by four.

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,080
Was this the one?

118
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah. You saved me. Thanks a lot.

119
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,580
Yeah.

120
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,880
Well, I'll give you some money. Go shop around before you go home.

121
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,680
Umm... Do you think you'll finish late today?

122
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Hmm?

123
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,480
I want to go home together.

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
It's fine if you can't.

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
No... I didn't say I couldn't... but...

126
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,380
Saeki-kun, could you come for a minute?

127
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,580
Yes.

128
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,780
Then why don't you take a seat around here and wait for me.

129
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,980
Sorry for making you wait.

130
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,980
As for the membership, the members enter after we've given them a strict examination,

131
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,680
so there aren't any suspicious people...

132
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,680
Hello.

133
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Long time no see.

134
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Is coffee okay?

135
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,180
Thank you very much.

136
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,080
What a lousy brother, leaving his sister like this.

137
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,280
That's not true.

138
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,280
Umm... Do you mind if I stay here?

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
It's fine.

140
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,980
But isn't it boring for you to be here?

141
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,380
Why don't you wait for your brother downstairs in the cafe?

142
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,880
It's all right. I'll wait here.

143
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,780
All right. Well, I'm going to go out for a while, so take your time.

144
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Yes.

145
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
You must have been bored.

146
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,020
No.

147
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,720
What is it?

148
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,120
I just thought you were really different from usual,

149
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,220
different from when you're at home.

150
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,020
Well of course I'd be different at work and at home.

151
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,820
Brother, even though I don't really think so,

152
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,620
my friends at school say I'm too serious.

153
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,220
Since when? You're so lazy.

154
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm not! I'm not!

155
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,520
Which is it?

156
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,220
Right. You're right.

157
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,420
I'm a liar. I put on a facade.

158
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,620
Just like you said, even though I'm not.

159
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,220
Sorry. It's my fault. I said too much.

160
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,520
Everyone does that at some time.

161
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:52,820
Well, my different personalities at work and home must seem like a very dishonest, adult thing to do.

162
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,420
That's not true.

163
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,720
You were cool!

164
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,520
Then you should just leave it at that.

165
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,220
I don't care whether you're serious or lazy.

166
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,320
You call people like me liars.

167
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,220
No you aren't!

168
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,120
If you found out the truth about me, you'd probably hate me.

169
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,020
What? You say it as if you're so confident that you're well-liked!

170
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,820
Hey!

171
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,320
Idiot! Hey!

172
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Don't pull me!

173
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,520
Do you have to swing like that?

174
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,220
I had completely forgotten

175
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,220
the fact that I was even thinking of leaving home.

176
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,920
I wished she wasn't my younger sister at all.

177
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,620
I thought about such things...

178
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,020
Good morning, brother.

179
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,320
What is it?

180
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,020
Is something the matter?

181
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,620
Ah... No, it's nothing.

182
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,520
Good morning, dad.

183
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Good morning, Nanoka.

184
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,620
What? You still haven't left?

185
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Jeez...

186
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,920
Stop it.

187
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,020
No.

188
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,720
I said stop.

189
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
No!

190
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,820
Oh, good morning.

191
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Hello.

192
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,020
Good morning.

193
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,720
It's so nice that you guys get along so well.

194
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,920
My kids are always fighting with each other since their ages are so close.

195
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,220
Eww, don't do that. Stop it!

196
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,120
It's not. It's alright.

197
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
What is?

198
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,620
Stop it...

199
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,520
Hey brother.

200
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,320
I want to go out and play somewhere.

201
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,020
Go.

202
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,720
I want to go with you, brother.

203
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,020
Why?

204
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,520
Just because.

205
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,420
I'm too lazy, so no.

206
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,720
Recently, we've only gone on neighborhood strolls and grocery shopping.

207
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Isn't that enough?

208
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
It's not.

209
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,320
We went to Hakone over summer vacation.

210
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I want to go to a proper place.

211
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,720
Let's go somewhere during the next holiday.

212
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
It's a promise, brother!

213
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,620
I don't want to think about unnecessary things for now.

214
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,320
I saw it!

215
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,020
You and Nanoka-chan walking together last night.

216
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Nanoka-chan is so cute!

217
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,020
I can see how you can get so wrapped up in taking care of her.

218
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,520
What are you saying?

219
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,620
If someone who doesn't know anything sees you two,

220
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,120
it might seem like you guys have that  kind of a relationship.

221
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,020
Odagiri, come here for a second!

222
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,520
What is it?

223
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,410
Midori-sama will pour for you!

224
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,450
No thank you!

225
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,240
I know that I have to do something about it.

226
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,580
Drink if you're a man!

227
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
If you enter his room without his permission,

228
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,220
he'll get angry.

229
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,920
She's my younger sister.

230
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,120
Without a doubt, my...

231
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,020
Why?

232
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,220
Is she asleep?

233
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,920
Besides that... Why is she...?

234
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,120
Geez... You want me to jump on you?

235
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,320
What are you doing?

236
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,220
You'll catch a cold.

237
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,720
Yeah.

238
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,620
Aren't you going to get angry?

239
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,720
Nothing.

240
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,620
Do you want to sleep together?

241
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Sorry, just kidding.

242
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm going to sleep now, so go back to your own room.

243
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,720
Brother... what do you think of me?

244
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,020
You know how I feel, right?

245
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,120
I...

246
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,520
...brother...

247
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,220
Don't say it!

248
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,420
love you.

249
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,520
You know that right?

250
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,320
Don't say anymore!

251
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,820
Brother!

252
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,120
Don't say it.

253
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,120
You love me like a sister would love her brother.

254
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,720
No!

255
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,920
Saying that you love your sibling like that...

256
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,720
That's not what I want to say...!

257
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
Something's wrong with you.

258
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,020
No!

259
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,360
<i>yasashii yume ga</i>
a gentle dream

260
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,390
<i>sotto mune no haru wo yobi</i>
calls the spring in my heart

261
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,290
<i>yasashii kaze ni nari</i>
and becomes a gentle breeze

262
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,760
<i>kimi ni furete satteyuku</i>
that touches you then leaves

263
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,850
<i>chiisana potto ni wa</i>
in the small pot

264
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,250
<i>daisukina kimochi</i>
are feelings of love

265
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,830
<i>yurayura to</i>
swaying softly

266
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,080
<i>ii kaori nosete</i>
that carry a sweet scent

267
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>itsumo matteita</i>
always waiting...

268
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,320
<i>kono toki wo atatamete</i>
warming up this moment...

269
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,730
<i>futari dakara wakaru koto</i>
things we understand because it's the two of us

270
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,100
<i>kotoba janakute</i>
are not just words

271
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,600
<i>hohoemu dake negaudake</i>
we just smile, we just hope

272
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,720
<i>shizukana sora e</i>
to the quiet sky

273
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,510
<i>ashita mo mata aeru yo ne</i>
we'll see each other again tomorrow...

274
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,180
<i>shizukana sora de</i>
at the quiet sky

275
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,360
Dearest, it seems that Nanoka is in her rebellious phase, and I am all alone.

276
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't care about Koshiro, but I definitely want to at least secure my daughter's heart.

277
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,840
That is what I, Zenzou, am feeling in the Autumn of my 51st year.

278
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,210
Punishment of the Human Rocket!
