The rain's suddenly stopped, and the clouds
look like they've been wrenched apart.

24
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,940
The rain's suddenly stopped, and the clouds
look like they've been wrenched apart.

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,010
This became lovely moon-viewing sake.

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,120
I wonder whose work that was.

27
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,130
Musubi-chan.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,130
Uh... um...

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,030
W-What?

30
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,130
I'm sorry, but I didn't
think about how we'd land.

31
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,290
Ouch!

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,490
Huh!

33
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,820
Are you all right, Musubi-chan?

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,320
Yes, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,830
Um...

36
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,330
Excuse me, but who are you?

37
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,170
I-I'm sorry... Ouch!

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,170
Oh my! You're hurt.

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,190
Mi-Minato-san!

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,840
Musubi-chan, your clothes!

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,180
Ah, they're all torn apart.

42
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,840
So noisy.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,510
Is anybody there?

44
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,140
You are!

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
That should do it.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,190
Um... I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,190
Don't worry about it.

48
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,860
I just did what I was asked by Miya.

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,690
Miya-san... is her name, then?

50
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,360
- By the way...
- Yes?

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
How come you guys were there?

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Eh?!

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,530
It's... uh, um...

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,540
You are obligated to maintain
confidentiality whether you like it or not...

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,370
Um... we were blown by
a sudden wind... Hee, hee...

56
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,880
Sudden wind, huh?

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,870
Ah, well... ha, ha...

58
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,880
Well... I guess we can leave it at that.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,540
Minato-san!

60
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,220
I borrowed a kimono.

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,230
Ah, you're like two flowers
standing next to each other.

62
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,900
I-I'm very sorry. Even I ended
up with borrowing clothes from you.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
I like to meddle in people's affairs.

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,900
My husband was like me, too.

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,840
Those were my husband's clothes.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,740
Your husband?

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,240
No, that ugly sweat suit is not mine.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,580
He's passed away... her husband.

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,580
I-I'm sorry.

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,920
No problem at all. It's been a long time.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,260
Ah, I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Miya Asama.

72
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm Minato Sahashi.

73
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,590
I'm Musubi.

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm Kagari. Nice to meet you.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Ah. Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,270
Huh? Sniff, sniff...

77
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,440
Smells delicious!

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,770
I was preparing for dinner.
Would you like to join us?

79
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,340
But we have already
caused enough troubles to you.

80
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,810
"Grumble"
But we have already
caused enough troubles to you.

81
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,710
"Grumble"

82
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,270
Musubi-chan!

83
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,210
Thanks for the food!

84
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,950
It's so good!

85
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,250
Yeah, it's really delicious.

86
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,850
Ah, I'm so hungry!

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,460
Huh? Do we have guests?

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,640
Uzume, I always tell you not
to leave your room dressed like that.

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Why not? I'm wearing panties.

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,970
- Uh, excuse me...
- Yes?

91
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,310
I may be asking a rude question, but...

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,650
What's with this house?
I mean, you don't look like a family.

93
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,650
Ah, this place is...

94
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,650
"Maison Izumo"
Ah, this place is...

95
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,020
"Maison Izumo"

96
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,920
"Room for Rent... Maison Izumo...
Two meals a day included,
Rent is 50,000 yen/ month..."

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,290
"Room for Rent... Maison Izumo...
Two meals a day included,
Rent is 50,000 yen/ month..."
A board house?!

98
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:25,320
A board house?!

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,330
Yes. I'm the owner,
and they are my tenants.

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,430
Well, nobody but weirdoes like us

101
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,660
want to live in such a battered
and cheap board house these days.

102
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,330
So we're perennially
looking for new tenants.

103
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,000
Battered?

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,340
No, no, more like it's got "charm,"
or it's old-fashioned... you know?

105
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,680
Looking for new tenants?

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,010
I beg you!

107
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,180
We were kicked out of our
apartment and have nowhere to go.

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,340
Please raise your head.

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,360
My late husband was a person who
never rejected anybody who came.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,030
Then...

111
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,360
Welcome to Maison Izumo.

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,370
Minato-san!

113
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,700
M-Musubi-chan!

114
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,370
That's great, isn't it!

115
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,710
Miya, are you sure you
should accept them so easily?

116
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,540
- If they reached here by chance,
it must be fate.
- Musubi-chan, it's all because of you.

117
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,380
- This must be the work
of the gods and goddesses.
- Oh no, it's because Minato-san worked hard.

118
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,380
There's no reason to
reject them, whoever they may be.

119
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,010
I see. If you've already made up your mind,
I have nothing to say anymore.

120
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,560
Well, let's talk about the details.

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,730
Yes.

122
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,060
Takami-san!

123
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,400
What? The last number?

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,930
I understand. I'll keep watch, anyway.

125
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,360
This will be trouble.

126
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,280
Next news.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,920
"Shintou Teito Arboretum"
"Abnormal Growth of Plants"
Next news.

128
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,950
"Shintou Teito Arboretum"
"Abnormal Growth of Plants"
Regarding the abnormal
growth of the plants in the arboretum,

129
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,690
Regarding the abnormal
growth of the plants in the arboretum,

130
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,420
its management company,
MBI is taking this case seriously...

131
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,080
Ah, I forgot!

132
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,430
Oh, Mom?

133
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm going to be moving.

134
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,770
Moving?!

135
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,440
What are you thinking at a time like this?!

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
Ah, um... about my allowance...

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
Halved!

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,110
Eh!

139
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,240
I'll send you half the amount
until you pass the entrance exam.

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,810
If you are a man,
show me your guts!

141
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,450
I'm busy, so I'm hanging up.

142
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,740
Wait! Mom!

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,750
Ah, Minato-san...

144
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,150
Huh? What do you need?

145
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,760
We're out of shampoo...

146
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,750
"Natural Shampoo"

147
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,940
Hmm, at times like this...

149
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,140
Oh... modesty is difficult!

150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:06,480
Well... Everyone has some strengths
and weaknesses... What am I saying?

151
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,500
This is not a place for someone
like you to be this late at night.

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,830
I don't have anywhere to go home to.

153
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,170
You are a rare one, aren't you?

154
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,760
Ashi... kabi?

155
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,180
I'll let you join... my collection.

156
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,300
Come on.

157
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,110
This is it... I think.

158
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,280
Yes?

159
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Hey, long time, no see, Big Bro.

160
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,190
Yukari?! Why are you?

161
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,530
What a mess!

162
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,530
Why?

163
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,200
What are you talking about?
It was you who told me to bring some clothes.

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I told you to send them.
I didn't tell you to come out from the country.

165
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,540
I came to see the city 'cause
I was accepted to college here.

166
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,210
I hadn't heard that!

167
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,980
It was not so easy to tell you

168
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,310
since I just heard from Mother about you
failing the entrance exam for the second time.

169
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,380
"Failed Twice"
since I just heard from Mother about you
failing the entrance exam for the second time.

170
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,710
Since I just heard from Mother about you
failing the entrance exam for the second time.

171
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,890
Ah, by the way, Mother seems
to be here now for her job as well.

172
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,220
Minato-san!

173
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Where should I put this luggage?

174
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
Ah, she is...

175
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,230
Ah-huh, so this is what's happening.

176
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,890
No, there are lots of reasons for this...

177
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,900
So these clothes are for her tastes.

178
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,230
- Pardon?
- Hey, try to listen to me at least.

179
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm his younger sister, Yukari.
Nice to meet to you!

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,910
Ah! You're Minato-san's little sister.
I'm Minato-san's Seki...

181
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,910
Oops!

182
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,910
Musubi-chan, confidentiality, confidentiality!

183
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,740
Oh, you're right.

184
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,920
Hey, enough with the PDA.
It's broad daylight still, you know.

185
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,080
Huh? Oh no! I'm sorry!

186
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,260
But anyway... why did you move so suddenly?

187
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,590
Well, many things have happened.

188
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,260
I finished cleaning the kitchen.

189
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
Okay, then, let's wipe the floor together.

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,930
Yes!

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,940
Why did you have her change?

192
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,940
Because I brought them all the way here.

193
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,280
Don't you want to see
her in those clothes, Big bro?

194
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,450
You must be misunderstanding something.

195
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,430
Huh?

196
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,290
Well, I promised to stay
over at my friend's house.

197
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,290
Yeah, I'll e-mail you my new address later.

198
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,460
Musubi-tan, let's take
a bath together next time.

199
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,300
Yes!

200
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
You!

201
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Ah-huh!
You haven't touched these yet, have you?

202
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,240
Well, that...

203
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,980
Just kidding. See ya, Big Bro, Musubi-tan!

204
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Yukari!

205
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,980
You two are close.

206
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,850
We don't have a father, and our
mother's always busy at her job.

207
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,980
So we spent a lot of time together.

208
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,830
Well, we'd better start going too.

209
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,990
Yes!

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,330
You are so strong.

211
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,930
Because I'm a fist-type.
This is nothing for me.

212
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,010
A "fist-type"?

213
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,010
Then those two who attacked us
the other day are... lightning-type?

214
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,010
I guess so.

215
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,820
By the way, when you caused the
twister, you were saying something.

216
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,690
That was an incantation.

217
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,850
An incantation?

218
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,360
Well... the special words
to chant when we use major power.

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,030
Every Sekirei has his or her own incantation.

220
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,500
I see.

221
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,760
Our new lives start right here.

222
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,380
Welcome!
I was waiting for you. Come on in, please!

223
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,370
Yes, I'm indebted to you.

224
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,940
Yours will be room 202.

225
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Please go ahead.

226
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,390
Wow!

227
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,390
I've already cleaned.

228
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,900
Thank you very much.

229
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,230
Minato-san, I'm stuck and I can't move.

230
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,240
"Creak!"
Minato-san, I'm stuck and I can't move.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,300
"Creak!"
Ah! Musubi-chan!

232
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,700
Ah! Musubi-chan!

233
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,140
"15 Minutes Later"
Ah! Musubi-chan!

234
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,630
"15 Minutes Later"

235
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,410
We finally... made it.

236
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,410
Musubi-san, you are so strong.

237
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,080
Yes! Because I am a fist-type Sekirei.

238
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,920
You are a funny person.

239
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,250
Now, please come
downstairs once you settle in.

240
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,410
Yes.

241
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,930
Musubi-chan...

242
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,430
Yes?

243
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,260
The Sekirei Plan is
supposed to be confidential, isn't it?

244
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,100
You shouldn't say things
like "fist-type" and "Sekirei"...

245
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Ah! I got careless...

246
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,770
I hope it'll be all right.

247
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,610
Don't worry.

248
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,080
Whatever the President will do to you,

249
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,810
everything will be fine
as long as we're together.

250
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,150
Whatever happens to you,
I will protect you without fail.

251
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,220
Oh no! What a loser I am!

252
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,960
A girl said she'll protect me, then I
felt oh so happy, and ah so relieved!

253
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,460
Minato-san?

254
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,630
Ah, yes, thank you.
Shall we put this stuff away?

255
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes!

256
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,510
Um... Musubi-chan?

257
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,140
Yes?

258
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,480
Ah, well...
Thank you for your continuing support.

259
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,850
Yes, for many years to come.

260
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,820
Sekirei Number 88 and her Ashikabi...

261
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,500
Kagari-san, are you leaving?

262
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Yes, I'm going to work.

263
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,170
Oh, you're leaving early today.
I've already prepared dinner for you.

264
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm sorry. I promise to eat it when I'm back.

265
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,850
My.

266
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,250
See you, then.

267
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Kagari-san is working at a host club.

268
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,190
A host... I see.

269
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,200
I heard he is the number one
host in the club. Isn't it amazing?

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,530
A host?

271
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,200
Musubi-chan, do you wish such a
cool guy would do those things to you?

272
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,540
I'd like you to do
anything to me, Minato-san.

273
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,040
Anything?! Musubi-chan,
what do you mean anything?!

274
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,540
Minato-san... Minato-san... Minato-san...

275
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,600
Anything!

276
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,050
Dinner will be ready soon, so how
about taking a bath before that?

277
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,110
Wow, a bath!

278
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,620
Wow! What a spacious bath!

279
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,960
We can take a bath together,
and I can wash your back comfortably.

280
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,730
No! I'll take a bath later!

281
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,630
Huh? Minato-san?

282
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,900
I think I'd get dizzy
before I got in the bath...

283
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,400
Hot!

284
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I wanted to wash Minato-san's back...

285
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,620
Huh? Is anybody in there?

286
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,990
Ah! You're the new resident!

287
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,970
How could we survive even
though we fell from so high?

288
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,170
I guess this tree became a cushion.

289
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,150
Help me!

290
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I'm Uzume of room 203. Nice to meet you.

291
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm Musubi. Nice to meet you.

292
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,300
Ah, Sekirei symbol! You are a Sekirei!

293
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,930
See? Me too, me too!

294
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,910
Ah! What was... that?!

295
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,520
Now that I think of it, I saw her then, too...

296
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,510
What the?!

297
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,660
Whoa! Wait a sec!

298
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,330
I'm so excited!

299
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,000
Listen to me first!

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,330
I'm Sekirei number 88, Musubi, a fist-type!

301
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,010
This is my first real fight.
I'm inexperienced, but I'll do my best!

302
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,340
"Do your best"?

303
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,010
Here I come!

304
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,910
Time-out! Time-out!

305
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,040
I can't play with you now!

306
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,620
Modesty, modesty.

307
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,370
Hey you! You are her master, aren't you?

308
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,370
Heh?

309
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,710
I don't feel like fighting.

310
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,040
So, can you stop her?

311
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,540
Huh?

312
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,170
Ah! Get away from Minato-san!

313
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,550
Get away from Minato-san!

314
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,060
Mu-Mu-Mu-Musubi-chan. Stop, please!

315
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,390
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,950
Get away from... Minato-san!

317
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,400
Hey!

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,240
Girls shouldn't run around
dressed like that. It is disgraceful.

319
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,070
Yes Ma'am. I'm sorry.

320
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,740
Hee, hee, you've got in trouble.

321
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,410
Uzume-san, you too!

322
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,670
Yes.

323
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,950
I won't dare to ask you
the reason for all this,

324
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,090
but I will never allow any
violence in Maison Izumo...

325
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,180
Do you understand?

326
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,690
Y-Yes...

327
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,830
Dinner will be ready soon.

328
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,430
Miya is... very, very scary
when she's get angry.

329
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,830
She's laughing...

330
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,570
"From the President: There is an
un-emerged Sekirei in the arboretum!
First one there wins! It could be you
who makes the Green Girl emerge!"

331
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,130
These abnormally proliferating plants...

332
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,130
I feel something disquieting...

333
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,970
It's really like a stone door made of plants.

334
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,300
Homura!

335
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,800
It is thy misfortune that we meet here!

336
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,810
Today is the day we settle the
question of who is the strongest!

337
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,110
I'm really busy, you see.

338
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,480
Wait! Coward!

339
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,160
You'd better stop playing
around and go find your master.

340
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Homura!

341
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I don't admit... I don't admit it!

342
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,170
Ashikabis are just base monkeys!

343
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,170
Instead of having bodily
contact with such a being...

344
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,300
I shall finish him off
before my body is violated!

345
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,630
You can't get down?

346
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,530
Don't worry. You are just fine.

347
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,700
So, come on. I'll catch you.

348
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,850
Now... what's your name?

349
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,560
Ku-Kusano...

350
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,420
Ku-chan, huh? That's a cute name.

351
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,230
Hey, why were you crying?

352
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:44,360
It's all Ku's fault. Because Ku
selfishly said she wanted to go outside...

353
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,240
Help me...

354
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Please help me, big brother...

355
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,580
Ku-chan!

356
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,250
Help me!

357
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,240

358
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,650

- Minato-san?

359
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,590
Minato-san... Minato-san!

360
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,380
Musubi-chan?

361
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,100
You seemed to suffer from a
nightmare... Are you all right?

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,260
I was having a dream...

363
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,100
A dream?

364
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,940
The green stone door is still closed.

365
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,610
If we don't take action soon, those who
are after that will come to gather here.

366
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,210
I understand.

367
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,420

368
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,300

It's Miya.

397
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,900
Our Maison Izumo has added new
residents and become even more festive.

398
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,070
But this is certainly not "Girls Next Door"
or one of those programs,

399
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,670
so please don't misunderstand.
