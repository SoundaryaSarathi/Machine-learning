00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:14,306
Come on! Unless you
want to die, get moving!

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,797
I told you to step forward further!

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,976
Hey, hey, snap to it!

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,658
What are they planning
to do with the Namekians?

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,996
K- Kuririn-<i>san</i>, are those all Saiyans?

6
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:42,334
No, they're not. They're wearing the same
battle dress, but they're not Saiyans.

7
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:47,005
Besides, Vegeta is supposed
to be the only remaining Saiyan.

8
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,007
Not including Goku or yourself.

9
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,009
T- then...

10
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,346
Come to think of it, there was that guy
who said he was Goku's brother.

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,681
Our task is to go through space, searching
for planets with good environments,

12
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,017
and once we've exterminated
those who already live there,

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:04,289
we sell them for a high price to aliens
who are looking for a suitable planet.

14
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:07,690
It could be that these guys
are in league with them.

15
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,965
Though if so, I don't see Vegeta around.

16
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:17,457
Is he off somewhere else,
looking for Dragon Balls?

17
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:35,320
My name is Freeza, and as you can see,
I am gathering your so-called Dragon Balls.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,327
Incidentally, where are the others?
According to our survey,

19
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:45,819
there are supposed
to be ten of you here.

20
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:53,672
You intend not to say
anything, do you?

21
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:55,503
I will kill you.

22
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:16,294
6588...

23
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:23,968
6590... Whew... 20-times
gravity sure is tough...

24
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:28,640
But I have to thoroughly retrain myself,
starting from the fundamentals...

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,304
...or I won't be able to bear
multiple <i>Kaio-ken</i> levels...

26
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:04,506
Now, I shall have your answer, please.

27
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,630
Not in Namekian. Speak to us in
language that we can all understand.

28
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,966
We know that you
are able to speak it.

29
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,802
T- the others are out
working the fields.

30
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:35,306
Only those of us who are elderly
or children remain here.

31
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:38,810
There you go. As long as you
answer me honestly like that,

32
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,646
I will not do anything to you.

33
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:45,984
Now then, I will continue
to have you answer me, please.

34
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:49,317
Where is your Dragon Ball?

35
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,992
I believe there is another one here.

36
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:58,663
I- I don't know. We don't
have anything like that.

37
00:03:58,663 --> 00:03:59,998
Dodoria-<i>san</i>?

38
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:00,999
Sir?

39
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,335
As I recall, the second
Namekian that we killed

40
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,272
said something quite interesting, yes?

41
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:12,944
Yes. " We can only turn over the Dragon Balls
to those who we judge to be men of valor."

42
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:16,448
Yes, yes. He was a very
stubborn man, too.

43
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:20,618
I simply could not get him
to cooperate with me...

44
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:24,622
...but then I killed one of them,
to serve as a lesson to him.

45
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,953
What!?

46
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:31,126
Once I did, I got him
to say all sorts of things.

47
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,634
The seven Dragon Balls were created
by the Grand Elder of this world.

48
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:40,638
Each of them is in the custody
of one of seven Elders.

49
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:44,976
Each one is to engage in a contest
of wits, a contest of strength,

50
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,312
and to ask the reason
for one's wish.

51
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:51,316
And once each Elder
judges you to be a man of valor,

52
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:56,321
you are at last able to obtain
their Dragon Ball, or so he told me.

53
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:00,658
Well, I attempted to do
as I was instructed,

54
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:04,596
but he told me that he was absolutely
unwilling to turn his over to me.

55
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,933
I could not help but kill him.

56
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,270
H- how could you do that!?

57
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>And so, it took some effort</i>
<i>to find the first Ball.</i>

58
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,435
<i>The next three were easy.</i>
<i>Everyone was very accommodating.</i>

59
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:27,285
I see. So that's it, huh?

60
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,288
A- accommodating, you say?

61
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,291
You are lying!

62
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,794
T- that's right! There's no way
the other Elders would obligingly

63
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,296
hand over their Dragon Balls to you!

64
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,799
Oh, no, they became quite
accommodating once we did this.

65
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,637
Zarbon-<i>san</i>, please show them.

66
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,104
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,646
--Why, you!
--No, don't!

68
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,470
H- how could they do that!?

69
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:59,143
That was awful!

70
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:02,313
Gohan, control your <i>Ki</i>,
or they'll find us.

71
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:04,582
But I can't take this!

72
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:08,586
Still, you want to bring Piccolo
and everyone else back to life, right?

73
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:12,256
That's not the sort of opponent
that we can stand up against.

74
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:15,259
If we come forward now,
we'd just die for nothing.

75
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,261
Darn it!

76
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:20,492
And here, after we've come
all the way to Planet Namek...

77
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:28,170
How about it? Are you feeling
a little more accommodating?

78
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:48,189
What is your purpose
in gathering the Dragon Balls?

79
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:57,635
Oh, it is just a trivial little wish.
I would like to obtain eternal life.

80
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:03,241
What!? Then, he and Vegeta
are both after eternal life?

81
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,245
Maybe they aren't
friends with Vegeta, then.

82
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,712
I don't know.

83
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:14,651
I would not turn over the Dragon Ball to the
likes of you, even if it meant my own death!

84
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:20,591
So you mean that you would choose
death over handing it over to me?

85
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:26,325
I see. The people of this planet
do seem to be quite stubborn.

86
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,934
However...

87
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:34,272
...will you still be so stubborn
after the deaths of those children?

88
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,172
W- what!?

89
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,682
You would even kill children!?

90
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,533
Oh, no! Hide!

91
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:09,034
There's a strong battle power...

92
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,823
Freeza-<i>sama</i>, over there.

93
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,366
Oh, you've come for us?

94
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,976
Namekians!

95
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:20,967
They've come to save them!

96
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:51,342
Damn! Then our bad feeling
turned out to be true!

97
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:56,514
This <i>is</i> trouble. Here I was, just about
to have the Dragon Ball brought out to me,

98
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,684
when you interrupt your work...

99
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:02,620
...just to come here to be killed.

100
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,023
I see now. So the rumors about
someone attacking the villages

101
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,186
and taking the Dragon
Balls are true, are they?

102
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:17,966
You're going to pay for this!
Trample on the peace of Namek, will you!?

103
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,650
Be careful fighting them!
These guys are quite strong!

104
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,481
Good luck!

105
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:42,326
Oh, you plan to fight, do you?
I wonder how much battle power they have.

106
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,995
Dodoria-<i>san</i>?

107
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,986
Yes sir, I will check.

108
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:02,503
Please do not be discouraged, sir.
All three are around 1000.

109
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:16,294
We will not even
be needed to fight them.

110
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:18,629
<i>So that's it. I get it.</i>

111
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,133
<i>So that's how they can pinpoint</i>
<i>the few small villages</i>

112
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,636
<i>that dot the vast surface of Namek.</i>

113
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:30,308
<i>lt's because they can search</i>
<i>for us with those devices.</i>

114
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,644
9998...

115
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:37,315
9999...

116
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:40,978
10,000...

117
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,662
I'm so hungry...

118
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:28,966
<i>Vegeta, and someone even more</i>
<i>incredible than him, are up ahead...</i>

119
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,456
All right!

120
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:44,137
This is laughable! You want to tangle
with us with a battle power of 1000!?

121
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:55,326
Not true. Those three are just suppressing
their <i>Ki</i>. Don't they even know that?

122
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:59,490
The Saiyans were surprised
about that, too, huh?

123
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,832
Get them!

124
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:51,468
What is this? You call
<i>that</i> a battle power of 1000?

125
00:15:56,313 --> 00:16:00,147
What's going on here? All three
of them have increased to 3000.

126
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,598
Way to go! Awesome!

127
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,267
Hang in there!

128
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,269
Oh, my, they fight
pretty well, do they not?

129
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,941
I've got it. The Namekians are a race
that can control their battle powers.

130
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,277
That's not a type
you see very often.

131
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:30,111
Way to go! Hang in there!
Go on! Go on! Let them have it!

132
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:47,298
<i>All right, including his, there are only</i>
<i>three devices that have not been destroyed.</i>

133
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:51,291
Children, stand back from me.

134
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,632
Quickly!

135
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,975
Dodoria-<i>san</i>...

136
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,311
Yes, sir.

137
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,802
Those guys are pathetic.

138
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,649
Now I have to be put out.

139
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,925
May I take care
of all three of them?

140
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,825
Feel free.

141
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,515
Y- you bastard, you think you can
defeat me with such a puny technique?

142
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,183
Elder!

143
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,248
No! He was targeting the Scouters!

144
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,584
Scouters?

145
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:17,645
Those devices that can tell
your opponent's strength and location!

146
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:25,162
So that's it! Then they can't tell precisely
where the Dragon Balls are, after all!

147
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:27,998
Using those Scouter things,
they just searched out Namekians,

148
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,933
then forced them out of them!

149
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:34,495
That old man knew that, so that's why
he destroyed all of their Scouters!

150
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,169
Why, you-!

151
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:48,517
I- I'll kill you all...

152
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,530
I'll kill you all!!

153
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:06,303
I'll kill each and every one of you!

154
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,861
Elder! Look out!

155
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:37,668
<i>The Elder had made a quick-witted attack.</i>
<i>However, it has set the enemy's fury ablaze.</i>

156
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:44,164
<i>Can Gohan and Kuririn</i>
<i>do nothing but watch on?</i>
