1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,076
Tomorrow, we’ll be meeting
at school at 7:00 AM,

2
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:11,175
and head to the rink by bus.

3
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,385
Everyone be sure to be on time.

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,888
Okay!

5
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,790
It’ll be cold there,
so wear warm clothes.

6
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,817
And don’t forget your gloves.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,785
Okay!

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,361
I thought it was cold, but this…

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,392
Shao Lan, let’s hurry home!

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,269
Thanks for waiting!

11
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:37,572
Hey, wait up!

12
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,310
You know, Kero…

13
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:41,911
What happened?

14
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,219
Tomoyo, look.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,450
There’s ice here.

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,782
Oh, ice is going to be slippery.

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,594
Sakura, are you hurt?

18
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,061
No.

19
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,558
I wonder if tomorrow’s skating
will go alright.

20
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:02,936
It’ll be fine.

21
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,031
You’re great at sports, after all.

22
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:09,169
Even though it’s your first time, I’m
sure you’ll get the hang of it quick.

23
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:10,405
I wonder.

24
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:12,004
I’m still a little worried.

25
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:14,041
But I’m looking forward to it!

26
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:30,259
[Sakura and the Cold Ice Skating]

27
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:41,865
I’m home!

28
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:43,666
Eh?

29
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,775
These shoes…

30
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:52,142
Welcome home, Sakura.

31
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:54,345
Yukito!

32
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:56,820
H… hello!

33
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:58,121
Dinner is ready.

34
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:58,923
Eh?

35
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:00,924
You made it today?

36
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:03,794
Dad made it before he left.

37
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:08,196
Dad left on a business trip…

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,465
It was very tasty.

39
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,907
Yukito is staying
at our house tonight…

40
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,271
Schweeet!

41
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,453
Maybe I should make something to eat…

42
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:33,819
Didn’t you just finish
eating dinner?

43
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:35,985
But Yukito eats a lot.

44
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,593
He might be hungry again.

45
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,064
He came to study for college
entrance exams, didn’t he?

46
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,595
If he eats too much, he’ll get sleepy.

47
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:45,195
I see…

48
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,863
Of course it is!

49
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:49,865
Then I’ll take him some more tea!

50
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,351
It’s cold tonight,

51
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,851
better make some HOT tea!

52
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,031
What’re you doing?

53
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,599
I thought I’d bring you guys some tea.

54
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:20,830
Arigato.

55
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:24,469
It’s late.

56
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:25,707
Go to bed and sleep.

57
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:27,508
Good night.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,821
I made the tea and everything…

59
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:43,919
But I didn’t get to see Yukito.

60
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,156
Sakura.

61
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,031
Eh?

62
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:48,959
Thanks for the tea.

63
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,970
No… problem…

64
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,205
Better not catch a cold.

65
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:55,633
Good night.

66
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,767
Okay!

67
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:57,870
Good night!

68
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,250
Schweeet!

69
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,049
I’m so happy!

70
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:12,190
Okay, Sakura

71
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,583
Cut it out!

72
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,928
I’m gonna get sick!

73
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:16,285
Oh yeah,

74
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,425
tomorrow is the skating trip.

75
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:20,697
Good night, Kero.

76
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,079
Who… are you?

77
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,063
A dream…

78
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:29,865
What is it?

79
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,736
I had a dream.

80
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,308
I saw it before, too.
It keeps coming back.

81
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,581
It’s gradually getting clearer.

82
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,182
The moon is out.

83
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,555
It’s a full moon.

84
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,770
There’s someone with long hair there.

85
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,481
G… good morning!

86
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:22,782
Good morning, Sakura.

87
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:23,917
Go sleep some more.

88
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:26,219
What’s with making
breakfast so early?

89
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,091
You’re going skating today,

90
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,092
so Touya is making lunch.

91
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,088
Eh?

92
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,760
Your lunch is that one.

93
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:43,503
Eh?

94
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:46,278
Just kidding, just kidding.
That’s mine.

95
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,839
This is yours.

96
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,481
Thank you very much!

97
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:56,653
It’s cold again today!

98
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,657
I’m off!

99
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,598
I don’t wanna skate
on a cold day like this…

100
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:43,528
Geeze.

101
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,837
You’ll warm up when we get there.

102
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,599
Usually

103
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,273
Mei Lin waited until the last minute
to decide to come.

104
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,973
She’s from Hong Kong,

105
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:56,077
so she must not like the cold.

106
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:56,975
Is that so?

107
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,078
Because Hong Kong is a warm place.

108
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,714
I read it in a book once.

109
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,623
It’s close to the equator,

110
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,119
so it has good weather all year long.

111
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,792
Wow, that’s great!

112
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,126
You know, you could live there

113
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,262
for a hundred years and
never see weather like this.

114
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,500
We’ll be at the rink shortly.

115
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:24,876
Okay!

116
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,992
She’s good!

117
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:43,121
Sakura!

118
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,223
All right!

119
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,746
How do you balance on these skates?

120
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,009
I fell, of course.

121
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,180
Are you OK?

122
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,632
Shao Lan!

123
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,072
Let’s practice together.

124
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:34,502
One, two. One, two.

125
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,122
Miss Mizuki is good at this.

126
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:45,080
Yep.

127
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:58,094
Yes.

128
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:05,342
Are you all right?

129
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:07,470
Yes…

130
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,751
Keep your feet about as far
apart as your shoulders.

131
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,452
If you keep it slow,
you shouldn’t fall.

132
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:15,186
OK.

133
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,984
OK, shall we try
it out together?

134
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,225
Yes!

135
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,855
Everyone’s trying hard, aren’t they?

136
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,762
Yeah,

137
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:25,825
we’re heading back in the afternoon.

138
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,100
Keep it steady, like that.

139
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:33,735
One, two. One, two.

140
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,598
That’s the way, Kinomoto.

141
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,442
As expected, Sakura learns quickly.

142
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,478
Shao Lan, are you OK?

143
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:45,683
It hurts!

144
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:46,950
And it’s cold!

145
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:49,520
You OK?

146
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,303
Cocoa, please.

147
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,801
I’d like a hot milk, please.

148
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,216
Mei Lin,

149
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,145
you want to eat lunch
with us over there?

150
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,955
If I take even one step from here,

151
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,452
I’ll break!

152
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,425
Are you OK?

153
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,757
I’m not OK!

154
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,258
I’ll come by later,

155
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,693
so let’s skate together.

156
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,935
Why is Japan so cold?

157
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,280
Let’s eat!

158
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:52,282
What’s going on?

159
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:54,142
My brother and Yukito

160
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,716
made lunch for me today.

161
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:59,321
That’s wonderful!

162
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,186
It’s almost a waste to eat it.

163
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:04,957
Let’s eat!

164
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,265
Miss Mizuki!

165
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,670
Wooo…

166
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:44,696
One, two. One, two. One, two.

167
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:51,134
Sakura’s got the hang of it.

168
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:53,370
That’s just like Sakura.

169
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,572
What’s going on over here?

170
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,908
Li, you’re missing out.

171
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,811
I’m so cold!

172
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,881
Come on out, you’ll warm up.

173
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,519
Look lively, and get out there!

174
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,622
Okay…

175
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,103
Actually, it is a bit cold.

176
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:23,171
By any chance,
is the thermostat broken?

177
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,042
No,

178
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:25,843
it’s been working normally…

179
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,228
Naoko, you look like
you’re getting sick.

180
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,696
It’s really cold…

181
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,728
I’m shivering too.

182
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,294
We don’t want you
to catch a cold,

183
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,068
let’s go back inside.

184
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:53,037
OK…

185
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,238
Sakura, Tomoyo,

186
00:13:58,578 --> 00:13:58,976
you all right?

187
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:00,312
Yes.

188
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,271
It’s a little cold,
but I’m comfortable.

189
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,445
OK, we’re going inside.

190
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:12,320
All right, I did it!

191
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:14,725
It’s cold!

192
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,621
It’s so cold, Shao Lan!

193
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,523
If you’re cold, go inside.

194
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,100
Thanks!

195
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:25,465
All right…

196
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,876
Even if I go inside,
it’s still cold…

197
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:41,946
Cold, huh?

198
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,887
It’s a little too cold.

199
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:53,666
May I have a cup of hot milk?

200
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,930
Something warm, please!

201
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,700
Can I get a hot coffee?

202
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:03,703
Hey, Mei Lin,

203
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:04,838
you’ll catch a cold.

204
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,140
So cold…

205
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,344
Come on, stand up.

206
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:10,780
Mei Lin, what’s wrong?

207
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:18,750
Mei Lin!

208
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,187
Hey, everyone!
Come in from the cold!

209
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:24,556
What’s that?

210
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,159
Teacher…

211
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:27,664
Sakura…

212
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:33,836
Tomoyo!

213
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:02,729
What’s happening?

214
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,362
Everyone’s frozen solid!

215
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:06,801
Stay calm.

216
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,265
Is this because of a Clow Card?

217
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:09,330
Yeah.

218
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,071
You and I probably weren’t affected

219
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,307
because we have magic power.

220
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,809
This is the work of the Freeze card.

221
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:16,705
Freeze?

222
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:26,783
Eh!

223
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:40,868
Release!

224
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:42,036
Jump!

225
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:45,735
Eh!

226
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:56,679
Thanks…

227
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:58,420
Never mind that,
hurry up and seal the Card!

228
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,181
Yes.

229
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,191
Oh!

230
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,151
Look out!

231
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,611
Jump!

232
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:30,213
Oh!

233
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:37,095
Hey

234
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:46,338
Eh!!

235
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,176
Dammit!
No matter how much I fight it…

236
00:17:59,018 --> 00:17:59,814
Eh!

237
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:29,379
Hey, snap out of it!

238
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,480
Do you want everyone
to stay frozen like this?

239
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:36,013
I’ll distract Freeze,

240
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,317
while you look for
a chance to seal it.

241
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,520
But… how…

242
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:43,056
It’s swimming in the ice.

243
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:45,425
When it breaks the surface…

244
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:47,054
That’s when it’s vulnerable.

245
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,032
Yes.

246
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:05,542
Wah!

247
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,399
Now!

248
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,206
Return to thy true form…

249
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,472
…Clow Card!

250
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,131
Huh? It warmed up again.

251
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,368
It’s hot!

252
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,513
Thanks, Li!

253
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:49,314
Where’s the teacher?

254
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:56,690
Miss Mizuki!

255
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,391
Would you take these to everyone?

256
00:20:58,898 --> 00:20:59,364
Sure!

257
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,891
Here!

258
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:02,957
Thanks!

259
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:10,908
Shao Lan!

260
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:22,519
What’re you doing?
