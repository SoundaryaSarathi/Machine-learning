00:00:00,-100 --> 00:00:07,470
"That Was No Idle Boast!! Son Goku,
an Audacious, Wonderful Guy"

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,730
You're strong! Enough that I would even
say marvelously so.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,720
Why, thank you.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,070
However, I am growing tired of this fight. I'm thinking
it's about time to bring it to a conclusion.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,070
Before the end, let me ask you, just in case. How about it?
Wouldn't you like to work underneath me?

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,740
It would be a shame to have to wipe out
all that power you have.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,750
You would be able to do work so much
better than Commander Ginyu.

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,090
You've got to be kidding. You really expect
me to accept that offer?

9
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,430
I thought you would say that. You Saiyans as
a group are stubborn to the point of being fools.

10
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,770
Well, there is only one route left for
you to take. Just death.

11
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,720
We'll see. It won't be so easy.

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,630
Such confidence! But I am aware of what you're doing.
While you say you're being serious,

13
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,730
you're still keeping back a good deal
of your power.

14
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,060
My secret's out, is it?

15
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,070
Keeping that in mind, the way I figure it,

16
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,750
using about 50 percent, or in other words,
half of my max power,

17
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,080
I can turn you into space dust!

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,750
What!?

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,090
That's a bit of an exaggeration! You're
trying to feed me too large a bluff.

20
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,420
It's been fun.

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,380
It's been quite a long time since I've had
this kind of exercise.

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,070
W- What's going on? Those two are just
staring at each other now.

23
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,400
Both of them are searching for the right
timing to begin again.

24
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,410
Besides which, it feels like we're about to be
crushed by both of their tremendous Ki alone.

25
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,750
Father can win this, right?

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,080
There's no way we can tell.

27
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,090
Their power is particularly greater than
anything we can comprehend.

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,090
That's true.

29
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,380
Yahoo!

30
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,390
H- Hey, you! I'm not this poor a pilot!

31
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,760
Why is it, with all my beauty and glamour,
and my super-cute face, that I have be
turned into a frog!?

32
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,760
Everything that's happened to me, it's
all those guys' fault!

33
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,440
H- Hey you, what are you doing!?

34
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,450
Hurry up and give me my body back!

35
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,450
I can't see in front of us!

36
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,460
Look out!

37
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,440
T- That was perfect!

38
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,100
B- Bulma-san!

39
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,110
B- Bulma-san, why have you come here?
It's extremely dangerous!

40
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,110
Bulma-san?

41
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,790
Huh? What's that?

42
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,460
Goku and Freeza are over there...

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,140
What?

44
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,800
Bulma-san, you shouldn't go there!

45
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,470
T- That's Freeza-sama?

46
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,090
It's a shame. It really is a shame.

47
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,760
If you were to become one of my men,
wonderful things would await you every day.

48
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,450
King Vegeta, Vegeta...

49
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,800
...and that lower-class warrior Burdock...

50
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,130
Every single one of them,
so terribly obstinate.

51
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,740
Dammit...

52
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,410
That's what cost them their lives.

53
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,090
H- How marvelous! Freeza-sama's body is
responding spontaneously to Goku's power!

54
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,770
After taking Goku's attacks, every nerve
in his body has a precise read on him. Is
this the power of Freeza?

55
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,440
Fantastic!

56
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,770
Bulma-san...

57
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,460
That over there isn't me! It's a frog, a frog!
I'm Bulma! You have to understand!

58
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,130
All right! Nice!

59
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,070
Ah, I get it! You're...

60
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,410
You've finally gotten it, huh!?

61
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,410
You're that Ginyu guy!

62
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,410
What are you doing hanging around in
a place like this?

63
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,750
You'd better hurry and seek shelter
somewhere, it's dangerous here!

64
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,750
That's not it!

65
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,770
Using about 50 percent, or in other words,
half of my max power, I can turn you into space dust!

66
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,780
He ain't bluffing...

67
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,200
What speed! I didn't see that at all!

68
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
- Son!
- Father!

69
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,530
Bravo! What an attack to behold!

70
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,210
To think that I should be able to see
Freeza-sama's form like this! I... I...

71
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,540
Freeza-sama, I'm so glad I trusted and
stayed with you!

72
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,220
What are you saying, Bulma-san? Father
is the one getting beaten up!

73
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,550
That's right! Bulma-san, please go somewhere
safe and take refuge right away!

74
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,890
What are you talking about!? I'll never see
another fight like this!

75
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,230
I wonder if she hit her head or something
back when we left her by herself.

76
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,520
Again, I couldn't see Freeza's movement...

77
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,190
Can there be this much
difference in our powers?

78
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:47,870
Didn't I say so? If I use only half of my max power,
I could turn you into space dust, as I recall.

79
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,870
Dammit!

80
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,890
On you go!

81
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,230
All righty. Takeoff preparations
are complete.

82
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,190
Sensei, give Son-in-law our best!

83
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,860
Tell Gohan I'm waitin' for him here on Earth!

84
00:12:52,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Ask Bulma-chan to bring us back some souvenirs
of Planet Namek's cakes, okay!

85
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,550
Sit tight, Gohan-chan! We're comin' to
save you right now!

86
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,220
Is this for real? Are we actually going to
Planet Namek!?

87
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Yamucha-sama!

88
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,890
(Amidha sutra)

89
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,830
Is everyone ready for this? It's about time
for the countdown.

90
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,190
5...

91
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,840
1 0... 9...

92
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,180
4...

93
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,510
8... 7...

94
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,860
3...

95
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,850
...6...
...I don't wanna go to Planet Namek!

96
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,530
2...

97
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,200
1...

98
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,200
Blast-off!

99
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,200
Here it goes...

100
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,540
Y- Y- Yamucha-sama!

101
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,550
Lemme off! I don't wanna die yet! Lemme
off! Lemme off, 'kay!? 'Kay!?

102
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Hey, forgive me, forgive me.
I made a mistake!

103
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,260
Welcome!

104
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,110
Your speed is too low!
Anyone can see that!

105
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,890
What's the matter? Never mind half
my max power, I'm not even using a third!

106
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,900
Serves you right!

107
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,260
Looks like you're finally starting to
get a little winded.

108
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,920
Then again, it's amazing you haven't died yet.

109
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,330
l- It's no use. He's too strong!

110
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,770
To think he's this strong... !

111
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,110
Kaio-sama, Goku is still wearing that
heavy gi, isn't he?

112
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,120
What he has on now is only
tough, it's not heavy.

113
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,210
l- I see...

114
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,050
O- Oh no! Is there anything else?

115
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,580
Goku...

116
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,090
There's nothing to worry about, Chaozu!

117
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,090
Goku is going to win this fight!

118
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,930
Aren't you forgetting about the
Kaio-ken technique?

119
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,940
With Goku as he is now, he should be able to
withstand as much as ten times his regular power!

120
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,270
- Oh, yeah!
- That's it!

121
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,040
- All right!
- All right, all right!

122
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,200
No...

123
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:43,550
Regrettably, what he's using right now is
that very 10x Kaio-ken...

124
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,220
It' can't be!

125
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,140
T- This isn't good! There's too much difference
in their abilities!

126
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,230
Father...

127
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,570
Bulma-san?

128
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,250
That's our Freeza-sama! Against Goku...
such grandeur!

129
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,080
W- Who the hell are you!?

130
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,590
Who, me?

131
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,220
Watch out, Piccolo!

132
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:00,240
As Kaio's words cut off any encouraging news about Goku,
who is already using a ten-fold Kaio-ken,

133
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:10,570
is there any glimmer of hope remaining for
him? And what of Ginyu, as he closes in?

134
