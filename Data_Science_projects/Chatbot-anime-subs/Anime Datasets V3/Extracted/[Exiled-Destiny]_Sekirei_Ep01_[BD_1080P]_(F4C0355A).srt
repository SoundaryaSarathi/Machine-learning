1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,590
Don't let her get that back!

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,180
What's going on?!

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,550
Keep your guard up!

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,220
They're not human!

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,310
They're...

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,560
D-Don't come closer!

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,430
Fire! Don't hesitate!

8
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,930
Hey, Yu-chan.

9
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,870
You didn't stop me, so I killed all of them.

10
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,540
It's boring.

11
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,770
They're so weak.

12
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,740
All in all, this is an
unnecessary species, as I thought.

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,270
Don't you think so, Yume?

14
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,600
Now my life is blooming then falling

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,610
I grab destiny tight

16
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,010
There's no more hesitation anymore

17
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,610
Tying our bond

18
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,620
To the sky waiting for the dawn

19
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,450
Holding you, my love, tightly

20
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,620
I present an unbreakable prayer

21
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,830
We all are still in the darkness

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,460
Right now I just

23
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Want to touch you deep in your heart

24
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,640
And give you all of my overflowing passion

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,140
I spread out my wings

26
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,310
Toward the future of our dreams

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,650
On them are engraved

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,650
The feeling you gave me that day

29
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,150
The words of our oath

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,320
Will make a miracle happen

31
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,330
My pounding heart, take off now!

32
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,360
My wish can fly high, high up

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,670
"Nation of Japan, Capital, Shintou Teito"

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,350
- I passed!
- Lt's really there!

35
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,020
- How about me?
- Congratulations!

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
"Applicants Who Passed the Entrance Exam"
- How about me?
- Congratulations!

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,450
- How about me?
- Congratulations!

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,690
Minato Sahashi,

39
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,190
nineteen years old.

40
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,060
Cherry blossoms fell... a second time.

41
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm sorry, Mom.
I failed again this year.

42
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,870
Eh? What will you do now?

43
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,870
Will you come back here?

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,210
Sorry, please let me think for a while.

45
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,880
I'll call you again in a few days, so...

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,870
Bye.

47
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,880
Continuing on, news on the economy.

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,220
CEO Minaka of the giant conglomerate MBI

49
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,560
announced that his company bought
up 80% of the of Shintou Teito stocks.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,230
In response to this,
Teito organizations objected...

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,900
A company that can buy out the capital city...

52
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,520
What is all that about?

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,570
MBI, huh?

54
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,440
The company owns that building, right?

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,910
I heard that's the tallest in the capital.

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,250
Shintou Teito, huh?

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,250
I was attracted to big city
life and came to the capital,

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
but I failed to be accepted
by the university twice

59
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,920
and I don't have anything
else in particular I want to do.

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,550
Not to mention, as long as I'm like this,
there's no way I can find a girlfriend.

61
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,930
Get out of the way, please!

62
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,930
Eh?!

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,990
Please move from there!

64
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,410
Ah, it was too high to jump from after all.

65
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,280
Ah, thank you very much.

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,950
You caught me, didn't you?

67
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,620
Well, not really "caught"...

68
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,290
She's so cute!

69
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,810
Watch out!

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
There's no use running away.

71
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,300
Fight with us.

72
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,970
I don't fight, yet!

73
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,970
Even if you don't feel like it...

74
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,640
W-What's that "zap"?

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,300
We sure feel like fighting!

76
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,710
- Wait!
- Why, you!

77
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,250
Ouch!

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,330
Huh? I tossed and turned in my sleep...

79
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,000
And I ended up in such a place...

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,340
No! I didn't do anything!

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,570
Huh? Good morning.

82
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Thank you very much for the pajamas.

83
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,050
And I took the futon
all to myself... I'm sorry.

84
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,550
Minato-san?

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,690
S-Sorry! You'll change, right?

86
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,030
I'll wait outside!

87
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,190
Call me when you're done!

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,370
This is bad! This is really bad!

89
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,210
Real boo-boo-boobs!

90
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,110
It was not a dream after all.

91
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,350
We should be safe here... huh? Eeeeek!

92
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

93
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm really sorry!

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
For getting you into this.

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,390
Why did I do that?
I could've run by myself but

96
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,230
I grabbed your hand without thinking.

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,400
It was very soft...

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,070
A girl's hand...

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,400
Ah! I'm sorry I haven't introduced myself.

100
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,410
I am Musubi.

101
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,410
Ah, I'm Minato Sahashi.

102
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,010
Minato-san, I thank you again for saving me.

103
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,580
Oh, no! I really didn't do...

104
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
What?!

105
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,860
Mu-Musubi-chan? Musubi-chan?!

106
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,100
You fainted because of hunger...

107
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,440
I really, truly owe you my life! Not only
did you save me, but you gave me this...

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,110
OK, OK... Just eat as much as you can.

109
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,270
Yes.

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,450
But still... looking at her unusual clothes...

111
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,450
What was that all about?

112
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,450
Jumping, exploding...

113
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,290
On top of that, all those "zips" and "zaps"...

114
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,620
Minato-san!

115
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,160
Yes?

116
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,790
I'll tell you the truth...

117
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,460
You don't have anywhere to return to?!

118
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,130
Well, yes... so...

119
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,800
If it's not too much trouble for you,

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
could you please let me stay tonight?

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,140
Huh?!

122
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,470
Ah, eh... I don't mind but...

123
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,810
Great! You really are my savior!

124
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,150
Uh... by the way, you were chased
by somebody a little while ago...

125
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,980
W-What?!

126
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,820
I wish someone like you
would be my Ashikabi-sama.

127
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,490
Ashikabi?

128
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,830
Yes. I've been looking for a long time.

129
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,160
Someone precious, one who I haven't met.

130
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,860
We were all born for our own Ashikabi-sama.

131
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,510
To guide them to the higher sky.

132
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,160
Eh?!

133
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,180
What was that?

134
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Sahashi-san?

135
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,340
Ah, Landlord?!

136
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,350
Is there anyone else in your room?

137
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,520
Ah, it's just my friend visiting me...

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,690
Ah, huh.

139
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,530
This apartment house
is exclusively for singles.

140
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,200
If you bring a woman in...

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,540
You gotta get out immediately!

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,470
Y-Yes.

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,870
Minato-san!

144
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,970
Yes!

145
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,550
Ah, you finished changing.

146
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm... sorry.

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,220
Was I... lacking modesty?

148
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,560
Oh, your boobs... No! I don't...

149
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,890
Rather, I was happy... Oh, no! I mean!

150
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,900
Good...

151
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Well, you better not do that anywhere else.

152
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Minato-san!

153
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,530
Ah, I mean... I'm not saying it's
okay if you do that in front of me...

154
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,910
I'm hungry.

155
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,680
Ah, yes, I got it.

156
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:46,910
"Skyland"
Ah, yes, I got it.

157
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,610
"Skyland"

158
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,250
That was so delicious!

159
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,590
I'm glad you're satisfied.

160
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,260
Ah... she completely finished dishes for ten.

161
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Minato-san!

162
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,100
Please let me cook dinner.

163
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,270
Eh?! Really?

164
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,100
Yes! Please look forward to it!

165
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,910
Ah, then I'll just stop by the bank,
so go ahead to the grocery store.

166
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,940
Do you know the way?

167
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes, I do.

168
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,620
I want you to get out...

169
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,950
How can I say that?

170
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,210
Here it is.

171
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,960
"Donnamondas" family restaurant
has now reopened. Please visit.

172
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,630
Please visit.

173
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,300
Ah!

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,960
Hey! You're the guy with that cocky Sekirei!

175
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,700
You're yesterday's S&M costume ladies!

176
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,300
Where is that Sekirei?

177
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,370
S-Sekirei?

178
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,310
Minato-san!

179
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,980
I forgot to ask what you want to eat!

180
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,980
No! Run away, Musubi-chan!

181
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,050
Eh?

182
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,220
Too bad for you, meeting us two days in a row.

183
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,820
The capital city's small, huh?

184
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,650
You two!

185
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,020
You are too slow!

186
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,950
Musubi-chan!

187
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,670
'Cause you're with a man,
I thought you'd emerged already.

188
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,000
But it seems you haven't.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
Lucky.

190
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,280
Musubi-chan!

191
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,690
Minato-san?

192
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,040
If you do anything to her,

193
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,370
I will...

194
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,570
Eh?!

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,710
Why do you protect her?

196
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,710
You aren't her Ashikabi, are you?

197
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,380
Musubi-chan, run!

198
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,720
So, do you wanna die with her?

199
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,710
- M-M-Musubi-chan, run now!
- I... my body... why do I feel like this?

200
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,060
Hey!

201
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,250
Wait!

202
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Shit! He's running around!

203
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,140
Hibiki, let's attack them on both flanks!

204
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,510
That was rough.

205
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,080
What happened to you?

206
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,420
Your face is all red.

207
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Ah, Musubi-chan?!

208
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,090
What should I do?

209
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,090
What should I do, Minato-san?

210
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,430
My body is... getting hot!

211
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,100
Wha... Musubi-chan, hey!

212
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
I-I'm sorry!

213
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,330
Minato-san, I...

214
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,600
I...

215
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,770
This is bad... really...

216
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,330
Do you think you can escape from us?

217
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,980
You're trapped like rats in a bag. Now give up!

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,110
Ah, Musubi-chan?

219
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,190
Hikari, look!

220
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,450
That's bad!

221
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,230
- She's done it!
- Oh, no!

222
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,820
Who would have thought she'd
make contact in a place like this?

223
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,090
We let our guard down.

224
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,160
But... it's so annoying.

225
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,500
Now that she's emerged,
there's nothing we can do about it.

226
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,730
Anyway, would you die so we feel better?

227
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,160
Let Minato-san go!

228
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,380
You got tough all of a sudden.

229
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,540
If you don't let him go...

230
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,910
Tell me, what will you do if I don't?

231
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,950
Hikari, above you!

232
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,530
Not bad.

233
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,660
I underestimated you since
you've just made contact.

234
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,540
We don't fight against ones
who've emerged, on principle.

235
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, do your best to ascend to the higher sky.

236
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,890
We've lost our jobs.

237
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,560
So annoying!
Now we have to find another girl!

238
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,230
What's the point of fighting without a master?

239
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,230
Homura!

240
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,570
Obnoxious guy!
Were you keeping watch on us?

241
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,570
You only go after the ones
who haven't emerged yet.

242
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,240
Do you really think you
can win this game like that?

243
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,640
Oh, shut up!
You're just acting like a guardian!

244
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,240
Wanna fight?

245
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,910
If you wish.

246
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,590
Oh, crap! We'll get charred again.

247
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,260
But that girl seems to have met her master.

248
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,930
A fight between emerged Sekireis is...

249
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,950
Not my business.

250
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,600
I don't get that guy.

251
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,270
Well, there must've been others watching us.

252
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,940
What we are doing is a
battle royale staged in this city.

253
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,610
A noticeable rookie is easy prey.

254
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,950
Are you alright, Minato-san?

255
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,920
Forget that... your chest! Your chest!

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
What on earth are you guys?

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,290
We are...

258
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,060
Sekireis.

259
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Big bro, I heard you
failed the entrance exam again this year.

260
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,640
Yukari, your voice is too loud.

261
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,310
Well, I want you to send
some of your used clothes.

262
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,650
Yuck! What are you going to do
with a high school girl's clothes?

263
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,480
Big bro, you're completely
tainted by the urban life...

264
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,980
What are you talking about?!
You're wrong...

265
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,950
Oh, whatever!
I'll pick some interesting ones.

266
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,320
Normal ones are just fine. Normal ones!

267
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm counting on you.

268
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,530
Dinner will be ready soon.

269
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,070
This kind of thing is sort of nice...

270
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,810
Musubi-chan, then those two...

271
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,180
What are they?

272
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,350
She said they're... Sekirei.

273
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,250
I saw it with my own eyes,
and yet, it feels unreal.

274
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,690
Ta-dah!

275
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,360
Was the TV on?

276
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,700
Wait! Don't turn it off!

277
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,370
Congratulations!
You are chosen as the Sekirei's partner!

278
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,370
Professor!

279
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,710
Is he your acquaintance?

280
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,710
Yes! He's my professor
and the company president.

281
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,810
To think you can't even recognize my face.

282
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,720
You should at least read
newspapers, Minato Sahashi.

283
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
No wonder you failed the
entrance exam for the second time.

284
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,190
How could you know?!

285
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,150
There's nothing I don't know.

286
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,400
The Sekirei Plan.

287
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
That's the name of the game
happening to you right now.

288
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,930
The Sekirei... Plan?

289
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,410
Do you understand?

290
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:05,750
In short... Musubi-chan is what you call a
"Sekirei," and they secretly fight each other,

291
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,750
and I am her partner
who is called "Ashikabi," right?

292
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,320
Great! You're a quick learner! Ha, ha, ha...

293
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,260
But... even if I'm told
such things all of the sudden.

294
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,090
By the way, this is a highly secret project.

295
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,460
Now that you know about it,

296
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,460
you are obligated to maintain
confidentiality whether you like or not.

297
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,430
Whether I like it or not?!

298
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,570
If you breach in confidentiality we, MBI,

299
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,940
will bully you with all our might.
So, keep that in your mind.

300
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,110
"Bully"? "All your might"?

301
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,110
Now, I'm busy, so I'll excuse myself.

302
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,380
Wait!

303
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,780
What do you mean "bully"?

304
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,120
Well, take care of yourself,
Number 88, Musubi-kun.

305
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,450
Yes, Professor!

306
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,130
So what do you mean by "bullying"?

307
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,790
Yes, who is it?

308
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,990
Huh? M-B-I.

309
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,270
No! I haven't told anybody! I didn't tell!

310
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,900
More like, you got here too fast!

311
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
W-What the heck?

312
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Ah, my clothes!

313
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,810
Oh man! I didn't need to ask Yukari.

314
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,820
Hey! Wait!

315
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,160
I'll be outside!

316
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,750
Minato-san.

317
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,160
I will fight for Minato-san.

318
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,570
And I will definitely win.
So we'll ascend to the higher sky together.

319
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,230
Musubi-chan.

320
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,340
Landlord!

321
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,840
Here she is.

322
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,670
Uh, well... this is...

323
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,580
Get out!

324
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,440
"Apartment Info."
"Room Information"

325
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,850
You are a student who failed the exam,
with no guarantor. And what's your budget?

326
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,010
No way.

327
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,860
That was the fifteenth.

328
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,530
Looking for a room is hard.

329
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,530
Budget is a problem,
but more than that, the guarantor is...

330
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,400
There's no way I can ask my mother.

331
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,540
Minato-san?

332
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,210
Ah? It's fine. It's fine.

333
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,440
Now, let's go to the next one!

334
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,880
We tried more than thirty
and all turned us down.

335
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,410
Reality is harsh, huh?

336
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,030
Minato-san?

337
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,240
Hey, Musubi-chan.

338
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Yes?

339
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,740
Ashikabi... right?

340
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,640
Why me?

341
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,710
I'm not good enough.

342
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm nothing special. I failed
to enter the university twice, and...

343
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,350
Someone special like an Ashikabi...
I'm not the kind of person who can be one.

344
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,260
It's supposed to be a
beautiful moon out there tonight.

345
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,930
I like you, Minato-san!

346
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,940
You are special just because you're you.

347
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,370
My special person.

348
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,630
I can do anything you wish for.

349
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,630
I'll break those thick clouds,
and get to the moon...

350
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,120
And someday, I'll reach the higher sky!

351
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,730
My fists of the pact,
shatter my Ashikabi's perils.

352
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,310
Now, let's go!

353
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,330
Eh?!

354
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,580
Whoa!

355
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,660
Let me tell you a story,
from a long, long time ago...

356
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,000
Gods and Goddesses lived in a
place called "Takama-ga-Hara."

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,670
One day, a ship with the gods'
treasures came down to the earth,

358
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,000
and the ship was called "Ama-no-lwafune."

359
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,010
But it's an old story.

360
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,680
A faded myth not even written
in the ancient history books.

361
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,010
But the new legend has already begun!

362
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,180
One hundred and eight
Sekireis have been let out.

363
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,020
Sekireis must fight each other

364
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,020
for the Ashikabi whom
they choose for themselves.

365
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,030
And the last remaining one
leads its Ashikabi to the higher sky,

366
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,200
and grasps the fate of the world!

367
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,370
Now let's begin...

368
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,030
The new legend,

369
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,400
a lovely war chronicle,

370
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,500
a miraculous love story!

371
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,380
See? It's as beautiful a moon as I said.

372
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Yeah.

373
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,050
The spring when the cherry blossoms
fell for the second time in my life,

374
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,990
Musubi... I met her.

375
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,990
Feather 1:
"Sekirei"

376
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,730
I think I'm caught up in something huge...

377
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,060
Be confident, Minato-san!

378
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,400
Musubi-chan!

379
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Minato-san is a typical "caught up in
something bigger" type of character.

380
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,410
"Character"? What?

381
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,170
The second episode:
"The Door to the New Residence."

382
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:33,570
Feather 2:
"The Door to the New Residence"
The second episode:
"The Door to the New Residence."

383
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,010
Feather 2:
"The Door to the New Residence"
Please favor us again next time!

384
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,070
Feather 2:
"The Door to the New Residence"
