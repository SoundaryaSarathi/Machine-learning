1
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:05,174
As a child, I thought

2
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,614
your mother is just your mother.

3
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,884
A teacher is just a teacher,

4
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:17,024
and a police officer is just
a police officer and nothing more.

5
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:23,184
And celebrities were just celebrities.
They were different from me.

6
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:26,834
And I still felt that way, even now,
at twenty.

7
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:53,924
When I was darkness at that time

8
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:56,764
With trembling lips

9
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,854
In a corner of a room I cry

10
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:04,934
The more I struggle

11
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,774
The more this wound deepens

12
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,934
The broken promise hurt me

13
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,674
Nobody can save me

14
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,854
God, I have only one request

15
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:22,484
Stop tearing apart my love

16
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,824
I need your love

17
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:29,054
I'm a broken rose

18
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:31,994
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

19
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,164
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

20
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:36,934
I need your love

21
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:40,244
I'm a broken rose

22
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:43,174
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

23
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:47,134
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

24
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:50,114
I wanna need your love

25
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:53,344
I'm a broken rose

26
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,684
I wanna need your love

27
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:11,034
But this is such coincidence.
I'm surprised.

28
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,634
Yes.

29
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:16,564
Well, surprised doesn't even
begin to explain how I felt.

30
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:20,234
So, where should we go?
Do you mind if we get home late?

31
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,904
Tomorrow's Saturday. You don't
hafta work tomorrow, do you?

32
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,514
Yes.

33
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,544
What I wanna know is...
Is this reality?

34
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:29,214
Don't be so nervous.

35
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:32,094
Yes. I'm sorry. It's just...

36
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,894
It's fine. There's no need to apologize.

37
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,654
Yes. But... Oh boy,
what am I gonna do?

38
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:40,294
Now you're making me nervous.

39
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,964
Huh?! Why?

40
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,474
Because, well, I never imagined
in my wildest dreams

41
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:48,564
that I'd meet you in this manner.
I wasn't prepared for this.

42
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,634
That's my line.

43
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,564
But I was thinking how
nice it would be to see you again.

44
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,104
No way. That's impossible.

45
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:00,484
No, really. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have called you.

46
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:03,254
The truth is, I'm terrible at
doing the small things.

47
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:06,214
Yeah, this has to be a dream.

48
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,514
Because in reality,
these things just don't happen.

49
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:13,064
Even if they do, at least there's
no way it would happen to me.

50
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,444
Green light already?
What a restless traffic light.

51
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:34,724
And so am I.

52
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,154
He seems to be quite the player.

53
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:46,534
That dream-like kiss
abruptly woke me up from my dream.

54
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:51,964
This is not a fairytale. There's no way
Takumi could be a prince.

55
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:54,974
He'll sleep with me once
and dump me.

56
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,134
Wait here.

57
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,714
Should I go home right this moment?

58
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,284
I didn't plan for this to happen.

59
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:11,084
Hey, isn't he that guy from Trapnest?

60
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,754
Wow! Cool! He's so tall!

61
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,454
Then why did I get into his car?

62
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:22,334
I'm not that foolish to believe he would
even think of making me his girlfriend.

63
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:28,464
And I'm not that naïve to think this'll
end after a drive and dinner.

64
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:33,134
There must be a part of me
that was hoping for this.

65
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:39,074
There's no need to hesitate. I'll never
be in a situation like this again, ever.

66
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:43,954
I don't have a boyfriend now,
so there's no reason to feel guilty.

67
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,614
Think of this as creating
a once in a lifetime special memory.

68
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:49,824
Sorry to keep you waiting.

69
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,234
- He's from Trapnest...
- Ren?

70
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:58,394
No, the long haired guy.

71
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:03,394
Th-They saw us. And what's worse,
while he had his arm around me.

72
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:07,444
We'll be in the tabloids.
We'll be on TV.

73
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,634
I'm hungry.

74
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,214
Um... Mr. Takumi...

75
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,354
Mr?

76
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:15,914
But you've always
just called me Takumi.

77
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:18,314
Well that's true, but...
that's not the point.

78
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:20,024
It may not be something
for me to point out,

79
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,424
but aren't you concerned

80
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,364
of the risks of being seen
entering a hotel with a girl?

81
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,534
At the least, perhaps you should
wear some kind of complete disguise.

82
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:28,694
Some kind of complete disguise?

83
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,964
But if I wore a costume,
I'd stand out even more.

84
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,644
You'd look good in one!
This is no time to be joking!

85
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,544
What's with this guy?
He's pretty funny!
You'd look good in one!
This is no time to be joking!

86
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,204
Not to worry.

87
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:41,404
The entertainment reporters are too
busy to be following my every step.

88
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,214
Our band keeps a lid
on our public appearances,

89
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,714
so people don't recognize us enough
that we need to be overly cautious.

90
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,954
What are you saying?
Trapnest is really famous.

91
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:53,554
I guess Reira is.
She may need a costume.

92
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,094
I'd say all four of you share
about the same level of fame.

93
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,024
You think that because you're a fan.

94
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,054
The general public may
also recognize Ren, but that's it.

95
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:02,634
Naoki and I are known as

96
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,434
the blonde guy
and the long haired guy.

97
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:07,404
That's not true! You're number one
in my book, Takumi!

98
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:16,214
I'll bet he thinks of me as
a foolish, easy woman.

99
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:19,444
But that's basically
the type of woman I am.

100
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:21,584
With all I've been through,

101
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:24,054
I thought I had become
more cautious towards men.

102
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,224
But nothing's changed since that summer
back when I was seventeen.

103
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:32,464
If only I could remain high
on this moment of happiness,

104
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,594
I wouldn't even care about tomorrow.

105
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:37,394
What's this?

106
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:38,674
Awesome!

107
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,224
It's huge! There are two rooms!

108
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,334
So pretty! It's like a castle.

109
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:43,494
Would this happen to be...

110
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,444
A suite room?

111
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,174
Do you like it?

112
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:53,144
Right now, I'm so happy
I could just die.

113
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,254
If I could die here,
I'd die a happy woman.

114
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,854
If you must die, do it in bed.

115
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,054
But before that let's
get something to eat.

116
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,494
Choose anything you like.

117
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:07,634
Huh? Are you suggesting
that we eat in the room?

118
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,064
Oh, if you prefer not to,
we can dine out.

119
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,534
No, I've dreamed of
ordering room service in a hotel!

120
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:15,804
Their specialty is duck.

121
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:18,114
Duck? I've never had duck.

122
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:21,444
Really? Never? It's great.
Then how about foie gras?

123
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,274
I've totally never had foie gras.

124
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,074
Then should we get some caviar too?

125
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,204
Yay!

126
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,384
Why not take a shower
and relax until the food arrives?

127
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,854
There's a bathrobe, so use that.

128
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,724
Yes. A bathrobe?

129
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:37,824
He knows this place
like it were his own castle.

130
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,894
These are brand name cosmetics.
I wonder if I can take them home.

131
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,874
I'm sure tons of foolish girls like me
approach Takumi,

132
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:52,204
and I'm no more than
one of the many.

133
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:56,214
But if I'm here, well aware of that,
there should be nothing wrong

134
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,914
with me spending one night
to purposely enjoy a dream, right?

135
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:01,674
Delicious!

136
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:04,894
Isn't it? But to me,
that food you prepared

137
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,414
was better than this, Nana.

138
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:08,694
That's impossible.

139
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:12,494
No, I'm serious. While on tour,
we always eat out

140
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:13,654
and I get sick and tired of it.

141
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,804
By the way, you're back on your tour
starting tomorrow, right?

142
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,694
Are you okay for time?

143
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,304
Not a problem.

144
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:23,914
We leave early in the morning
so I hafta leave during the evening,

145
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:26,074
but you can take it easy
and spend the night here, Nana.

146
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,644
What? He's gonna leave?

147
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:34,374
Come on, don't make such a sad face.
It'll make it hard for me to go.

148
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:36,924
Oh, no, I'm sorry. That'll be fine.

149
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,854
I don't mind.
I'm not thinking of anything as dreamy

150
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,484
as keeping you here with me
until the morning.

151
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,494
Once the tour is over...

152
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,934
I'll come directly to see you.

153
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,274
When I do, would you mind
cooking for me again?

154
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:01,474
I mustn't take him seriously.

155
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:05,044
It's okay. I'm not that stupid.

156
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,504
I guess I am different from
when I was seventeen.

157
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:10,844
Thank you for the meal.

158
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,094
Then I'll go take a quick shower.

159
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,454
You can warm up and wait for me.

160
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,794
You are really impatient, Takumi.

161
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:21,104
I'm not thinking of
quickly running home

162
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,624
after eating all that I can.
So take your time.

163
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,904
But I can't help but wonder

164
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,934
how many women Takumi's slept with,
using this method.

165
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:34,314
Is he really satisfied
with commoners like me

166
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,544
who have little money and no skills?

167
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,614
I've gotta warm up. Gotta warm up.

168
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:42,974
The phone.
Should I turn the power off?

169
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:45,984
090... who is it?

170
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,194
Hello.

171
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:49,354
Hachiko!

172
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,934
You're late, so I'm getting worried.

173
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,224
Where are you wandering
at this hour?

174
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:57,504
Nana? Huh? Whose phone
are you calling from?

175
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,074
Mine.

176
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:00,564
So you bought a cell phone.

177
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:03,074
Well, Ren bought me one.
He insisted I carry one.

178
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,174
Is that so? That's great.

179
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:08,874
But I don't understand how to use it.
Like how to email.

180
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,414
Doesn't it have a manual?

181
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:12,384
It's thick, so I don't wanna read it.

182
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:15,524
I thought I'd have you teach me
when you got home,

183
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:16,574
so I've been waiting.

184
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,854
But unless yours is
the same model as mine,

185
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:20,054
the functions are
gonna be different.

186
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:21,094
Is that so?

187
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,224
Then hurry home, read the manual
and teach me how to use it.

188
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,224
What about Ren?
Have Ren teach you.

189
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,124
The person who bought that for you
should be responsible.

190
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:30,834
Ren left a short while ago.

191
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,734
Of course. He has to leave
early tomorrow morning.

192
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:36,904
I'm surprised you know that.

193
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,704
B-Because Ren said so yesterday!

194
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:40,744
Yeah?

195
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:42,144
Mhm! He totally did!

196
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,444
So, where are you now?
When are you coming home?

197
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,254
Well... um, sorry... maybe not today.

198
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:51,284
I'm at a friend's place,
and I might stay over.

199
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:54,364
Really? So there are friends
who are willing to have you stay over,

200
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,624
knowing how troublesome you are.

201
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:57,934
A guy?

202
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,624
N-No! I-I'm at Jun-chan's!

203
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,134
I'm joking. Don't take it so seriously.

204
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,964
All right. I'll study my cell phone
on my own.

205
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,564
Say "Hi" to Junko for me.

206
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,044
I can't tell Nana.

207
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,874
I don't want her to know.

208
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:18,414
If she finds out that I'm knowingly
being such an easy woman,

209
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,854
she'll never look at me the same.

210
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:23,374
But you know, Nana...

211
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,684
The truth is, I too wanna love someone
as diligently as you do.

212
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:32,654
Like you and Ren, I too wanna have
that connection with someone.

213
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,464
Hey, Nana. The truth is,
I'm not at all okay.

214
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:42,064
I'd hate to be dumped by Takumi
after a one night stand.

215
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:48,244
What should I do? I'm scared, Nana.
But I can't run away at this stage.

216
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:51,044
I can't bring myself to tell him
I want him to love me.

217
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:58,284
This isn't good. I could end up
feeling hurt all over again.

218
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:01,264
If anyone asks, I'm staying
at your place tonight.
Nana

219
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,194
If anyone asks, I'm staying
at your place tonight.
Nana
Say. What do you think
of this alibi creation?

220
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,354
Say. What do you think
of this alibi creation?

221
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:07,664
Nana's roommate is a woman, right?

222
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,004
Mhm.

223
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,134
But that woman is more handsome
and manly than your average man.

224
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:16,264
Nana seems to have a serious crush
on her. Maybe those two are a couple.

225
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,934
But never mind that.

226
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,014
Really?

227
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,314
There's something fishy about this.

228
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,284
About what?

229
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,944
Jun-chan. You feeling drunk?

230
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:28,214
It's the smell of a new man.

231
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:29,724
I just hope she hasn't been

232
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,384
caught by some guy so terrible
she can't even tell her roommate.

233
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,114
Takumi's hair was so long,
it showered my body.

234
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:43,724
As I let it caress me, I laid there
wishing he would always keep it long.

235
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:49,334
Even though I may
never touch it again.

236
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,964
He said it'll be hard for him to go,

237
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,764
but once he's done,
he's quick to leave.

238
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:19,534
Even his departure is hurried.
Such a busy prince.

239
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:24,744
I should go home too. I'm done with
playing a make-believe princess.

240
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:32,084
What? I can't. I've got no strength.
It's as if I have no bones.

241
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:41,644
I have to pull myself together.
I must quickly return to reality.

242
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,784
In the morning, I've gotta look for
whatever job's available.

243
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:48,734
And this time, I'm gonna
take my work seriously.

244
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,764
Damn! The last train left long ago.

245
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,904
And I don't have enough money to
take a taxi home from the city center.

246
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,074
I might as well spend the night here.

247
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,884
It's likely a once in
a lifetime opportunity

248
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,444
to stay over at
a place like this anyway.

249
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:23,464
Trapnest's tour ends
on the eighth of July,

250
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,494
with a performance in Tokyo.

251
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,674
I don't have a ticket,

252
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,764
so I'll prepare something
and wait at home.

253
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:36,544
I'll be waiting with a little bit of hope.
Just a little bit of hope.

254
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,674
You met with Yasu? What the heck?

255
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,044
Why didn't you invite me?

256
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,584
Be quiet, blonde guy over there.

257
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,054
Is Yasu doing okay?

258
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:51,624
I guess so. He hasn't really changed.

259
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,264
Is he still a skinhead?

260
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,094
- Yeah.
- Nose piercing?

261
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,864
- Yeah!
- So? What's Yasu doing now?

262
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,264
I mean it, shut up, Naoki.

263
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,494
I haven't had much sleep.
Let me sleep.

264
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,874
Someone switch seats with him.

265
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:06,404
Then I'll switch with Naoki.

266
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:13,184
Hey, Take, which side is Mount Fuji?
Which side can we see it from?

267
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:14,444
Are you listening?

268
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:17,584
- Say, Takumi...
- Yasu?

269
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,514
He's a lawyer now, apparently.

270
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,484
That's not what I'm asking.

271
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,384
But you wanted to know.

272
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:28,394
So he really did become one,
even with that look.

273
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:30,164
Even with that look?

274
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:34,064
So his dream came true. I'm glad.

275
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:38,614
He had already passed
the qualification exam

276
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,004
during his fourth year in university.

277
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,704
That's really something,
don't you think?

278
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:44,014
Is that unusual?!

279
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:46,284
Would you stay outta this,
blonde guy?

280
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:50,354
But now he's moved to Tokyo
because of his band.

281
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,584
So isn't his dream to become
a professional musician?

282
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,914
Huh? Moved to Tokyo?
Because of his band?

283
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:57,684
The band he and Ren had
before Ren joined us.

284
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,964
They found a new bassist,

285
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:02,664
and have been giving it
some serious effort.

286
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,264
What's this?

287
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,604
After snobbishly telling me repeatedly

288
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,904
that bands are nothing more than
a hobby? I don't get him.

289
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:13,634
Yeah. Leaves a bad taste, doesn't it?
Want me to rough him up?

290
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,504
What made him decide
to do this now?

291
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:22,914
Yasu!

292
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:27,754
Why are you smoking?!

293
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,324
Never mind, continue smoking.

294
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:35,624
I know very well that you
only stop smoking in front of me.

295
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,794
You're only considerate like that
on the surface.

296
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:41,104
But then you secretly do stuff
in the shadows.

297
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,234
What else are you hiding?!

298
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:45,074
Nothing really.

299
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:48,904
You have too many secrets!
I'm really pissed off, you know!

300
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,774
Why didn't you say anything
about you and Reira?!

301
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:53,704
Oh, that. I'm sorry.

302
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:57,454
"Were you that impressed
by Reira's voice?"

303
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,114
It's not funny!

304
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:00,454
I said I'm sorry.

305
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:06,354
She was really great, that Reira.

306
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,254
I felt so defeated.
I'm no match for her.

307
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:12,434
Was she like that since the old days?

308
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,734
Is that what you call a genius?

309
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:20,314
I guess.

310
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:23,614
But she has defined abs.

311
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:29,014
Hmm... You sure are well informed.

312
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:34,044
Where's Hachi?
Isn't she coming today?

313
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,254
Nobu, that's all you've been saying.

314
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:37,424
Huh?

315
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,234
Hey, Nobuo.
Are you in love with Hachiko?

316
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:40,494
No, I, ah...

317
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,794
It's just that, it's kinda lonely
without our regular audience.

318
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,864
But Hachi's only one person.

319
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:48,404
I want to perform live!

320
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:50,934
I need to release this tension!

321
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:52,774
Then let's do it.
We got an offer to perform.

322
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:54,714
Tell us more.

323
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:55,974
Our performance at the Live House...

324
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:59,074
The crowd liked us, so they asked if
we'd be interested in doing another.

325
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:00,254
Let's do it.

326
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:01,484
- All right!
- All right!

327
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:04,054
That day I checked the classifieds
for job offers

328
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,794
and went to three job interviews.

329
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,194
For a dentist's receptionist,
a supermarket cashier,

330
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,284
and a phone operator
for a pizza place.

331
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,194
I got turned down by them all.

332
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,464
What could they have found about me
that they didn't like?!

333
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:17,964
I wanna know why you got fired
from your job in the first place?

334
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:20,704
Well, because I started
making a habit of skipping work...

335
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,804
But at the interviews
I told them in clear terms

336
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,074
that I will take work seriously this time.

337
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,674
Then you told them that you got fired
because you skipped work?!

338
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,644
You're such a fool!

339
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:33,054
You've gotta realize, if you take
just any job that you can get,

340
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,114
you'll end up with the same result.

341
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:37,414
Why not look for a job
that suits you better?

342
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,214
What would be a job that suits me?

343
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,154
Well, maybe not specifically
one that suits you.

344
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:45,694
Any job will do as long as
it's a job you enjoy doing.

345
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:48,434
If the workplace deals with
things you like,

346
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,624
you'd be more motivated,
don't you think?

347
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,634
When you were working
for Mr. Mizukoshi,

348
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,704
you were surrounded by nice things
and you wore those pretty clothes.

349
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:59,234
You seemed so alive at that job.
Why not look for another job like that?

350
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:03,074
I see. That makes sense.
She's right.

351
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,314
I wonder how Mr. Mizukoshi is doing.

352
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,074
Never mind Mr. Mizukoshi!

353
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:09,884
But I sometimes think about him.

354
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,524
I don't mind telling you now,
but I kinda had a crush on him.

355
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,994
You don't have to tell me. I could tell.

356
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:19,694
But, you know, taking Mr. Mizukoshi
and Takumi into consideration,

357
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:20,684
you have a thing for long hair,
don't you?

358
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,404
No way!

359
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,034
What's with your overreacting?

360
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:26,094
Because you're saying strange things!

361
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:29,974
Strange? I prefer men
with short hair...

362
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:32,514
You have it wrong!
Mr. Asano had short hair!

363
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,274
- Asano?
- And so did Shoji!

364
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:41,384
Well, I think his hair is pretty long.

365
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:45,114
Yeah? Well, I guess that wouldn't be
considered short.

366
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,314
Seeing that you're comfortable
talking about him,

367
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:48,854
I guess you're over him now.

368
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:53,924
It would be nice if you could find
a boyfriend soon. With long hair.

369
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:59,054
There was just no way that
I could talk to Nana about Takumi.

370
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:04,404
Being who he is, I couldn't even
tell Jun-chan about him.

371
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:06,364
I wasn't able to discuss him
with anyone.

372
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,504
I've never had that experience
with love, and it was very painful.

373
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:14,244
Shoji, are you moving?

374
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,624
What?! Shoji's moving in
with Sachiko?!

375
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,214
They're such a lovey-dovey couple.

376
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:27,624
That's nice. I envy them.
They seem so young.

377
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,164
You're right.

378
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:34,534
You're playing in Kyushu
starting today, right?
Take care of your health
and best of luck to the end of the tour.
Nana

379
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:38,014
You're playing in Kyushu
starting today, right?
Take care of your health
and best of luck to the end of the tour.
Nana
During his tour, I gathered my courage

380
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,774
You're playing in Kyushu
starting today, right?
Take care of your health
and best of luck to the end of the tour.
Nana
and sent Takumi
one short email message.

381
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:40,404
and sent Takumi
one short email message.

382
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,844
But I never got a reply.

383
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:49,044
Ren
Concert Congratulations
Taste the euphoria.
From the Guitar Genius

384
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,184
Hey, Nana...

385
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,354
I always admired you.

386
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:55,784
I wanted to be like you.

387
00:20:58,034 --> 00:20:59,964
I lived life always thinking that.

388
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:06,864
So please.
Please sing again, once more.

389
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:13,144
I reached into the sky

390
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:19,654
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

391
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:25,024
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

392
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:31,014
Like colorful balloons

393
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:33,134
I'm alone

394
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:36,864
My hand had no place to go

395
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:43,494
And gently you took it

396
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:44,674
Starless night

397
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:48,874
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

398
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:54,674
I want to feel your warmth

399
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:56,554
Tears are falling down

400
00:21:56,554 --> 00:22:00,654
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go

401
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:07,154
Of your hand holding mine
