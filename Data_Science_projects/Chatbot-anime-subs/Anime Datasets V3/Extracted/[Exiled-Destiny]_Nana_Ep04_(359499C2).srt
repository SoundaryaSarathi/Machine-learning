1
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:03,552
Nana!

2
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:13,062
Shoji!

3
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,902
Hold... me!

4
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,572
What's with that face?

5
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,612
I'm sorry about earlier.
I said stuff I shouldn't have.

6
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:28,932
Don't worry about it.

7
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:31,742
That killed the mood!

8
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:57,912
When I was darkness at that time

9
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:00,742
With trembling lips

10
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:03,842
In a corner of a room I cry

11
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:08,922
The more I struggle

12
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:11,762
The more this wound deepens

13
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,922
The broken promise hurt me

14
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:19,652
Nobody can save me

15
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,832
God, I have only one request

16
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,462
Stop tearing apart my love

17
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:29,812
I need your love

18
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:33,042
I'm a broken rose

19
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:35,982
Sorrow tumbling down is your song

20
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:38,152
All alone with nowhere to go in my life

21
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:40,922
I need your love

22
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:44,222
I'm a broken rose

23
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:47,162
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain

24
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:51,122
With your smile, your eyes,
and sing me, just for me

25
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,092
I wanna need your love

26
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:57,332
I'm a broken rose

27
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,662
I wanna need your love

28
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:13,882
Welcome back!

29
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:15,922
Jun-chan, you've gotta hear this.
You know what Shoji!

30
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:18,182
Good night.

31
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:24,762
Room 707? Give me a break!

32
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,762
What are you talking to yourself for?

33
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:27,762
That's scary.

34
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,022
I'm not talking to myself.
I'm talking to Demon Lord.

35
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,362
That's even scarier!

36
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:35,902
Damn, I'm tired from running around.

37
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,872
You really are troublesome.

38
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,312
It's your fault for
leaving me all alone!

39
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:49,182
Why, at a time like this,
must I speak like a bitch?

40
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,922
I wanna always be the cute girl
when with the man I like.

41
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,322
I can't stand this.

42
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:00,262
Perhaps it's too late now.

43
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,432
I've shown Shoji things about me
that are less attractive,

44
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:08,102
and here we're in a room together and
there's no longer that sense of nervousness.

45
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,862
He's just gone right off to sleep.

46
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,102
You know, Nana...

47
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:18,312
The truth is, I really want to bring you
to Tokyo with me.

48
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:23,482
But, you know, I don't have a job.

49
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:26,382
I'm not even a University student,
just studying to enter one.

50
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,332
If you were on the verge of life and death,

51
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:30,792
I could do nothing to help you.

52
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,632
That's hard for a man.

53
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,462
I want you to understand that.

54
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:40,672
Then...

55
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,542
Then I'll stay back home,

56
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,472
find a job and save up money
to come to Tokyo!

57
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,082
Then, after one year,
you pass the University entrance exam,

58
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,312
I'll come to Tokyo too.

59
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:53,842
Then I'll find a job here and work hard
so that I can make it on my own!

60
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,612
Would it be okay then?

61
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,852
Then I must pass next year,
no matter what.

62
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:03,892
Just watch me, Demon Lord!

63
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:08,962
All right!

64
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:12,092
Now that we've made up, why don't we
sleep together for a change?

65
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,102
What do you mean by that?!

66
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,892
For a change suggests
we've done this in the past!

67
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,102
We haven't even kissed yet!

68
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:21,172
It's okay if you don't want to.
I've become used to holding back.

69
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,442
Doesn't it cross his mind that
it might be nice to build the mood?

70
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,442
Never mind.

71
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:27,072
Don't jump to conclusions
on your own!

72
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:30,122
Oh? Then why don't you share
your opinion on this subject?

73
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,922
Huh? Well...

74
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:37,592
Then, if you tell me
that you love me,

75
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,692
I'll sleep with you.

76
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:39,292
Love?

77
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,232
You've gotta realize
this isn't about who says what!

78
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,462
You can't expect
a Japanese man to say that!

79
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:47,092
But I have never had anyone say
those words to me in my life.

80
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,202
I'd be happy to hear it just once.

81
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:50,802
What's the point if
it's said because you asked?

82
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,002
Never mind.

83
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,112
All right, you win.

84
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:59,272
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do. I'll say it.

85
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,812
I'll just think of myself
as an American.

86
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,282
My name's Michael.

87
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:04,392
Who's that?

88
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:07,152
Do I hafta sleep with
some mysterious foreigner?

89
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,322
I won't sleep with anyone but Shoji.

90
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:14,562
I'm gonna make some tea, okay?

91
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:20,232
So would you prefer
green tea or brown tea, Michael?

92
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:45,952
Nana.

93
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,762
Shoji, I know you said it...

94
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:53,002
inside your heart.

95
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,102
You told me that you love me.

96
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:01,942
So you heard it.

97
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,512
I wanted to have a happy love.

98
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,482
Romantic and dramatic
like in the movies.

99
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,952
But during the summer of seventeen,
I became a woman

100
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:20,192
and learned that dating men isn't so sweet
like on the big screen.

101
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,332
Or so I thought.

102
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:26,672
But that evening,
my body was melting away

103
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,502
with the sweet taste of happiness.

104
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:37,172
I wonder if things are all right
between those two.

105
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:38,942
I'm a bit worried.

106
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:42,242
But they can't rely on their friends
to bring them back together.

107
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:45,322
They're not junior high school kids.
Right?

108
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,062
Don't just leave me here
talking to myself.

109
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:53,102
Good night.

110
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:09,412
A woman's life isn't so bad after all,
is it, Jun-chan?

111
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,912
But it's long distance.

112
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:18,582
Huh?

113
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,892
Nothing. That'll be three hundred yen
for the late return.

114
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:22,792
Ah, right.

115
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:25,962
Nana.

116
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:28,962
Wanna have dinner with me tonight?

117
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,792
Mr. Nakamura.
That would be a problem.

118
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,442
You may have finally woken up
to my beauty,

119
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:36,772
but it's too late now, Nakamura.

120
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,702
What's the big deal? It's just dinner.

121
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,072
And he's not serious.

122
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,672
Aren't you lonely with your boyfriend
having moved to Tokyo?

123
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,142
And he's a pest.

124
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:45,812
But you had a crush on me.

125
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,852
You've got the wrong person!

126
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:52,592
Should I quit that job?
But it pays pretty good.

127
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,832
I hafta hurry and save money,
so that I can move to Tokyo.

128
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,392
I can't wait until next spring!

129
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:02,932
Yes, this is Nana!

130
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,472
Shoji! I'm doing great!

131
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,132
Nana Komatsu. I'm 19 years old.

132
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,472
I have a boyfriend, but we're in
a long-distance relationship.

133
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:14,142
I'll show you, Demon Lord!

134
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,482
I don't know where I was born.

135
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,652
I've never seen my father,

136
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,332
and I've long forgotten
what my mother looks like.

137
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:38,772
I came to this coastal city
when I was four,

138
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,802
where I was raised by my grandmother
who owns a little restaurant.

139
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:42,802
She had nothing
but sarcastic remarks for me.

140
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:48,032
Right now, I work long hours while
polishing the shards of my dream.

141
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,692
Good evening!
We're Blast.

142
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,722
Thank you!

143
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,622
It's cold!

144
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,152
It's too cold!

145
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:07,322
They're coming!

146
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,252
No way!

147
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,892
Everyone was waiting out here
in this freezing cold?

148
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:14,792
Thanks a lot for today.

149
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,892
Nana! Your performance was the best!

150
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:17,962
Thank you.

151
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,632
Nana! I have a present for you.

152
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:24,662
What is it? Vivienne Westwood?
You sure it's okay, Misato?

153
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:26,872
You...

154
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:29,542
You remembered my name?

155
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,872
Of course, because you're always there
when we're performing live.

156
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:36,512
Nana, your birthday was last week, right?

157
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:40,912
That's a birthday present for you!
Happy eighteenth birthday!

158
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:41,852
Thank you.

159
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,322
Yay! I got Vivienne Westwood!

160
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:48,632
Izakaya - Japanese pub

161
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:51,372
Izakaya - Japanese pub
Okay then,
here's to today's successful show.

162
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,232
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

163
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,772
We were by far the best
in tonight's battle of the bands, right?

164
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,372
Most of the audience came to see us.

165
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,812
I never imagined
such a day would come

166
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,212
when I'd be so popular with women.

167
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,982
But they all come dressed as Nana.
It's kinda scary, if you ask me.

168
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:11,182
Wow, it's a jacket. I'm touched!

169
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,952
I'll bet the other fans are strangling
that girl about now.

170
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,032
A significant investment
for one kiss from me.

171
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,422
Demon!

172
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:21,502
Excuse me, I'll have another!

173
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:25,262
Nobu, stop it already.
Your graduation is tomorrow, right?

174
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:27,272
Aren't you attending graduation, Nana?

175
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:29,462
Well, excuse me for dropping out
of high school!

176
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,142
What's up with that?
I only finished junior high.

177
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:35,372
Why are you bragging about it?!

178
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:40,312
The national university student's laughing.
Rub it in, will you?

179
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:43,312
Still I would've liked to see Nana
in her school uniform.

180
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:44,952
Did you wear those loose socks, too?

181
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,682
Don't go there, Yassan.

182
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,512
She was one terrifying girl
in school.

183
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:50,622
I was so scared
I wouldn't dare talk to her.

184
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,592
Liar! You were always
following me around!

185
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,202
You were really annoying!

186
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:55,962
What's that?

187
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,602
I became your friend

188
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,932
because you were always alone
at school and looked lonely!

189
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:01,462
You should thank me for that!

190
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:07,712
Hurray for Blast!

191
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,542
It's no use.
Let's just leave him and go home.

192
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:12,782
You think he'll die?

193
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,782
Yeah, he'll die.

194
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,152
I'll flag down a taxi
and take him home.

195
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:19,062
Yassan, you sure have money.

196
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,392
You're not learning law for nothing,
you lawyer-to-be.

197
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,192
Yasu, should Nana get thrown in jail,

198
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,532
make sure and defend her
as her lawyer.

199
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,792
What do you take me for?!
I'll never get caught.

200
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,892
- Did you do something wrong?
- Wait, Ren.

201
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:35,772
I'll tell Nobu about that thing.
So you tell Nana, okay?

202
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,202
About what?

203
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:41,082
The truth is,

204
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:44,982
the reason Yasu became a skinhead
has to do with this bald spot he got.

205
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:47,342
In the end, those who laugh at the bald,
cry as a bald!

206
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:53,482
Performing live is the best.

207
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,592
How can I put it... Orgasmic!

208
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,022
I come while on stage.
There's no stopping it.

209
00:12:58,632 --> 00:12:59,622
I'm glad for you.

210
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,762
Yup. It's awesome. It feels sooo good.

211
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:04,462
Even better than doing it
with a man?

212
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,862
That depends on the man.

213
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:16,972
Wow, I'm freezing!

214
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,172
I'll catch a cold!

215
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:21,182
What would you do if I end up
losing my precious voice?

216
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,352
Isn't there a hand warmer
or something?

217
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,722
Those girls need a lesson
on gift buying.

218
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,592
There has to be something we can use,
like a scarf or something.

219
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:28,482
Found one!

220
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,962
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

221
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,282
Ren Honjo
Nana Osaki

222
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:50,582
Hey, Ren, do you remember?

223
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:55,712
There was a snowstorm
the first time we met as well.

224
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,252
I remember.

225
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:58,082
Really?

226
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,452
It was at a Christmas live concert
a few years ago.

227
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:03,422
Two years and three months ago.

228
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,192
You were wearing a red dress
that day.

229
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,632
Was I? You don't even hafta remember
the clothes I wore.

230
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:14,132
I couldn't forget it even
if I wanted to.

231
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:18,012
You were the worst audience ever,
for refusing to get into the mood.

232
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:19,042
What are you saying?!

233
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,642
You were in the very front

234
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,872
and just stood there with
a cold look on your face.

235
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,482
I was thinking,
"What's up with her?"

236
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,702
It pissed me off.

237
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,822
Then, after the show,
you came backstage with Nobu.

238
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,252
The way you greeted me was pitiful.

239
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:35,252
All you said was, "I'm Nana."
Without even so much as a smile.

240
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,162
That was it.

241
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,962
Don't you have anything else to say?

242
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:43,862
Back then, there was so much going on,
I was in a bad state.

243
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:47,702
Yeah. Because you got kicked
outta school for selling yourself.

244
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:50,002
I was not! I was framed!

245
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,412
You're the one who took
my virginity!

246
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,202
Sorry about that. Calm down.

247
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:57,282
But given your short temper,

248
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,372
I'm surprised that
you didn't fight back.

249
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,112
I didn't have the energy
to lose my temper back then.

250
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,552
Yeah. That certainly was
the expression you had.

251
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,392
Besides, I wanted to quit school
and get a job,

252
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:09,982
so I figured it worked out well.

253
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:15,462
But wasn't your nasty grandmother
overworking you at the store?

254
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,032
What did you need the extra money for,
to put up with that?

255
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,102
I wanted money.

256
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,372
And Grandma never gave me even
a penny of allowance money.

257
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:26,572
It's not a laughing matter!

258
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,132
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:30,142
I told you before.

260
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:36,522
When I was four, my mother left me
with Grandma and disappeared.

261
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:41,082
She gave birth to me without knowing
who my father was.

262
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:45,052
Soon enough, I became a burden to her
so she fled with another man.

263
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:48,002
Grandma had a habit of telling me

264
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:50,302
how she didn't want me growing up
to be like my mother.

265
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:57,202
Therefore, I was never allowed to
wear pink or red girlish clothes.

266
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:01,602
She said they were provocative colors
that would seduce men.

267
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:06,212
When Grandma died, I was all alone.

268
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:12,222
I decided I'd use the money I earned
to buy poor me a Christmas present.

269
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:16,222
Of all things, I bought myself
a frilly red dress.

270
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:21,092
I excitedly wore it to
the live concert that evening.

271
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:28,572
I was hiding the red dress under my coat
and ran in the snowstorm.

272
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:36,452
He's my senior at school,
two years older than me!

273
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:37,812
He's really cool!

274
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:39,972
I'll introduce you to him later.

275
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:45,242
Really, don't bother.
I just came to have fun.

276
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,082
You'll see what I'm talking about
when you meet and talk to him.

277
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,022
He's more level-headed
than your average grownup.

278
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:55,422
He grew up in an orphanage,
so I'm sure he's gone through hard times.

279
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,742
Ren was abandoned in
the warehouse district by the harbor,

280
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,102
right after he was born.

281
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,372
It was apparently all over the news.

282
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:08,872
Nobuo, it's not nice to talk about
such touchy issues of someone else.

283
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:12,382
It's all right.
Ren boasts about it.

284
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:13,442
He does?

285
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,192
He brags that
not too many people can say

286
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,312
they were in the news
right after they were born.

287
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:21,552
On top of that, he actually lives
in that warehouse district.

288
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,952
He says, "This is my origin."

289
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:27,052
Ren is trying to become
a professional musician.

290
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,232
So he says he's thankful
for his scandalous past

291
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:30,862
because it attracts attention!

292
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,172
What's that all about?
What a fool.

293
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:36,872
Why? That's pretty cool!

294
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:40,172
He's just trying to get sympathy
by selling his unfortunate past.

295
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,442
That's so not cool.

296
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:54,682
But I was charmed by the man
who appeared on stage.

297
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:06,102
Ren was abandoned
in the warehouse district by the harbor.

298
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,172
Ren boasts about it.

299
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:27,492
What name do I give that feeling
that was born that night?

300
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:33,492
Sweet words like "love" or
"adore" just don't sound right.

301
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,732
Perhaps envy and irritation
mixed in with jealousy.

302
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:40,292
And moreover desire.

303
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,242
Even now I get anxious.

304
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:54,482
Because sometimes I feel
that this daily life,

305
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:57,322
living together with Ren,
is nothing but a dream.

306
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,822
Ren was a bright light that lightened
the boring life I lived until then.

307
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:11,062
But no matter how hard I try,
he still remains outta my reach.

308
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,602
I wish we could do it in a bigger place.

309
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:23,852
You're right.
This place is kinda small.

310
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,982
Not that. I mean performing on stage.

311
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:27,512
We have the fan base now.

312
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,512
Yeah, go for it.

313
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,882
I mean both of us.

314
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:36,692
By the way,

315
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,132
what was that thing Yasu was talking about
as we were leaving.

316
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:42,832
He seemed kinda serious.
Was it concerning the band?

317
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,802
Getting a bald spot is a serious matter.

318
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,532
Never mind.
I'll hear about it from Yasu.

319
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,942
More importantly,
I'd better take my medicine.

320
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,442
Can't live without it, huh? Junkie!

321
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:57,342
No way! It's the pill!

322
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,452
We'd be in trouble
if I don't take it!

323
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:01,682
Since you won't do anything
for prevention!

324
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,312
What are we going to do
if I have a baby?!

325
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,082
Give birth, and we'll raise it.

326
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:10,462
I worked hard labor instead
of going to high school,

327
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,952
so I've got lots of money.

328
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,392
One or two kids would be totally fine.

329
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,792
Fine with you, but not with me.

330
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,542
Right now I'd rather perform
than raise kids.

331
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:40,322
Nana...

332
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,892
I'm going to Tokyo.

333
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,532
You live your life however you like.

334
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:12,692
I reached into the sky

335
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:19,192
But I couldn't reach what I wanted

336
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:24,572
They grew smaller
and disappeared into the sky

337
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:30,562
Like colorful balloons

338
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,682
I'm alone

339
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:36,412
My hand had no place to go

340
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:43,042
And gently you took it

341
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:44,222
Starless night

342
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:48,422
I won't look back
at the shadow of my past

343
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:54,222
I want to feel your warmth

344
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,102
Tears are falling down

345
00:21:56,102 --> 00:22:00,192
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go
