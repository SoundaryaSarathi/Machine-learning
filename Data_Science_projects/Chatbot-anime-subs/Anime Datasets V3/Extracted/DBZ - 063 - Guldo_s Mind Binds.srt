1
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:27,283
A leadoff attack, huh? Ha!
Well, I doubt it will do any good.

2
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:34,259
Gohan!

3
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,089
Right!

4
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,104
Fools!

5
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:48,595
Stop!!

6
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,776
<i>You brats!</i>

7
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:01,286
<i>T</i>- <i>they're not there!</i>

8
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:02,947
<i>W</i>- <i>where are they!?</i>

9
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:10,562
<i>There they are!</i>
<i>All the way over there!</i>

10
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:13,224
<i>Did they move in that one instant?</i>

11
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,561
<i>Dammit, I can't hold</i>
<i>my breath any longer...</i>

12
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,017
Those tiny bugs are better
than we thought, huh?

13
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,586
Their rating on my Scouter...

14
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:51,269
It's a rare species that is able to change
their battle power without transforming.

15
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:54,773
You've got some nice
friends there, Vegeta-<i>chan</i>!

16
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:58,810
Those guys' speed and power
is incomparably better

17
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,880
than the last time
we fought. But still...

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,782
Incredible!

19
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:06,618
You've increased your destructive power
several steps over what it was before, Gohan!

20
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,889
That's all thanks to having
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> unleash my power!

21
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,222
But that guy fled
all the way over there.

22
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:20,899
I'm sure he must have stopped
time again. Let's go, Gohan!

23
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:21,593
Right!

24
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,565
Oh! They vanished!

25
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:46,914
Stop!!

26
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,794
<i>They're already here!?</i>

27
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,258
<i>W</i>- <i>wait, there's no need to run away.</i>

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,933
<i>All right, l'll start with</i>
<i>that pipsqueak over there.</i>

29
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:18,223
Oh, crap!

30
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,622
Over there!

31
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:27,221
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

32
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:37,575
Oh, man, we almost had him!

33
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:41,246
What are we going to do with Ghurd?
He's having trouble with them.

34
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,416
At this rate, we're going
to have to redo our bet.

35
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:49,587
All right, I'll bet this bar of chocolate
that he finishes it in the next minute.

36
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,111
Okay, I'm in.

37
00:03:54,926 --> 00:04:01,889
Damn it! Attacking while keeping time
stopped consumes energy too briskly!

38
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,211
I don't know what's going on!

39
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,714
Kuririn and Gohan took the Dragon
Ball they worked so hard to get,

40
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,885
and flew away with it!
And Vegeta was with them!

41
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,377
What? Vegeta was with them, you say?

42
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,561
What on earth does that mean?

43
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,230
<i>lf I knew that, I wouldn't be</i>
<i>letting it get to me, would l?</i>

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,567
<i>l can't stand anything</i>
<i>that's been happening lately.</i>

45
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:42,907
So you say, but didn't your space
capsule get all busted up? Whoops...

46
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,239
There's no way you can
come home, is there?

47
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,915
But then, it's been six days
since Goku took off from here,

48
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,349
so he should be arriving pretty soon.

49
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,747
Huh? I can't hear you very well!

50
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,527
I know!

51
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:07,555
Really! What is everyone thinking,
tossing a lady aside like this!?

52
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:13,136
<i>Son-kun, hurry and get here.</i>

53
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:48,907
Look, Gohan! Every time he stops
time, he gets more worn out!

54
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:51,910
All right, let's keep
attacking him like this!

55
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,899
Right!

56
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:02,482
S- stop!!

57
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:23,166
<i>l</i>- <i>it's no use!</i>
<i>l don't have enough energy!</i>

58
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,039
<i>All right...</i>

59
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:30,207
<i>l think l'll go hide</i>
<i>somewhere and rest for a bit.</i>

60
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,608
<i>Let's see, let's see...</i>

61
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,718
<i>Behind that rock!</i>

62
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,400
He's gone!

63
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,588
Over there!

64
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,765
How did they know I was here!?

65
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:26,534
S- s- stop-

66
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,561
Hey, Ghurd!

67
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:54,554
This is disgraceful! You're going to
bring shame upon the Ginyu Special Corps!

68
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,235
Ghurd, you dummy!

69
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,237
If you get yourself beaten
by those pipsqueaks,

70
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,839
I'm not going to play
with you anymore!

71
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,400
You'll have to take your
3 o'clock snack separately, too!

72
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:10,515
I- I just got a little bit careless!

73
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:13,751
I'm going to put these
maggots away right now!

74
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:17,422
All right, now's our chance!
Let's charge him, Gohan!

75
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:18,252
Right!

76
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,083
T- they're coming again!

77
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,757
All right, if that's how they
want it, I'll use my trump card!

78
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,889
What is this?

79
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,289
My body won't move!

80
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,063
It's my paralysis technique!

81
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,567
No matter how hard you
struggle, you can't move!

82
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,797
Dammit!

83
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:26,321
I can't move!

84
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:33,257
What happened to all that
energy you had earlier?

85
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:53,951
Looks like Ghurd
is getting pretty anxious.

86
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:57,288
He's using his paralysis technique,
which he doesn't show off that often.

87
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,891
And against those two
sawed-off little bugs, too.

88
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,621
Hey, ReaCoom, the chocolate.

89
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,460
That bet you just made.
One minute has long passed.

90
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,196
All right. Ghurd,
you piece of crap!

91
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:30,254
T- those idiots! After I told them
to watch out for his supernatural powers,

92
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,586
they go launching a frontal assault.

93
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,989
I'm going to get you good for all
the embarrassment you've caused me.

94
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,887
Way to go, hand power!

95
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,222
Get them! Get them!

96
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,712
No need to hold back!

97
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,501
Your flesh is so soft, huh?

98
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,515
All right, now it's time
for the 100-blow punishment.

99
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,918
I'm going to hit you a hundred times!

100
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,921
1... 2... 3... 4...

101
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:40,550
5... 6... 7... 8... 9...

102
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:48,266
15... 16... 17... 18...

103
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,597
G- Gohan!

104
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:00,544
I'll do it to you,
too, just to be fair.

105
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,104
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

106
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,778
You give me my due!

107
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:20,898
Hey, Ghurd, how long are
you going to keep this up?

108
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:23,234
You're holding up the next fight!

109
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:26,570
Hurry up and finish them off!

110
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,731
Okay... let's see...

111
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,676
All right...

112
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,243
This tree will do.

113
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,538
Hey, you guys!
I'm going to skewer you!

114
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:03,405
You might be good if I
cooked you up and ate you!

115
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,940
Yeah, I bet you'd
like to escape, huh?

116
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:18,556
What's the matter?
If you don't run away soon,

117
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,888
this huge skewer
is going to run you through!

118
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:29,196
F- Father!
Uncle Piccolo!

119
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,403
<i>Gohan!</i>

120
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,926
<i>G</i>- <i>Gohan is in danger!</i>

121
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:09,540
<i>Piccolo, are you sensing</i>
<i>the Ki on faraway Planet Namek?</i>

122
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,671
<i>Still, there's nothing that you can do</i>
<i>with your power as it is now,</i>

123
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,902
Piccolo!

124
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,400
I can't eat with this knife!
(" <i>taberarenai-fu</i>" ) (" <i>naifu</i>" )

125
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:49,572
Yeah!

126
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,863
Can't you move? You poor things.

127
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,534
All right, I'll take care of the kid
in the yellow outfit first with this thing,

128
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,503
and then I'll use a different
supernatural power on the other one!

129
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,878
G- Gohan, can you do anything?

130
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:25,542
I- it's no use!
My nerves are all paralyzed!

131
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,712
Here goes!

132
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,824
Our constraints have been released!

133
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,237
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

134
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,135
Gohan!

135
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:09,849
T- that was dirty, Vegeta!

136
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,968
T- this was supposed to be a fight
between me and those kids...

137
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:22,873
That's something that you guys
decided for yourselves.

138
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,876
You think there's such a thing
as fighting dirty in a war?

139
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:32,216
T- to think that I would be done in by
a lowbrow monkey bastard Saiyan like you...

140
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,552
It's infuriating...

141
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:38,044
Hmph. You're the <i>last</i> person
I want to hear that from.

142
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,404
Who would have thought
we'd ever be saved by you?

143
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:54,701
Thanks.

144
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,908
Don't get me wrong.

145
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:01,071
Do you think I deliberately rescued you?

146
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,015
I just had the perfect chance to kill
that grubby bastard Ghurd, that's all.

147
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:11,855
This is no time to be feeling relieved.

148
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:15,689
Brace yourselves.
We won't get lucky this time.

149
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:22,866
Hey, hey, hey!
Ghurd got himself wasted!

150
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:25,536
T- that is a problem...

151
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:30,940
Our Ginyu Special Corps fighting pose
won't be as beautiful with one of us missing!

152
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,443
ReaCoom!

153
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:42,541
Butta!

154
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:45,912
Jheese!

155
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,920
Ginyu Special Corps!

156
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:56,363
S- sure enough, it's not beautiful.

157
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:03,841
We'll have to have Commander Ginyu
think up a new pose for the four of us.

158
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,377
Putting that aside,
we have to decide

159
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,513
who is going to take out
those two runts in Ghurd's place.

160
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,849
I still get Vegeta, you know.

161
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,518
All right, Jheese,
rock-paper-scissors with me.

162
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:15,519
Okay!

163
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,854
First time is rock!

164
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,856
Rock-scissors-paper!

165
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:23,418
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
Tie, go again!

166
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:31,869
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
Tie, go again!

167
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:35,873
W- what could those people be thinking?

168
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,609
Yeah... I can't figure out
their character one bit.

169
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:48,218
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
Tie, go again!
