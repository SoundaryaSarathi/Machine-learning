1
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:14,712
Why am I in this crowd?

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:20,022
No no, if I make it through there's
a mountain of dojinshi waiting for me.

3
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:24,322
Based on the ones I saw in
Akihabara and in the club office...

4
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,192
...I can expect some good stuff...

5
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:30,672
Sasahara.

6
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:32,302
Sasahara.

7
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,302
This is your first Comic Fest?

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,502
Uh, yeah...

9
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,882
You look tired, are you okay?

10
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,052
Yeah, I'm okay...

11
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:46,022
I've just been over-excited since
yesterday, and it's worn me out...

12
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:48,922
It's still too early to be tired.

13
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,822
That's true...

14
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:06,772
Kohsaka stands out...

15
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,512
But still...

16
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:16,312
Is it 100% otaku in here?

17
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,342
<i>Genshiken</i>

18
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:42,082
<i>I woke up and as usual forgot
my cell and missed the Express.</i>

19
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:48,112
<i>My life reflected in
the train window.</i>

20
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:52,852
<i>I'm sure I have something that
I won't lose to anyone in Japan...</i>

21
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:57,722
<i>... but it's pretty sad
that no one notices it.</i>

22
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,532
<i>I can't run fast, though.</i>

23
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:04,132
<i>I'm not that strongly-built.</i>

24
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:11,142
<i>Here I go, at my dauntless pace.</i>

25
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:17,312
<i>Pass away, today's
sadness, raining in the sun!</i>

26
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:22,782
<i>Hesitation, repetition,
dreaming all night, all night.</i>

27
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:28,052
<i>Farewell sadness,
to outer space you go!</i>

28
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:33,302
<i>Look to the sky and shout
at the top of your lungs!</i>

29
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,032
<i>At this tempo!</i>

30
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,842
<i>Right now, at this tempo!</i>

31
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,902
<i>Genshiken
Right now, at this tempo!</i>

32
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,582
<i>International Exhibition Hall Station</i>

33
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:00,982
The foreboding of a storm...

34
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:06,392
M-Madarame's getting into
character s-so don't mind him.

35
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:07,392
Oh...

36
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:13,402
<i>Episode 3: The Issue of Regional
Cultural Advancement and its Merits</i>

37
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:28,212
We took the first train, so why
are so many people lined up already?

38
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,942
They've been here all night, of course.

39
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:32,712
I-Isn't that prohibited?

40
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,022
Besides, it's such bad weather...

41
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,532
A storm, in fact.

42
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:38,392
Oh...

43
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:41,562
Well, it's not like
I'd want to go that far.

44
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,462
I-lf Kasukabe were here she
wouldn't understand a word of this.

45
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:48,732
No, I don't think she'd realize
she was missing anything.

46
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,852
Ugh, high humidity.

47
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,792
Why's the air so hot?

48
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,392
It sure is hot.

49
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:11,562
Oh yeah!

50
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,032
Why are you so cheerful?

51
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,662
This bad weather makes
it feel like a real event.

52
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:21,732
It's times like this when things
like religious experiences happen!

53
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:23,342
You think so?

54
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:28,142
Religious experiences aside,
this weather is a rare thing.

55
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:29,642
Y-You're right.

56
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,012
Recently it's been otherwise, but in the
past...

57
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:37,122
...popular opinion held that it didn't rain
during the summer Fest.

58
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,922
Wow, is that so...

59
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:40,822
Yes!

60
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:43,262
I get the feeling
something will happen today!

61
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,522
Something divinely inspired!

62
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,862
You lost me...

63
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:58,012
Stop and go, what a drag!

64
00:04:58,142 --> 00:05:00,172
But we're definitely making progress.

65
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,572
I've got a total runner's high.

66
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:03,272
Huh?

67
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:04,712
The world of light!

68
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,682
Running in place is depressing.

69
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:11,052
Why not go actually run for a bit?

70
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,042
We'll keep your place in line.

71
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,522
Good idea!

72
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:17,422
Are you serious?

73
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:20,122
Just kidding, I'd never
mess up the line like...

74
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,732
M-Madarame, are you all right?

75
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:34,112
He's embarrassed.

76
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,112
This could become legendary.

77
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,552
Yeah, um, well...

78
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,912
Am I in trouble?

79
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:43,082
It's sprained...

80
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,752
No, broken...

81
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:50,992
But at least my fingers move, and
it doesn't feel like it's snapped...

82
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,832
I need to hit the corporate
booths before dojinshi today!

83
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:58,502
My first priority is to get my hands
on the commemorative limited edition...

84
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:01,542
...Kujibiki Unbalance anime
trading cards that Kodansha put out!

85
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:04,002
All you have to do is line up for them!

86
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,242
I can do it!

87
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:07,942
Piece of cake!

88
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:09,972
I just need to get to them...

89
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,312
You sure got quiet.

90
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,552
Of c-course, he's embarrassed.

91
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:24,492
Good, I'll go as far as I
can, to the divine domain!

92
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:48,082
It feels like I can reach heaven!

93
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:52,022
The exhibit hall is
currently terribly crowded.

94
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,752
Please do not rush, but
walk slowly and carefully.

95
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,992
We thank you for your cooperation.

96
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,972
Posters, pencil boards...

97
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,732
Would it be best to check
what the trading cards are now?

98
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:13,072
B-Before that let's get
in the card-only line.

99
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,542
If it's there, we can always g-get out.

100
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:16,912
That's true.

101
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,712
Madarame?

102
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:20,852
We're going.

103
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,282
Uh, yeah.

104
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:30,382
I-I don't have
t-today's rare card.

105
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,752
Neither do I.

106
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:32,762
Or me...

107
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,332
W-Well, I'll sort
them so gather them up.

108
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,602
What about you, Madarame?

109
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,502
Sorry, Sasahara, look for me.

110
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:42,432
What?

111
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:46,302
It turns out I twisted
my wrist when I fell.

112
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:47,872
Are you all right?

113
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,212
Is it swollen?

114
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:50,712
Well, I haven't looked...

115
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,312
Anyway you look at it, that's
a sprain, or maybe even worse...

116
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,422
You think so too?

117
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:06,032
I even forgot to act like Tetsuo.

118
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,152
Huh?

119
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,692
In any case, you should hurry to
Medical...

120
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,732
...or maybe you should go to a hospital
instead?

121
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,492
I'm okay, I'm okay...

122
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:16,762
I can stay...

123
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,172
Here.

124
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,482
Well, if you say so...

125
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:29,082
There it is...

126
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,352
The rare card.

127
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:38,122
I have seen God.

128
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,892
You can stop now...

129
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,632
Man, that's brave...

130
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:51,102
Brave and risky...

131
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,642
Are y-you seriously okay, Madarame?

132
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:56,942
It gradually hurts less and less...

133
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,982
I-Isn't that bad?

134
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,912
Come on, here's where it really begins!

135
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,682
We're finally at the east hall!

136
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:04,622
But...

137
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,422
Y-You can't shop with
that hand, can you?

138
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,252
Right, so...

139
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:13,552
I'll stick close behind Sasahara,
he's just the right height...

140
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,792
If I like something he looks at, he can
buy two copies and I'll pay him later.

141
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:19,562
...I really don't like that idea.

142
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:22,032
Just choose stuff you're into!

143
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:23,602
I still don't like this.

144
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:26,642
Sasahara, think about this.

145
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:29,542
If you took the first subway train...

146
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,082
...waited in line for five hours
in humidity and a rainstorm...

147
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,652
...got through both this injury
and the limited edition trap...

148
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:36,882
...and now had this mountain
of treasure before your eyes...

149
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,552
...would you come this
far just to run away?

150
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,822
I don't think you've
gotten through the injury yet.

151
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,902
This thing's gone numb now anyway.

152
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,492
We'll pretend we didn't see that.

153
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,472
Like hell!

154
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,212
Let's go.

155
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,402
Oh, excuse me.

156
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,842
W-What a clown.

157
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,282
Madarame...

158
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,192
Hold on, this really looks serious!

159
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:14,282
S-S-S-Sasahara,
g-get a staffer!

160
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:21,232
Hmm, he's out.

161
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:25,732
I guess his brain finally cut
out on him, like a breaker...

162
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,842
He was pushing too hard after all.

163
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:30,432
I'll g-go with him.

164
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:32,512
Oh, that's all right, I'll go.

165
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:33,612
No, you won't!

166
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:36,512
You're awake?

167
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:38,312
Don't bother.

168
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,712
You guys buy dojinshi.

169
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,252
Two copies of the good ones.

170
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:47,192
I'll pay you later...

171
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,832
I'm counting on you!

172
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,122
Please don't speak.

173
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:55,562
You'll bite your tongue.

174
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:00,632
You actually see people on
stretchers quite a bit...

175
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:03,932
But you never expect it
to be someone you know.

176
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:30,932
W-Well, from here we split
up and do our own shopping.

177
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:33,592
All right...

178
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,532
This is our meeting place.

179
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,432
All right, then I'll be going.

180
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,632
Good luck.

181
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:39,902
Come back alive.

182
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:42,982
Please don't talk like Madarame.

183
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:10,232
Madarame mentioned it before...

184
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,772
...but they're all looking
at the contents before buying.

185
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,042
So that does happen...

186
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,712
It certainly is a welcome sight.

187
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:23,182
Lots of dojin shops won't
let you flip through...

188
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:27,912
But then it's not like there's anyone
to blame if you don't like it...

189
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,192
Ahh, there I go thinking too much.

190
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,332
One copy, please.

191
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,372
700 Yen.

192
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:53,182
Oh, a book about
Kujiun's Miss President?

193
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:53,882
<i>Please, Miss President.</i>

194
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:56,112
<i>And it's my kind of art style...
Please, Miss President.</i>

195
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:01,482
But, no one else is looking at them...

196
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,812
Darn it! What is there
to be embarrassed about?

197
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:26,252
Didn't I train for
this at the dojin shops?

198
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,992
Besides, we're all the same here...

199
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:43,462
Um, is it all right if I browse?

200
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:45,392
F-Feel free.

201
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,462
All righty...

202
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,682
One copy, no, two copies please.

203
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:09,122
That comes to 1000 Yen.

204
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,492
Ah, forgive me, ancestors...

205
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:19,932
Here I am in this place when I haven't
even visited your graves yet this year.

206
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,812
<i>International Exhibition Hall Station</i>

207
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,822
Hello...

208
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,392
Sure, see you later.

209
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,832
She doesn't think she can make it past
the station, so she's going home.

210
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,772
N-Not bad for Kasukabe.

211
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:55,872
Right.

212
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:02,742
Thank you for posing.

213
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,982
Thanks a lot.

214
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,852
Excuse me, please look this way.

215
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:14,122
Look this way too, please.

216
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,692
Would you mind posing with
your fingers interlaced?

217
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:21,692
Like this?

218
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:23,232
Thank you!

219
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:26,302
Thank you very much.

220
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,262
You're welcome.

221
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,182
Okay, here we go.

222
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,782
Cool, thank you much.

223
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:41,422
These are the pictures from last time.

224
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,052
Thanks as always.

225
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,952
Are you sure it's all right, Fukuro?

226
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,882
It's all right, it's all right.

227
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,552
Did I buy too much, though?

228
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,252
This is heavy...

229
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,192
<i>Student Council of Darkness
- 500 Yen</i>

230
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:03,602
Now I've completely blended in.

231
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:05,762
I'll take one.

232
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,572
Anywhere you look here,
we're all the same.

233
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,112
Hey, he came here with a girl?

234
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,582
You can't be yourself that way!

235
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,222
What's with him, lookin' all cool?

236
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:24,052
Why don't you dress for the occasion?

237
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:25,932
<i>Kujiun Parody - 700 Yen</i>

238
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:28,692
I'll buy it!

239
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,632
<i>I'll buy it!
Met Warrior- 700 Yen</i>

240
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:30,822
<i>I'll buy this too!
Project K - 1000 Yen</i>

241
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:33,262
I'll buy any book about her!

242
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:39,462
Uh-oh, I feel like something on top
of my head is starting to crack open...

243
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,672
Something on top of my head...

244
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,282
Sasahara!

245
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,672
Oh, aren't you...

246
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:49,152
...Haraguchi?

247
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:49,952
Why are you...

248
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,322
I'm also with the Manga Club, you see.

249
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,422
Then this is the
Manga Club's booth?

250
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:56,862
<i>Komaki 3 - Komaki 4</i>

251
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:00,022
Oh neat!
You make dojinshi?

252
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,702
I'll buy some.

253
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:02,962
No, just take one.

254
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:03,792
What?

255
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,062
Here's the latest one.

256
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,662
Uh, no...

257
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:08,832
I'll pay for it.

258
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,202
I'm giving it to you.

259
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,472
Here, give it a read.

260
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:14,432
Okay, thank you very much.

261
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,412
Is this really legit?

262
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:23,952
The other members
aren't saying anything...

263
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,192
Come on around behind the table.

264
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:27,782
Let's talk a bit.

265
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,582
Are you sure?

266
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,322
You can fit through that gap over there.

267
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:33,122
Right...

268
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,122
Have a seat.

269
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:37,762
Right...

270
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,932
It sure is hot.

271
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,232
Yeah...

272
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,532
Is this really kosher?

273
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,512
If I sit down it means
someone else has to stand.

274
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:51,552
For that matter, they're all
facing away and ignoring us.

275
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:56,282
Are you sure about this, Haraguchi?

276
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:57,722
So, are things in your price range?

277
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:02,292
Well, I couldn't afford big corporate
stuff so I went for smaller groups.

278
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:05,952
Ah, but you didn't have
a chance with the bigwigs, anyway...

279
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,122
...by the time you got through
the general attendee line.

280
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,772
If you're serious about buying, you need
to be here...

281
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,532
...as part of a circle from the get go.

282
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,972
I see, is it that much better?

283
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,742
Well, yeah, but I guess
Genshiken could never manage it.

284
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,312
I mean, is Genshiken
currently producing anything?

285
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:25,612
They aren't, are they?

286
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,482
Let me tell you about Genshiken.

287
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,852
About ten years ago, they
formed as a composite circle...

288
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:35,692
...crossing the bounds of
manga, anime, and games.

289
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:40,222
But on the contrary, what exactly
they do became blurry and vague.

290
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,962
Besides, nowadays all
circles are borderless.

291
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:49,462
So in conclusion, the existence
of Genshiken is valueless.

292
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:55,372
That's why it's made up
primarily of wanna-bes.

293
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,802
The only one who can even
remotely draw is Kugayama.

294
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,312
But it's just doodles,
nothing print-worthy...

295
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:04,552
Madarame talks like
he's a military otaku...

296
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:08,252
...but in reality he's just
an uninformed Zeon freak.

297
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,622
Tanaka does cosplay...

298
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,992
Cosplay...

299
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,432
It's just, you know...

300
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:20,062
And that Kohsaka kid?

301
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,302
What's his deal?

302
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,672
His interests are
definitely an otaku's...

303
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,502
...but his appearance, behavior, and
personality aren't otaku-like at all.

304
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,442
What an odd guy.

305
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,342
I wouldn't know.

306
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:38,252
In any case, Genshiken is a bunch
of lukewarm losers year after year.

307
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,982
They don't amount to
anything on their own.

308
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:43,062
Why not quit now and
join the Manga Club?

309
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,522
But Haraguchi, aren't
you part of both clubs?

310
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,592
In name only, really.

311
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:54,832
I attended at first, but once I knew
what they were about I stopped going.

312
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,172
Oh, that reminds me.

313
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:03,042
The chairman has held his
position since I was a freshman.

314
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,912
What year do you suppose he is?

315
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:06,112
Got me.

316
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,382
Well, the group's just
right for me at least.

317
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,512
Oh yeah?

318
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:11,812
That's too bad.

319
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:13,282
Ah, yes.

320
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:19,152
This conversation was confidential, so
don't disclose it to anyone else.

321
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:26,402
Oh, by the way, did you draw
anything in the book you gave me?

322
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:32,672
I'm something of an editor, so I have to
be the one who keeps everyone in line.

323
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:33,872
Oh...

324
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,702
How're they selling?

325
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,542
Not bad...

326
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:46,822
I feel sorry for the Manga Club guys...

327
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,192
Now I get it...

328
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:54,352
The reason no one looks
pleased about Haraguchi's name...

329
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:58,662
...coming up in conversation is because
that's the kind of person he is...

330
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:13,682
At this time, Comic Festival 66
Summer is now coming to an end.

331
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:39,902
Sorry I took so long.

332
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:42,672
H-Hi, y-you
really stuck to it.

333
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,782
Yeah, I had trouble choosing...

334
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:47,212
D-Did you buy anything for Madarame?

335
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:51,722
Yes, I tried buying
several books for him.

336
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:56,152
Oh! That one's by the fan
circle he's secretly into.

337
00:21:56,662 --> 00:22:01,602
I d-did think your t-tastes
overlapped, but this is unexpected...

338
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,032
I'm not sure if I'm happy about that.

339
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:06,032
I b-bought this.

340
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,132
T-This is pretty good.

341
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:12,772
I-Isn't it?

342
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:15,712
The art's pretty good, and it's s-sexy.

343
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:21,042
So Sasahara, how was
your first Comic Fest?

344
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:31,332
Yeah, like Kohsaka said before,
I really do fit in with Genshiken...

345
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:33,592
Ah...

346
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,322
It wore me out.

347
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:38,632
I'll b-bet, especially with
all that happened today.

348
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:39,762
Very true.

349
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,032
B-But, it's not over yet.

350
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:43,042
What?

351
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,272
You line up to go home, too.

352
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,602
Save me!

353
00:22:54,822 --> 00:23:03,892
<i>We took no detours or shortcuts...</i>

354
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:13,262
<i>... and we weren't afraid of
what tomorrow would bring...</i>

355
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:22,602
<i>... as we kept walking down
Inogashira Street late at night.</i>

356
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:31,942
<i>Only vivid dreams extended
deep into the shadows.</i>

357
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:42,762
<i>We aren't quite grown up.</i>

358
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:54,142
<i>Simple but complicated
glistening like marbles.</i>

359
00:23:54,442 --> 00:24:03,682
<i>The time we could see from there
sparkled, even if nothing big happened.</i>

360
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:13,662
<i>What we see from the marbles in
our hands now is a little different...</i>

361
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>... but they shine faintly nearby.</i>

362
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:34,322
<i>Harunobu Madarame: Injury to wrist
ligaments; metacarpal fracture;</i>

363
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:39,322
<i>sprain of proximal interpharyngeal joint;
- Full recovery in two months</i>

364
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,982
Hey, Sasahara, is this your
first time in Ochanomizu?

365
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:46,892
Yes, I always go straight
to Akihabara and back.

366
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,832
Check out all the college students.

367
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:53,662
Yeah, Nihon U, Meiji U...

368
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:56,632
Over there are Tokyo Medical
and Dental, and Juntendo.

369
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,342
This sure is a famous place.

370
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,212
Sundai.

371
00:24:59,212 --> 00:24:59,702
<i>What?
Sundai.</i>

372
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:00,812
Athenee Francais.

373
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:01,942
<i>Yeah, but that's...
Athenee Francais.</i>

374
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,982
Bigakko.

375
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:03,342
<i>Right...
Bigakko.</i>

376
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:04,452
TDG.

377
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,282
<i>Hmm...
TDG.</i>

378
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:07,182
Which one doesn't belong?

379
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,312
Uh...
