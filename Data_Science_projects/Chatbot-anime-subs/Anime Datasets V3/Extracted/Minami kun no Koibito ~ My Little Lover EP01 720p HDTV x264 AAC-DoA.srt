and headed for Kyoto.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,030
He is so cool even though he is small!

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,760
Right. Even though he is small,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,910
he is very brave.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,670
I want to see him.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,750
Oh, come to think of it, there is a legend in this area

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,380
that is called 'one-inch-princess.'

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,610
- One-inch-princess?<br>- One-inch-princess?

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
Really? Does she really exist?

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,590
I don't know...

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,490
I wonder.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,280
- One-inch-princess!<br>- One-inch-princess!

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,290

One-inch-princess!

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,500
One-inch-princess!

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,700
Where are you? Over there?

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,100
Come out, one-inch-princess.

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,670
I am sure she is here.

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,120
For example, under the grass like this.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, it's a frog. Over there?

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,130
- Over here.<br>- One-inch-princess!

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,730
Where is she?

28
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,540

Right, the new school year starts today.

You went to bed late last night?

81
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,240
I'll bet you watched dance videos or something on your computer.

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,420
No, I didn't.

Well, yeah, sort of.

Asuka, you too. You are a 9th grader from today.

- It's not that.<br>- It's not that.

112

We are in the same class as Pheromone. We are super lucky.

Yeah, I wanna date her. I feel like melting.

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,240

<i>We have a crepe shop. Please come.</i>

<i>Here is our crepe shop. Would you like to come?</i>

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,130
That's because our class couldn't sell crepe at all.

140

No way.

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,230
Okay, I want to ask Horikiri-san to be the female class rep.

149
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,930
Eh, but...

150
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,670
Why don't you do it?

151
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,240
May I ask you to do it?

152
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,350
Eh, well. Oh, no...

153
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,940
<i>Excuse me, sensei.</i>

154
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,390
What is it, Nomura-san?

155
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,370
I want to run for the class rep.

156
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,930
Well, but, now Horikiri-san was...

157
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,520
Horikiri-san, do you want to be the class rep?

158
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,410

159
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,520
It doesn't matter.

160
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,410
I...

161
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,450
I want to be the class rep.

162
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,480
Sensei,

163
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,530
The one who wants to do it should do it.

164
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,250
That's true.

165
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,740
Okay, it seems Horikiri-san is reluctant anyway...

166
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,800
Maybe I will ask Nomura-san to do it since she volunteered.

167
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,260
Is that okay, Horikiri-san?

168
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,370
Horikiri-san?

169
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,020
Yes, it's fine.

170
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,480
Okay, the female class rep will be Nomura-san.

171
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,440
Let's give her a big hand.

172
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,830
I'm looking forward to working with you.

173
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,010

178
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,640
Hey, the competition is arond the corner. So, I want to review the choreography.

179
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,400
- Would you help me?<br>- Eh?

180
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,790
- Okay. Count on me.<br>- Really?

181
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,050
- Let's do it.<br>- What I want to do is

182
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,690
a cool move.

183
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,890
<i>My Little Lover</i>

184
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,690
I am so tired.

185
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,550
Choreography for the competition...

186
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,730
That'll be fun.

187
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,370
What kind of dance should we do?

188
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,830
You know what?

189
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,380
You must be tired from working hard.

190
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,260
Oh, Riku. It's unusual (to see you now). You were working with the Hand Craft Club this late?

191
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,790
Eh?

192
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,920
Oh, well... Yeah.

193
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,680
What's wrong Horikiri-shi?

194
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,350
You see...

195
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,800
Huh? No way!

196
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,960
This is your favorite dance team, Chiyomi. Cool!

197
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,170
I want to audition for it, too!

198
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,930
- The audition is held in Tokyo?<br>- Eh, Tokyo?

199
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,990
I can't do it. I have to study for the college entrance exam. My mom won't okay it, first of all.

200
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,390
You think so, too?

201
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,440
And, if I pass it, I have to stay in Tokyo.

202
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,590
- Stay in Tokyo?<br>- Eh, what are you going to do if you pass?

203
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,290
Are you going to quit school? Your parents won't let you do it.

204
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,040
You are right, but...

205
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,170
What? Are you serious?

206
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,090
A little.

207
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,880
Ah, Chiyomi?

208
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,070
Let's talk about this some other time.

209
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,480
I have to go somewhere from now.

210
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,460
Oh, is that so?

211
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,310
Riku. Would you go home with Chiyomi?

212
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,170
Yeah.

213
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,760
Then, see you.

214
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,820
Huh? Hey, wait!

215
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,550
Horikiri-shi, are you interested in romance?

216
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,550
It's not that I am not interested, but I don't believe in that kind of stuff.

217
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,220
You don't believe in it...

218
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,380
Well then,

219
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,030
have you ever liked anyone?

220
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,990
I did when I was little.

221
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,130
But I forgot about it.

222
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,820
I see.

223
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,150
Ah...

224
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,510
Recently,

225
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,360
on the internet,

226
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,410
I got interested in this online novel.

227
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,520
Online novel?

228
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,440
Yes.

229
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,240
<i>Hanadoroboh (Flower Thief)<br>Zakka (variety goods) &amp; Cafe</i>

230
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,230
Thank you for walking me home.

231
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,160
No problem.

232
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,770
Umm... What I mentioned earlier,

233
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,270
Moon Bunny Michaela's "Blue Fairy,"

234
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,920
is really interesting.

235
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,940
I really like it...

236
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,120
Yup.

237
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,590
Like (it).<br>(He wants to say "I like you.")

238
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,450
Is that so?

239
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,770
Then, I will read it.

240
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,190
Ah... why don't you?

241
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,780
Yup.

242
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,330
See you.

243
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,700
- Horikiri-shi! <br>- What?

244
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,020
Well...

245
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,040
What is it?

246
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,180
It's nothing.

247
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,540
What is it?

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,550
What is it?

249
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,960
Well...

250
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,690
I will tell you tomorrow.

251
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,450
Okay, I see.

252
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,100
- Bye, bye. <br> - Bye, bye.

253
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,360
Riku has been reading it.

254
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,360
Okay.

255
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,040
<i>Fairies lose their magical power when they fall in love.</i>

256
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,550

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,210

260
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,540

Moon Bunny Michaela!

263
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,980
- Sensei! <br>- It's ok, it's ok.

264
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,210
I haven't told anyone.

265
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,920
No one at all!

266
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,650
I think it's fine to tell... you're just doing what you like to do.

267
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,040
No way. I'll be so embarrassed that I won't be able to come to school.

268
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,180
You are a celebrity in the online novel world.

269
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,600
No, it's just dumb luck.

270
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,270
When I wrote about what's been collected inside of me, it just happened.

271
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,080
I guess that is the mental scenary

272
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,760
that is inside of your heart.

273
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,870
No, no, it's not something that big.

274
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,840
What is it?

275
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,900
First of all,

276
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,630
this.

277
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,840
It's for you.

278
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,140
But it's not my birthday.

279
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,780
I know.

280
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,640
I wanted to give this to you the other day.

281
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,890
But, I couldn't.

282
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,700
What could it be?

283
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,230
It's cute!

284
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,630
- Did you make this yourself?<br>- Yeah.

285
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,110
Wow!

286
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,470
The moon and a bunny?

287
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,460
Is this... perhaps...

288
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,410
I...

289
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,430
am a fan of Moon Bunny Michaela.

290
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,550
So,

291
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,140
I wanted you to have it.

292
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,660
You knew?

293
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,950
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,530
I did...

295
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,110
Then,

296
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,560
you knew yesterday.

297
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,750
Yesterday...

298
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,150
I couldn't say anything more.

299
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,280
What?

300
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,520
You knew.

301
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,350
I see.

302
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,070
What are they mumbling?

303
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,080
There, just say it.

304
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,970
I wanted to tell you...

305
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,600
I...

306
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,690
love (it).<br>(He wants to say "I love you.")

307
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,830
I love Moon Bunny Michaela.

308
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,690
Thank you.

309
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,120
I love

310
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,970

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,680
worrying about various things.

316
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,130
So, I know this is not the right time.

317
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,850
But,

318
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I wanted to let you know how I feel.

319
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,400
I thought I needed to put my name in.

320
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,880
So, I won't rush you to answer me.

321
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,760
Riku...

322
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,420
If you like someone else, I'll give up.

323
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,520
But,

324
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,350
if that's not it,

325
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,590
I'll keep raising my hand.

326
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,370
For a long time.

327
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,280

328
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,010
We get along.

329
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,000
He's nice.

330
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,540
More than that, he has good taste by noticing me.

331
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,370
Oh, no.

332
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,530
I didn't bring an umbrella.

What are you saying, Chiyomi?

344
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,600
The dance group I admire, Solo, is having a workshop.

345
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,370
But,

346
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,360
you don't have to go now when you're studying for the college entrance exam. You can do it next year.

347
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,210
I want to go now. It has to be now.

348
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,850
No, you can't!

349
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,440
For someone who is clueless as you to go to Tokyo alone? I'm against it.

350
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,890
I am also against it.

351
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,030
You can just dance when you get to college.

352
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,380

353
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,960

I'm not going to take the entrance exams!

355
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,540
I already know what I want to do.

356
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,220
Going to college is just a waste of time!

What are you saying?

358
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,560
You were able to get into a decent high school.

359
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,050
What are you going to do if you're not going to college?

360
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,260
That's right. Your mom is right.

361
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,270
If you regret it later, it'll be too late.

362
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,820
Why do you collude at times like this?

363
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,730
Mom, you never listened to your parents!

364
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,790
What are you saying, Chiyomi?

365
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,390
You guys had to get married because you got pregnant with me!

366
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,470
Dad!

367
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,930
Chiyomi, we're not done talking.

368
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,920
The lightening is getting closer.

369
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,970
What?

370
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,960
Chiyomi-chan?

371
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,030
<i>[We are out of soy sauce. Can you by it, haha]</i>

372
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,030
I can't believe you're asking me to go on an errand at a time like this.

373
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,360
You even misspelled "buy".

374
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,010
What is it?

375
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,480
<i>My Little Lover - Minami Kun No Koibito</i>

376
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
<i>Hey,</i>

377
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>Minami-kun, you're aiming for Med School, right?</i>

378
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,560
<i>Maybe I'm being too forward but</i>

379
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,840
<i>what are you going to do about tuition?</i>

380
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,870
<i>You're mother is a single mom, right?</i>

381
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,430
<i>Why don't you ask my dad?</i>

382
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,430
<i>I'm sure you'll find a way.</i>

383
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,730
Minami-kun.

384
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,850
What is it?

385
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,840
What is it?

386
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,860
If you don't have anything, I'm going.

387
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,920
Why do you ignore me?

388
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,300
I'm asking, why do you ignore me?

389
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,290
I'm not ignoring you.

390
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,800
You are.

391
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,810
You don't look like that when you're with Nomura-san.

392
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,830
You were with Nomura-san this whole time?

393
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,690
Are you dating Nomura-san?

394
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,350
What are you saying?

395
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,580
It's none of your business.

396
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,750
That's right.

397
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,280
It's none of my business.

398
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,710
Sorry, for being abrupt.

399
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,790
What is this?

400
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,030
By the way, don't show up wherever I go.

401
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,790
Me?

402
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,650
You were just there.

403
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,630
When Nomura and I were walking.

404
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,870
That's not really...

405
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,120
Well, I don't really care.

406
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,150
I came out now because I had a fight with my parents.

407
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,440
A fight?

408
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,080
When I told them I'm not going to college,

409
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,710
Dad and Mom got angry.

410
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,170
You're not going to college?

411
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,660
I have something I want to do.

412
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,190
But they won't even listen to me. All they say is, college, college.

413
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,360
You are so easy going.

414
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,150
Eh?

415
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,010
You are so spoiled, and easy going.

416
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,750
Why?

417
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,290
Why do you say things like that?

418
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,120
You are horrible.

419
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,270
We were so close before.

420
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,330
Why?

421
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,280
It's obvious.

422
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,270
I don't like you anymore.

423
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,380
Hey!

424
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,600
Wait.

425
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,480
Wait a minute.

426
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,230
Umbrella... Wait!

427
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,510
This is...

428
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,080
She's not back yet. She's not answering her phone, either.

429
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,180
It's so weird. I thought that text message made it easier for her to come back.

430
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,350
Ok, I'm going to look for her.

431
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,340
But it's raining hard.

432
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,910
That's why I'm going.

433
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,760
You guys are so loud.

434
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,760
It's Chiyomi! Chiyomi!

435
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,920
Is Chiyomi-chan back yet?

436
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,850
- No. Why?<br>- I thought so.

437
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,040
I just saw Chiyomi-chan by the Misaki Park.

438
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,460
He hit her. It's domestic violence.

439
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,610
What are you saying?

440
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,280
So, that's why she was crying.

441
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
Don't do that. I will arrest you.

442
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,440
Please.

443
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
What do you mean? What are you guys saying?

444
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,780
Take me there.

445
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,360
- Get my coat.<br>- Okay.

446
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,820
Dad, your shoes.

447
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,350
- Here.<br>- This way.

448
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,000
It's not going to stop raining.

449
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,790
Wait.

450
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,260
It's dead. What?

451
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,040
<i>Wait.</i>

452
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,310
<i>- Shunichi.<br>- Wait, wait.</i>

453
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,760
<i>- Shunichi!<br>- Wait.</i>

454
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,330
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

455
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,040
<i>You idiot!</i>

456
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,530
<i>Shunichi, let's go inside.</i>

457
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,390
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

458
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,380
<i>Good morning.</i>

459
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,910
<i>It's obvious.</i>

460
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,690
<i>I don't like you anymore.</i>

461
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,700
Why are we like this now?

462
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,780
<i>Before, we got along so well.</i>

463
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,410
I want to get back to how we were then.

464
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,590
I want to be small again.

465
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,870
Minami-kun...

469
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,120
<i>Why?</i>

470
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,570
Eh?

471
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,580
Eh? Why?

472
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,430
Have I... become the one-inch princess?

473
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,200
No way.
