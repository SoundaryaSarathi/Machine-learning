<i>[Episode 1]</i>

3
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:54,758
Over here!

4
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:29,919
Second Disciple!

5
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,919
Congratulations, Master,
on obtaining this magical artifact.

6
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:57,998
Kunlun Mountain hasn't had a weapon
since the Bell of the East Emperor.

7
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,359
<i>Could it be that
I will have a new disciple?</i>

8
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,199
- Quick!
- That way!

9
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,838
Hurry.

10
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,439
This is Kunlun Mountain?

11
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:33,358
There is something
shining brightly up there.

12
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,158
You'll find out when you reach the top.

13
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,519
Why did you give me
the appearance of a boy?

14
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,678
Kunlun Mountain does not accept
female disciples.

15
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,759
If you want to be a disciple,
you must be a boy.

16
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,959
Remember this.

17
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,199
From this moment on

18
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,718
you are no longer Bai Qian,
daughter of Qing Qiu's Fox King.

19
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,759
You will be Si Yin.

20
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,718
You are a wild fox I found

21
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:08,478
and sent to Kunlun Mountain
to become Mo Yuan's disciple.

22
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,278
Will anyone see through the disguise?

23
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,718
- That will depend on luck.
- Depend on luck?

24
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:21,319
Mo Yuan's disciples
won't have the ability to.

25
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,959
As for whether Mo Yuan himself
can see you are a woman...

26
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:28,238
that will depend on your luck today.

27
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,718
<i>Where did this brat come from?</i>

28
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,798
<i>He's trying to take my spot as disciple?</i>

29
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,598
Another ignorant and incompetent fellow

30
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:06,038
who relies on the support of
his family's elders to become a disciple.

31
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,079
Mo Yuan is the highly revered God of War.

32
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,598
How could he possibly take in
a thin and weak fox?

33
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:41,838
That...

34
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,199
- Master.
- Master.

35
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,879
- Zhe Yan.
- Zhe Yan.

36
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,158
<i>How strange.
The fan chose him as its owner.</i>

37
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,278
<i>I had thought the God of War would have
a ferocious and formidable appearance.</i>

38
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:14,358
<i>Who would have thought his face
would be even prettier than Zhe Yan's.</i>

39
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,879
<i>Could he have seen through
Zhe Yan's enchantment?</i>

40
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,559
Si Yin.

41
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,598
Hurry and greet Mo Yuan.

42
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,999
Honorable Mo Yuan, Si Yin from
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods

43
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,238
admires your fame
for your fighting prowess.

44
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:36,358
I came from afar to seek tutelage.
I hope you will take me as your disciple.

45
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,639
<i>This artifact holds immense power.</i>

46
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,278
<i>It must not be handed over
to one outside of Kunlun Mountain.</i>

47
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,639
<i>It seems he is fated to be my disciple.</i>

48
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,959
Honorable Mo Yuan.

49
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,478
What did you say your name is?

50
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,278
My name is Si Yin.

51
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,838
My name is Zi Lan.

52
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:22,079
Kunlun Mountain already has 15 disciples.

53
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,759
The two of you came on the same day.

54
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,959
If I accept both of you,
who should be the senior?

55
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,239
Zhe Yan, do you have any suggestions?

56
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>Zhe Yan, please.
I don't want to be the junior.</i>

57
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:48,519
This wild fox of mine
doesn't look very reliable.

58
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,519
Why not have him as the junior?

59
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,558
Then I won't be your disciple.

60
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,759
Young man, you changed your mind
so quickly about being a disciple.

61
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,759
What do you take Kunlun Mountain for?

62
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,918
Even if you were brought here by Zhe Yan,
you cannot dishonor Kunlun Mountain so.

63
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,359
Why have you changed your mind?

64
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,519
I am the youngest in my family
only because I was born last.

65
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,038
How come I have also become
the most junior here?

66
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:21,558
Just because I arrived
a moment later than he did?

67
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,479
How unlucky.

68
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,198
Then why don't I give you this
magical folding fan weapon? Is that fair?

69
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,839
Master, you just obtained
that artifact today.

70
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,438
This fellow sure is lucky.

71
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:46,839
That is the only magical weapon that has
appeared in thousands of years in Kunlun.

72
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,278
Why is it being given to him?

73
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,198
- Exactly.
- Yes, that is too unfair.

74
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,119
You must not lie to me.

75
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,879
I never lie.

76
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,158
All right then.

77
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,359
Then I will take you as my master.

78
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,519
Bow.

79
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,599
Rise.

80
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,839
Bow again.

81
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,198
Rise.

82
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,198
Third bow.

83
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,839
Rise.

84
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,918
From this day forth, you will follow
Kunlun Mountain's Mo Yuan, God of War

85
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,918
as his sixteenth disciple, Zi Lan.

86
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,399
Thank you, Master.

87
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,558
And his seventeenth disciple, Si Yin.

88
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:38,119
Thank you, Master.

89
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,599
Master.

90
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,999
What is the name of this fan?

91
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,198
Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

92
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,438
- Greetings, Heavenly Lord.
- Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

93
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,438
Do not stand on ceremony.

94
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,639
- Thank you, Heavenly Lord.
- Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

95
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,359
Greetings, Father.

96
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:32,719
Word has returned from Kunlun Mountain.
Mo Yuan has accepted two disciples today.

97
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,359
He has given the Jade Purity Fan
of Kunlun to a young disciple.

98
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:40,078
His name is Si Yin. He is a wild fox
that Zhe Yan picked up.

99
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,359
What?

100
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:45,519
Kunlun Mountain's weapons have
the power to terrify the four seas.

101
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,958
Mo Yuan has given it to a fox?

102
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:56,438
<i>10,000 years ago,
Heavenly Father returned to chaos.</i>

103
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:59,719
<i>The ancient gods also experienced
catastrophes and passed away one by one.</i>

104
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,399
<i>Within the Celestial Tribe</i>

105
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>only the Dragon Clan, the Phoenix Clan,
and the Nine-tailed White Fox Clan</i>

106
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,158
<i>have descendants left in this world now.</i>

107
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,479
<i>They are respected
within the Celestial Tribe.</i>

108
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,839
<i>I am a nine-tailed white fox,
youngest daughter of Fox King Bai Zhi.</i>

109
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,879
<i>My name is Bai Qian.</i>

110
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,038
<i>Unfortunately, I was too mischievous in
my younger days and caused much trouble.</i>

111
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,119
<i>My parents found someone to rein me in.</i>

112
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,839
<i>They let the old phoenix immortal,
Zhe Yan, turn me into a boy</i>

113
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,399
<i>give me the name Si Yin,
and send me to Kunlun Mountain</i>

114
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,958
<i>to take Zhe Yan's younger brother,
Mo Yuan, as my master.</i>

115
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,839
<i>Thus, 20,000 years passed.</i>

116
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,239
Give me your hand.

117
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:40,078
Miss, your bones tell me
your love life is full of adversity.

118
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:41,278
Presumptuous!

119
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,479
Miss, Miss. Don't listen to his nonsense.

120
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,318
He doesn't know divination
by bone structure.

121
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:49,479
Come to my stall.
Allow me to tell you your destiny.

122
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,239
Are you stealing my business?

123
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:54,438
Think about how much of my business
you steal with your pretty face.

124
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,318
Miss, this way please.

125
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,639
Come, sit.

126
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,318
Miss, have you run into some trouble?

127
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,198
Let go.

128
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:15,999
A strong-spirited lady? I like!

129
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,038
Again?

130
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,078
Every time we're here, we encounter
a bully dallying with an innocent lady.

131
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,719
If she is not married yet, there will
surely be a hero who will help.

132
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,879
If she is married, a husband will
appear out of nowhere, wielding a sword.

133
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,399
- Whether it is a hero...
- Or a husband...

134
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,318
- he's certain to be wearing white.
- he's certain to be wearing white.

135
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:33,558
Stop!

136
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,999
Bully, let go of that lady!

137
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,999
Let's go.

138
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,519
Master will find out if we're late.

139
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,198
Men, attack!

140
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,599
Attack!

141
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,958
Attack him.

142
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,038
Hurry up. Master will find out.

143
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,399
He is holding
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun.

144
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,999
It seems he is Si Yin.

145
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,359
You must teach him a lesson.

146
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,719
There is no rush.

147
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,558
Master, please have tea.

148
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,879
Quick, kneel.

149
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,278
You went to the mortal realm again?

150
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,181
Master, don't give them a hard time.

151
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,678
This time, they went
to the mortal realm to offer divination.

152
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,958
They were only looking for something
new to do. They didn't cause any trouble.

153
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,318
Senior is the best.

154
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,879
Are you saying I am intentionally
giving you a hard time?

155
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,999
No, I...

156
00:14:58,999 --> 00:14:59,999
Senior!

157
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,678
Master, you just returned today.
You should rest.

158
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:08,078
They won't cause much trouble.
I can look after them.

159
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,798
I do feel a bit tired. You may all go.

160
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,038
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

161
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,359
Seventeenth, stay behind.

162
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,999
Yesterday, I passed by
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods

163
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,759
and brought back three peach blossom
wines for you from Zhe Yan.

164
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,999
The peach blossom wine
that Zhe Yan brews himself?

165
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,359
It sure is Zhe Yan's craft.

166
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,119
Thank you, Master.

167
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:58,519
It is good wine, but don't drink too much
or else it will be bad for your health.

168
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:01,359
Don't worry, Master.

169
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,719
I understand.

170
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,239
A little brings cheer,
too much harms the health.

171
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,999
Master, why did you
bring back wine for me?

172
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:11,958
Isn't it your birthday tomorrow?

173
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:17,958
Right! I forgot it is
my birthday tomorrow.

174
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,519
Thank you, Master.

175
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,078
You are so good to me.
Better than the old phoenix.

176
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:58,879
Who could come and go
from Kunlun Mountain with such ease?

177
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:15,679
Are you that lady?

178
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,318
That is correct.
The lady you met today is our goddess.

179
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,519
Do you know who our goddess is?

180
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,358
She is the goddess, Yao Guang

181
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,078
who conquered the world
with Mo Yuan in the olden days.

182
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:31,078
<i>Goddess Yao Guang?</i>

183
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,679
<i>Oh no, Senior Disciple said Yao Guang
has always adored Master</i>

184
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,878
<i>and even moved her home
to Kunlun Mountain.</i>

185
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,638
<i>Could she have wanted
to lure Master into fighting her</i>

186
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:45,558
<i>thereby producing a bit of affection
by recognizing each other's talents</i>

187
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,638
<i>so she used me as bait?</i>

188
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,479
Don't get lost in thought.

189
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,439
We are not done yet.

190
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:56,999
Although you have committed a serious
offense, our goddess is merciful.

191
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:01,358
From this day forth, you will follow
our goddess as her disciple

192
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:05,199
and devote yourself to religious practice
to tame your mischievous heart.

193
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:12,919
I am already
Mo Yuan's seventeenth disciple, Si Yin.

194
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:17,398
Why would I follow them instead?
Don't even think about it.

195
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:18,838
Insolent.

196
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,078
Mo Yuan is so magnificent.

197
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,558
How could he have
such a naughty disciple?

198
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:34,878
As a lady, admiring an outstanding man
is not embarrassing.

199
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:38,919
However, kidnapping his disciple
to interact with him

200
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,159
is a massive embarrassment.

201
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,878
Do not speak such irresponsible remarks.

202
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:45,239
You're the one making
irresponsible remarks.

203
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,439
My master treats me well because
he takes pity on my past

204
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,798
and was entrusted by an old friend.

205
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,038
As for you, you kidnapped me

206
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:58,798
not only to make me be your disciple,
but also to keep me here.

207
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,838
My master's one finger is already
a thousand times better than you.

208
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,558
You want me to be your disciple?
Don't even think about it.

209
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:19,798
Do you dare say that again?

210
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,558
My master's one finger is already
a thousand times better than you.

211
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,078
You want me to be your disciple?
Don't even think about it.

212
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,078
Very well.

213
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,519
Very well.

214
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,719
Since you are so stubborn...

215
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:40,479
Take him to the water dungeon
and lock him up for three days.

216
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

217
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,999
A fox spirit dares to argue
with our goddess?

218
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,439
You deserve to be in the water dungeon.

219
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,638
Our water dungeon is most torturous.

220
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:56,638
Every hour, it will fill up to the top.

221
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,159
Enjoy slowly, little fox.

222
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:04,759
It's just a water dungeon.

223
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,398
You are serious?

224
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,474
Hey!

225
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:22,999
Let me go!

226
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,439
Let me out!
Let me out!

227
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,398
Someone!

228
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,358
Anyone!

229
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,118
Let me out!

230
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,439
Let me out!

231
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,038
Let me out!

232
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,479
Someone!

233
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:59,479
- He's not in the forest.
- I haven't found him.

234
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,548
Not at the lotus pond.

235
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,638
- Nor the back of the mountain.
- Nor the back hall.

236
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:03,959
- None of you found him?
- No.

237
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:07,118
Seventeenth loves to drink. He wouldn't
let the jugs of wine break.

238
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:08,838
He must have been
taken away in a hurry

239
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:10,798
causing the wine jugs
to fall to the ground.

240
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,038
Who would dare kidnap someone
from Kunlun Mountain?

241
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,118
Could it be the Ghost Tribe?

242
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:16,598
- The Ghost Tribe?
- The Ghost Tribe?

243
00:21:16,598 --> 00:21:19,659
No, they wouldn't.

244
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,439
Unless it is Ghost Lord Qing Cang.

245
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:24,362
Aside from him, any other from the
Ghost Tribe who dared come to Kunlun

246
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:27,049
would have had their demon powers
suppressed by the divine energy.

247
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:29,038
and would have been
no match for Seventeenth.

248
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,638
It is definitely not the Ghost Tribe.

249
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,759
It's someone I couldn't catch up to,
who managed to kidnap Seventeenth.

250
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,878
They seem to be very familiar
with Kunlun Mountain.

251
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,798
But besides us disciples, who else would
be so familiar with Kunlun Mountain?

252
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,239
Could it be Yao Guang?

253
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,798
Yes! Aside from us, Yao Guang
knows this place best.

254
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,719
Go search again.
Ling Yu and I will go to Master.

255
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,239
- Yes.
- Yes.

256
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,519
- Master.
- Master.

257
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,078
Seventeenth is missing.

258
00:22:12,078 --> 00:22:13,398
Missing?

259
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,999
- Have you searched the wine cellar?
- We have.

260
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,159
Master, we are thinking...

261
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:24,999
Speak.

262
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,838
After Ninth Disciple heard
the shattering of wine jugs

263
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,638
he noticed a black shadow flash by.

264
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:34,118
He couldn't catch up to it. Later on,
we noticed Seventeenth was missing.

265
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,558
Master, even Ninth Disciple
couldn't catch it.

266
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,799
How familiar with Kunlun Mountain
must that person be?

267
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,798
Moreover, besides the few of us
here at Kunlun Mountain

268
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,199
only Yao Guang's residence is nearby.

269
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,878
We are thinking
perhaps Seventeenth spoke carelessly

270
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,919
and offended one of Yao Guang's people.

271
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,519
However, we don't dare to search
for him without permission.

272
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,118
Bring him up after another hour.

273
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:18,838
Kindly persuade him to leave Mo Yuan.

274
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:20,239
- Yes.
- Yes.

275
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,519
Why does Mo Yuan favor him so?

276
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,999
Has he truly been enticed by his looks?

277
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,479
Mo Yuan?

278
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:48,159
Is one of my Kunlun Mountain disciples
in the water dungeon?

279
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,318
Mo Yuan, did you listen
to someone's provocation?

280
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:58,679
Why would my water dungeon
have a Kunlun Mountain disciple?

281
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,759
We have known each other
for thousands of years.

282
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,038
You should know I do not like
to argue needlessly.

283
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,919
- Move aside.
- Mo Yuan.

284
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:13,159
This is my residence.
How dare you barge in as you please?

285
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:15,558
Step aside.

286
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,759
I respect you as the God of War.

287
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,398
However, this is my residence.

288
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:23,999
Without my permission

289
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,303
not even the Heavenly Lord
would dare step foot inside.

290
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,519
- Yao Guang!
- Yao Guang!

291
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,199
Mo Yuan!

292
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,239
Master, you're here.

293
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,519
Seventeenth, are you all right?

294
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,638
I was just drowned in water a few times.

295
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:12,598
I am not that delicate.

296
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:15,759
You have matured a lot tonight.
You've learned to try to brave.

297
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:19,638
I still have to drink peach blossom wine.

298
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,278
I still have to celebrate my birthday.

299
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,078
Seventeenth!

300
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:33,118
Mo Yuan.

301
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,038
- Mo Yuan, listen to me.
- No need.

302
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,838
I am afraid of you spoiling
this disciple of yours all day long

303
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:40,659
and being subjected to criticism
by those in the Celestial Palace.

304
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:43,239
When have I, Mo Yuan, ever feared
what others say?

305
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,038
I am doing this for your own good.

306
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:50,038
You are a son of
Heavenly Father's first wife.

307
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,679
You are the God of War.

308
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,038
You should be revered
all around the world.

309
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:59,959
You should not be subjected to criticism
because of a mere disciple.

310
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,239
The seventh day of the second month.
The summit of Mount Cangwu.

311
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:06,759
I will settle this debt with you.

312
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:13,878
He is requesting to meet on
the summit of Mount Cangwu?

313
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:20,398
He is going to settle this debt with me?

314
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:32,558
Master.

315
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:40,638
Master.

316
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,878
Master.

317
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,759
Master.

318
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:50,519
Master.

319
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,078
Master.

320
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,919
Master!

321
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,999
- It's so painful.
- Master.

322
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,199
It's no matter.

323
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,558
I will look after him.

324
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,358
Then I will check on the medicine.

325
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,159
Master.

326
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,759
Master.

327
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,159
It's all right now.

328
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:15,558
I will protect you.

329
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:21,199
That goddess is not worthy of my master.

330
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,598
Not worthy...

331
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,239
- Mo Yuan.
- Your Highness.

332
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,078
Why have you come
to Kunlun Mountain so late at night?

333
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:55,199
Father has heard you will be dueling
Yao Guang on the summit of Mount Cangwu.

334
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,959
He has ordered me to come mediate.

335
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,398
You know relations between
the Celestial Tribe and the Ghost Tribe

336
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,398
are no longer as good as before.

337
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,567
Ghost Lord Qing Cang could
find an excuse at any time

338
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,351
to start a war
against the Celestial Tribe.

339
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:11,878
If the amity between the two of you
is affected by such a trivial matter

340
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:13,558
it is indeed inappropriate.

341
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,878
Mo Yuan, must you insist on this battle?

342
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:21,919
I insist.

343
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:25,550
Otherwise, I will not be able
to answer to all in Kunlun Mountain.

344
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,679
Kunlun Mountain is sacred land.

345
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,159
How can anyone be allowed
to  just break in

346
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,398
and kidnap anyone they want?

347
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:37,598
Your Highness, do you not agree?

348
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:42,159
You are right.

349
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:45,278
However, you need not worry.

350
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:47,318
Please ask His Majesty
to not worry either.

351
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,838
This is a personal matter between
me and Yao Guang.

352
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:53,479
Should the Celestial Tribe
and the Ghost Tribe one day wage war...

353
00:28:54,638 --> 00:28:58,118
whether it is Kunlun Mountain
or Yao Guang's Residence

354
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,159
we'll both fight with all our strength.

355
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,999
That is righteous.

356
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,878
You are right.

357
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,159
Father, that is what Mo Yuan said.

358
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:29,118
When that fox received
the Jade Purity Fan of Kunlun

359
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,398
I was very astonished.

360
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:34,798
Now Mo Yuan has
become angered for his sake

361
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,278
and hesitates not to battle Yao Guang.

362
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:42,479
If I get the chance,
I would like to meet him

363
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:47,959
and see what gifts he possesses for
Mo Yuan to hold him in such favor.

364
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,239
Look!

365
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:54,479
Master won. Master won.

366
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,838
Our master is God of War.
How could he lose?

367
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,959
- That's right.
- Yes.

368
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,999
Master wouldn't lose.

369
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:03,959
I've lost.

370
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,798
I am utterly defeated.

371
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:17,078
Then please move out of Kunlun Mountain.

372
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,038
Mo Yuan!

373
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:24,078
What else is there?

374
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,199
Back in the day, during the great war
between Celestials and Ghosts...

375
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,439
we were bonded as comrades.

376
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,078
Yet now...

377
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:41,278
Now, everything seems to have faded.

378
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:46,679
We were merely acquaintances.
You are overstating.

379
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:07,078
Master breaks another woman's heart.

380
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,798
Master dotes on Seventeenth the most.

381
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:11,598
Who told her to pick on Seventeenth?

382
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,759
All right, that's enough.
Master already noticed us.

383
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,700
- Get going.
- Let's go.

384
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:43,878
Seventeenth.

385
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,318
You're awake? Do you feel better?

386
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:48,159
I'm all right now.

387
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,479
I thought I'd be stuck in the water
dungeon for another 10 days or so.

388
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:58,038
You fell asleep as soon as we returned.

389
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:01,038
You clung to Master's hand while dreaming
and mumbled about being in pain.

390
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,959
You wouldn't let go no matter what.

391
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,199
Master was upset when he heart that.

392
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:08,038
He stroked your back
and comforted you by saying

393
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,358
"Don't be afraid. Master is here."

394
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:15,598
You were just like a little girl.

395
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:20,959
I have to see Master.

396
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,638
Master is dueling with Yao Guang
on the summit of Mount Cangwu.

397
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:28,199
I still have to see him.

398
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,679
With your cloud jumping abilities

399
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,063
he'll be back before you
even reach Mount Cangwu.

400
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,719
Senior. Seventeenth, you're up?
Have something to eat.

401
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,598
And also...

402
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,463
Master told me to tell you
you are to make

403
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,382
30,000 copies
of "True Classic of Vacuity"

404
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:48,638
in half a month as discipline.

405
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:50,919
30,000 copies?

406
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,598
By the way, there is
a woman in the drawing room

407
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:56,222
who says she is from Qing Qiu.

408
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:58,078
A woman?

409
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,958
<i>Xuan Nu?</i>

410
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:23,079
<i>There is someone who looks
more like Bai Qian than I do?</i>

411
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,958
<i>And it is a man?</i>

412
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,639
Where did this young lady come from?

413
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,199
She seems to bear
a remarkable resemblance to me.

414
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,438
Si Yin, my name is Xuan Nu.

415
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,222
I am the younger sister
of Bai Xuan's wife.

416
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,639
You are from Qing Qiu?

417
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,798
I think I've heard them
mention you before.

418
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:55,918
I heard from my sister that you've lived
with Zhe Yan for thousands of years

419
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,559
and are great friends with the Qing Qiu.

420
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,278
Yes, when I lived with Zhe Yan

421
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:08,878
I often called them my brothers
just as Bai Qian did.

422
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:11,398
Qian Qian?

423
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:15,958
Speaking of her, I haven't seen her
in thousands of years.

424
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,918
This is the younger sister
of the wife of Qing Qiu's Bai Xuan.

425
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:29,318
This is Mo Yuan's senior disciple.

426
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:31,798
He is Die Feng, second prince of
Water King of the West Sea.

427
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:39,318
I did not know of your esteemed status.
I have been impolite.

428
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:42,313
Our past identities matter not
in Kunlun Mountain.

429
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:45,387
We are all Master's disciples.
There is no need for such formalities.

430
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,518
Yes.

431
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,798
Since you know each other,
you two can talk.

432
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:53,199
I will be going now.

433
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,398
Si Yin, this is a letter from Bai Zhen.

434
00:36:03,398 --> 00:36:06,878
This letter contains everything
he is entrusting to you.

435
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,918
A letter from Fourth Brother?

436
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,759
Why didn't he come himself?

437
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,759
Bai Yi's baby girl is about to be born.

438
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:16,478
All the immortals in Qing Qiu
have gathered there.

439
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:22,278
When I left Qing Qiu,
Second Brother had just married.

440
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:24,759
He is having a baby already?

441
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:27,239
They already know the gender of the baby?

442
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,759
With Zhe Yan around,
it'd be hard not to know.

443
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:34,159
Let me read this.

444
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:43,119
<i>Fifth Sister, Xuan Nu is
being forced by her father</i>

445
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,918
<i>to marry a bear.</i>

446
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,878
<i>She ran all the way
to Big Brother's abode.</i>

447
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:50,318
<i>Big Sister-in-law was afraid she would
be found, so I thought of you.</i>

448
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:54,838
<i>Kunlun Mountain is sacred ground.
People would not think to search there.</i>

449
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,518
<i>Let Xuan Nu hide there for now
as a favor to Big Sister-in-law.</i>

450
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,998
<i>Me? Why aren't you
taking on this problem?</i>

451
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:02,239
<i>Why are you throwing it to me?</i>

452
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,719
<i>I also feel leaving you with
this problem isn't right.</i>

453
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,759
<i>But in Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods,
Zhe Yan and I are the only two men.</i>

454
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:12,119
<i>How can we take care of
an unmarried woman?</i>

455
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,518
<i>You are a woman and have also
known Xuan Nu since childhood.</i>

456
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:17,559
<i>I would be more at ease
leaving her in your care.</i>

457
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,998
<i>By the way, she does not know
you are Bai Qian of Qing Qiu.</i>

458
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:22,599
<i>I did not tell her.</i>

459
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,358
I've finished reading it.

460
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,958
Fourth Brother just left you to me.

461
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,278
I really am in a difficult spot.

462
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,239
If you find it a difficult task

463
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,719
then I... I...

464
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,518
Don't cry.

465
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,518
I have to ask Master if you can stay.
Wait here for me.

466
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,798
Don't cry.

467
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:11,679
Senior.

468
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:13,518
<i>Seventeenth?</i>

469
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:16,119
<i>Aren't you keeping your cousin company?
Why are you here?</i>

470
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,358
<i>There are some things
that need Master's approval first.</i>

471
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:21,559
<i>I really can't believe
she isn't your sister.</i>

472
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,398
You two look so similar
standing side by side.

473
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,798
The world is so large.
There are bound to be coincidences.

474
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:34,798
Senior, do you think
I should keep Xuan Nu here?

475
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:38,478
You say Xuan Nu ran away from home
to escape being forced into marriage.

476
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:40,719
She only came here because
she had nowhere else to go.

477
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,079
If that really is the case, it would not
be a problem for her to stay for a while.

478
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:48,838
Will Master allow it?

479
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,998
Back when Yao Guang had
one-sided affections for Master

480
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:54,398
she moved her entire residence here.

481
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,599
Master did not think too much of it.

482
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,119
He even told us that
those who come are guests

483
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,478
and we must do what we can.

484
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:04,318
Xuan Nu is just staying here for a while.

485
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:06,759
Master probably won't be too inflexible.

486
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:11,239
But Kunlun Mountain is full of men.

487
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,119
Where will she stay?

488
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,199
In your quarters.

489
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:18,119
- Master.
- Master.

490
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,438
Kunlun Mountain is
full of male disciples.

491
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,639
It would be an inconvenience
no matter where she stays.

492
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,478
She came to see you. It would be most
fitting for her to stay in your quarters.

493
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,599
But I am also male.

494
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,639
Master is right.

495
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,559
Since she came looking for me,
I should be the one taking care of her.

496
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:49,079
How are the copies coming along?

497
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,039
Didn't Ling Yu tell you?

498
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,878
Master, after 30,000 copies
of "True Classic of Vacuity"

499
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,679
my fox claws would be falling off.

500
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,358
Can it be a smaller number?

501
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:08,438
No.

502
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:13,199
All right, Master. After I take care
of Xuan Nu, I will start my punishment.

503
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,719
Master, I will get back to organizing.

504
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,199
This is right near my quarters.

505
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,438
Stay here for now.
If you need anything, tell me.

506
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:44,239
Thank you for taking me in.

507
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,318
Do not thank me.

508
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,503
Without my master's permission,
nobody would dare let a woman stay here.

509
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:52,318
Si Yin.

510
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,159
When you were living in
Ten-mile Peach Tree Woods

511
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,998
did anyone tell you that
you look just like Qian Qian?

512
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,599
People often said that.

513
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,159
Fourth Brother even said
we look like twins.

514
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,239
I think you have
some of her charm as well.

515
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,239
That's just a coincidence.

516
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,398
She is Qing Qiu's future female monarch.

517
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:18,559
How could I compare to her?

518
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,398
I'm afraid hiding here will be of no use.

519
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:23,478
In the end, I'll still have to marry
that black bear spirit.

520
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,878
Don't be so disheartened.

521
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:29,239
Perhaps things will have changed
after a good night's sleep.

522
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,599
I can't talk any longer.
I have to start my punishment.

523
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:00,159
Little golden lotus, little golden lotus.

524
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,599
Starting today, I have to copy
"True Classic of Vacuity" 30,000 times.

525
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,914
I won't be able to look after you.

526
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,039
I'll take care of you again
when I come back.
